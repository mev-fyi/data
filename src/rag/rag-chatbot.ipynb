      "Physicists believe that string theory has the potential to produce a unified theory because of several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Consistency with known physics: String theory incorporates and extends the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, two highly successful theories in their respective domains. It provides a framework that can naturally accommodate both quantum mechanics and gravity, which have been challenging to reconcile in other approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Explanation of particle properties: String theory offers a way to explain the properties of particles, such as their masses and charges, in terms of the vibrations and interactions of the tiny strings. It provides a more fundamental and elegant description compared to the ad hoc assignments of properties in other theories.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Grand unification of forces: In the standard model of particle physics, the three fundamental forces (electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force) are described independently and have different strengths. String theory suggests that these forces can be unified into a single framework. The different vibrational modes of the strings correspond to the different forces, allowing for a unified description of all interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Extra dimensions and symmetry: String theory requires the existence of extra dimensions beyond the usual four dimensions of space and time. These extra dimensions can help explain certain features of the universe, such as the hierarchy problem (why the gravitational force is so much weaker than the other forces) and the existence of different particle generations. The mathematical symmetries inherent in string theory also provide a basis for unification.\n",

      "5. Mathematical elegance: String theory is highly mathematically consistent and elegant. It relies on sophisticated mathematical techniques, such as conformal field theory and algebraic geometry, which have been extensively studied and developed over many decades. The mathematical beauty and internal consistency of the theory give physicists confidence in its potential for a unified description.\n",

Deep nets trained by simple\\nback-propagation perform better than more shallow ones. Learning is\\nsurprisingly rapid. NORB is completely trained within five epochs.
