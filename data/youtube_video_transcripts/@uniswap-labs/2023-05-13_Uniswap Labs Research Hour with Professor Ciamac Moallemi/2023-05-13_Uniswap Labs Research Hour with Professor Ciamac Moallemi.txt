wait a little bit I would want to go now or do you want to sort of wait for people to join uh I I have no idea of knowing how many people are in so okay yeah I'm just going to start because there's no way of knowing how long I should wait uh hello everyone uh welcome to the first ever D5 research our series hosted by unisoft labs um Shin researcher at neurosoft labs and co-host of today's conversation with me here is Austin my colleague at labs and co-host for this space as well unit swap is the largest Marketplace for Unchained digital assets the tools we build um uh are built upon the unit swap protocol governed by independent and decentralized community of uni token holders and today is the largest decentralized trading protocol to date the protocol has serviced over 1.5 trillion dollars of transactions across multiple blockchains and never be hacked making unit swap one of the most trusted names in D5 unisoft Labs is focused on Building Technology that enables users to swap tokens by nfts provide liquidity and self-custody their assets with confidence the appendix expressed during today's conversation will be ours personally and not that of the labs Our Guest today is xiamek molami cemack is a professor at The Graduate School of Business at Columbia University and the director of the Bridger family digital Finance lab CMS research areas include operations research Market microstructure blockchain technology and quantitative Trading CL Max returned three papers on amms with potentially many more to come see I'm like welcome thank you Jen and Austin excited to be here first question you did your PhD in electrical engineering I believe what led you to go from studying message passing Paradigm to financial markets what's similar and what's different so um that's a a good starting point uh I've always been interested in mathematical modeling and computation and um uh simultaneously I've always been interested sort of in a little bit more the applied side uh like I'm not a pure mathematician I I don't want to you know sort of I want to work on things that you know some someone might Implement and so on and so um for my PhD I was working in electrical engineering um broadly speaking I was working in an area called stochastic control where you're making decisions uh over time sequentially and there's uncertainty about the future so it's a combination of sort of stochastic modeling thinking about probabilistic modeling of future outcomes but also uh optimization um and and so those were kind of the methodological things that uh that that excited me now in double e the main applications for um up for that kind of work are areas like controlling computer networks or Robotics and um so forth um uh after I graduated and I I moved to Colombia it's a business school we're interested in sort of different problems and I decided to work mainly in the area of quantitative Finance so again I'm still you know interested in stochastic controlling the abstract but the main applications I think about are things like quantitative trading um uh um you know uh algorithmic trading Market microstructure um these days of spending a lot of time thinking about blockchain so I think um the the core um uh ideas are are the same as in in double e um uh but just sort of the the the applications are different and I think within Business Schools that's actually sort of quite common um I think really um over the past um uh 20 years 10 years five years um you know like the rest of society um uh you know business has gotten sort of more technical so I think you're starting this um you know there's quite a lot of people like me with from backgrounds like let's say electrical engineering or computer science or operations research who've moved into a business schools and are focused on applications and business problems yeah perfect I think um one of the questions that you have brought up and it sort of made a space in the amm research world was that your paper on loss versus rebalancing uh so like what is your paper on loss versus rebalancing and when do you think it's a reasonable metric to use uh when do you think it's not for mmlps yeah so um uh I mean I'm obviously uh opinionated on this but I think it's uh the the right metric um Let me let me try to um uh convince you in the audience why so um when we're sort of thinking about um an amm um on and and you're thinking about possibly being a liquidity provider there's a clear benefit which is the uh the fees right um uh you're gonna earn fees if people swap on the amm now um the thing you you have to be thinking about is uh um what is the downside what is the cost right and I think this is a little bit more challenging because the cost is not really obvious right like uh if you know if you bring up your you know the unit swap GUI it's sort of very clear like that you're going to pay 30 basis points or five basis points or whatever the fee is right but it's harder to think about the uh um uh the um the cost now um uh you know um I think the the community um uh had largely sort of settled on this um idea of of impermanent loss as a a form of uh cost and in indeed like if you're if you're if your choice is uh um you know strictly between um uh you know lping in a uh a pool and or um uh um a just a hoddling a position then then maybe impermanent losses is is sort of the right thing but um uh um you know um I think that Benchmark of hodling is is actually not the right thing because it conflates um uh other things and um the main thing that conflates is it conflicts Market risk right so when you're you're lping um the number one driver of your p l is that basically your long tokens right your long tokens you deposit them in the pool first order thing is are those tokens going up and uh or or are they going down right to some extent in my mind that is orthogonal to whether you decided to uh and and you know a bnlp or you decided to sort of do something else so I think the the right way to sort of look at um uh like isolate is this decision of lping um a good enough or not is to sort of get rid of the market risk right and and this is actually quite common in finance that's at the heart of like options pricing in the black shoals model right the great innovation of uh um of of Black Shoals um and uh um you know of that sort of uh options pricing literature for that they won the Nobel Prize with is if we sort of eliminate the market risk if we dealt a hedge if you will then you'll sort of uh arrive at sort of the underlying um value of the uh of the option and so lever is basically the same idea of of eliminating Market risk but apply to a uh an automated Market maker and the idea is let's imagine a a trading strategy where in addition to to holding a position as a LP and an amm simultaneously but separately you hedge away the market Risk by potentially shorting um let's say you know maybe hypothetically maybe for real but shorting let's say on a centralized exchange whatever exact tokens at any given time that you're holding in the uh um uh the amm right so this would um uh seek to eliminate that market risk and then whatever's left over that's the natural um a profitability of the amm and what we see is that what's left over is two components right there's the fee income which is a a positive that helps the the LPS but the negative the cost component is um is is lever um uh and it we interpret that as basically the the money that's paid to to Arbitrage yours right and so the um that interpretation is that if you have an amm it's sitting on chain right uh at any given time it doesn't know what the fair value is of the uh of the asset it's just a smart contract right meanwhile this asset is trading maybe on other chains maybe on centralized changes and so on and so forth um arbitragers will come and we'll exploit the fact that the amm has stale prices right so let's say you're trading something like uh um you're trading um eth versus usdc if the price um uh you know ticks up a bit on binance um arbitragers or Searchers or whoever you want will come in and they will um buy at the stale prices on on chain until the on chain and off chain prices match this is of course a cost right because the arbitragers are only buying when it's uh when it's profitable and um uh um uh it's a zero-sum transaction between the arbitrageurs and the the LPS in the chain so whenever the arbs are making money the people on the Chain are are losing money right and so this becomes the the fundamental cost of uh being a liquidity provider it's not um uh um it's like you know being any kind of Market maker with any kind of Market maker the the thing you always suffer for um from is adverse selection you suffer from Trading with people who have more information than you and amms aren't any different but the particular form of adverse selection is that the um uh these arbitragers who have better information and that they know what the uh um uh better estimates of what the market prices they can pick off the amm and they'll make money and um you have to account for that when um uh you are valuing um uh um your position in the amm so I think I mean in my mind it's it's sort of um uh the the the the core way to to to to look at it and and I think should be should be Universal now let me just pause and and make a statement about where um where it's not the case um you know again the idea of of of lever is coming from from Black Shoals and dynamically hedging and that works to the extent that you can dynamically catch right so um you know um with this idea of you know maybe hedging your risk assumes that there is some other place let's say uh centralize the change or whatever where you can um you can short and get rid of your risk and that may or may not be true like maybe if you're trading East versus usdc um uh you can I'm short on centralized exchanges and so on but maybe if you're you know out in the long tail of uh a you know a token may not even trade anywhere else right it's sort of not clear that uh um uh um uh that's the uh the the the the the right model so it is predicated on being able to sort of uh frictionlessly dynamically trade the asset that said I will argue even in those instances it's still a helpful model even though you can't maybe literally interpret it um and and literally go out there and Delta hedge and the reason is the same as the black shoals model that people use the black shoes model all the time in environments where you can't dynamically trade for example if you work for a startup and you get stock options how do they value those stock options they use the black Jewels formula right well you can't take the blackstrils formula literally in that constant context because you can't you know a trade dynamically in a non-public company right so nevertheless I think it provides uh you know an important source of uh of of input some you know you know a notion of fair value and so I think um uh their lever applies also um in um uh even even for assets that may or may not um centrally trade um I'll make one other um a sort of um comment I think you can start to see a ways why um lever is uh Superior to um uh in permanent loss right the the first thing is that um a lever versus in permanent loss is actually permanent right when you um lose money to Arbitrage yours you never get that money back right so lever is is kind of in some sense a true loss right whereas in permanent loss it includes lever as a component but it also includes Market risk right and the market risk is the difference between whatever the huddling position was and whatever the current position is in the uh the amm at the time you're you're looking at it so the reason why um uh um impermanent loss is not um uh I'm literally not permanent is because it includes Market risk whereas a lever does it I think uh another um sort of reason to start to see why uh impermanent loss isn't the right concept is if you think about impermanent loss it's not path dependent right my impermanent loss depends on where I started and where I finished right but nothing on what happens in between right versus if you think about the active Market making of course what happens in between matters right for example if the market is more volatile if prices are constantly jumping up and down you're going to get picked off as an LP More Often by uh um by by arbitragers or or Searchers then if the market is not choppy right so um but lever is explicitly path dependent in fact a lever ends up varying with the with the variance right it looks like you're uh you're you're sort of paying out variance right so you know I I think you know there's a whole bunch of arguments I would make that certainly it's the right concept versus uh um a versus in permanent loss um I think there's this one uh perspective or maybe even criticism if you want to call it but uh it says that uh as you said like never requires Dynamic hedging and as you said sometimes it's not even feasible when there's no uh like a different marketplace where you can execute that hedge uh the other aspect of that is uh not everyone has access or ability to carry out those hedging trades and so it's not really an actionable item for the median user of unislab and you if you think about like the for example like traditional portfolio Theory Etc the the suggestion or The Benchmark is really kind of very actionable right like it just suggests that you buy SMP index and and don't don't do anything else which is very actionable for uh but for me for example I think that's a great example Jen but if you look at portfolio Theory it'll tell you to hold a certain percentage in the SNP Index right so in theory you're supposed to be rebalancing right so uh um maybe you rebalance um uh once a month maybe you rebalance once every six months right um lever is the same thing it's periodically um I'm rebalanced uh to sort of uh to to hedge your risk right I I don't I don't think that's a burden I think um certainly if there was demand for it um uh people could sort of offer that as a service I do think a bigger burden is if you want a short it's uh it's sort of expensively short right so um uh if you sort of uh um uh actually wanted to um if there was a let's say uh um uh you know it looked like the pool is profitable if you hedge if you you know you know in in in in in the work I've done I sort of assume that you trade at Mid market and I assume that there's no cost to holding that short in reality um uh you know in the crypto World everything's expensive so if you're going to hold a giant short for a long period of time then uh um uh you know that will probably swamp whatever money you're making or losing in the uh um other things so so again I think uh I think if you want to take the model literally you're right there's like uh um you may not be able to sort of a Delta hedge but again I think even in the absence of taking it literally um uh um you know uh I think the the model has values and again I would just you know um you know point at the options markets right or or general I mean mean um you know people use options pricing in all kinds of settings where you can't dynamically trade is it is it a a number that you can guarantee so that if this is not the price that there's an Arbitrage no right but nevertheless it's it's an input to sort of think about um uh what is what is the cost you're giving up I would argue that whether or not you can hedge there is a real cost to being an LP where people are going to pick you off if you're if your price is still they're going to pick you off when they have more information and um you need to quantify that in some way what do you say to the people who I prefer to lever as lvr do you think that lever is sort of the right way that it should be said what do you say to them absolutely that is uh uh otherwise it doesn't sound nearly a sec I like lever okay okay good I always I'm a big stickler for how people say things uh you know ether and Mev I'm always like I gotta say it the right way so I I was I talked to someone who's like called it lvr and I was like no no that's definitely a lover so I just wanted to hear from you know the source what you felt about it um okay and uh a lot of people have been kind of taking the concepts and trying to bring it to life so to speak uh what do you think mechanism designers can do with respect to the idea of lever um so I think um uh you want to mitigate it I mean I think it's a uh it's a it's a it's a bad thing um it's basically um a money that is being um taken from uh the liquidity providers and uh is going to sort of uh Arbitrage yours and is is getting in the way of uh of welfare improving trade so so just to sort of take uh maybe take a step back and set up what the goal of a mechanism designer should be um in general um the way um I like to think about um um on markets and I think that it's sort of pretty Universal in economics at this point is that the goal of a market is to take a um uh Goods let's say a token or whatever right from someone who has low idiosyncratic value to it um uh and and trade it for someone who has high idiosyncratic value right um how much you pay and who gets paid that doesn't matter because those are zero sum right like if I um uh let's say buy a token from Eugene and um I pay one dollar or I pay um a two dollars you know again more money I pay the less money the more money you received and so on that sort of Nets out right but if I have a higher intrinsic value for that token and you have a lower intrinsic value then the net of that transaction is that a netnet we're both better off right so what you really want to do is you want to find mechanisms where organic sellers are able to transfer to organic buyers as much as possible right and how much is paid by who a sort of doesn't matter right accept except if there are intermediaries like let's say arbitragers or or Searchers right um they are taking money right and but they are not um affecting the uh um they they have no special value for the asset they're just taking money and um uh they're not um uh um they don't have a special idiosyncratic value low or high for the asset right so if you have um let's say arbitragers who are taking this lever money from um LPS what will happen is on the margin people will LP a little bit less right because you know there's some losses potentially associated with LPN right and if they LP less then there will be more less trades right and and now all of a sudden you're going to start to get um welfare loss right so um the idea is that um uh paying these arbitragers um uh it's just strictly um a worse for everyone from the perspective of uh of uh um a welfare so um what we should try to do is uh is is to mitigate that and I think um uh there's there's lots of ideas um uh related to um uh sort of uh you know how to do that um and let me just you know a list a bunch which I've heard um people describe right so so one idea is rather than having prices be set um uh in a um be set by people trading against the pool um to the extent that you have good price um sources maybe have prices by something like an oracle right in in that instance the Oracle could move price because uh uh you know and if you move a price um without anybody trading against you the um the pool um hasn't uh hasn't lost money right um other ideas are just um sort of think about things like fees right fees are another kind of friction that prevent arbitragers are trading against you now you all you have to be careful about fees because fees are also a friction for the for the organic Traders right so if you know um like one way for example to eliminate lever is to make your fees extremely high if you make your fees extremely high then um you won't lose money to arbitragers because they won't trade with you because nobody is trading with you right but that also defeats the purpose of the uh um the mechanism so um one might think about more intelligently setting fees for example I'm having fees um vary with volatility right um uh you know I don't know if it should be with uh you know um very volatility or volatility squared or what but all things being equal um the higher on the more volatile markets are the more of this Arbitrage there's going to be um with people picking off stale prices because more often prices will be stale right so thinking about a setting fees in that way um I think another class of mechanism is a thinking about maybe um uh having a designated class of arbitragers so for example if you could enforce um uh um uh you know let's say let's say you have a pool in the fees 30 basis points um maybe you could whitelist some participants let's call them arbitrageurs and give them the ability to trade at a zero basis point fee if they can trade with a zero basis point fee there will be more aggressive to trade and they will more um often police so that the price uh on on the pool is equal to sort of the the price across the market of the uh of the asset by virtue of being able to trade with no fee um you're sort of creating a priority mechanism where um uh these these people can ARB earlier now you don't want to do this for nothing um maybe they pay a rent to you to uh to do that or maybe you auction off this right right but that's another mechanism where um you know maybe different than something like an oracle where um you're trying to um uh control this this value abstraction instead of uh letting you know the market take it through competition by auctioning it off you can try to monetize it and maybe a feed back to uh um uh the the LPS but I think this is a major challenge to sort of mitigate um uh how much LPS lose to uh to arbitragers yeah I think it's a very difficult problem and one that uh it'll be interesting to see how people come up with solutions for it I think sort of one solution that people have brought up as a sort of a new market structure that could be used or dark pools and I know that you've written a lot about dark pools and you've talked about like how they enhance welfare and for whom so do you think uh crypto falls into the regime that you've described and what do you think will really benefit from the introduction of dark pools and crypto so um you know I think with a lot of these things um uh you know there's there's counterbalancing effects I think um the the principle I would use to sort of think about it is you know um uh you know does it enhance you know that concept of social welfare does it enhance um gains from trade right does it you know make it easier for um uh you know people with low idiosyncratic value to to give the the sell the thing to people with high idiosyncratic value if you think about let's say a dark pool um just just to sort of keep things uh a little bit simpler the crypto world is very complicated and you have a centralized limit order books you have uh um uh you know amms and so on let's just imagine you had a limit order book and you're thinking of introducing a dark pool in a parallel to that right so um how do I view a dark pool I view a dark pool as a a mechanism where um uh I'm basically it's sort of like a limit order book in the sense that a people are matched right um uh however the um the orders aren't exposed right and also many people are put in orders that um don't have a limit price attached but instead are meant to match it quote unquote on mid-market right so like typically in a U.S equities the the mid Market would be the the nbbo the mid of the national investment and offer and so you might put an order in for a uh um uh in a dark pool that says look I want to um you know buy a thousand shares of something um and at any point in time I'm willing to pay the mid price of the the nbbo right now this type of order um uh is um I'm not gonna get um so so first thing to realize about this order is number one you typically save versus directly trading on a mechanism because you're not paying a bid offer spread right so in in terms of explicit costs if I want to immediately trade in a limit order book like let's say I have to pay half the spread in a dark pool I'm trading I'm in Market that part is better right the part that's worse is I'm not sure if I'm going to trade because there has to be someone on the other side in the dark pool who is going to be matched against me who wants to sell to me at uh at Mid market so you've lowered the explicit cost but you've increased the uh the risk of execution and what typically happens is you end up trading when you don't want to right so for example you may end up buying right before the price goes up right or you may end up selling right uh um excuse me end up buying right before the price goes down right um so you sort of ex post regret it a little bit right or you end up selling right before the the the the the the price goes up right so in other words there's a flavor of of adverse selection you have to think about right again your orders won't execute for certain and more often than not um when they execute you will slightly regret it um exports so so because of this what happens is the kind of people who want to use dark um pools are on people which I will call in in Finance on parlance uninformed right now what I mean by that is not a pejorative it's not that um uh they don't know anything or they're dumb or something like that it's just that they don't have short-term information short-term Alpha right so there's some people in the market who want to trade because the price is going up in the next uh um five minutes or the next hour or something like that and there's some people who don't have that kind of information they're trading for other reasons maybe they just like this thing for for the long term or if it's in their portfolio or just a longer time horizon or whatever that population of people or the population of people who are going to use a dark pool because they're patient right they can sit there and they can potentially wait and over time and wait for that order to sort of fill so those people get it get an option that's good right but on balance what happens is when you introduce a dark pool you have to sort of think about the the equilibrium effects what you're doing is you're pulling some of the uninformed um uh Traders away from trading in the lit markets and what that means is that the lit markets is now going to are going to to be populated with the sharks it's going to be populated with the people who have who are trading because they know what's going to happen in five minutes right or they have some prediction or so on and so in equilibrium there's a possibility that actually spreads in the in in the lit Market will uh will increase right so you know again it's complicated and there's not a there's not a simple answer um you have counter balancing effects on the one hand introducing a mechanism for um a people to exchange that sort of uniformly better right it feels like you're giving people more choice there's more chance for these organic um uh sellers to sell to these organic buyers and um a vice versa on the other hand because you're siphoning away this uninformed flow you're making the the um the original um a limit order book Market or dealer Market you're making that more toxic and spreads are increasing and spreads increasing is bad for welfare right because again it makes it harder to trade so I think it's it's difficult to say and I think um uh you know uh the the right answer is you have to sort of think about these things in equilibrium you can't you can't think about in isolation um what happens to Stark pool you also have to think well what is the introduction of this article what are the implications for the behavior of of other mechanisms and and people who are not using the dark pool themselves yeah that makes sense I I I've seen some research on how on the amm dark pools there's been a lot of talk about do they work are they good so do you have a sort of opinion on an amm based dark pool instead of sort of a central and order book based one uh I don't I don't uh I haven't thought about that I don't have um a strong uh um a strong views do they are are there on chain um uh dark pools how would that work there are there are no on-chain dark pools currently I think they're sort of in the stage of do they have value should someone build them because obviously Dar like ZKA proofs and things like that on chain are very difficult so there's been some talk about them a lot of people are very interested in them I'm sort of unclear if they work um or if they have value long term over some like a limb Market or things like that yeah I mean I think it does uh uh I mean I think it sort of comes down to the same two effects like you know I mean one thing that's uh a little bit odd about an amm uh um right now is that if I have a buyer arrives and then a seller arrives two seconds um uh later um uh they're they're somehow not matched they somehow both have to trade against uh um and and pay spreads and so forth versus if you could somehow match them instant like they should be matched instantly right because uh um you know no one has to take risks or only a risk for a short period of time so I think in that sense they're um they're good but in another sense um if you end up again matching these uninformed Traders and pulling them away um uh from interacting with the LPS what you're going to get is the flow to the LPS is going to be more toxic so there's going to be larger lever or adverse selection or whatever your cost metric is if that makes sense here's a question that I have regarding the comment on like the net equilibrium might be better or worse uh compared to the contractual where you don't have the introduction of a new place uh is uh how do you is it possible even to to find out ahead of time because once you have introduced the new thing and you sort of already find out the what the equilibrium is realized and that might be too late right uh you can't I'll introduce the thing or I don't know if you can but is there any way for us to uh model it realistically and and find out ahead of it and kind of decide what's a better thing to introduce than not yeah I mean I think you're you're you're pointing at a a an excellent challenge um I mean I think we can sort of write down small models and uh like show that hey thing you know again things could be better um things could be worse but I think it's uh um uh it's really hard to say um uh you know uh you know the world is complicated and we can't we can't model everything I think all you know also in in in the crypto world there's there's another um aspect which is let's say we hypothetically agree that like dark pools are a bad idea how are you going to enforce that right if someone can uh um profitably run on dark pool they're going to do that right so even if it's a worse equilibrium for everyone if the um uh the you know the the dark pool operator or on the you know the dark pool participants if it's good for them um it will it will likely happen in a in a decentralized setting nice uh I agree uh I guess I know another uh kind of mechanism somewhat similar in maybe in spirit but implemented very differently is the idea of payment for order flow yeah where you kind of you take out all the non-toxic flow and you sort of Promise them I don't know if it will be realized but you promised them uh execution Improvement but on the other hand you kind of create this lift Market where everyone is a shark right what's your what's your mental model of how it has been working in the in the traditional Market has been doing well what's the problem with it and are you seeing this trend in crypto or not so um you know I've I've always had concerns about payment for order flow um uh I haven't um to be fair I haven't sort of um looked carefully at a data and tried to sort of uh carefully uh understand it but um uh you know just uh um intuitively um uh I I feel that there's there's sort of potential problems um I think there's two flavors of a potential problem um sort of the the first flavor is that it is clearly better for retail Traders right so if if you're a retail Trader and someone is paying for your order like hey you're not paying commission B maybe you're getting a small price Improvement so so it's it's clearly better for um uh for for one set of Market participants right uh I think you have to um ask the the broader question though is it better for the uh for for the market overall and I think it sort of you know it's sort of the same issue we we discussed before if you pull away this uh again quote unquote uninformed uninformed in the sense of no short-term Alpha not not being pejorative at all towards retail Traders but if you pull away this the this let's say less toxic flow right then um the remaining flow is going to be more toxic and the overall Market quality might be worse right and uh I think you know um uh you know it's not clear necessarily you want to optimize for retail Traders right um for example in uh um uh you know let's say in the equity markets probably the vast majority of of trading is is institutional often you know I mean you know um certainly the vast majority of trading on my behalf is like index funds and so on that's primarily where I invest right so you know it's not clear that we really wanted you know um design a market where we privilege a small subset of the trading um or you know and and maybe you know um uh um reduce the market quality overall now again it's an empirical question one should um a test and measure um whether you know um the extent to which uh this effect occurs and and I haven't so I'm I'm speculating in that dimension but I think um that's sort of that's one problem and I think that would hold true in crypto also right in crypto again if you um uh you're effectively it's a mechanism for price discrimination right if you um uh if you begin to get some information about who you're trading with right the lowest bit being are they retail or are they not maybe you know eventually you could sort of know their identity well then you're going to end up customizing um uh quotes for um of people and and so on and again you know maybe better for some people but not clear that uh overall it's going to be better I think there's another issue that that exists in the uh um in the trout fire world that maybe doesn't have a crypto analog and and that's sort of the inherent conflict of interest right the other thing that that sort of worries me about payment for order flow is you have a decision being made about where the order is going to go and um the person who's making that decision is The Brokerage and um they usually um a do not are not fully aligned with the interests of the uh the the retail Trader whose order that they're they're routing right namely they're going to Route it to some wholesaler um maybe you know who knows what that decision is based on is that decision based on you know the retail Trader getting the best price Improvement or is it based on how much the wholesaler is paying the broker and and so on and these are you know um you know as far as I can tell they're um sort of opaque privately negotiated on mechanisms I think the advantage of um of crypto is um at least what I've heard about um payment for order flow in crypto is that a people view it as more of an open mechanism of like yes maybe um uh we will um uh um uh auction this uh um uh um retail order flow because it's valuable but um uh you know number one um the proceeds of the auction are going to be directed back to the uh the retail Traders themselves and number two the auction is going to be um uh conducted in a uh um an open way where like sort of anybody can participate and it's not you know a negotiation between like uh you know a large brokerage and uh you know a couple of large Traders and everyone else is in the dark so I think that that second aspect where there's like this kind of uh principal agent problem if you will I think that won't exist in the in in in the crypto world or at least um not in the decentralized crypto World um I I don't know about the centralized crypto world and so that is uh um uh um I I think uh um a better directionally according to your intuition are there Market characteristics that would make a certain Market better suited for this type of payment for order flow uh kind of Market structure is it a market where there's less liquidity but more speculators is it a market that's more volatile what kind of character characteristic would you be looking for when you think of introducing such mechanism I think um uh that's a good question my initial reaction would be that if you have markets where um are like dominated by um uh the um uh um uh let's say retail Traders um I think it's more likely that the payment for order flow would be it would be better um but I I should be careful I haven't I haven't carefully thought about it um yep sorry I just came up with the question so yeah I haven't thought about either um yeah we can probably sort of transition so I used to be a Trader so how is your uh trading experience helped your research and uh which helps the other more academic research or Quant trading type of research um I think both um I think um uh and and you know going back to a little bit what I was talking about at the beginning like I'm an applied mathematician I want there to be an application um uh and so uh um I think the the advantage of uh of doing practical stuff of doing uh like um sort of uh um actual trading and so on is that practitioners get to the problems early right like um you guys identify the problems you identify like what the issue is um you know uh and and so on because in some sense you're interacting with the the real world I think I think amms are a great example of this if you would explain to me the idea of like a constant product a market maker like let's say in a 2020 my reaction would have been like this is this is a bad idea it's not going to work you should just have a limit order book right so turns out you know and and I'm someone who actually you know you know I have some background in in the original prediction markets literature and Market scoring rules and so on it wouldn't have been a foreign idea but my reaction would have been that none of the market scoring rule stuff worked why should this work well you know what I was wrong right and the people who figured out I was wrong were the practitioners and I think the evidence is the fact that there's massive volume on these systems now right so I think the um the the practitioners um uh I identify the uh um the the the problems first they sort of get to the uh the heart of the matter as an academic I can sort of make up problems but you know it's literally that I'm just making it making it up right now I think um where the the academics have uh have an advantage is that um you know we're not really under um time pressure um and um so we can be more patient and um also I think there's more of a premium for sort of uh um uh coming up with an elegant model and for thinking um uh clearly about something in in my experience in in practice you know you're just under a lot of pressure to come up with the answer um if it's like a reasonable number and it seems to work okay but you you can't prove it or you don't have a theory behind it or you know anything that's fine and you know again you know that's that's totally reasonable I don't mean to criticize someone if you're if you're a font Trader your number one goal should be to you know make a lot of money in a risk-adjusted way or whatever right your number one goal isn't to sort of uh understand the theory of markets right maybe you know some of that will come along but you know again you know uh um an industry you should be very pragmatic I think where the the academics come in is you know again coming up with uh um uh sort of the uh um the the the sort of a right way to sort of uh think about things um uh you know I'm from a uh you know and I understand what are the true underlying forces that are that are going on so I mean personally um I'd like to have a foot in uh um on both worlds um I mean I'm mainly an academic I've been doing this for 15 plus years but um I have uh um I have run um quantitative trading strategies I've done fixed income relative value as well and I think you know seeing how the markets operate at a ground level gives you a real approach appreciation for um what are the important problems to work on as as an academic cool okay so I think the the one of the unsolved mystery of uh of practitioners is the performance of The Medallion fund uh which you've I've noticed you've written column articles about uh who do you think are the most likely to uncover their secrets uh either uncovered by successfully replicating them or uncovered by uh by writing about them I think uh I think it's fun to speculate I mean I think the reality is um I mean obviously you know a Renaissance in Medallion uh um particular have been extraordinarily um successful um uh I think uh you know eventually you know I'm uh I think those guys will uh will will somehow leak uh um uh what's going on I think though I think I think there's I would like to expect that I think there's a couple of ingredients for the success I think um on number one um Jim Simons has run an incredible um uh kind of uh um uh recruiting machine um my understanding is uh this may not even be current but I think they have on the order of uh um a several hundred um uh you know sort of PhD level um researchers and I think the the amazing thing is nobody leaves right so I think a quite common thing that happens at many other Quant hedge funds is after a while people leave and the alpha leaves with them I think through some combination of Ironclad non-competes but also um really paying people a lot of money um Jim Simons is sort of built an organization where they haven't had that much much out the leak and I think one interesting aspect of it is my understanding is that internally they're open right so just to give you a little bit of perspective on quantitative trading shops usually operate in two ways right um one style is called the siled style where um you may be like let's say an alpha researcher you're working on your own particular Alphas or machine learning models or whatever and you know maybe some Alpha researchers are sitting to your left and to your right but you don't talk to each other about what you're working on right you talk to your manager and like information close is very tightly controlled and that's for reasons that like you don't want um people knowing the secrets you don't want people leaving with the secrets uh later on right but the downside of that is nobody likes to work in that environment right um uh you know in my entire experience in Academia and in Industry right people want to collaborate people want to talk with their neighbors and bounce their ideas and so on right so the other model is you have a more open model where people are working on their own projects but you know what other people are working on and you bounce ideas and so on of course that comes with with much larger IP risk so my understanding is Renaissance has the second model they're open book right but somehow they're able to do this without the the IP risk so I think there's I think they they you know hats off to them they've sort of um managed uh um uh manage it very well I think um to dive into a technical point and this is now real speculation I have no way of knowing any of this stuff by the way I don't have any contacts at Renaissance this is just anecdotes and talking with people um I think um um I I understand that one of the main things that Renaissance does better than other people is uh um a thinking about a transaction costs and understanding um how to how to how to sort of trade right um at the heart of uh um you know sort of quantitative trading there's kind of two steps right one step is the alpha step you make predictions right like what's going to happen in you know five minutes an hour a week two weeks you know whatever there's a price going up going down but then the second step is once you have a bunch of predictions you have to monetize them you have to sort of decide to um uh for you know what portfolio you're going to form how are you going to trade it are you going to aggressively try to get into this position is it going to be slower you know so on and so forth and one key ingredient of that is is understanding how much it costs to get into a position right namely in general the faster and more aggressively you uh you you trade the the more you are paying and I think like a common kind of rule of thumb for Quant trading is um uh you never want to be like let's say um more than just to you know make up a round number let's say um you know five or ten percent of the market right if you're at any point in time you're more than five or ten percent of the of the of the trading volume then um you're really maybe pushing prices and uh um it's hard to know exactly like uh you see the price go up but maybe you're the one driving it up and maybe you're ultimately going to lose money my understanding is that Renaissance has just a much more sophisticated understanding of this is willing to just trade way more aggressively than other people because they have that understanding and um are able to sort of um you know monetize their predictions better than other people um but that's just sort of a pure pure speculation on my part we always loved your speculation so we're always happy to hear anyone's ideas on that um okay moving on to hot topic of the day um Mev um so Mev is I guess one of the hottest topic on crypto Twitter nowadays um what what do you think is the car the current Frontier and is there anything in the current proposal to to address it that you would like to propose Improvement upon so I I I think this is the most important issue certainly in in defy I mean people compare it a lot to front running in tradfly markets but the reality is um uh you know despite what you might have read in um in Flash Boys or you know what Michael Lewis wrote I don't think there's really so much front running in traffic markets right um uh um uh to most extent um uh you know um uh putting aside the the retail business um the the orders are are confidential until they uh um uh execute um so so here in the in the crypto world first of all that's not true right there um uh you have the whole concept of the mempool and so on and beyond that the um because of the complexity of smart contracts the range of possible Mev is like you know infinitely complex relative to what you might imagine in in a trout fire market so I think um uh you know it's a major problem probably hacking is the number one problem in D5 but maybe the number two problem is uh uh uh Mev um so you know I think people you know are doing a couple of things um I think they're um a generic mechanisms mechanisms like um uh let's say um uh flash Bots or maybe um a proposer Builder separation which I sort of view as uh um you know maybe a decentralized version of of flashbots um and these are kind of generic Solutions in that they are meant to sort of deal sort of simultaneously with with sort of any form of Mev right any form of Advantage you can get by controlling the the sequence of of transactions I think that's one way to go at it I think um uh there's there's you know the issue of that is you know in in my mind you know maybe oftentimes nav can be better addressed depending on what the what the problem is right so maybe Mev for example is different for an automated Market maker than for a collateralized uh lending pool then for like an nft Marketplace and uh so on and so forth um and and I think the alternative which is you know sort of a little bit more the direction I've been thinking is to try and address it at a uh um a protocol by protocol level um uh um you know again depending on the nature of the protocol and what it does and I think I think one sort of major advantage of this is if you look at um uh addressing things at the at the consensus level at the layer one level like for example with flashbots what happens with flashbots is that all of the Mev goes to the miners right and um uh you know to some extent um uh there's still you know positive things about that like okay so we don't have priority gas auctions and that's great so the the externalities of Mev to others are less but to another extent when you generate this cash flow for miners what does that do I mean it's just going to incent more mining activity right um uh is that is that uh good or bad well I mean it depends on whether the chain is as secure or insecure it has nothing to do with the application though right like as an alternative you might take a particular form of Mev like let's take lever lever is a form of Mev right it's you know the money arbitragers um uh uh extract statistically trading in amm versus uh let's say a centralized order book right what I think better mechanisms would take would look at that lever and instead of paying lever off to the uh the miners they would pay lever to the LPS right because the LPS are the one who are who are actually paying it if you could somehow refund it to them right what would happen is that now all of a sudden on the margin it's more profitable to be a uh um an LP you get more LPN you get more gains from trade you get more social welfare right so I think like for example for functions a specific like lever which is you know something I thought about a lot that is the right mechanism you need to think about it in protocol because you want to sort of think about how do I redirect it to the the the right participant the other alternative of just giving it to the miners you know okay I mean it's nice that you have a competitive mechanism there and so on but again all that's going to happen is you're going to have more Mining and it's not clear that that's going to you know generate gains from trade and improved welfare so so um I think it's it's an enormous issue um I don't I don't know how to solve it but um uh um you know one comment is I think you know um it's important to look at it at the application Level I think a a a second kind of comment is uh um you know it's not universally a good or bad thing um uh so I think you know people would generally View and I would agree that a sandwich attacks are a bad form of Mev right the fact that that exists it's sort of uh subtracting value from the uh um uh that the trader making them less likely to trade it's going into the pocket you know this is just kind of a no benefit um uh to that um on the other hand one might argue that um uh um you know maybe something like liquidation that's a good um a form of Med right in the sense that you know if you have a lending pool like compound or Ave you know you need Liquidators there right because if you didn't have liquidation then uh you know eventually loads could become unhealthy and you know sort of people lose money so I think you know again this this also argues for sort of um thinking about um uh Mev um at more of a um a protocol level now um that doesn't mean I don't think you know we should think about things like PBS or um uh um you know um you know Central auctions like flashbots and so forth I think those mechanisms are also interesting but I think you know this has to be addressed at uh at both levels yeah it's definitely an important problem um and I think a lot of people are trying to solve it so hopefully soon we'll see some more improvements um I guess lastly uh what sort of advice would you give to someone who's like intellectually interested in D5 um I think it's a it's a great place to be intellectually interested um um because it's a very uh open place so um I think sort of relative to like sort of uh um becoming interested in Trad fi um uh somehow there's a much lower um a barrier to entry the data is all there it's easy to get sort of on-chain data even the exchange-based data you know more often you can get for free um uh you can you can um it's important to uh um you know that uh um you know most things are open source like if I want to see how exactly you know um you know how a uniswap contract um uh works I can I can look at it on GitHub right if I want to know exactly how NASDAQ works like you know good luck getting them to sort of tell you anything right um and and I think the third aspect is sort of the open culture you know all the discords and and people talking on on on Twitter and you know having this chat with uh guys like you and you know and so on I guarantee that if you guys work for Renaissance Technologies we would not be having this live stream right now right so I know who you are you know yeah um uh so I think uh um uh you know um my advice is is is is get out there and and look at stuff and um I think you know again um the um I think there's there's a lot of opportunities and and sort of thinking about um uh let's say like there's a new product and trying to analyze it with uh um uh conventional tools and uh so on and just to be clear um I'm you know talking about this from a research perspective I'm not sure that this is a space to sort of uh invest your money in uh aside from um you know uh I'm just sort of understanding how the the the space works and so on and uh um but you know I'm from from a research perspective I think it's a very exciting place with uh um you know lots of new and interesting problems do you have any sort of advice for people who are uh you know like PhD students or an operations research or people who are on the margin Traders does your advice change at all for them or do you think it's sort of like a good place to be for operations research folks especially just specifically for the research part obviously I think the research questions are very interesting I think if um uh some of it like uh you know if I was giving um some advice some of it would also depend on like sort of what you want to do Downstream right so um uh the reality is although um uh um uh there's a lot of interest in crypto in Academia it's a little bit of a niche topic right and it's a little bit spread out across different worlds like there's a lot of people in CS interested um some people in uh or some people in in in Business Schools I I think this this makes it attractive like I love interacting uh um and collaborating with uh you know in this sort of interdisciplinary way but from the perspective of let's say you're a PhD student and your strategy energizing about how do I get that assistant professor job these kind of things make it a little bit harder and that's just the unfortunate reality of Academia as it's a little bit of a rigid place and it's very slow moving and uh um you know actually you know the flip side is there's actually positive things about that so you know I mean it's been you know almost a year since maybe the crypto bear Market started and uh um you know what um uh you know you can see sort of uh um activity slowing on the industry side but on the academic side if anything uh the activity is is more and more and more right like I think um for example in um you know I was just at the uh AFA conference American Financial Association in New Orleans in January there was you know um uh one um session on Market microstructure probably around six or seven sessions on various blockchain related topics so I think if anything right now that and you know just because we're slow right and we're um uh you know more deliberative I think um there's a lot more interest in in crypto on the on the academic side because people really don't care you know about what's going on in the in in the marketplace with token prices and so on but they are starting to see that there's you know very interesting mechanisms and and Technologies there so I'm sort of quite bullish on that but you know the the reality is it's not 100 a mainstream Topic in Academia yet yeah it's sort of we've seen a lot of uh professors and things like that who have been really interested in it and pushing the field forward which is uh nice especially during the spare Market um to see sort of more interest from the academic crowd um I guess like last question sort of anything that you think we miss anything that you want to talk about anything that is on your mind that you sort of want to uh shout out from the rooftops um yeah now that you've put me on the spot I know I feel bad no but I think uh um I think it's uh um a great stuff I'm I'm excited you guys are starting this uh research hour um and uh you know again um uh um I was sort of you know saying this in my advice to PhD students but I think one really nice thing about me uh you know my own experience in the crypto world is the fact that that you know um you know researchers Industries such as yourselves and people at other firms it's you know I'm so open to a discussion and engagement with uh with Outsiders such as myself so you know keep up keep up the good work we're hoping to we're hoping to so uh uh yeah it was a great initial talk uh do you sort of want to end it option yeah well cmx thanks a lot for being our inaugural guest and thanks everyone who joined us today uh this hopefully will be uh uh occurring every two weeks from now uh borrowing some vacation plans but uh hopefully we'll see you guys in the next one right if you have any sort of advice anything let us know but yeah it was a great talking to everyone hit us on Twitter yeah thanks guys and thanks again
