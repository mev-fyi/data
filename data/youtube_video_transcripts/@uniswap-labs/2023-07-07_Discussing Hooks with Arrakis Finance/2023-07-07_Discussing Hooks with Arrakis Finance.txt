minutes ago this person who is doing like Axiom hooks I was like that is a cool um sort of idea uh like reads like the state of how old their account is and then if you're not old enough you can't Swap and I was like that's pretty cool um it's interesting to sort of see the co-processor used that way we talked to yib a little bit about it but it wasn't like um you know the most interesting thing in the world but I think like it was mostly just because we wanted to work on core stuff instead no I think hook ideas are coming from from all different places right now right and it's it's pretty exciting we're we're really excited over here and super happy to be here because yeah it's just it's a ripe time to hear what everybody's new idea what you could do with the hook is exactly we have we I won't let you show too much because we will uh obviously one of the big topics and I want to make sure we don't front run our own questions too much but yeah I could probably start in like 30 seconds uh usually people trickle in so yeah no worries but I think I saw your Tweet the book is all about you mentioned yeah I think it was a pretty cool hook um I I'm excited there's been some like I like people sort of just like cooking on crazy hook ideas I'm like these aren't the most interesting like they're not like you know they're not gonna go on prod right but like it's cool to like see people noodling on the space like I saw someone who only let you trade during nice see open and I was like is pretty cool so um I'll have I'll do I'll do our our fun um the fun like crazy thing we have to say uh all right I'm starting now so hi everyone welcome to the fifth defy research hour series hosted by uniswap Labs I'm Austin a researcher Uno swap labs and the co-host of today's conversation with me here is shin my colleague at labs and co-host for the space uniswap Labs is the largest Marketplace for on uniswap protocol is the largest Marketplace for on-chain digital assets the tools we create are built on the unit swap protocol governed by an independent and decentralized community of uni token holders and today is is the largest decentralized trading protocol to date the protocol has serviced 1.5 trillion dollars of transactions across multiple blockchains and has never been hacked making uniswap one of the most trusted names in D5 you know swap the labs is focused on Building Technology that enables users to swap tokens Buy nfts provide liquidity and self-custody their assets with confidence the opinions expressed during today's conversation will be ours personally and not that of labs Our Guest today is Iraqis Finance Iraqis is one of the largest integrators of uniswap protocol currently hosting around 200 million dollars in total value log Iraqis Finance is also a portfolio company of unusual Labs Ventures Iraqis uh specifically Cassandra thank you for joining us thanks for having me pumped to be here we're excited too when we sort of uh we're cooking on people to ask for the space I think with those were pretty high up on our list we're like we need the the folks who are on the ground floor you know I think there's no one better who's on the ground floor currently than uh Iraq is thinking about building and managing liquidity on unusual V3 so I think this sort of goes into our first question um you were their team and you specifically were one of the early people who got a look at uniswav4 and I think specifically when we when it was sent to you you had like there's no documentation no white paper no nothing it was just a GitHub link of code sent to you so what was like your first impressions of the code especially in the state that it was in three four months ago yeah that's a very interesting question um I think certainly it's amazing it's so cool to see I have to say that um uh you learn so much more when it's public to absolutely everyone right so like I feel like I understand it's so much more richly today now that uh the whole world is talking about hooks um but I think immediately especially for like um right we've been building tooling and infrastructure on top of uniswap V3 for since pretty much it's that was a prior white paper and uh on paper and pen and not yet deployed to production and so I think immediately this hook concept did pop out to us as extremely meaningful and kind of like for uh for the liquidity provider right um it allows you to do at at the basic level it allows you to not have to to uh build all this extra infrastructure and keeper infrastructure and things just to uh reposition liquidity uh at a certain moment given a certain on-chain trigger and so this was real the first huge massive noticing that they just clicked right away um I think like uh the the thing you notice at the very beginning right or like the the lowest hanging fruit is something like limit orders something we've thought of for a long time or range orders and again we've been we've been hacking on these just so much more complexity when you add all this peripheral stuff and so the idea that um that that you can um after a swap is executed actually immediately um reposition liquidity or uh you know redistribute it or pull it out of uniswap all of these things were like for me this was one of the that was the key Insight right away the code is definitely right all as usual uniswap code is uh you you know you really have to um you have to get to know it and I think uh for me one thing that was very opaque until actually some of the more developers on my team who are also incredible and uh we're looking more fine-grained into it uh they really had to explain to me right what was really going on with some of this flash accounting and things like this so there's a um some very interesting Innovation there which I think doesn't get talked about as much it's also a bit more it's a bit more interesting uh uh ercy five and the way that the accounting works and the settlement at the end of uh being able to do a number of different things uh so all of that was I can just say very complex to metabolize but once I sort of saw it and it clicked uh it was um uh felt as well very very useful and interesting and driving all kinds of efficiency that makes sense I think um when I first was reading it I was like what is happening here uh and it was very very helpful to have like Noah and things like Sarah and Mark to help me uh but obviously that's not something that most people get so I was very grateful to have some amazing Developers um I guess on those lines I we didn't we didn't sort of give you a little bit of chance to talk about what Iraqis is we sort of alluded to it maybe uh but I think people would be pretty helpful to get a little bit of context on what you guys do just because I think it will help motivate why um I know why we had you on this call obviously totally yeah so I think at its core arrakis is really about um uh building on-chain infrastructure that allows liquidity providers or or just participants on chain participants in defy um to to access liquidity provision in a way that maintains um sort of the the kind of ethos that you had in an earlier phase of decentralized exchanges like uniswap B2 the feeling that you could passively um simply Supply your assets to participate in the market to be a liquidity provider but at the same time leverage all of the power of the much more interesting uh and much more advanced features of something like concentrated liquidity and now of course what you're seeing with uni before and hooks and so on so so for us I think uh we're entirely focused on the liquidity provider and how to improve the ux improve the composability and improve uh sort of be on The Cutting Edge of the most advanced things and most optimized things as a liquidity provider that you can do but expose those to The Wider defy community yeah I think it's sort of a big thing that people talked about was difficulties with V3 you know the it's all very different than V2 which provide your assets and sort of call it a day but in B3 uh the choice of ticks is definitely a more difficult um I'll pass to shin and he needs to get on to the next question uh yeah are there any uh Improvement or feature requests that you would like to see uh on you know the hook or the hook kind of uh um implementation or the interface that you would like to see from from uniswap's end [Music] that's a big question I still have to say like the design space with the hooks is so massive it's hard to mention an improvement when already your head sort of explodes with the amount of possible things you could you could achieve with these hooks um potentially even uh there there can be I mean I think this is what uh these kinds of things are all about but like I think there will need to continually be a ton of Education there about trying to basically write that the design space is so wide kind of uh helping people go towards the the parts that are actually really meaty and interesting um I think one thing I don't know if it's an improvement or about it's definitely a question mark that I have and it's I'm not alone I don't think this is a major news but it's about uh actually on the trader side right like how is routing going to work is this extremely interesting question that I've been mulling over and when I uh so it's in my dreams right uh like uh because of all the possibilities of of what can happen inside of a hook uh that allows you to realize what your trade execution will actually be when when the when the trade routes through that hook it means and the fact that there can be infinitely many right in uniswap B3 there were just a couple of pools with the different features of univ 2 and V1 there was simply one per asset pair but now you could have you know infinitely many hooks per asset pair and each of them could be doing very interesting internal logic and so the only way to understand what your execution would really be is to simulate these transactions uh and this just seems like it just a wildly complex problem that I'm I'm very interested in understanding how how uni wants to attack it or also if they want to expose that problem to sort of the outside community yeah I think we sort of exposed to the outside Community already right through aggregators and things like that but I think that we have sort of on we have simulation logic uh already and we have some very good back-end Engineers so I think um we're very excited for this problem we have talked about it on Twitter a lot um we sort of agree it's a very large problem but uh you know what's you know all fun problems are you know hard problems right so it'd be a fun problem to solve but a hard one um so on the same line we sort of talked about hooks uh maybe some improvements uh what are like some of the hook designs maybe that you like you've seen that you like to see or that you're excited about maybe like hooks your personal excited about and then obviously hooks out of rackets is excited about yeah I think it's hard to separate personal in Iraq yeah yeah maybe you guys maybe maybe yeah I wanted like business versus pleasure you know I was like what's this cool interesting versus what's like uh you know like you're gonna maybe build them yeah yeah okay I think then I think there's I definitely have the uh I can see the two differences there yeah maybe what should I start with the the fun the personal or Let's do let's do the uh let's do the Iraqis ones first I think those will be more fun or those will be interesting exactly yeah so exactly the meat and potatoes I think I don't know if you guys have seen this uh eth research post that came out I believe it's like uh the mcam um it's about the uh lever minimizing uh uniswap V4 hook so you you guys have probably seen this I think it's even been talked about I believe when uh when when you went around with the uniswap team I was I was watching the the stream uh then and maybe it was Noah who mentioned that it was excited about a hook that might auction off at the top of the block the um the Mev that always exists around you know uh stabilizing the price to match the price of the outside world and because of the latency you have just inherent to at least layer one right it's like a 12 second latency there's kind of no way that there's not going to maybe be some sort of Arbitrage opportunity at the top of a block so um I feel like this for me um this post that each research post was really massive I felt like um and I immediately was drawn to it's again highly complex but the the more that you go into it you see that it has some really amazing features kind of um starts to show a path more concretely for how dexes can truly rival or at least compete with centralized exchanges and just like a paradigm shifting way and so yeah what I think is like the coolest part maybe about that um that uh uh that post well I think there's a lot right there's there's multiple there's multiple there's a ton in there and we don't have to go too too deep just yet maybe but I think maybe the the two things that are are highly interesting is one building on the shoulders of giants I think there's something called The Diamond protocol that it was referencing I I truly don't even know if uh exactly where that came from but it feels like a long long time research has already been going on here um but so yeah the first part about being able to to provide a way for um the Searcher or the person trying to extract the Mev from from the fact that um that the prices on chain or the price inside your liquidity pool inside your hook don't match um the real world price um that they can be both incentivized but also in such a way where they hurt the LPS less so like every time this happens right if they're extracting value by doing these arbitrages where is this value coming from well it you know there's it's all Zero Sum somehow so it's it's got to be coming from somewhere it's coming from the LPS right so the LPS are getting hurt by this and so I was it was sort of mind-bending for me at first to understand this idea that you could make um the Arbitrage opportunity more attractive for the Searcher for the for the uh Arbor and yet also improve uh like make things better for the liquidity provider that it hurts them less and this seemed at first like um kind of like an impossibility and then the more that you wrestle with it you see that that's very interesting so I thought that was huge and then um the second part that I found very cool is this idea that then you can maintain that price throughout the whole block um and this seemed like a new feature I think maybe this thing called The Diamond protocol had uh uh had that research had already been done but uh but this this extra piece this idea that then you could actually um facilitate all the trades that might be running through your hook and give them exactly that price the price that the arbor moved the market to these two things were were highly fascinating to me and I guess maybe just to mention why why is that so cool right it's basically like almost a guarantee that your on-chain Traders if if you can get um you know if this thing works as described and uh gets a ton of scale right an on-chain Trader can now get something close to a guarantee that they will just get the real world price right the price that um that everybody believes is the price that you should get and so that's like a paradigm shift from where we are today right wherein every Trader has to be super concerned about am I getting the wrong price just because the pools are not um you know are not being armed or something or are just you know don't reflect the real world and then secondly even if they do right now am I going to get value extracted from me because of the slippage that I placed so I even though I could have gotten that prize and the pool was at the right price I didn't get the right price anyway and right all of a sudden complete Paradigm Shift every Trader always gets the exact price that's on whatever binance let's say for if your Market is uh e2sdc and binance leads the price exploration there so yeah I thought that this was right the meat and potatoes and the thing that I think Iraqis is really really excited about building definitely um uh could start from something like this post yeah Connor's uh shout out to Connor I don't know he's probably maybe if he's watching shout out to him uh yeah he wrote a paper about it it's a good paper uh we sort of agree I think it's an interesting post uh it'll be interesting to see sort of the the lever um all the different ways that it comes out to mitigate lever uh we're very excited about it people like to argue about it on Twitter and I'm like keep arguing uh and so we can get more good ideas you know uh so um I guess the other one is what is like I don't know it's just like a cool thing uh we sure were chatting a little bit earlier about just like cool random things uh so like unexpected Maybe yeah I think there's definitely a bunch of of cool things I think like where my mind often goes um in terms of like fun hooks or things that I think sound interesting always has to do with like integration with other protocols right so like this massive new thing that you can do is that you could provide liquidity to uniswap but the liquidity doesn't always have to sit in uniswap right it can it can arrive in uniswap in a pre-modified position hook right before modified or sorry before swap hook let's say right um that just before the swappers swap arrives then the liquidity can arrive and sit and sit in uniswap and right after that swap it could you know go elsewhere again and so I think in in this domain which has nothing to do with what we just talked about right um there are some really fun ideas I think for instance one thing we talk about is how it sort of problematizes or makes interesting a lot of the kind of liquidity mining schemes you see in the world so like uh imagine um imagine wanting to you know getting the best of both worlds in that maybe uh on a decks like curve there's a lot of you know there's often all kinds of uh liquidity mining rewards that are there and maybe not a ton of volumes but a lot of reasons for uh LPS to put liquidity sitting there um because of these outside incentives so what if you could both lap up those incentives and also lap up all the volume on you to swap to me this is like uh again something that sounds quite interesting and then from there my mind even goes somewhere that might even be somewhat contentious for you to swap but my one of the things I haven't posted is on Twitter at first it's like and it's not that I want to see this but I just wonder about this domain space is like does do hooks make vampire attacks to uniswap easier somehow right in that other new dexes right can basically say hey we don't have the kind of network effects that uniswap has but we have something new what if we give you the best of both worlds and uh you know your liquidity will sit in our decks but you'll still catch um uh the flow from uniswap since maybe that's where um that's where a lot of the trading is happening now and which has some of these Network effects and people trade through the unit swap UI and so on so so you wanna you wanna be able to be there for that flow um at first especially but still allow these other dexes right these competitors to actually build up liquidity without forcing those liquidity providers to to give up the optionality of this uh unispop specific flow and right again I imagine then uh something like of course the there was this highly contentious Sushi swap a vampire attack extremely famous right and so does does that kind of thing become even easier now where you start like that and you say okay you know we know you wanted LP on unit swap but you can LP on us and uniswap and then once they get these large Network effects they they you know go to phase two of some kind and they try to uh to to you know migrate away from uniswap entirely so like I wouldn't say that's I mean maybe that's not very fun right uh but uh it's just sort of these are these more interesting fanciful ideas I have um yeah so I don't know how you guys feel about that right and again feel free to steer the conversation far away if we don't want to be talking about vampire attacks but no I think it's it's it's definitely interesting I guess like at that point what really is a vampire attack if you're a vampire attack is improving the protocol right like I think that's like a very different uh comparatively so um maybe let me uh take a step back from here and uh ask you maybe a spicy question about liquidity management protocols so uh you know like the the inherent uh kind of selling point of of unchanging liquidity management protocols Is You by definition implements your logic on chain right uh maybe some maybe all of it maybe some of it but you know the part that's implemented on chain is the selling point of of such protocols now uh only in some sense also by definition strictly inferior to to off-chain Market maker in that you know if you guys start with the same logic uh same strategy but you impose this additional constraint to yourself that your logic has to live in the self-executing smart contract that can't do much uh in the grand scheme of things um right like what what are really the thing that we're we're trying to gain here because you're apparently giving up something yeah so so if I understand correctly the question is can a fully on-chain liquidity manager ever rival um uh something which can can leverage uh you know things uh fully off-chain ideas and um uh like yeah that I guess is the harder question that maybe the easier one is like what are we gaining here uh right because I think the the complexity uh trade-off that that like the online implementation is giving up is is is pretty evident uh but like the exact thing that we're trying to gain here what do you think it is is it is it just transparency that people can audit the code or it's you think it's um okay Support Agency issue that we're trying to address uh is it high fees that hedge funds are charging uh you know like what do you think is the realistic selling point of these protocols yeah I I have working with so one thing Iraqis does a lot of right is we also work with protocols protocols that are tokenized and these tokenized protocols they want to um uh you know they they want to improve the the liquidity profile for their token to achieve certain goals and basically this can be quite complicated on on universalopathy 3 as as we all know to do to do yourself so even if the protocol has assets to do that maybe there are there are ways for for that to be streamlined and I think there you really really see that what is this zero to one Improvement about it being on chain even though as you say we give up a lot of optionality right or um a lot of things by being entirely on chain is this transparency right if you were working with an uh like uh with a traditional Market making firm or something not only is it entirely custodial right and and they're yes charging High fees or there are these very interesting deals that they make with a you know you they get an option on your token to buy it at a certain price right this is like a classic Market making deal but beyond that you also have zero transparency of what they're really doing in the market right like for instance it's known that some of these some of these market makers on centralized exchanges and assets that they don't really um they're not really sure how to trade they just paint a picture they trained a pity pretty picture in the book of the centralized exchange but actually whenever any taker comes they move their limit orders away because they don't want any takers because they're not sure how to manage uh their risk or things like this right and and as a um as a customer there like a protocol you would have no idea that this is happening right so I think this transparency can be really huge right so the non-custodial ship and the transparency the fact that we you can get just full real-time data about um how is the liquidity that actually now you own that is simply being run on some automated uh automated strategy that that uh fits your needs um exactly what it's doing and when and not only that also because it's non-custodial you at any time can simply remove your app you know take everything out and say I don't want to do this anymore right so I think that like these are gigantic benefits in my view and and then I guess the last one right on the on the trader side is always right I do think Dex is in general right could have this issue of red how will you ever if we have these 12 second block times on ethereum L1 so how could you ever rival these centralized exchanges you have to pay fees if for market makers you want to move but what we lose in that efficiency which at some in some places right that it's there is something lost you gain in having a fully transparent open market that's globally accessible by anyone right and and that's why I think volume on dexas has grown you know tremendously even though we do know that they're you know we we don't rival them in efficiency on chain uh quite yet got it uh thank you for that uh unfortunately I have to step out a bit early but Austin will continue the conversation that I will uh thanks for coming Chen so my this is off topic uh my dad texted me my dad used to like be in the news and so he like Cox he always texts me during these things to give me tips and he wanted to know where you're at uh if maybe like the bra very very Broad View because I really don't want to doctor so maybe not never mind don't don't ask that he just wanted to me to compliment you on the wonderful view uh so I just wanted to I wanted to say that uh so well hey thanks no worries and I'm not afraid to say that I'm right now I'm here in in Zurich so hey Austin's dad it's it's Zurich um and uh yeah it's um it is a nice view I thought um this isn't this isn't where I live or anything but uh a friend's apartment and they had such a beautiful view up here I thought it was it was perfect fitting it is a very killer review I have just like my background of my office so not as fun uh yeah okay sorry I will get back to it um so I guess like one of the things that we want to talk about is like what types of improvements from uh like wait what are the types of improvements that help like Iraqis provide better performance like do you really do you think that like it's a more engineering optimizations like hiring more Engineers more portfolio optimization like more quants more code like what is like what improves iraqis's performance comes by the question honestly I don't even know if I know the answer yeah I mean me neither right I mean one this there's so much Green Field here right that if if you attack any of these right if you say let's make a team that's just only about shipping the on shipping the code right entirely smart contract developers let's optimize this to the nth degree let's write it entirely in Yule and uh you know let's let's fill these smart contracts with all kinds of features I think you could there's so much room to you know just perform amazingly well in in the space that that we're in just focusing on that and then on the other side you could be very very lean in terms of uh in terms of trying to ship code and and infra on-chain infrastructure and really just focus on like you say the and so um it's put in that same thing just sort of just like General on-chain analytics I'm still a little bit um I guess even I would say disappointed with at least what's publicly available with the analytics of understanding what all the LPS are doing right like uh we're we're um you know we're highly incentivized to know exactly what's going on in these markets and it's quite difficult there's a ton of work to be done there to actually understand like what are other LPS doing and like what uh in general um and especially if you're going to be getting that in real time um yeah it's just right now I think most of that is is super opaque and even when you see analyzes often they have to be very very coarse grained where for instance they yeah right or they only look at the nft positions manager for univ3 right and that silos a whole class of right all of Iraqis doesn't actually integrate with the nft things like this where um of course much of this you know it improves over time but I'm still amazed that there's not um or I still often feel that there's something lacking there and again even to our own understanding I would still love to understand better what you know what what all kinds of LPS are doing and you know classifying them and understanding them and and uh yeah for now I feel that there's still a lot of question marks there so yeah yeah it's definitely something that we're thinking about a lot too uh is like how do we think about are how do we like like what is the what does the community need to become more sophisticated like what analytics do they need it's just like really hard to calculate a lot of this and I think that's sort of just the concerns and the difficulties with working with on-chain data um but I do think you're correct that like there it needs to be solved before the you know like a lot of capital can onboard like ironically people ask me like what is what do you use to manage reality positions and I'm like I just use revert Finance right like I don't have like some crazy setup it's just Reverb and like you know shout out to them uh they do a great job and it's just sort of like funny to me that uh that's like honestly almost like Best in Class uh and it's like just like two I think it's just two guys and um I think yeah there's a lot to be done to like sort of improve that area yeah and one other major Improvement in whole space that I think we could totally focus on or anybody could focus on to really Drive value to the like LP on-chain lping space it's just front end as well right like uh uh to this day being a uniswap B3 LP is very complex it's complex on the uni UI it's complex on all the other peripheral liquidity manager uis as well I think and often right is especially if you want to provide custom and uh like customized preferences for um you know uh then I think that like just providing better metrics for them to understand how their position is doing right but also in interfaces that just make it easier and more approachable for you to say I do want to LP right and and I I do understand what I'm getting into here um and I sort of feel confident about it um yeah there's just a ton to do there and then when you think about unib4 and hooks right I imagine that uh uh this is going to be uh you know even another order of magnitude of complexity okay I want to be an LP either if you go to a fully generalized uh UI then uh it's gonna be you know you have to be highly proficient in what's going on right no um and then if you go to something uh that's more like shipping an easier ux um still there how do you then allow the user to understand what they're getting into because you're hiding some of the complexities from them so so yeah a lot to do I agree I think uh I've been talking or Cal uh like the design leader you know swap has been talking a lot about this um he's like the person he's one of the big champions of like the simple interface and he's just like we need to make el ping simple again um not simple again but like the lping interface much more simple than it is uh but yeah definitely not like Sunny will be much harder in V4 but something the team was thinking about at least on a good note um so we have two more questions so I have one more about uh if you could if you could design or like choose one hook design and then hide it as a secret forever um what would you choose and why yeah good question right I mean so I think maybe this isn't an answer to a question but maybe it's a question I have for you guys too right okay well because a lot of what happens to me thinking through Hooks and like uh right when we just started here too there was some some new hook designs just dropped some fun uh some sort of fun hooks uh LP rebates and old only old accounts and stuff like this and I think when I originally started thinking about hooks I thought about it in the in a way like yeah there's going to be different hooks for different things lots of different hooks for different things but sometimes the more that I think about it I think that what about hooks that are like monolithic hooks right hooks that are everything in the kitchen sink or or is that the direction that hooks might end up going like why or why not this is maybe a question I have for for you and so so yeah I guess it's yeah not an answer to your question yet I love that I love chatting right so that's fine I mean it's a good question right like I don't I don't think every pool will have a monolithic design um I think that it's too dependent on the asset pair you know like the dye usdc ones are always going to be very different than the usdc eth ones I talk a lot about this with Oracle specifically uh I'm like the one last remaining non like I am okay with oracles my coin will ask for many people who believes that and that's because I think that like in the past we built oracles for every single asset type and they all kind of sucked at all of them I think that in the future we can build oracles that are good for the asset pair that's in mind and you don't have to worry about that as much and then trying them like you did in V3 and so I think that sort of thinking rolls up where you will have big classifications of uh pools or token types that use specific only use specific hooks um but I do think that there will be like a set of this is good and like this is like a you know one hook but it's like 10 different designs that it can do um and like maybe like limit orders and like T1 and an Oracle or not an oracle but like those two and then like uh you know maybe some of these lever reducing hooks so I think like those will maybe exist in the future um I think a lot about like there's three different types of asset pairs that I think about I think about like ethus eth usdc is in its own and then there's like all mid caps actually maybe four all mid caps versus eth that all like long tail tokens versus eth and then like stable coins I think they all need different things uh and they all have different like the ethoscc market is like so competitive it needs lever reducing hooks it needs to be as gas efficient as possible but like a die usdc parent is only in Oracle like it maybe like it needs like a breaker or like a very simple Oracle and like just like you know things that are not as complex and so I think that that they'll never be sort of this one monolithic thing that is included in every single pool because um every every Market needs something slightly different but I do think that like within those asset categories there might be sort of this idea of a monolithic uh end-all be-all hook until the next good design comes around and then you know we go to that so um this was more my question I totally agree that there are there are different markets right and so there's there's no one hook for all these different Market types but even if we were to just zoom in on ethusdc right will it be that there should be many different ethusdc hooks that achieve different things for different users and I could see that right maybe one that just really foreign limit orders on ethusdc as opposed to you know other uh other types of hooks but but I do see potentially right just shelling points around like well this is instead right originally I thought okay maybe you ship the hook that really does the dynamic fees and then you ship the hook that does the loss versus rebalancing minimization and you ship the hook that does X and Y and Z and then you realize well wait why don't you just put all of those in the one best hook for you right uh and so that that's where yeah I do think potentially there could be write these kind of yeah best best hooks for for that specific Market let's say that that kind of uh sap up all the liquidity and so yeah so now to finally get back to your question I think this is this is the hook I would want to keep secret that's the best one right the one the one that sink to elaborate like what I think that is because my my goal here was to drop so much Alpha that my team would be mad at me um so I think like right if we talk about we talked about this loss versus rebalancing thing that I I'm super excited about and I think uh but if you look at the loss versus rebalancing paper right in the equation for uh LP profit and loss it's actually three things right there's spreads or fees that you capture right and this is a positive income markups however we want to call them I say I didn't leave it as not just fees because maybe you can capture the spread in a different way but let's just call them trading fees for now that's one term of the equation then there's loss versus rebalancing this term you want to minimize since this is a negative one and then there's also this Market risk component right the fact the the hedgeable market risk of your um and then this is the third component of the lp profit and loss and so in my opinion yeah the hook I would want to keep secret from the world that I'm Now not keeping secret from the world is a hook that attacks all three of these terms in that equation to really just provide the best experience for for the lp again maybe I'm just only thinking right now about a very high volume pool like an E3 SDC yeah I think that's the killer one right if it's a perfect loss versus rebalancing hook on ethos DC it's it's kind of game over right I mean I game over right now it's that's like that's the best possible hook you could come up with and hopefully you know someday maybe someone uh on this call will come up with it all right but we'll see um okay I guess we have our last rapid fire questions so um do you like if ever when do you think V4 will pass V3 and volume in like months I think it definitely will I think uh the history shows us I I was uncertain how quick migration would happen to V3 and maybe you maybe you know how many months it took I don't but it felt fast it was very fast yeah yeah it was extremely fast and right this is what's cool about Unchained stuff is like uh right uh is the mobility in comparison to you know the traditional Finance is just incredible right so if everybody sees it's better everybody can move tomorrow so I think um like we're talking about how many months from launch like uni before launches yeah yeah so deployment and then trading works yeah interface from what everything works right cool so it gets deployed and the interface is there how many months from there oh I'm gonna say maybe two and I think that's even long long but it's because there's a lot of complexity to shipping these uh to shipping hooks that actually make things better and that also there's you know you want to understand these smart contracts too so there's maybe some new smart contract risk associated so yeah yeah I think probably I do agree um the other one is like how many hook like how many hook designs will see significant volume in V3 in V4 like like six months after a launch like do you think it's going to be like very few hooks to do a lot of volume a breadth of hooks um what number Dan said 10 just for uh you know give you a little uh Alpha there cool to have a number yeah yeah I financially I think at the beginning it will right there will be a lot of there's you know there's a lot of excitement in the world right now about all these different possible hooks I hope we see you know this wide variety I think at first it will be hard to know um besides certain kinds of signaling and also one one last thing that's quite important right is now because there can be a full sea of hooks those who actually do control the are at the trader right like the one inches and the uniswap uis as well and all of these uis the hooks that they search through is super important right so if all of these uis only search through 10 hooks then for sure it's 10 or less also but if they search through the there's really wide variety I would see it um yes starting wide and going down over time and so I'd love to see a world where actually at First there's a bit of a chaos and we're seeing more than 10 actually sort of splitting the volume um uh but yeah where will it end up I think and again this is On Any Given pair or just sure yeah no I think I think just in general yeah in general then yeah you need like at least five because you already mentioned that there's kind of a couple of different categories right um so I would say no no less than five because stable coins will just defend it stable car markets will definitively have a different hook than the other ones or for instance so yeah um but I hope that there is some variety like I say I'm wondering if there are going to be these winner take all monolithic Maybe yeah exactly we don't know yeah so I trust Dan with 10. 10 was a good one he had a good argument for it um so I was like that's fair uh yeah that's sort of all the questions we have I I don't know if there's anything else we're gonna chat about or we can sort of let you go um you know nice for you to have to have you on well yeah first of all thanks for having me and um I think uh just want to mention that like um you know there's so much activity and noise in what's going on um and as a developer who was just hacking around on defy and sort of happened on this um and didn't just happen on it right it was in it was actually in the uni V3 like first post that hey there should be these peripheral peripheral protocols but it was just really is um started out um much more never knew I would be here with uh with this uh protocol with hundreds of millions of dollars inside of it and I think it's a testament to to I I feel happy about really deciding to not do something super zero-sum and instead work on top of what's already working great and you see that that you you really reap the benefits of that so basically like uh not trying to fight with uniswap but just help uniswap grow is what allowed us to grow um and so yeah it's it's great to be here and to be in more contact because in those days I didn't know any of you guys I was just a person in my in my underwear um trying to figure out how you need me three out to work so yeah very different right you might have said uh we'll meet we'll be seeing you at ECC and we saw you at Denver so uh you know it's nice to always hang out all right I will um yeah so uh thanks everyone for coming uh obviously go and follow Cassandra on Twitter follow our rackcast follow uh me and shin follow the UNIF swap Labs Twitter all of those fun things and uh we'll be back in about two weeks probably with another hugs conversation so if you have any further feedback in the meantime uh feel free to reach out um Contra thank you for coming and uh we'll see you in about two maybe like a week or two in person for sure Steven Perry
