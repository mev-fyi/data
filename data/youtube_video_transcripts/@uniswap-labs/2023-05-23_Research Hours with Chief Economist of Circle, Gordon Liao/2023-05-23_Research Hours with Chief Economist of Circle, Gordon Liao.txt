so hi everyone welcome to the second research hour series hosted by uniswap labs um uh I'm Austin a researcher at uniswap labs and the co-host of today's conversation with me here is shin my colleague at labs and the co-host for the space uniswap Labs is the largest Marketplace for on-chain digital assets the tools we create are built on top on the unusual protocol which is governed by an independent and decentralized community of uni token holders and today is the largest decentralized trading protocol to date the protocol has serviced over 1.5 trillion dollars of transactions across multiple blockchains and has never been hacked making uniswap one of the most trusted names in D5 you know swap Labs is focused on Building Technology that enables users to swap tokens Buy nfts provide liquidity and self-custody their assets with confidence the opinions expressed during today's conversation will be ours personally and not that of labs Our Guest today is corn Leo Gordon is the chief Economist at Circle internet Financial which created the usdc stablecoin he's also an advisor to your swap Labs as well as the former research lead Gordon's research areas include stable coins amms foreign exchange among others Gordon welcome to the uniswap the second ever unit swap office hours thank you so much it's honored to be here and uh great to hear that very long intro including a disclaimer that uh the view is expressed here are ours and ours only it does not represent those of our respective institutions uh very much because like you know that's what uh typically researchers identified a reserve put on their paper uh you have to right if not you know it could potentially be that way so no especially this is our our things are views so I guess we have a first question uh so uh do you have like any other things you want to add to your background so I give a pretty short Spiel but I want to let you sort of talk about any other things that you think we may have missed no not much to add uh you know I started my career in traditional finance and did research um at the Federal Reserve as well and I really see this being almost uh no pun intended a full circle going um from traditional Finance to centralized Central Banking to decentralized finance perhaps a little bit backwards to more of the centralized space that I see all of them being interrelated in many ways and uh quite important in the next next chapter of financial innovation yeah perfect so I guess a little bit on that uh so you've sort of been in every single section of the Trad five D5 space um so what was the biggest difficulty for transitioning between Trad Phi and D5 for you well I wouldn't say it's difficulty there are certainly differences in language differences in terminology differences in culture um and it needs some translation I think not many people are able to actually do this translation uh knowing the difference between um you know even for instance what liquidity provision means in divide versus what typical Market making is like in traditional Finance you know the difference between principle-based trading and agent-based trading these are Concepts that share many similarities but oftentimes they are approached from different angles some of the ingots approach from D5 oftentimes are grounded in engineering Concepts in computer science Concepts in traditional Finance is very much about financial engineering about the concepts that are previously known and I would say that the cultural differences are really interesting that I will observed in a very good way um I I think it is also a generation divide that if you can watch Wi-Fi is much older crowd much older population um demographics uh still many people on the banking side are in Susan High every day and then D5 is filled with this new energy of uh basically gen's ears which you know I'm not a gen zero myself so I actually got uh kind of taken me by surprise in a good way I learned uh What uh the index generation cares about and what really is intriguing and that's been really refreshing in many ways okay real question in coming what at what size does a bank start to be systemically important and you know in some ways Circle somewhat resembles a bank so does that threshold change when we were thinking about a stable coin issuer yeah so first firstly I would say that you know circle is quite different from a traditional uh Bank um you know it is not uh if you think about what banks do right banks are credit institutions we fulfill this role of transforming liquidity transforming credit um circle is closer to be a payment institution um than any conception of banking it does fulfill an important role of um facilitating payments and having some role of facilities to our value and but the server value is not meant to be uh you know transforming credit uh in the way that typically Banks lend out their assets on a fractional Reserve basis and it's also quite different in that um you know the the key is how about payments facilitating payments as quickly as possible even the store of value part which is important but you can see it is more of um competition with physical cash given this uh issues a stable coin that is now interest rate bearing rather than any form of security or deposits at this point so I think it's it's new type of perhaps payment Centric if you want to call it Bank um but it's it's really closer to a uh a payment instrument um that is resembling cash um to your question about how big does a bank have to be to be systematically important I think that's actually it's not really well defined uh internationally uh the bank of international settlement has a the Basel committee previously set up a framework for evaluating uh what is theme to be gcps or Global systematic important Banks and that's a number of different criterias size is one of which but things like interconnectedness uh things like operational complexity also is a factor in the U.S there is a threshold which after 2018 will change I believe it's around 200 it is at 250 billion dollars in assets that's when um Banks become required to fulfill certain obligations such as liquidated coverage ratio testing and some of the other um key uh Financial regulatory ratios that typically gcps have to fulfill but that that is not a single criteria in in the long way of saying but it's really interesting to point out the size of 250 billion dollars because I believe when svb failed it was just below that threshold of uh needing to submit testings of liquidated coverage ratio uh so is that does that point to you know a trend of this threshold maybe shrinking a little bit uh implicitly even though it's not stated on paper or do you think it's adjusting of the micro Frontiers well uh so the threshold um I think originally after dothrank was lower but it did become higher some people call it a tailoring rule um but it's also related to just the size of the banking sector have grown so dramatically uh since the global financial crisis in 2008 so for the GNC years you might not remember uh when 2008 happened uh but that was a very meaningful event that changed all of banking landscape and pretty much produce the today's Financial environment with banks having much larger Footprints much more concentration as well um due to quite a bit of consolidation as well as liquidity injection that start from the central bank that also leaves um commercial banks with larger balance sheets yeah that makes sense so the you this you think the systematic uh the systemically important threshold should vary across countries um because the Central Bank sort of sizing is uh different uh and their ability to carry out policy changes for example like a Finnish Bank should be much lower than the U.S Bank so if you agree how should we think about stable coins for their really isn't a border yeah so I mean there's a concept of global leases my important Banks right so in some sense there there needs to be a global standard and um there were many rules designed um in the aftermath of 2008 that were trying to set an even playing field a same standard for larger listings out of Institutions I think there are around 20 or so uh global system and important Banks although the size varies quite dramatically and most recently we've seen uh quite a Swiss to fail and that was a very slow uh death in some way that its assets was shrinking slowly it was a multi-year process and imploded um so yeah I think there does needs to be a global standard to set the Baseline of what is considered systematically important of course there are some tailoring involved that each country has to have its own uh rules to determine what is considered uh systematically important and by the way you know the concept of CVS systematic important financial institutions applies Beyond just banking large Insurance firms large asset manager management firms are oftentimes deemed as systematically important as well and what that means oftentimes is the central bank has some Authority being overseeing overseeing the these organizations and uh your question about you know whether there should be some sort of tailoring for uh stablecoin issuers I think you know perhaps given that there are different um many different currencies out in the world and uh obviously the dollar is a dominant currency of global trade and finance and dollar stablecoin is the largest um you know largest uh stablecoin by circulation as well um but you know for many countries uh there are smaller stable coins that are packed to local currencies are some some of which are very well backed and perhaps for those countries um it's meaningful to have some sort of destination for the importance of those institutions as well okay uh I want to dig deeper into this distinction between you know payment uh companies who takes deposits uh you know at Circle uh versus a bank right and I think you wrote an article in Barons recently you argued that opening the payment rules to non-bank financial institutions could lower the complexity of banks but you know on the other hand if you think about the comparison here uh you take a financial institution uh this financial institution takes taking some deposit uh issues some you know liability maybe in terms of its its own stable coin or just in terms of like a banknote and then in the ideal scenario where uh you know stablecoin are widely accepted as payment and integrated into the economy there is to some extent a risk uh where you know this like deposit taking financial institution could pose uh to the system so I guess like in in terms of the argument of like separating out payment from The Lending and borrowing business model how how should we how should we think about it and how do you reason about you know opening up payment rails to to non-backed financial institutions absolutely I think that's a great question and something I thought a lot about uh since the time I was at a Fed where I think a lot the FED economists were influenced under one particular view of South developed after uh I would say like probably after the diamond diving models of the world but banking you know as a concept has had a very long history and the concept of having payment specific Banks or sometimes uh narrower Frameworks for banking has been in discussion for in almost a century actually Beyond a century um the yeah if we think about banking there's a credit facilitation aspect of banking uh but I think in the last couple of decades this aspect of banking has completely been transformed by um Innovations in technology but also Innovations in financial structure you know today I believe the status you know only 30 of credit is provided by Banks uh whereas previously in the older days a couple of decades ago in days of It's a Wonderful Life which is a movie that that capture that era of relationship heavy type of banking um you know Banks provided the bulk the vast majority of credit I think was 80 or something back in the day but today you know banks no longer fulfill that role of credit permission as they used to other than smaller Community Banks you know a lot of the banks are originally in loans and then syndicating them and um you know they would sell out the loans into private credit markets or syndicated loan markets um so they still serve a very important function but arguably you know the amount of assets no longer needs to be these type of E-liquid loans that just sits on the portfolio so then they you know the natural question to ask well if banks are just holding quite a bit of marketable Securities in many ways or loans and securities um do you necessarily need to tie up the payment aspect uh with the lending aspect and what has also taught us in recent times is the rise of technology in terms of Mobile Banking in terms of social network in terms of the flow of information and how quickly it could spread in a network makes uh liabilities of any sort much more runnable than before and this is exactly what we observed uh with svb's collapse but also with some of the other banks that um you got taken over including uh more recently with First Republic that once there's a trigger there's a belief that others could run on the bank whether there's is value or not everyone is motivated to uh to access their mobile app and to pull money out of a particular bank and that sort of dynamic was always there as always part of typical bankrupt but with the spread of information and how fast they could occur and with the easy availability of Mobile Banking experience that makes that type of risk much more heightened so in this environment where you have Banks fulfilling less of a credit in the mediation role as they had previously as well as much more runnable deposit base because of event of Information Technology so I think it really makes sense that we think how much of payment activity should be tied in with banking activities in fact some of the recent research coming out of the Federal Reserve from colleagues of mine previously actually wrote about the risk of payment flows to Banking and to bank lending specifically I'm thinking of a specific paper by Eli and and co-author um where this is really if you look at even just the fedwire statistics and data the more that banks have payment churn activities in how much they had to pay out from their account to other Banks uh perhaps it will fulfill payroll for perhaps to fulfill invoicing the more risk that creates to their lending book that means they can't hold as much of eLiquid lungs in the environment we actually have seen um just much higher growth and velocity of payment on the payment rails so for instance the fedwire payment rail has increased um its payment uh value by 50 in the last three years from I believe the status was from 2019 to 2022. um it introduces a lot more risk to naturally The Lending and credit transformation and I think there could be a completely redesign of banking system in which you could remove some of that risk and put it separately aside into payment specific institutions you know whether you want to call it payment specific Banks or stablecoin company it doesn't really matter that uh kind of facilitates payment activities while you have the lending activities being born by those depositors that are aware that they are taking on risk that are uh providing the liquidity for transforming assets and transforming uh transforming uh credit and maturity um and I think this actually enticing very well with D5 why is that so because uh if you think about it if you move away into the world in which you have a separation of payment activities which could potentially be fulfilled by um a payment stablecoin uh from the risk taking activities a lot of these type of risk taking activities end up being much more granular in that there are risk-taking activities for facilitating uh illiquid loans for instance or E-liquid perhaps under a regulated World E-liquid Securities um and that sort of liquidity provision is best done with programmability with open source innovations that allow more participation into a network rather than more siled systems in which only a few players get to get to deploy risk Capital towards it so currently you have already naturally the development of Syndicate alone market for instance it's it's a it's a large market for banks and non-banks to participate in to lend out money but that's only reserved for a small network of Institutions not just because of Regulation and requirements but also because simpler is really really hard to facilitate the sharing of liquidity risk sharing of credit risk through a larger Network because currently all the trading are down rather manually so having more automated ways through D5 to allow transformation of risk and provision of liquidity into uh perhaps a broader Capital Market um has to be developed simultaneously with this separation of payment activities and Landing activities this is why I believe you know companies like Circle and unisp are uni swap labs are core to Innovations in finance because you have this simultaneous Trend happening that makes sense I guess speaking on liquidity risk and credit risk and runs uh I guess the big Topic in stable coins last year was I was under collateralize algorithmic stable coins uh like Luna that or not Luna usdt that us T that reach their sort of end with a big run in a large loss of capital do you think that we should completely give up on our underclaughterized algorithmic stable coins or do you still think that there's a possibility that they may come back and figure it out that's a great question you know I think I'll go stable coins so this is the distinction between trifi and D5 D5 people who might be Engineers by um training or by background I thought this is a great idea you know from a tri-fi perspective it's always kind of clear that this is not so different I'll go stable coins we're not so different than the experiments that many Emerging Markets central banks played in terms of uh having fractional Reserve with foreign reserve and creating packed currencies so one of the um you'll try Limas well the trilemma of international finance or International macro is that you can't have a you can't have all three things you can't have a packed currency um and also have a free floating um open flow of money uh between your cross-border at the same time having independent monetary policy many countries have tried this in the past of pegging their currency to the dollar having free flow of exchange with a dollar and trying to set their own independent monetary policy and that simply just has not worked over and over again in the experiences of the peso crisis in the experience of many of the other crisis unless of course you have a constant inflow of uh Revenue source that um that actually makes the pack kind of destabilize from the other direction but that's a longer discussion but the simple fact is um you know Luna and Tara represented a form of their own Central Banking um but with very limited um inflow of cash that is by Design I think the original conception is if you can generate enough payment activities and you can charge fees on those payment activities that serve as part of the equity revenue stream that you could have enough of equity value that's back in Luna therefore they would also back there but that was simply so it is a bit um a bit of uh idealistic in some sense um because what we've seen is of course it wasn't adopted for payments as nearly as much um it was uh mostly adopted for the usage in this anchor product protocol which set its own independent monetary policy paying uh I forgot what like 20 interest rate or something uh and allowing free conversion and allowing a pack uh which just by fundamental design doesn't it just violates us tested Time and Time tested property of international finance so could algorithmic stablecoin work in some particular way that's designed by perhaps a more well-packed with more well-backed collaterals possibly but it's certainly not going to be you know equity-backed collaterals which was essentially what uh material was could you summarize the top two policy changes that circle is advocating for you know as nicely as chachu pte would have done it well I don't know if I could uh articulate things as nicely as try to see these days but I think you know the two large policy changes that Circle and probably I would say the rest of the industry would like to see is at least in the US is too pretty particular bills one is related to payment stablecoin that is having a Federal Regulation framework regulation framework around payments they require coins that would allow it to be fully backed and be regulated so it could also gain broader adoption um at the same time having also a market infrastructure bill that allows more um adoption of D5 protocols but also with proper safeguards with the necessary rules and requirements around regulating uh D5 protocols so those are just broadly to a piece of regulatory legislations that's going through uh being discussed right now whether we'll get any result from these discussions is yet to be seen but I think there's a broad recognition that this is very much needed and the US is far behind other countries in these discussions as we've seen in Europe there's already a Mika markets in crypto asset bill that's passed that address both of these Topics in Asia there are also many legislative efforts so I definitely think that um you know we hope there will be both these two bills that are in some form that could be supported for the industry but also uh maintain a fair amount of regulatory oversight makes sense I think it's sort of a sling that's on the top of everyone's mind is a regulation in the coming sort of years uh so it's important to hear like it's interesting to hear sort of your perspective on that uh so I guess yeah just add that like some people fear that regulation is kind of bad for the industry I actually think it's quite the opposite right what we're seeing is without regulation it will always be on the fringes and right now um the risk to the industry is actually uh one in which there's no access whatsoever to um the Fiat world that is having banking access cut off and um I think having the proper level of uh regulation and consumer protection would allow the industry to flourish and Grill that makes sense I guess on that topic you recently wrote a paper about blockchain based foreign exchange using amm's and stablecoins how has the reception been for that paper and what can you tell us about sort of people's thoughts on it yeah thanks for asking uh that's the paper with you and uh soon and along with MC and and David puth uh the reception has been great right um it's we have uh had a number of presentations at uh central banks and a few other uh upcoming presentations um I think probably the topic of using distributed Ledger or blockchain for settling cross-border payments it's just well understood that is a um that is probably like the uh the killer app of crypto that more broad-based population could understand it's very clear how broken the following exchange rate market and cross-border payments are and it's very clear that um something like public blockchain or distributed Ledger is a clear solution to issues that face this really large Market that's quite critical to the lives of so many people whether it is sending remittance or making payments making payrolls cross-border um or whether it is uh trading um the foreign exchange rate Market is a uh is an enormous Market by volume it's uh processing about seven trillion dollars a day uh by value and um that's uh still somewhat archaic in in terms of having real-time settlement and not having real-time settlement which is about um not having these sort of sediment of one leg of the trade against the other lack of trade sometimes known as payment versus payment protection um it's it's probably around half of the trade volume and that is problematic because they introduce the settlement risk into the financial system but it's also problematic in that those who use existing Solutions have to put up liquidity against the claim uh Against The netting of settlement and that is also inefficient which is probably why the netting solution hasn't been uh fully adopted it's only adopted partially um I do see the greatest opportunity are at uh not at the institutional level necessarily but more for everyday consumers for everyday users especially for those who are in um uh in at the bottom of the pyramid who might be sending money in a cross-border for remittance for their family and who currently had a face very Hefty charges on average I think the World Bank estimated to be about six percent of transaction crossbow transaction value in remittance goes towards fees so being able to solve that problem Alone um it's a real value add to a lot of households in the world uh that depends critically on the necessary remittance to meet their livelihood so they said issue that I'm also very passionate about from The Real World impact perspective um as well as from the trading perspective so last time I checked um I think Finance still the most popular Exchange in Asia and Tron is still the most popular or most commonly used pavement rail in crypto uh as you said you know uh this is meant to serve maybe the unbanked billions in developing countries what what has Cc or just in his Excellency downright what what can we do to increase adoption of you know usdc or maybe uricy and other stable coins how can uniswab start to serve the billions of unpacked in developing countries do you think yeah I think what they have done right is probably early mover Advantage by far right just by having the early presence really help to drive the entrenchment in um in in their adoption usage in many parts of the world in Emerging Markets um I do think you know the whole reason why this whole system was developed with how Bitcoin arrives in the middle of you know October the in the Bitcoin wallpapers read in October 2008. um you know the whole ecosystem was developed around the concept of uh being a bit more decentralized not relying on centralized entities what we have observed in fact was developments that were quite contrary to the underlying ethos of decentralization in fact you had immense concentration of risk within a few institutions by many of these platforms have collapsed in the last two years and you had an immense concentration of also power [Music] that I don't think is the healthiest both for the ecosystem to continue to develop as well as for um just for even adoption standpoint right for um any industry to grow uh in a healthy competitive manner you have to have more competition and more um the less concentration of uh of of brisk and uh of market share um so yes I do think um currently our ecosystem is quite concentrated and hopefully those who are at the center of it also recognize the need for the broader Diva ecosystem to continue to develop because that is where the real Innovation is it's not just a centralized platform that does everything um which you know somewhat resembles what we have already in traditional Finance so I guess as part of that people have been sort of talking about uh crypto as banking the unbanked and bringing payments uh to the unbanked for like many years essentially since like 2015. like what do you think is sort of the difference this time and what do you think has been through the innovations that have happened that have allowed it to sort of grow and do something that is actually usable now and what do you think needs to continue to grow to sort of be the one place to do payments yeah I think um a couple of things one is having more regulatory Clarity this time around and I think we definitely have a lot more uh regulatory Clarity in many countries now than even a couple years ago and continuing on this trend of having more clarity that supports adoption i'm broader usage in a safe and sound manner it's very important to um to further uh the use of digital assets more broadly I also think that you know we had a couple of cycles in which it's it was really centered all the activities were centered around speculative activities which created these boom and bus Cycles which were somewhat unhealthy because doing times of booms you have everyone being so excited about either you know icos or airdrops or whatever incentives um and then quickly that Fades and uh that leads to uh a lack of interest and activity especially if some of the users who are more um just getting started would burn through the process um I think this time around having more Focus um real world utility and activities that could transform lives should be the focus and hopefully that would mean you know adoption would be much more sustainable than um purely speculative form that has been characteristics of previous Cycles uh speaking of utility and using crypto as payment I think a lot of debate has been going around whether you know the the advantage of crypto payments stems purely from kind of the regulatory Arbitrage aspect of it you know if you look at South Asia countries nowadays if you have a like WeChat on your phone you can basically seamlessly get a cross-border payments uh already right and and that's because kind of they solved a lot of the infrastructure issues that I guess crypto is maybe equally well positioned to solve but uh you know maybe that's the way to go like do you think that the advantage of crypto of doing cross-border payment is really regulatory Arbitrage or not uh and is it the way to go about solving this problem yeah you know first I think you know crypto has sometimes a sometimes the term is used very broadly but crypto just means cryptography right uh there are many Technologies are built um uh cryptography there are Technologies are that spilled on cryptography that has nothing to do with digital assets um I think the ones that you are mentioning the ones that are these super apps in Asia they definitely have emerged as a a solution to many of the payment issues that those countries and those citizens of those countries face but they also come with certain uh downside in that they are very concentrated uh there's two large payment apps alipay and which I pay that's recently responsible for um for the vast majority of day-to-day transactions now in some countries and uh that is problematic because um you have such concentration of activities being centered around you know to um essential oligopoly um and that's why the government kind of stepped in to uh to lower the concentration a bit by having certain requirements and one of the most Innovative requirements around that was actually something I think the U.S should consider which is uh making those companies to fully back their Reserve asset with the central bank so today a un that is held in a WeChat wallet um or alipay wallet it's actually a U.N that's backed one-to-one with the central bank reserve currency um I think that's something that 100 men started who recognize is actually needed to ensure the safety and stability of their financial system which is something that is worth emulating from other countries that are also considering proper regulations um you know whether that itself is uh fulfills all the payment needs I think you know you're inherently limited by the level of programmability those two platforms could provide you're also inherently limited by the the fact that these two organizations could essentially decide uh whether to include your app or not or whether to uh is good or whether to uh you know formulate their own version of the same Innovation and we've seen this in the US as well with many of the web 2 companies uh with some of the app stores that make decisions um uh which app that it could be launched or cannot be launched um those are our symptoms and those are our examples of concentration um in which it sometimes could deter Innovation and so I I do fear that that sort of system in which everything is built around a couple of key platforms you end up with a lot more platform risk a lot more concentration risk and deterrence to longer term Innovations yeah I guess as part of that um the stable coin space is sort of semi-concentrated as well do you sort of think that usdc is the only stable coin model or stable coin in the space needs or do you think that there are other sort of models that you think have Merit uh to be in the industry um you know I think Circle welcomes Innovation and competition right the whole reason of having um perhaps having Federal Regulation is that it would allow competition but on the same Level Playing Field um that is there needs to be a bare minimum requirement for the asset backing to be safe uh for the full Reserve backing um for the protection of consumers the protection of users and Beyond which is open for competition of the different type of features that stable coins could introduce you know for instance customer code has gone around usdc but uh now has also built out a cross chain protocol layer those type of Innovations uh requires competition and requires um standard setting as well so I I don't think you know usdc will be the only stable coin in town at all in fact I think it is about encouraging uh competition but at the same time requiring the same standard and interoperability between tokens stable coins like usdc is you know type of real world asset what other type of real world asset do you think we should have on chain yeah you know this is kind of related to um the last question value like for instance one type of relatively stable store value could be um really short-term um uh that instruments of sorts that provides some level of stability but also has the ability to Bear some interest that delivers some interest back to the uh to the holders but that requires innovation in security rules um I think there are also currently in existence some type of um similar to stable coin type of instruments out there that's tokenized uh treasury or tokenized treasury funds um but of course it has different type of requirements as well being a security um being you know having qualified purchaser status or at least qualified investment investor status um so there needs to be a simultaneous evolution in terms of Technology as well as with the confines of Law and Rule to make this closure easier so then what is clearly a security can be a security but with the right disclosure foreign yeah I get so as uh as we're starting trying to wrap up I was sort of looking forward to the next few years uh what sort of products and Innovations do you think you're most excited for in the D5 space there's just so many I think at a fundamental layer uh innovations that continues uh layer one layer two whether it's related to security or privacy that is a huge area that I'm very excited about and that Innovation on the application side I think we are just beginning to crack open the surface area of um the real world usage of this technology um products that touches everyday life whether it is FX or whether it is you know collateralized lending that's being used for treasury trading these are real problems that needs to be solved and there are real demand for it if you could have a solution for for instance for solving treasury intermediation issues um so I think we're just beginning to touch on the real world asset side and I do think that is a large area of growth because we know the demand exists the demand for Solutions and for Solutions both from technical sense but also from a legal regulatory sense um it's it's immense um and then everything that happens with web3 that will uh we'll see what happens I'm optimistic but uh it's less proven demand it's rather I think we can build everything around it we have to see how the consumer Behavior shifts that makes sense uh so I guess we have sort of been asking you questions you sort of have anything else that you want to talk about that we haven't touched on um I don't in particular have anything um else to add I would say that um you know for those who are doing research in the area having fundamental understanding of financial system having fundamental understanding of what has been built before and what it teaches us about present is very important there are so many examples of D5 protocols out there that is in some ways emulating what has been done before but perhaps for the wrong reason perhaps not knowing well some of the solutions have been tried in tried Phi are are a path to Nowhere or a path to something that's even better so I would encourage anyone doing research in this space to First delve in deeply on the traditional Finance side yeah you Frontline our last question our last question was uh advice for researchers in the space so I think we'll just sort of skip that one um yeah I think that was sort of a great uh research hour so uh Gordon thank you very much for coming on um we want to uh shout you out go follow Gordon on Twitter he will post wonderful things about uh tradify and D5 and you can read all of his papers on uh the same topics as well and um yeah I think that's all from us I think we'll be back in about two weeks with another guest uh if you have any suggestions feel free to DM shin and I are on Twitter uh or send us an email or anything like that which I'm happy to get into it um and that has been all for us at the uniswap research hour so uh thank you everyone for coming and we appreciate your time and we also appreciate Gordon's time thank you thank you Austin it's a pleasure to uh join you guys again of course of course thanks everyone all right
