[Applause] [Music] my name is started on workshop activities which are by the last Monday today guys have some questions you guys help with anything yeah so just to talk a little bit about monkeys Network monkeys net worth is a platform that allows individuals to create projects to complete those projects and get a currency he's sorry or a variety of experiments we are getting towards working with organizations and [Music] structure is to get those community leaders to incentivize prevent law passed in projects feedback to each other in a sort of decentralized manner on this year sorry but you predict a little bit more yes all right one of the things that we've done very tough on this year's actually set up not just network specifically for this stuff constantly go to Japan Valentina's dot network be able to see our fountains Explorer which is dedicated [Music] there are any kind of penalties of need to die of certain passes around the conference but this is also where we will be posting the bounties have been created for this workshop in particular about myself that I'm manager of Renville ripple is an open source library patterns and UX guides to me help you make dance the bounties Network and ripple or this little experiment and decentralized problem solving today with the goal of uncovering new UX patterns that might help ripple is a research driven offering and we're constantly researching UX problems that are common among tasks and prototyping and testing potential solutions with users and in doing that we want to cover a number of challenges that this room might be familiar with what bring a community around to coalesce around creative solutions and so a partner partner can faculty-student on this initiative to incentivize this collaborative generation these creative effective and have exhibitions in response to families so cordons going to talk a little bit about the bounties themselves and then we'll get into the need for kind of substance constantly my Foreman said we're going to try to keep this pretty casual agree quick because we want you guys to start talking about this people in this room are going to do the interesting work here between now and now on Monday so we want to make ourselves available but for questions but also just a few minutes of each other so phone's going to talk about kind of structure a little bit of the boundaries so for this workshop we have word bounties that we've created for you guys to take on just a curiosity room has a interest or experience currently priced as it's moving peering because the Lord is open what all right so we have four bounties that we've created for this workshop and they're centered around design and UX and front-end and usability for gaps can I get some brief show of hands of who is works in any of those areas who has like a keen interest in any of those areas great so what you want to do as being loose these bounties is encourage you use artists extremely practical don't have a background and design background in us I would encourage you all to still attempt to submit to these bounties we're kind of structuring them so that you are being incentivized to participate and then there's larger incentives for people to want to go that stuff further too they're sufficient so what I want to do is to talk about the submission requirements and the evaluation criteria as we introduce them to these counties so livestock said each of these bounties comes out of research that rebel has done around feasibility problems that are have been identified in-house calm usability problems and so we've created a prompts for one or for four of these billion issues that we've identified and the first of these is onboarding new tap users so the submission requirements and I was kind of go through them briefly and then show you what the other bounties are because the submission requirements and evaluation criteria for each of these not Jesus is going to be fairly similar like I said before we want that many people to be able to participate that's possible so the minimum requirements were submitted to each of these bounties is going to be clearly articulated and written explanation of your solution and the attempts to us to solve from the prompt and if possible some sort of visual accompaniment to see that written explanation to sort of help you explain what your solution is and how you came about hiking ideal submissions would include a design by all the illustrations our flood was prototypes working demos links to source code use of the rim bulb library is encourage those who are a little bit more technical and are curious or willing to experiment with that it's really you get set up for evaluation criteria so this is how we're going to be evaluating each of those submissions to these counties I won't read through all the Americas they're available to you by the too late does this does your solution provide the new in a group approach to these common disability problems and because of that we expect users to be able to polish the task they need to accomplish and the pattern be applied a wide range of contexts not all down share the same share the same feasibility concerns but always plus implementation fidelity so again we want everyone to be able to participate so the technical implementations and high fidelity submissions are not a requirement just abstractions of ideas but you know you get bonus points if your submission is particularly please and through a thorough the remaining criteria accessibility error handling so is considered estates the user might pick number when they are they cannot learn these patterns these are corrected so just to go through the props really quickly so the first one is going to be about onboarding new deaf users the second is going to be about smart contracts and interaction third speak about transaction states and what is going to be about address those counties are what the problems are and how they sort of so we try to put a pretty good amount of context into the text of the Bounty's themselves so I'd encourage everyone to get you and open them up and I'm not going to go through like read through these line by line an interest of time but full health preference so the first one here is onboarding new DAP users rebels research has told us something that probably ever in this room those very well that is really really hard for someone new to an area to use an app so you know the typical onboarding workflow has tons of pitfalls and areas failure and abandonment and frustration so you know a process usually at a high level including something like wallet signing in the wall adding funds an app and then proceeding to try to accomplish whatever they were originally attempting to do is a process that we have seen lots of attempted solutions some more successful than others with it we think we'd all agree that this is a major pain point and one that is certainly confirmed as as a challenge to foreign criminals research unfortunately for us none of these are there's no once it's one-size-fits-all and global onboarding solution and each application prints its own context and its own user goals that it's trying to fill and so it's really having its own each application has with the user and this is where I plug my friend Ryan Ryan's Mercia I think on Thursday on conversational design later on this week so the challenge here is to create a reusable pattern or set of patterns to improve upon some aspect of california-berkeley this could be a Model T Eyre onboarding process or just a novel approach to some version of it so you know we have a laundry list of relevant scenarios that accounted for here checking for whether cable browser checking for a connected wallet different different scenarios involved there checking for specific network signing a wallet message funding the wallet in funding the wallet in different ways getting the balance of an ephah dress displaying current price or current gas price so there's there's a I just want to reiterate we aren't saying this this prompt is to create a perfect end and onboarding flow if you have that that would be an amazing submission to this bounty but improving in a novel way on any aspect or angle on that that workflow is going to be valuable and it will collectively we're all doing that we think that there's a tremendous opportunity here there's also an opportunity for if you've got friends of the river you have any interest in collaborating to sort of take these prompts piecemeal and sort of say you know I'm interested in this part of the process this person interested in this part of the process is there any attempt to submit something that's a little bit more high caliber because there are going to be prizes that are larger than just the payout that you're going to see or you're sufficiently being accepted and I'll go over that at the end the second prompt is on on chain Arizona smart contract interactions so on chain interactions with smart contracts typically introduced some levels of complexity that are greater than just a basic quality wallet transaction experience for users and proteins and users end-users would all collectively benefit from having a set of consistent patterns or a lot of that common functionality associated with that process things that we've seen come up in our research there are estimating gas compressed gas costs dealing with transactions but we've also looked at more complex work and we're close like opening CD so similarly to the previous prompt if you can think if you have a novel approach any one aspect to smart contract interaction user experience whether that's just one of those types of individual functionalities such as such as estimating gas price or a new approach to an entire workflow opening a CV in DRC 20 token swap all those would be fantastic submission ideas for this product so again included a little bit of a laundry list of possible ideas but these aren't necessarily a constraints just a place to get started the third practice on transaction States this is another one that has come up over and over again and our user research that everyone nearly of whom we've talked to is expressing concern or lack confidence around transactions permanent they're scary and all your money and that creates a lot of tension nervousness anxiety among users if you're in this room you probably know to look at either scan or meta mask to understand more about a transaction but alum users who aren't as familiar don't gonna do that this so how can we create a set of patterns at the bill that builders can use to provide a more informative experience that alleviates anxiety during the transaction process to help people understand more about what is happening without overloading them with information and accounting for different contexts some wearing more information as information so here we references you know some potential and but some of the things some of those scenarios might be a user rejecting a transaction or attractive transaction getting rejected or low gas transaction stop pending in the memo table to low gas resubmitting a transaction so there's a lot of these kind of transaction related scenarios that are our severe pitfalls for the and really strong uh protections here and then the last prompt we have is around is around quality exploration well address exploration we recently performed an inventory of patterns UI patterns among you know very wide number range of deaths for displaying information associated with an etherium address in the net and we got this which is huge sprawling variants and some works very simple displays of just an address in a balance somewhere these bridge displays of information including tokens and other assets and transaction histories and currency conversion lots and lots and lots of information again each death each death has its own context and its own meaning these are all potentially very valid approaches but we're all benefiting from more consistent patterns or displaying information associated with the wallet addressed in adapt and how can we start to create some of those those models that recognizing each has its own context look and we can create elements that are recognizable to users and start to build some more of that content so things we possible scenarios to account for here my wallet balance recent transactions I mentioned tokens [Music] currency conversion to Fiat adding funds through a grant so again we wanted to keep this short and and put a lot of this into the bounties themselves because really we don't see this moment as what's important what we see work where the value we see coming is in the work that hopefully you guys are going to do over the next week and we are here to answer questions now we're here we're going to be you know around the edge of questions this week please feel free to put comments on the bounties themselves on Twitter really where everything reaches we will we will be here to answer so just a few more housekeeping things before we open it up to any questions that you guys might so some requirements will actually talk about the prizes first so I've gone through some of the evaluation criteria for how we're going to be judging the submissions that anybody Jesus issues submit the bounty fulfillment for any of these prompts are welcome to do one you're going to do all of them but basically depending on that based on that evaluation criteria your submission will there be accepted work well if it was accepted you will receive the amount that the Mountie images around $5 0.03 P and this is just meeting having your submission be accepted that minimum requirements again so this is submissions that meet some of the criteria will likely to be accepted you don't need to hit you know check every single box because there are some of these evaluations Nigeria that are more geared towards the technical folks in the room but there's kind of a second-tier prices that we want to give off or exceptional subdivisions so these are going to be submissions that most if not all of the evaluation criteria sort of submissions that we see go above and beyond to provide demos prototypes examples of things that are maybe particularly innovative particularly thoughtful and pretty thorough and so for each prompt what's gonna happen is there's going to be a first prize winner and a second prize winner the first prize can receive 0.5 or eat and that's about two hundred dollars at the time of activation of this bounties and the second prize is going to receive 27 people just about left you that the dollars us so we just really want to encourage you know we thought that lower to your incentive as we want to encourage everyone to participate University have fun talk to your quality solutions that you have ideas that you have but then we also want to incentivize people that want to take that step further or do something really common usability problems like that so some of the things are in that need to participate are going to be a wallet and you're going to set up a sign up for an account on Mounties Network the sign up process for an account on the network is really speak for you such as link your wallet provide you know the minimum amount of information and totally kind of up to you who might information you want to provide and once you've done that you are free to submit to any news Matthew when it's your submission is ready and again there is a comment section on each of the bounties where you're welcome to ask questions I will be receiving those since I was the one who created the bounties but we're going to be sort of collectively addressing each post and those conversations can start on the Mounties or you can get in touch with us you know Twitter or whatnot to do that we will get back to you will sort of be in conversation around the active time line which again is until next Monday also we will we also encourage people to comment on other people's submissions if you see someone submit something and because all of this everyone participating in this workshop if you see someone submitting something we should you know tell them what you think about it tell them asking questions ask them have you thought about this you know because it really kind of little bits doors and opportunities for collaboration which is really what and without these network is all about you know rage identified exaggerating that it seemed which ways those mechanisms so please you know he is active as happy and don't back so yeah that's it any questions feel free to ask and as with a rep remaining time if you want to stick around and start doing things like signing up for your account of Bobby's Network reading the Proms you are welcome to do that and we'll be around and helpful to do that if you have any questions were out setting up the wallet so I got some mouth and then also around specific prompts but the problem being I didn't enter the next week and you're bluffing [Music] missions will be receiving your instantaneously accept it and then we'll be contacting the first prior to your prizes for those exceptional solutions what's the percentage of bounces that never gets even submitted to very few do you have a lot of the submission there are a lot of the counties that we create for that they invaded on conscious network are in partnership with a partnership of organizations and so because that grounds for experimenting it's a lot of the counties coming out of partnerships or events or conferences or efforts like that activities we don't see a lot of people at this point in times it's not Network it's very young it's still in a very much an experimental stage we don't see a lot of people creating bounties just on their own so life you don't see a lot of people saying hey albey that's your point whatever needs to bring me pizza that actually happening although you could do that hi my name is Jody Reed I had a conference in New York in February doing about it tastes roses and we'd love to talk to you about your great work on our what is my question and maybe it's for the room this is five dollars enough to get an engineer to actually make a submission and this $50 and $100 of being a Nobel Prize questioner what you know we started off like a loner is a couple reasons one is because the minimum requirement for a submission basically writing a paragraph about what you think a sketch of what looks like something very low fidelity and so for those less minded people who want to be able to reward something but we also recognize that for the people that are going to be spending more time and more effort in the Aris initiatives that you know that's where the higher tier war comes in but this is actually a really great point because this is a problem that exists in the world of contest style freelancing I guess you call it where you know you have a lot of people working who are not guaranteed to receive and apparently this is something that is usually problem on platforms that you see like fire or platforms that you see like upward 99designs where there's hundreds of people submitting their work on powers that's something that we really care about that's something that we don't have or right now that's something that we want to work towards a solution for so I just want to make sure make sure to say that I also want to say that we are the type of platform and that is happy to have this conversation and if you in the room feel like you want to like discuss only about what or reasonable yeah would be for like those initial president submissions and as well as what those cried prizes might be for those exceptional submissions a stock but it and we're probably willing to increase those and change those we're also willing to extend the deadline if you guys feel like the time that's given is not enough I will say one thing that we did talk about was maybe I mean changing the price to be arranged and taking this to the town the time and effort that has gone into this admission and the first prize about increasing the first prize to calculate those customers so let's definitely have those conversations we're totally open to it we're not you know we don't think the both have their room votes on the question I answered that loan but let's see what the others say of them yeah he thinks that fog bill was is enough anyone so I think a better question than five is five dollars in that first submission it doesn't ultimately my sufficiently paragraph this crack knees into minute sketch which you know I think that's fair do you think we it would be reasonable to maybe like additional tiers or with additional criteria is that more recently I think me like this submission report is should be zero it would be still okay the problem for me is like well I work as a designer I know my hourly rate where I mentioned the winning solution the demos and prototypes and explanation of error states and that's many hours and the best-case scenario of dollars doesn't cover almost like a single hour we can talk about that there is a risk that I will not even get that right so I'm looking at in two hours time to risk multiplier and that equals no okay there you know one thing we hundred and eleven people sign up for this so no I hear you and I I agree with you as a designer I agree with you as a designer you know as we attempt to solve problems specifically for you know like spaces like design you know and where those kinds of projects and and workflows and careers where did those fit into platforms like this how do you address the problems that are named to those those spaces you know again you want to make sure that is fair also one thing we're considering and this is not an excuse but one thing we are considering is that we are laying at the bottom of a bear market and offering half at the end you know there's like that potential that buddy who says that it's never going to recess that they know anything about the precedent right but yeah so let's let's like how that conversation let's change the reward amounts I want everyone who participates to feel like it's fair and you feel like that they're not just doing this or nothing because ultimately that's how everyone feels you know right one of the challenges with the you know making the criteria that's burdensome is that when we're talking about the challenges areas issues like error states are where those a lot of those user failures are our habit and so that was that was our rationale for motivating that as top level of nation criteria normally that would probably be something as an ad something like an afterthought in a competition but just in the research that we've done that's where we see a lot of users family and so we don't want that to be left behind [Music] so I guess there's a little bit of an inherent tension and doing that but not necessarily mate but how do we make that work a while and so maybe the answer is to make that make some of those evaluation criteria a little bit more flexible so that you know we're saying when we say how is it handling errors maybe it is and maybe we remove that from from the like critical acceptance criteria but introduce it more as part of the prompt to recognize that that's that's part of the group problems the net result so not necessarily saying you haven't had comprehensive error state can I change the topic just for a minute - three equations that I understand the problem that you're trying to solve with Brimble is to bring in your non block changes and should try and make the experience much easier for them I've just tried to use the Rimbaud app demo on my phone and it says your browser doesn't support our bluff game features and I'm just wondering why you assume that I have to have a wallet to be able to use your tools must be put a lot of thought into that why do I have to have a wallet to use your wallet I mean you don't have to use as a demo in rebel that's not site or application library itself for developers no no but I think one of the big mistakes we make as a community is we assume that people they understand what a wallet is be that they want to have a wallet and I think that's a huge that's a huge mistake absolutely we can tell you that we completely agree yeah I think we're at the point at this point in time what can be like like practically right now what can we implement that's not what we already have which is wallets those forget we have a guide on connect on the UX guide on connecting to wallet I think better articulates our recommendation there I also want to say that allows or users have a complicated process required to still be able to fulfill a bounty and basically what we do is that we subsidize the gas fees for those users and so that's an example like a first step right that come exactly and that's like something that we're looking to expand and to continue to experiment with is how can we use mechanisms like that because obviously you know there there is a cost to the network and you know the future hopefully people will recognize the benefits outweigh the costs of things like gas and whatnot but until then there are things like meta trends to sort of offloads take some that pressure off when we use a side trust or yeezus IBM unit that's one thing we're talking about any size of all difficulties on the engineering perspective because when you the question for our brother yes sir and you have a lot of other issues with that you can have a lot of overlap work on work and somehow it's a very hot issue but if somehow it can make a precious more specific and go feeling them with I setup have your few options with a broad scope that would really take a lot of times I've said well that would be like between or even a hundred of tasks that are going to be completed and I don't need to order them and more so in a few minutes or most of the hours I can make a contribution that I am very sure that it's going to your proceeds and very good musical traditions or what your guys are awesome it's much more secure for me to contribute with a specific subject since my to enterprise for a very broad interpretation so breaking out to the prostitute were specific counties that have my more specific criteria so yeah just developed on this point I think God the issue is is working within the creative field as far as about me absolutely well I think if you guys came to the front of the room and said hey guys gonna do this app for free everyone's going to do it as soon as you put it like that value as soon as you want consistency in our thinking and I probably have you ourselves so five dollars makes me feel to pack up all flow whereas you say hey do it for free at the dump all about it sure I think everyone be working right now I'm sad about these conversations so maybe if you kind of go back and look at what type of times are right too late absolutely geared towards bunkies and what it doesn't really work in that mindset and that's like something that we're trying to figure out yeah right that's something that like I I want to say first of all that I like love hearing all of you guys because it's insight into into how involved the product and how it weekend no it's it's a firming to hear you guys echo the same skepticism that I have towards the platform that I built it right for things like you know competition style anything really and what you know is it how do you make that fair and you make it fair how does it apply to specific skill sets does it work for some a number of these are all questions that were to ask and that's why we're defending the ark in particular is kind of shifting our focus less on to be less on the sort of like competition style like freelancing platform and more about like engaging with communities and getting communities to incentivize their community members to participate in some sort of collective collaborative action that sounds different than something like a fiber you know which is like pay five bucks and you get a logo that's not what we won't found this to be and that's not where it does not not do not the direction that values and so that's where you know if you have a chance this kind of I'd love it if you guys could go on and just check out some of the projects that we've done that are more like community oriented and getting you know partners and communities to work with us to incentivize immediate numbers to do things that [Music] this you know this exercise in particular does resemble a little bit more about like competition kind of thing part of that comes from the fact that we die of like sort of this restriction this like a workshop type of event and so that's not necessarily we're not necessarily saying that that's our case yeah so what if we just get paper and some stuff and hair stuff just throwing out things and that man our say okay this is what we come up with maybe that's not you just get your hands dirty and do something yeah well you have a week to do that and if you don't have a week because I have a very chair official yeah you know I don't know if everybody here has all week to spend tonight but I would love to spend now in however some people who've gone with creative solutions and yet we're absolutely votes and for the people who want to continue to engage in their content conversations around these problems like I'd love to continue talking to you about that stuff I that's a little problems that we're trying to solve and they're harder and there's no clear answers and so I really appreciate everyone's to build on what I killed said I agree a hundred percent and I agree with him as well I would do this a breakout brother and you're probably put in on the right on the wrong perspective like IQ was right saying that if you put a price on it you're making that kind of an insult you should maybe focus on the intrinsic motivator like give something beyond the money like credit I don't know thank you are going to put somewhere the visibility of somebody who got found of the solution that it's maybe for designers that is entering the space right a better solution than five bucks right right also in this space we are like to have the designers and we know all each other it's a hyper technical space and we know that you need to know a lot do you need to have study a lot so it's a very specific kind of designer that can tackle these questions that you have so it's for specialized designers and again if you put a price on it to your pricing and prom until you put the right price the goal and doing it this way was to try and get people that aren't necessarily that don't necessarily fall into that category and so you know we wanted people to come and participate in to help to think about these problems with us who maybe like first time doc users or but who do run into these problems who maybe have limited experience with with doubts but have run into these problems before and have thoughts about the good kind of said sorry which one it bill from bill Trent Cameron and I running a conference in five months in New York and if there are any designers who would like and it's sent you for a rally program that fits what you think is right we are completely open to an experiment in February this year in New York and so if you think we can do something that's better than five dollars or zero dollars please tell us because we would love to run about the program during an FTA NYC it suits what a really what the community thinks is right yeah sure thank you thank you thank you yeah let's try cool with that I think we'll just kind of let you guys go if you stay the discussion around things like pricing and fair rewards and things like that so let's what would be the best way to do that anybody help to top of our heads some kind of slack channel or telegram group or something like that I know there's everyone's and a million of those but this is all of this feedback is valuable to me and I am interested in hearing it and collecting in it so let's put even think redeemeth he wrote a book on this that's right you're right it's called drive autonomy mastery and purpose those are the three drives especially for creative and kind of tasks for which he proves also that research proves that motivating through extrinsic motivators like money is wrong you will not get the results as if you are using intrinsic motivators which is why a most interesting you should look for other rewards Australia could enjoy the bounty slap so if you go to the bounties site actually that would be great place to do it but I am actually gonna do yours but you're getting nothing I'm in a bit of a bounty to continue this conversation and just how people that want to participate and then there's also you have the option to join our slack which is like a community's life at the that the Baptist he has and we'd love to engage with you about these kinds of difficult problems earlier Beryl expound the camera I think and we recognize you know this was a very thoughtful discussion we hope you recognize we are operating within the constraints of the conference schedule and that throw a little bit of the structure are and planning this to be a week-long kind of a synchronous thing as opposed to a dedicated in-person session we'd love to spend to spend that time - like I said before we are gonna be here so you know grab one of us to spend some time together if you are interested we really look forward to seeing what people can come up with and appreciate everybody's participation relax before people think the room even right at the prompt on the floor my lesson on the suffix [Applause] you
