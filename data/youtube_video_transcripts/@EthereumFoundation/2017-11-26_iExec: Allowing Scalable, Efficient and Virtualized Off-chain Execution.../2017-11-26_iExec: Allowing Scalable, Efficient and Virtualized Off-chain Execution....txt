okay so thank you today I'm going to present you or solutions for a efficient and scalable on option execution for arbitrary application for aetherium so we are I exactly I'm fed up so first let's thanks and give the be close to the team because they worked really hard to be ready for their country and having this release ready some of us are here we are at the booth just over there at the the outside of this of this conference room so we all know about 15 people in yo in front and we are going to be a little more formal joining us by the end of this year so that's a wonderful team and I'm really proud of them so what we are doing at I exam are doing the etherium based decentralized cloud computing which means that we are using the aphelion blockchain to create a decentralized marketplace for cloud computing resources so those computing resources that can be what you typically found in a cloud so servers applications and data datasets and so we are using the theory on blockchain to advertise and project those are computing resources so you can figure that a sort of Airbnb for servers but without Airbnb and of course in this case this is the blockchain that creates those are peer to peer interactions between the users and the providers so having a decentralized cloud why does it matter for two main reasons I would say the first one is that we can see that this conference there are more and more new decentralized application it is coming a new a decentralized economy and so we now need a natural infrastructure to support those new application that's the first reason and the second reason is that is this is decentralized cloud the infrastructure is going to be very different it's going to be distributed and probably compared to the essentialist cloud we're going to have many advantages because a marketplace not only going to be much cheaper it's going to be distributed that going to be greener and certainly more efficient because the data are going to be closer to the to the consumer or producer so what are the the applications we are targeting first we are looking at the blockchain base distributed application the Dubs so the application that executes on the blockchain and you know that the etherium virtual machine offer very few computing capacities to those application the processing is very low it's extremely expensive for storage and computation and so they need option computation to have an actual I mean to be a really important application the second category is what we call the legacy application those are these up the application running now on the cloud that would eventually come to infrastructure because we can offer a better price per price performance ratio so here we are thinking of applications such as simulations machine learning finance 3d rendering and so forth and the next category are those applications the data as close as possible to the origin so people talk about the de Kooning that fog or edge server computing so with the one of the key the fundamental point in the protocol is the exact tokens called RLC so this is a pure utility token this is the way people can enter the network and use the computing resources that I need is decentralized cloud and this is also the way provider for resources or application are being paid and this is very important also because it allows to create incentives in the protocol and that's something that is really new compared that can be eventually an advantage compared with the existing cloud and the way we're doing this so we should this token on my net and elastic freedom 2000 17 so the roadmap where we are now so we started about six months ago we are now the first version of Apple you have i exac so the way when you create a distribute in is hot switcher it's a kind of a chicken and egg problem do you first start to have the machines and then in the network and then you try to find some application to run on this machine or do you first start to with the applications and then once you know the application you then you can create a relevant architecture so when we design this roadmap for i exac we design it by starting with the application and particularly with the Dubs and then later that we come in next May or next June will open the network to the servers so it means that at the moment you can push any applications but they are going to be executed on all machine so you somehow you have to trust us but later on in next June it would be any machine that can compute any applications so we are very pleased today because we are not seeing the first version of AI exact and it's called a wonderer so the way we are naming the exact version we take characters from the Chinese novel what imagine so I don't know if you know this novel I love it it's a story of people who robbers rebelled against the central authority in middle a China and here the one who writes the number 36 and among the durable so this Russian one it's basically a software development kit that allows you to deploy your application on aetherium and i exac so I'm going to present you how it works so this is a video but really I encourage you to to try the tutorial by yourself by yourself it's much more fun than watching a video so what you see here is actually a screencast of it's actually a screencap of a webpage and so you don't have to install anything to do the tutorial you just visit the webpage and the tutorial is about six I mean from ten to a half an hour depending on what kind of test net you're using so when you use gear so so DSD so first you install the SDK that's very similar to traffic so if you are used to troffer you will find that it's exactly almost the same then we are here with this tutorial we are playing with a toy application of course it's factorial but if you are using when storing the SDK on your own machine you will be able to use any kind of application so when we start we first get some ETA - just to be able to deploy a contract we're using a function which is called I exact deploy so I exact deploy those two things at the one hand it combines all the solidity smart contract we will deploy it on inferior and the second thing that it does is that it it compiles it it pushes your existing application - I exact and what you've just seen here it's the application what it has been deployed and i exac so now what you will see here is that we are going to to use the application I use you user so for doing this we first retrieve some RFC tokens we allow the soap the contract will span those documents and what we're doing now that we submit a Java so once you submit a job you can see that I'm going to stop here you can see that so when you submit a job the job here is being computed this is why you see pending and pending so it has been accelerated but of course it takes a much more he can take more time and when it's done so this is the house of the transaction that you got from the smart contract and once it's done you can see that you you finish the job and this this is the result of the of the computation and you can see on the Explorer so this is an explorer we provide to see what's going on between our chain and off chain and you can see the result of the computation in the smart code track or you can retrieve it using our or a command line tool so what is the deployment strategy for on the route so what you have seen now is that it's running now on Rob stone and an order test net so we are going to deploy it in the coming weeks so first we deployed the SDK with on application the next two weeks we are going to create an app store so that it makes the application for the end user much more user-friendly because at the moment they have to interact with the spa contract and later on by the end of the year we are going to deploy this app store on main net which means that developers using the I exact will actually be able to earn IC tokens so what happens under the hood what we do is that those computations are actually executed on distributed infrastructure so we called worker the machines that joined us in hospital jointly this network and that provider our CPU time to execute the application and so we organize those workers in worker pool a little bit like you have my nerves and my nurple it's exactly the same way the same idea but here any worker can execute any arbitrary application are not just mining and what we do is now that we have an Oracle that looks at what's happening at the blockchain on the smart your smart contract and each time there were the Oracle detected as at reduction is market right it's exactly the corresponding application on the workers so for version 2 it means that any computing resources can join the network and also of course it causes a lot of of issues in particular with respect to a security and so since this September we have launched an official reserves program that has started very well actually so we're working on two things one is proof of contribution which is basically a conscious protocol to verify that the execution that went off Shane everybody agrees that the computation is OK before proceeding to the payments that's one and the second is some security reserves that we are doing to protect both the application at the remote machine so actually proof of contribution is done by a PhD student Adria who were with the student at economic volume for more long-term perspective we think that we are really lacking some good experimental tools to understand the performance of those blockchain based a distributed system so we are starting PhD thesis in collaboration with a lab in France which is called a lawyer and those people are really expert in emulation of very large parallel dispute very large distributed system sorry so why do you want to do emulation because it allows you to do experiments but with an existing software stack so it's much closer to the reality than just doing simulation so it's not only for us I think it will be very interesting also for the film community to have such such tools basically you can test your software very rapidly on tens of thousand virtual nodes so some words about proof of contribution so we started this in September about we now have no real solutions it's based basically on a stacking and reputation so how do I come up with a very interesting protocol it's very simple basically the idea is that for each execution you submit you associate this execution with a confidence or threshold and so workers they have both a reputation and reputation is gained according to their past work so the task succeeded or not and they also have to stick some money to stack some token and so what we do is that each time we receive the sum results we compare the results and we compute a new confidence threshold and we can pass this to a short then the result is accepted by the submitter and so task it duplicated or replicating as long as the confidence threshold is not met and so at the end what you have is workers who behave correctly in this case they receive the payment and some we did wrong because maybe they try to steal some money in this case we punished we punish them we take that stack and we distribute the stake amongst the workers we did correctly so the good thing with this protocol is that it's actually very simple so it's simple to implement and then to verify also and it would be also simple to optimize so at the moment Audrina is doing the performance evaluation and we are quite happy with these these early results the other thing when you compute when you do an execution on a machine you don't trust is the security and so there are two aspects here so once the sandbox sandbox thing it's the technique that protect the workers from the application so imagine the applications of virus what you want to do is to execute this application in sort of a restrain an environment where you control what the application is actually going to do so this is something that is not you take this for us actually there are many ways to do that can be a kernel level or virtualization basically here the main issues are more with respect to deployment how is it going to be deep to be installed by the machine join in the network the second thing that is renew the second thing is how you're going to protect the application from the worker who don't trust the machine how the machine is going you know that there can be some privacy issue so up to know we had no solution for that but since since some time there is a new solution that appears it's called an clave and particular thanks to Intel as our new instruction set that that are no deployed and entire process holes we don't have a solution for that so an in clave this is basically a memory space that is for you you executor application and even I mean even root on the machine even if you have privileged access on the machine you cannot access to this memory because fully encrypted and the way to decrypt the memories in a situation mat in the processor so what we are doing now that we're evaluating two solutions to execute our application within an app claim one is called as Korn something that has been published at the West di dis Europe and this allows you to run and Linux container Indian clay there is another solution that we are looking at called a graphene as IG's the same idea but instead of container it relies on library OS or a microkernel it's almost the same thing fuel so a couple of things that are coming in the very next future just after Def Con we're going to run and ask me at freaking ready then we are going to participate to the supercomputing conference even though we all know it could talk you and see we still have those big machines that that you have a super computing to be in Denver Colorado we are going to organise a Serie of meet up starting with volume so that people can get in the technology and use that and start to develop their own application by being December hopefully the App Store for distributed application will go live will go live and so you will be able to publish the application this our App Store by December we also going to launch ad app development challenge the idea is really to to give bounties to developers so that they can proposer some cool applications and we will be really happy to support them and by the next year so we are going to not show another program which is di exact Summer of Code I don't know if you I mean our google Summer of Code that same ID so it allows students you know everywhere on earth to work on any subject related to a decentralization so it's not only for exact it's for everyone okay so as a conclusion we've been really happy to present you this first step for I exact hope you will try it meters where we have a booth and happy Def Con happy I king [Applause] [Music]
