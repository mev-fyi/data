[Applause] [Music] and there's a bit of this I'm excited it's not seeming to be and I want to share something and these are not building new markets in the arts they're covered three broad topics in stock ideas around new kinds of property rights and the meat of it will be around generative economies new ways to generate and co-create work together and the final one is a bit in the rear detector which is seeing markets as a medium for us so as far as such the camera there's been a lot of amazing stuff that's been done in the sense of entirely positive and it's not doing some of the things have been done so far in space inside secondary sales which is awesome big crowd funding mechanism tecna's Asian decisive do a bunch of people have written like in the spectrum like Rob Myers intensity no he's not from further fuel to rely difficulty amazing things so Lewis son with intellectual property intellectual property as is as we understand it today we all have this idea that whatever we creates eventually goes into the public domain this this is for copyright the case eventually making us forget to do the probably the main activism start lobbying and then we'll say the principal payments babies are privately exploitable for a while and then becomes being able to be exploited by a line in the market now the way we design this is that we kind of guests how people should be with such intellectual property because of copyright depends where our world but maybe thinking the u.s. it's like after you died last seventy years or something like that say it's pretty arbitrary think about it so there was some new proposals with regards to asset property ownership by lane while an area personnel from other radical markets that proposed different ways to property rights was initially targeted towards that anymore I think it would be a party to natural property as well which essentially creates a market for the ability to private exploit intellectual property and if it's not being partly excluded because back into the Commons and back into the cons and this kind of property rights is called Harbor gay rights it's named after our harbor and though it's not part of your rights or hamburger rights its Hardware the rights so this guy invented this model where it situates as follows once you own the property whatever it is it's been in this case of symmetrically you have to always specify sale price upon which someone can buy it from that corner but they can't choose like five billion dollars as a price because you have to pay tax my basic request you sent so it means that might give you the price goes towards a level which is fair market fair and water pricey but the person that owns it and any points on I can buy from them at their posture the person has an owner constantly re-evaluating prices there isit so I thought this is a really interesting idea it's perhaps not readily available in the current traditional world but why not try create something like this for digital art visual art relate concern when I use this beautiful thing called blockchain material to allow us to experiment with us so I thought let's try this out in a creative particle this artwork is always on sale and that is the actual artwork itself and software referential I created it and I launched it in march/april and there was interest in the art work and it's so available to be bought and it's kinda valued at around forty thousand dollars and the great thing about this model is that while I started it is a like the secondary set of model where every sale the artwork generates really for the artist and this is any second I earn revenue from the fact that some of the sizes of all the disputes will connect so this is an interesting model and since then other people have started using this model in other domains such as conservation like your own digital writer and the money you pay gets given to rather conservation center spotlight and hard piece but what's interesting about this model and why part of the rights were created in Christmas is it asks the question what things ought to be owned in the comments and I think that's very it's particularly interesting in the case of etherium because when you look at it here and we often design markets for multiple participants to enter and exit as they wish so the question becomes what can we build an oddity on that is related to part in the pasta me theorem that they're an interesting experiments related to this I don't think many people might remember this experiment but it was running on a theory but it's called the universe explodes and it's a book it's a book where if you have a copy of the book there's like a few copies of the book if you have the book here of the right to remove some words and write some new words in the book but you there's there's you can only you can add less words than you then you take out so over time its universe explodes and the book becomes essentially nothing so all versions of the book essentially gets written out of existence so people can buy assault book so that's a good example to me of what Commons art can be where the theorem you can buy this all specific versions of this book then we'll sell things like they some maps which is famous on the internet for comments are everyone this isn't available to both and in its specific business but none of this criterion maintenance is both such a way that the people who co-created this could actually learn anything from it it's just a collective experience but with things I cover the text to the process only made specific sections of the things that you could buy sell and participate and co-creates value together then there was also projects in the space things like Solaris which is creative which is pretty fascinating I think it's so very unexplored the validity curve creates always together both collected universes and we seen in almost any popular media production there's fanfiction so much too much fanfiction and the press fan fiction is part of the cabin of the story hasn't really been done so much but also just ability to send people listen symbolize the co-creation of part together and collector storytelling so I think that's small space that's largely unexplored the next one I might have fun which is the meat of this talk is the production of generative economies in art and I think the most important thing is we have this economic incentive engines that we both my aetherium that could use and we could use incentivize people generate algorithms to make us go find interesting part interesting patterns exists in this you know adjacent possible space and what's been done so far is this people that happen some of the sex which is funny to say and it's the following kind of manic spree generated its water generated and then final one which is slowly being done is the standardization of these kind of generations the one of the first ones was the protocol program us I'm sure some of you might be familiar with this interrupted months there were about 10,000 of these created but they were done Randy so this has different parts of the Mesa Cryptococcus had put together and then it was Reese so in this generative artwork that was pre generated what Atlas was a similar project by the same guys we're in a created five 3012 generating apartments but what they did here though was kneelin different was that the action the code to produce the hard work in this one hundred bits off so if you take the specifics even put this there is a solidity code that will generate these pieces apart so there's no separate file that doesn't like it it's the representative our group is actually all in solidity then there is a similar project for generative which also uses similar thing to what Alice uses take compositions based on a specific cache and then there is project or Crooker which kind of took input from craft a case where you would have animate characters in able to be combined and bred into new anime characters and use machine learning models to generate those new versions about these anime characters so then this case is started combining the fact that if you have one of these you can generate new ones before I get to the holy grail there's another component that's been started which is the ability to use these collective organizational models doubts to basically send less people to produce Commission artworks to be created so given in the idea there was a doubt chakra sorry that condoms at Osaka experiment there's also other ones for : Alamos also tell them she they're several thin ones trying to talk we're essential people who manage good and Commission any artists anywhere in the world to great words together and when he's assault some of the money goes back into the doll so people could choose proposals to create parts together now when you take generative economies machine learning that Albert of the new generation aren't provided with dolls you get when to train the body a few articles AI art does this is where it gets fun and weird so essentially some of the first designs this one design I made called eponymous it's there was a prototype boat and youth Berlin was here or essentially is there is a a doubt that creates these digital artworks generally already and then pays people to improve this algorithm so over time you have new harbors we produce and it would incentivize software developers to upgrade to the uses in progress perhaps the most interesting one needs to be a visit production if you integrate its Lily Lily when it comes to clovers which is really great just these pictures that you see we feel familiar with is finished any games of a fellow or reverses depending what you call it and because there is many other vices minion states of this game you collect the various ones and because it generates interesting patterns you could find either the most sought-after ones or the symmetrical auspices we are humans we like patterns but what's great about this example is that it's advises people to run these simulations on their computers to generate some user burdens and it has a both an economy of a planet where it incentivizes people through a Dalek system using monikers so super super great experiment and it's also really fun I think they did a really good job with the user experience where they send advise people to monies things to collect is interesting pieces of work so this is like the start of something great so I'll combine everything together to get quite interesting outcomes not when you combine all these things together there's no one is missing this is where people like Jean Cogan who created machinery for artists started buying all this companies together and added one final piece which is the ability to add a philosophy of mind and arguments that he created and its profitable Abraham the AI is with an amazing medium pieces that this was describes a small project and what it is you have digital art of the economics machine learning and artificial intelligence and a philosophy of mind to combining together distinction in a quick as he describes it which is more palatable version and artists in the club higher versus red philosophy of mind comes in he said the machine learning or the the generative algorithm is federated so it's not one person owns the mind this artist so it's scattered among main computers and when hard works are generated they are good together in by these different sets and model keeps be improved such that over time you have this artist great artworks software developers is proving the smartest is making money for the people involved and it ends up being - artificial artists so - extremely extreme class today I think this is a holy grail of ideas together where I hope in the next five years we will see the first fight is that that lives up there that is salt a few million dollar artworks that we don't quite understand it's quite a fascinating idea so even my existence is for me you can visit go discuss gene comes from the machinery world so if we're trying to get this appears in the Crypt economic space it's gonna get quite interesting and then the final part which is perhaps put stranger kind of requests one daily request but I think it's interesting space to explore which is looking at markets as potential medium for just because of the fact that in an area we constantly deal with transaction display recall transactions so it fits adapted Sasaki Network recording the transaction and everything is about finance everything you have to do you have to pay those boys and market an area but we rarely has markets being seen as a part as a art medium mostly because we tend to see it as that hit them it's a it destroys the value of art sometimes where they will see there's a transaction to this experience and deeds that use experience but I think in that we can also create their own experiences and what's interesting what's interesting is that many people might not realize this but there is a lot of interesting things to see markets and obviously the first one that we are quite familiar with analysis in our books people like these words for these packets ascending climbing over the head and shoulders the various forms of like clouds that you can turn various later it's a terminology that you can see and people don't you see normal technical nuts and these things they get creative this is a dinosaur movement which is by fighting and then there's also just form for using markets as protest in South Africa there was a company that was litigated in state capture and it when was done the company got the visit but you could still trade in it through life shares in the science of the sky for yellow like screen this company formed in South Africa and sonic training this beautiful continue with a company in practice for he actually got sued because like practical information and then and then like this defining one is an experiment that I did and always thinking is like endings kind of forms of art experiments you sometimes wonder if it just being pretentious day but in this case our were just interesting to try so my question was could it prediction market the art so it's a prediction market itself so I create a running over and ask the community is this prediction market part and the outcome would be if people say yes it would be our who doesn't know become PR it ran for about months not a lot of people participated but there were people participating in this the final outcome was yes people the people that participated the limits are but the order could be any thought that this was not a written question or getting that question so they decided to mark it as be better so during the question itself is embedded like questioning that may be asking you this is the case so now it's just a fun experiment that I would do it this way that is are then the final the faulty parts is where you combine the market process to create art one of the interesting ones was the network of harness creating is part during the channel so the channel ocean is yeah the rising the English and they buy now price coming down in a Dutch motion when these two meet in the middle that's the price that someone pays for this Marquis but what's interesting in their experiment is the art didn't exist before the Roses started so during the process of the neshamah auction the artwork was created because this buying all price comes not in the plan took about two hours for the ocean to compete and in that two hours this one but bunch of artists together created this artwork and when it was bought through shared among all the artists so which is the interesting process where during the market process artists actually created and then there is also an experiment from the convergent team which essentially created bombing curveball ports which was a strange experiment where you could buy a piece of a space when it's under the line and the bonding curve which is the price doesn't know what making man ISM it might be in this but I think it's just a good example of experimenting with ways which you can do by part and markets and psychosis and perhaps in through that way maybe take control back over the narrative of Marcus's being necessary completely negative towards parts you know that is that was so worried about not going over time that I was I went across life I think that time for like one question if anyone is interesting to or feel like saying that this means maybe [Music] DMT oh yeah I mean obviously inordinate spirit artists all about it beforehand inside for me it's just at the end of the day art is just another foreign language right so we try to convey something in in specific form and sometimes language does not do that so sometimes we need to make music to say something sometimes we need to make means to say something sometimes we need to write the middle finger onto metal analysis to say something so yeah that's that's my most minimal definition yeah [Music] Oh yes sir that's part of the process like once it's SP creative people going like this I'm going to be the mix like brilliant part work or it's going good yeah I'm gonna some policy you know the artist beforehand it's yeah it's more like it's more like when you have this kind of generative algorithms if you just run in the process because it's because you should deterministic if you put specific input in again specifically so in that sense the mind of the artist is known before it it is written in stone so to speak so in the case of philosophy of mind is where it is certain input it would not necessarily know what the heart would be a toy itself so in generative algorithms there is no space currently where you would be able to say that like you would know you will not know what the outcome would be in terms of math yeah it just off ages mercy because it's very learning like your office gates the process enough there not one person in this process one note in this process would be able to like know what the thanks a lot in order to look like it's only when you bring all the pieces together that you will see this is what was created so it's to the venue to say philosophies Mike but it's just like the people that participate wouldn't necessarily know what the this [Music] meet share knowledge is this serve this country on these topics visit much platforms that have their communities these kind of communities I think would be great if there is actually like sexual one of the shares indices there could be I may just have fun [Music] multiple there's not kinda familiar but they might be home I've seen it [Applause] you
