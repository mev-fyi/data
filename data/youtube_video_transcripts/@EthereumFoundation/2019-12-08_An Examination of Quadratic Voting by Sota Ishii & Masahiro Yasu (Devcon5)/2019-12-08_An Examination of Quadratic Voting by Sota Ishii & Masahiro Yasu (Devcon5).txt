hi everyone I welcome to Japan are you enjoying Osaka oh yeah sounds great today I'm gonna talk about new voting systems and I just want to tell one one just one simple key message today which is read trade our voting system for beta one such as majority judgment and quality voting also changes world to a better one and before I give my presentation let me introduce myself quickly my name is Masahiro yes please call me masa and I found it Alice in 2017 which is a social media using ether and blockchain and I'm also in charge of the radical exchange Japan chapter which is created by Glenn wave the famous books author radical markets I think most of you know about erotica markets and our company is also researching mechanism design with famous economist otakus a guy from keio university which is one of the most famous private university in japan to create Alice as decentralized as possible so that's why I'm looking into the new voting ways to to create our service more decentralized one so today before I introduce my new voting ways I want to ask some questions to you why did brings it happen also why was George W Bush elected as a US president in 2000 us pray yes president election although our goal was recognized as the best candidate I think there are many reasons for that but it was due to the current voting system majority rule having huge defects for example people can't reflect the strengths of their preference also easily result in a spoiler effect I will explain what spoiler effect later and it's relatively easy to manipulate as well so I want to introduce two weather alternatives to the majority rule first one is majority judgment and second one needs quadratic voting so what's multi judgement it's this is the image of majority judgments so it's like this instead of choosing one option voters give a skull to every available option on x-axis you can see the options and on y-axis you can choose how much you like each option and after voting you can calculate the medium of all options and the option with the highest median winterbolt a majority judgment guarantees the contentment of the majority of all voters and it also prevents the spoiler effect which is one spoiler candidate in an election draws the draws boats from a major candidate with similar politics in case of 2000 US president election do you not remember Ralph Nader his sudden came up and he ate the bolts of Al Gore so as a result accidentally George W Bush won so you can prevent this spoiler effect by using majority judgment and the second important way is quadratic voting both robot with credit so if you want to by one boats then you have to consume one credit and that the costs of the price of votes increases quadratic quadratic re for each boat so if you want to put two then you have to consume for credit and three four nine credit and the option with the most amount of votes wins so cuban voters are able to express how strong they feel about a certain option and i i've read many documentation about credit reporting over magic judgment but there are very few use cases so we actually try to use them on our service so we use majority judgment on a lease for choosing a new category alice is a social media soul which has which has a category on top page so we use multi judgment with choosing a new category and also we use quadratic voting for choosing main strategy of alice in 2020 I don't tell the the detail outcome here because it takes a lot of time but I'll share the summary paper which is created by totaku Sakai the The Economist I introduced to you so just I share the good points of those voting weights first about a module judgment which is quite simple so you don't have to explain what is majority judgment to voters also it has high resistant to manipulation and it also sketches a picture of users overall preference as by product and the last point is very huge marriage for me which is result is compatible to border rules which is also a famous boating way or majority rule so you can compare the outcomes and decide on one with more confidence I think this is a few huge mate and also the good points of coded voting is it's all so simple but you need to explain a little for voters because there are no way to consume your credit point to vote now so but it's really simple as well and it can reflect the preference of a minority that has the largest interest in the particular poll glenda the also of radical markets also emphasizes him in his work and it makes voters think more because it has kind of gaming factor so resulting in people taking the boat more serious so in conclusion majority judgment functions much better than other voting rules such as majority rules so implementing is relatively easy and as the purpose of a platform the excel in for the result gives is also a nice purse plus and it's one of the greatest voting systems not only practically but say logically according to Professor guy and Craddock voting provided an interesting outcome more difficult to implement compared to module judgment but worth trying depending on the poll subject and especially beneficial if you want to give a power to minority so from this product our city of soda will talk about the length of the presentation konnichiwa uh hi I'm sorta ishi CTO of the artists and today I intended to talk about some technical topics however it's not so difficult for experienced engineers the weird boat in contract actually there's not nothing to say just period that's all so today I'll talk about the following show three obvious said majority is not either boating system however there's no silver bullet in other words there is no airtight alternative is the hawa I wanted to argue that we engineered children social choice theory including voting systems there are a lot of voting systems and each has its own strengths and weaknesses majority majority judgment and cold quoting are just one of many options it's accept their own proper purpose for charge fortunately just a huge amount of brilliant knowledge in this area I just started to learn about this field this year but I believe the doing so can help engineers like us after reading an e-book change a balance to achieve good system you have to understand what what we are building anyway it is interesting to note that there is a conference in this area called the NSF CEM decentralization conference which has been around since 1970 I'm sure imply implication of this centralization have a chance since then however it seems like in the latest conference they have also been discussing rock chain but I am trying to say is there is a lot of information out there to be studied so to our engineers in this region do consider leading up on the some social choice theory and let let's go over to build our structured government system our vision to empower the individual the user thank you to tick before we finish our presentation attracting to reduce the paper as I mentioned and this is a summary paper on multi judgment so you can learn many things about the magic judgments a good point and also a bad point so please take a look at it and I want to say a special thanks to Professor other Sakai so to conclude our session my presentation I'd like to share one story relevant to Japan about what happens when you use majority rule have you heard about our Minister of the cybersecurity anyone know he's 69 years old and with the best security policy why best because he doesn't use a computer also he said he has not ever used computer before and he also said he doesn't know what a USB is again he is our Minister of cybersecurity so this may happens in under current voting system I think this is fine and ironically the next next speaker is the IT Minister of Taiwan and also known as a genius programmer so I think see gonna talk about more detail about coders exporting and I really refer to it so please give her a warm welcome thank you you
