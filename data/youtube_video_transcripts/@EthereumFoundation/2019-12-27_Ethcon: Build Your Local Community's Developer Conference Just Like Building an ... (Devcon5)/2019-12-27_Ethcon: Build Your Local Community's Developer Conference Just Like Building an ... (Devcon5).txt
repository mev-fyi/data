[Applause] but the income yeah yeah so let's start so I see it let me say a non-profit developer conference run by folder volunteer so we are the volunteers so here's the who did that together at all yeah okay so the reason why we start it code is that first a Korean a developer Huntress is quite isolated from the mainstream 1200 community is because in politics by my language barrier and therefore we had nowhere to share our own research force in our own native language so and there is exist lots of conferences but without a real physical and chemical or need some people to say oh our products you really pulled us please how am i all talking like that so anyway so python is wired us to make the it code so we decided to make it a local communities developer and compress in a decentralized manner so we are all on - you're saying there's no owners systems like Jason means us or for us no ownership so we have some few principles the first one is it consciousness speak for a specific organization or groups first agenda and the second is it cannot be privatized or become a private organization and the third is in consequence of the officers campaign so what happened is that more than 500 developers are stated in Korea and 60 speakers including indirect panel currently and 16 individual donators donated around thousand more than ten thousand US dollars in including the f16 sponsor sponsor level in France and 11 million from this participating in this contest so this is what we have done and yeah so now let's talk about how to make your city's own income so first start small we only started with through the whole nine so I needed some view people with the hang out and just mailing and then the next one is about the beginning day so I recommend to choose an iconic place for developers so for Korean golfers having a talk at koi X is kind of an honor so it brought a lot of submissions and the base should be that we can were students a community because local community remember it is more important than a very some kilo speaker by the body and times entering water pressure support whole community anyway so fancy speech about that causes products good but sometimes speech balls are failures support more than them so please encourage people to share their experiences and because this is not the superstar scream conference and actually it's really hard so without getting your hands dirty anything happens so you should be ready for it so get your hands dirty and offline to make the process we have to get offline meetings and the third because it's very proud you make this conference activity like a club activity so drink beer and have some chicken together yeah so it make it like a community small so we do some package knowledge and treasure hunting and many other sponsor events and this is most important part of the because it's - so you should prepare the sponsorship back at least before month and the second you know you should know this post respond hiring and since once again hi and the thirst poster also was to be covered by the media and the media also wants to make one system a some years and so you should hop and and also you should have your media partners to cover the speakers because it will elevate your conferences authority and then the many of them submit you can get them more submissions from your local community yeah so it's all so let's build our local communities on either team ultra compress it comes just like building an officers together yeah thanks [Applause] you
