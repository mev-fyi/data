[Music] good afternoon everyone just waiting for the slice come up my name is John Garrett's I'm co-founder and CEO of oaken innovations formerly project oaken and I just want to start off by saying how excited I think I speak for the rest of our team when I say how excited we are to be here in Cancun at DEFCON 3 on this stage speaking to you and when I say you I mean the community that we've all been a part of for a number of years now and we're really excited to tell you kind of the story of oaken is what I'm gonna start with over the last year and then I'm gonna hand it over to Lex he's gonna take you through a few of the technologies that we've been building out and then we're gonna wrap it up with a video so again my name is John Garrett's I've been in the space since about 2014 very early on in etherium years one of the first projects I worked on airlock was on proof of concept three so very very early years from there I was able to secure a developer's grant a dev grant from the etherium foundation for embedded which was essentially taking the etherium client and porting it to ARM based resource constrained devices and that allowed me to start to build relationships in the community and many of those relationships are now my co-founders with oaken innovations this is our team we have a fantastic team I'm so proud of what we've been able to do in a very short amount of time many of you are familiar with Hudson Jameson but we also have Lainey Fisher James Johnson Lex and Daniel is the most recent addition shout out to F Lance Daniel was a recent hire we went through the process of Ethel ants and so shout out to someone else in the community that we've used their tools and has worked out very well for us so this is kind of the story of volc√°n about a year ago today you know the majority of us knew each other but we hadn't really worked together and so we got together about this time last year to enter into a couple hackathons the the kind of result of that was a judge's win with a hack ether camp and then from there we built on to a first place finish in the Dubai virtual blockchain govhack in first place was $100,000 all expenses paid trip to Dubai and our project there was a proof-of-concept that we referred to as Tesla and Tollbooth and what we were able to do is install an a theorem client in a Tesla and install an aetherium client in a mock Tollbooth to demonstrate the true period true machine to machine transactions with no human involvement that game does some traction from one of our partners initially Toyota Research Institute which we moved on to build-out proof of another proof of concept for peer-to-peer car-sharing and that was something that we debuted in May at consensus 2017 and essentially what we're able to do is installed in theory and Klein in the car connect that to a fob and through a series of smart escrow smart contracts rent out our short-term lease that vehicle and this is a all these proof of concepts that I'm speaking to our functional proof of concepts these are things that we have built out that are up and running you know not in a production environment but up and running nonetheless from there we've been able to be involved in a number of other projects I guess MIT Media Lab we're really working with Toyota Research Institute to start to facilitate some kind of an open blockchain mobility ecosystem and so we you know in the past we've invited other automotive manufacturers to come to the table and we've been at least successful in starting that conversation in we're based on a Dallas Texas so we have a strong relationship with a lot of the universities in that area as well were involved in an open data initiative with the Texas Department of Transportation or TX dot and we're also talking to a few Toll Road authorities both in the US and abroad we remember the trusted IOT alliance this is a we're very excited to be a part of this group there's a lot of active members in the trusted IOT alliance we're still kind of a small group but growing fast and ourselves we've been able to contribute MQTT T which Lex will talk about in a little more do tell shortly and if you if you're out there and you're working on IOT and blockchain and you're interested in becoming a member please go to trusted IOT org trusted - IOT org and check it out sign up and we'd love to have you on board and kind of learn more about your technologies so it's not my pleasure to introduce lex Shuang Liang Lex is our CTO and he has some prior experience Lex and I met in Guelph Ontario Canada which is close to my hometown and you know we we kept in touch after that initial like a connection Lex did some IOT internship work for eros industries which is now mon acts and joined the team just prior to the dubai event so please give Luxor round of applause yeah so our body so I'm from in Chinese liang shuang you can call me Lex and I got my master's degree in computer science at Temple University in Philadelphia so I'm glad to be here to introduce some of the technologies we are working on recently so yeah the person I want to introduce is MQTT trusted and the second wine micro tap and also we have a hardware security model we are working actively actively ways to use some secure hardware for the IOT platform yeah I'm qtd trusty these tragedies trust you the world of Mac MQTT so it's pitched down the iMac utt library and the history library MQTT is a very lightweight papa table based the machine to machine communication protocol is very popular for IOT applications it's designed for very low bandwidth communication for some sensors or tell my telemetry devices and the feature we want to bring into this machine to machine communication is from ECM global likely and unlimited the identity system and also it's trust see the without the centralized control and we can use beauty is it yes a algorithm to get the signature of the messages and embody the signature to send to send to the receiver so here is the flow from the sender side it put a plain message and I'm Q T DT library will build some packet like this it has from and to field which is based on the history address and we can we put the timestamp at the pro footage to see to put two summers content of the apparition of the message also the heat load and the sequence number and after that we'll use either the primary key of the user beam or Hardware tsukamoto to send message and put the signature into that message and at the receiver side each person can recover the address of the sender and pasted on some web Webster library serum library and it can checked checked' the permission of the sender from the smart contract also we can do proof of provenance of the data or access control paste down the identity of the sender so there some issues we want to solve from the library its interoperability there are some problems surface if the first man is signature can be messed up if the sender and the receiver use different libraries to stand on the recover the message and the second issue is this part of properties another standardized so we want to probably standardize this machine to machine communication scheme so it will be easier for your reader to talk with microwave are some talk with your car so they are all compatible with each other so because of these issues we want to collaborate with the community with tragedy the allergy allowance to build some standard for the machine to machine communication also boosts some semantic on top of the serum blockchain and this protocol so the next one we want to introduce the macro tab so you can see from name is small whirring of the decentralized application videos Raspberry Pi for our hardware platform but we can also put our stark to other embedded system like pickle porn and other embedded device so we assume like plan for the small contractor and up here first for the data storage and to MQTT library to support machine to machine communication so this is an example of the architecture we are working on from the top layer is a decentralization 4010 for IOT use case and we have three components it's the first one is the centralized data storage API and to transit machine-to-machine communication interface to the to the application and also the smart contracts so in the middle layer we have a peer prize but you can actually plug in other decent tragedy storage or libraries like swarm and so i'm qtg the extreme blockchain actually we we are trying to build like to support other blockchain larger forum and under the lowest layer it's a hardware abstraction layer we can step out Center data and hardware secure model as IOT wallet and here is the example of the Mahadev service to interact with user using the mobile web app so here you see boss has had access choose certain blockchain and IP iPads for these are storage but it's not like pure centralized infrastructure we still need some like server to offload the computing tasks of the impacted us to the servers here we can reuse MQTT broker on the server side also we need some server through uploaded like serum gateway and the IPF has gateway to support the country in the device so here you the real world example we build with to you top of the cache area you centralize the car sharing application so you can see it's not like a traditional server based design g10 paradigm is really like peer-to-peer didn't program all of the cars have our macro tab services rainy and they can communicate with each other through the qtg machine-to-machine communication and access to the smack contract so we have the video to show the real app the user experience later on I'll go quick very quickly about the hardware security module is we built this hierarchical model with requirements we want you for the IOT and production application first one is the way we want tamper-proof to pre when to the attacker like physically attack the device and we want to very secure key storage and we woke the key when we detect some attack intention also we want you to be blocked compatible a quick send using the hierarchy model and using and the signature compatible with Webster library or other serum libraries so here is our printer company accomplishments for the hard working model we can send offline transactions and we can send personal personalized the transactions also we have this nutrient library to access the functions in the hierarchical model so there are still ongoing work we actively the web like here we want we are developing the physical temper detection with collaboration with some hardware companies and we appealing this querque story based on the secure elements yeah today are like ongoing projects we are actively working on and we are like community driven and like to talk with developers if you have questions you can go to this website and stay tuned we may how more released like I'm Cody GT to the community thank you [Applause] thank you everyone so as Lex alluded to we've been in as much work as Lex has done honor on our back-end systems we've really been focused from the get-go on the front end and really making sure that there's a good user experience in fact some of this was born out of necessity for us to keep that user experience at a level that we're comfortable with and so we're just gonna play a quick video for you now this was first launched at Monday 2020 last week in conjunction with Toyota Research Institute and kind of gives you the our vision of the mobility future hello from oaken innovations we're excited to show you what we've been working on with Toyota Research Institute earlier this year we debuted our proof of concept blockchain enabled peer-to-peer car lease application at consensus in New York this application allowed consumers to lease a vehicle from a car owner using a smart contract on the etherion blockchain file storage on ipfs in a mobile application to lease and control access to the vehicle prior to our car lease model we developed a blockchain powered automated toll road system with connected cars this project 1 is the top honors among the entire world at the UAE international blockchain hackathon these applications allow for instantaneous remittance between the transacting parties they do this without the need for payment processors by using logic coded to a smart contract the hyper secure block team based IOT controls at a level of security not currently available on the consumer market all while reducing or eliminating the need for server infrastructure open innovations wants to give you a glimpse into the mobility future we envision we use the blockchain for application logic and data storage replacing traditional server infrastructure here we use the blockchain to store vehicle identity along with GPS now we add road and mapping data and allow trusted entities to update this decentralized data layer smart Road sensors can also feed this database this allows for a complete view of all vehicles and infrastructure with current construction and traffic conditions while allowing third party applications to be built on top of this data let's amend that vehicle data for lease or ride-sharing services this now allows consumer mobile apps for ride-sharing or leasing using this blockchain services layer in arrived share or lease transaction things get very interesting using blockchain technology instant value transfer and micro transactions are now possible within one smart contract transaction is instant remittance to several parties including the vehicle owner and driver insurance provider toll road authority and road tax entity why is this valuable the automobile owner and driver received guarantee an instantaneous payment of funds micro insurance policies for each rider lease transaction can be paid to an escrow contract then remitted to the insurance provider once the write is complete with the balance of that escrow going to the rider or lessee we can use an escrow contract for autonomous toll payments and even eliminate toll gates from the toll road infrastructure as we can prove the location of the vehicle using GPS we can even have smart toll road infrastructure where roads are only charged during peak hours as consumer behavior moves away from purchasing fuel and favoring paper ride mobility over vehicle ownership Road and Infrastructure authorities will face a shortfall of tax revenue that currently funds the construction and maintenance of roads included in the mobility transaction is a usage based tax - replaces lost revenue even short trips where a fraction of a penny is needed for Taxation all of these parties receive the benefits of instantaneous remittance all included in a single transaction user experience all without the need for payment processing intermediaries let's go further with this blockchain platform in an autonomous driving world we get to go beyond rider mobility into other applications solar energy production is highest from the sun is shining the most that's typically in the middle of the day energy demand typically spikes in the morning and then again in the evening time that solar energy production is weakest during low mobility demand times automated vehicles can store solar energy during peak production times then deliver that energy when and where it is needed also since we have the automobiles equipped with 5g connectivity we can provide a self-healing mesh network across large areas as well as a partition consumer Wi-Fi service all while the vehicles receive micro transaction reimbursements for sharing their internet connection thank you for your time and we hope you enjoyed our version of the blockchain powered vehicle future for more information please visit us at oaken innovations calm in blockchain - Mobility org you [Applause] [Music]
