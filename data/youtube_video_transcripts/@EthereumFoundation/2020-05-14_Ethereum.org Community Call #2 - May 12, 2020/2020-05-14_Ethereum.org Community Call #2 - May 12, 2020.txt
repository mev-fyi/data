and we are live all right thank you for joining the ethereal community call for those of you who I haven't met my name is Sam Richards I'm a web developer at the Deering foundation and I work primarily on a theory about org I'm also on the call as Josh Derek and team Kim who are contributors members of the team as well and you'll probably hear from them shortly so I sent a link to the call agenda and notes in the zoom chat I believe it's also on the calendar invite if you want to follow along and I can also share my screen just to go through some of these updates so just to give you like a format on the agenda today we're basically gonna spend you know ten minutes or so just given quick updates on what's been going on with etherium org since our last call and then really spend the majority of the time kind of opening the floor to open discussion from you guys what questions you have what feedback do you have what feature or content requests do you want to see on the site really hoping to use it as a time to get feedback from you guys so I will share my background noise on your mic and that sounds like someone talking in the boat I'm so sorry it's okay good to see you that alright yeah pretty sure so first up we're just gonna like cover some follow-ups from last time I'm one of the main discussions from our last community call and we're 25th was really around just like content suggestions primarily there's a lot of discussion around in at the yeoreum 2.0 page unfortunately I can't say that's live yet but we have made some pretty solid progress on it and are hoping to have that live within the next week or so and that should be a really high value page we've seen a lot of interest in that from the community pages that we did push live we have added and about aetherium org page which could check out that gives a lot of like granular look into what are the specific tasks we're working on what's next in queue what have we recently pushed the site just one more Avenue for you guys to follow along get an understanding of like who's behind this and how you could get involved we also launched an introduction to etherium improvement proposals and a page about the etherium foundation to help give some clarity between you know what is the difference of the etherium foundation versus aetherium itself and how that fits in we've also done a lot of updates to existing pages so yeah if you haven't checked out the site recently definitely encourage you to go check it out quickly going through updates on our end so we recently published a blog post last week you can check out the link here in the agenda that covers I'd say the bulk of you know what we've done over the past month but just to cover the highlights I'm happy one-year anniversary etherium org actually did relaunch just over a year ago crazy to think how far it's come and I think we got some really great plans for the next year so excited about that in terms of development updates that all cover just wanted to make note we've also started essentially publishing releases on the website so for you to follow that link to github here you can see like the pull request by Racal request updates that we're making to the site each week so if you are eager to follow along or add input create issues like this is a really good way to just see how we're progressing I would say the contributions we made that generated the most buzz the past month was definitely adding ipfs support to the website so any like that browser or even like a brief browser any browser that supports ens you can now browse the site at eath which is pretty neat we've also added a dramatically improved Site Search which makes it really easy to find any content that exists anywhere on our website you'll be able to search and find pretty easily lastly we did just finish a really solid content audit with a group of developers from the community we've dubbed these Tiger teams which I believe is a NASA term which is really just recruiting very specialized experts in this case it was various builders in the etherium ecosystem and got them to do like a deep dive feedback evaluation of the website specifically focused on developer content and onboarding and we got a ton of great feedback from those folks that we'll be pushing to the websites and I think the major themes that we took away we're just like what is pretty obvious in hindsight but really just focusing the content and gearing that towards user journeys so instead of just like a landing page for all developers creating a traffic control of sorts of like hey are you new and looking to get started here's where you should go and here's resources to get up and running with the etherium stack are you experience developer looking for specific tools here's a place you can go to to find the latest and greatest on that so more to come on that but wanted to give a shout out to the folks who helped us out there and if you guys are interested in ever like participating in one of these content audits it is something we're trying to do regularly so feel free to you know hit us up on Twitter I can drop in my email at the end of this and definitely don't feel free to reach out and get involved other major area I'll throw it over to you Tate Union but we've been having a lot of great progress on the translation program and we have some updates there you you thank you Sam can you hear me yep yeah thank you for contribution the translation program so I don't know like how many of you are already part of the translation program by I know the Jung is making a really great contribution in the French translation and we really appreciate ya like this we launched last October we data like a 23 language in its very org and I would like to expand our support to the other communities with a different language so yeah we set a goal for the quarter to supporting like over 30 language and yeah like we're looking for more native speakers of Vietnamese Thai vanish Norwegian Hungarian Finnish or Ukrainian so if you are interest to to join that will be very appreciative and yeah and also love to hear more feedbacks and opinions on the translation program so just briefly sharing our main focus at the moment as to recruit more volunteers from different language groups including the sample language that I mentioned earlier so I've been reaching out you the like regional communities and event organizer to provide a treat as our program in their country so East India and is Banco have been helping us a lot to spread the world in their community communication channels like Twitter and Facebook so it was very effective to recruit a few volunteers and we would like to connect with more community members that we don't have connection once yet so if you know any place Don's has it until reached out to me and another thing is to keep volunteers motivated and make them feel appreciated so as you know that remote volunteering work is very limited to show show our appreciation and keeping them motivated to continue their work so over the six ones that yeah a lot of people joined and like 80% of people contribute on the first version like that version 1.0 and yeah like now we only have like twenty percent of the participants and still keeping their contribution in their version 1.1 so I'm struggling to figure out how to debate them to continue their work so if you have any idea or feedback be Mariya appreciative great thank you tan and yeah just to give some context on like how big of an impact I think the translation program has so if we look at like the first three months of this year I'm at the org add a little over half a million visitors and we've seen the share of translated content just continue to rise and terms of like overall pageviews you know we started rolling out the program in August I think in October it was 3% of total pageviews by December it was 12% and now we're at a point where over 20% of pageviews on the website are too translated content so I think that really just speaks to just how important the program is at a whole and it's really exciting to see just how global of a community at the game has so yeah please feel free to reach out to us if you do have ideas or connections to like any organizations involved in technology or just you know information access I think if we can partner with the right communities like we could definitely hit our goal of translating 30 languages total you know by the second half of this year okay so last bit on the updates just looking ahead versus what we've done so far I would say the the theme is definitely just more of the same like we'll be focused on more translations of the content content updates and design updates to the pages that exist on the site and I would say we're really just starting to focus on and we've gotten a much better understanding of specific user journeys and like how to optimize towards those so what I mean by that is like initially we had this idea okay yeah we should talk about aetherium Wallis because people want to learn about that more and more we're learning hey we can actually like set goals around how many people actually like visit the website view the wallets page and potentially like download a wallet and get using it so focusing on like what our specific user journeys that people are trying to accomplish and like how can we enable them as easy as possible and start measuring against that so I think we're just starting to get a lot more intelligent about how we think about content generally on the site more new content I'd say a big area of feedback we've gotten from you folks on calls like this and doing you know feedback interview sessions is just the need for more native content on the site we have more control over the translations keeping that content freshen up to date so we'll really be focusing on how can we expand that how can we collaborate with more community members I think you know shout out to Annette who's also on this call I feel like a big success story here was launching the introduction to e ip's page I mentioned I mean that kind of happened organically in a telegram chat we're talking about ways that we could improve the EIP process some other community members suggested adding a page on a theorem org I created a github issue for it on our github and Annette volunteered to like lead with a draft of the content and over the span of two weeks you know a handful of us were able to draft the page share it on the github issue and eventually deploy to the website and now like I think that's just a great example of how community members can get involved and like solve a need and will definitely be thinking about you know how can we like continue to empower that how can we like create templates that just make it super seamless for someone to come in and nominate a page or actually draft a page itself and lastly along the theme of like looking for more translation program volunteers we're going to be thinking through like how what are fun and exciting ways that we can give contributors acknowledgement and like give them public recognition so one initiative we've been working on and hope to finish shortly is a collaboration with the po app or Pope I don't know how to pronounce it protocol Pio apt protocol which issue NF T's primarily for events so we're gonna be issuing tears of NFTE tokens to give to you website contributors and I think that's just an exciting way to kind of dog food the technology that we're working on and you know we like get people excited about oh I'm actually getting this tangible thing that I can show people and it's completely unique she's just wrote something in the chat have you considered get Quinn grants for translations and the languages you're looking for help in that's a really interesting thought you know we have so we've used git coin bounties a lot in the past for specifically development work and we've experimented with it a bit on content but a git coin grant may be an interesting take on it I was actually I was I was thinking about bounties actually okay got you you got you that's a really interesting topic yeah and I would be curious to kind of open the floor take you guys take on it I think what stuff is up until now like our translation program and most contributions on the site have been like completely volunteer based and it's been really great to see just like the number of people who have done it on their own like goodwill essentially like I think there's over 400 people in our translation project team correct me if I'm wrong so all those people have committed their time and energy for free if we were to suddenly create bounties I could see both sides of it I could see it's totally justified certain communities it's just harder to find people who have the time and energy and capacity to do this I could also see potential conflict where you know previous volunteers might feel slighted in a way of like hey I contributed this stuff for free and now all of a sudden these folks are getting paid to do so so well guess what you guys think about that you I should this note maybe a so just you know behind the scenes we we do work with a professional translation firm and so all the translations that are done by volunteers are also like quality controlled by a translation firm and even sometimes when there's like gaps in one that's mostly done they help us kind of fill in fill in the dots so it is possible that you know we might expand the use of that firm to to kind of get languages done more quickly we're trying to make a balance between you know we want to make sure that that the website is available in as many languages as possible so that it's more accessible but we also know that like being able to contribute to the site in this way is a pretty meaningful way for people to get involved in the theorem in the first place and so we want to make sure that there's you know people have the opportunity to be like oh you know I made a meaningful impact on making aetherium content available to my language community is the thing we wouldn't want to kind of stop happening so yeah providing additional financial incentives for our translators is something we're definitely looking into and would consider but it hasn't been like a media on the horizon but hopefully that background kind of gives you more context and how this all works any other thoughts on its plan Sam John I'm not sure if you have something to say I think you're needed right now okay I can't speak well there are occasional contributors there's a swarm of contributors who well who translated the site in many different languages but many of them now occasional and then you have two or three guys who do I think two or three guys who do most of the work for given a language maybe one maybe only one who do 80 but well it's a Pareto 80,000 twenty person you see and these guys who the man guys got to keep it good to keep them get to incentivize them and not only when an F T's or whatever but with well it's a hoop cage say you've got to have them interested to keep them interested so that they contribute more and financial incentive incentive motivation is well it's it's a small part of that the cage but it should be there too I think ok that's my point yeah thank you I think that's a really interesting perspective like I can tell you I frankly haven't looked into it to you and I don't know if you've done this analysis but looking language by language I would be interested to see to your point John like is it one or two people who are doing the large majority of the translation it probably is a few select people so I do wonder if yeah whether it's just engaging them one on one individually and just like making sure we're acknowledging them and like asking for feet back and getting them excited in some way whether it is you know public accolades or NF T's or financial incentive it probably is worth keeping those those like power users if you will engaged oh sorry and also no go ahead yes I I had a discussion with John last night about the translation program and yeah the Sam you're right that the high quality translations were conducted by a few or just one key translators and they usually complete the translation in a short period of time so yeah I guess they like a higher performance as yeah achieved because translators have more ownership and there was a responsibility for the project and if somebody already done this like one documents that they try not to involve and translate within the same document so I think yeah this is a good shoe fine like those key translators and maybe yeah like giving over like nothing incentive or the recognitions to those people I also these key translators you could give them as the tasks and huge events like translating the who's side etc will be committee evens but during these events you can detect the guys the new guys the new interesting guys who will well you want to keep and it's a detection system also right yeah I think that I mean that something that seems worth looking into and experimenting with like we don't know for sure what will be the ultimate motivator of these folks I think if anything it might be worth just you know reaching out to these like power users power translators interviewing them seeing what it is that motivates them like maybe it is payment of some form maybe it is like giving them additional responsibility like maybe it's like hey we saw you've done a lot of translations you've done a great job the professional service doesn't even edit your content because it's so great maybe we can somehow give them a status like give them the ability to review so that like they become the maintainer of the French translation and/or the Danish translation and that's even like a promotion of sorts that they could you know put on their CV it's something that shows progress on there and just an idea cool any other thoughts open questions discussions why are you guys here what were you looking to get out of this call what was exciting disappointing yeah really looking for just any and all feedback or input okay well um we definitely don't need to stay the whole time I would suggest we just ended early this month I did drop in my email at the bottom of the notes document I understand you know public zoom calls aren't always the best way to gather input from people if you do have ideas or feedback obviously like github issues are a great place to like you know suggest ideas and track progress of those but feel free to hit us up on Twitter email us directly whatever whatever makes sense to you and thank you guys for joining and really appreciate you getting involved John thank you for your translations I'm sure the French community appreciates your work yeah thanks fun it's great to you know we often don't get the actual meet the people who translate the site so we appreciate you joining the call it's good to kind of put a face to a username that I've seen in crowded before well tell you told me to come so okay it's a great suggestion awesome great cool thanks thanks so much thanks guys
