[Applause] we are from bullet projects from Warsaw Poland today we're going to entertain you by building and running some software on webassembly and all the golem infrastructure can I have a quick show of hands in the room I mean when the guests here only you are either current or former software developers like builders hey this workshop is for you guys and do remember how we all started remember how you started building your felt compelled and excited to touch their keyboards to write a computer program I know that when I started I was late by damage and I wanted to write the computer game on my 8-bit Commodore so I think what wait hey I've been playing a book on basic and and I just started writing simple if that statements and then that looks like a text Facebook it again it worked and I felt the trill for the first time years later I picked up C language which felt so professional to me and find and learn new syntax within the braces and curly brackets and it was you know it had a compiler and cycles like compile the Texan file that was so exciting and every time years later when I was picking all the other languages I I'm from thirty I felt the same thrill I mean I'm almost 40 now and I started trust language last year and they felt the same excitement with their new syntax and into sense being able to build something that the trusting words and what's a notice because we hope to be able to replace a lot of this is accepted with you guys here playing with webassembly and golem so we're assembling the Ascension is but seriously it is a programming it's most with mutated performance it comes with a form of binary form up the distribution here software it can be compiled from any language that the concept of it and today we're going to be showing brass language and it's posted under the sound or web accenting population but from C C++ from go and other languages as well I mean even heard of a c-sharp on biodiversity it is portable so the futon horse it comes with a sample T Mobile which is very similar to JavaScript funnily enough it's also very similar to Josephine and others I mean just like JavaScript broke out of the web browsers and music mechanic with no Dante s in the same way webassembly doesn't need to be run in the browser it can be run on my proper server site backends manner and this is what we are going to be demonstrating and playing with today on government and the word humble of itself and the other piece is a concept is a concept of this tool that is centralized marketplace for computing power so in essentially you're able to share your computing hour with others on your on your beautiful network what's important than the mean for us here is that since last released it supports the web ascending and running and we call it that she was mobile and what's also convenient for us today is that children has a lightweight erm so lightweight version which is called Gotham unlimited which is rid of the economy layer and it's meant for the trusted environments and such as the one he will be seeing here today and it also supports the G was new models so that's what we're going to play with today before we begin let's set ourselves in the moon can it has been denied okay so imagine we are not in 2019 we are here in Osaka in 2077 and we are at war we are the crypto resistance depending the free world from the oppression of the corrupt prove its corporate syndicates to exchange the ideas we celebrate our annual secret conference of the Society's greatest visionaries and fingers through gatherings of three months and free wills such as this is an obvious threat to the syndicate we've learned it's our culprits has been compromised and if you're likely to become a target where ever we expect long-range project which has been launched on the private islands in the Pacific Ocean but we are also defenseless our weights our technology are the ultimate defense join us they join the network leverage the computing power so that together we can outsmart the enemy and make a step towards a more balanced civilization who's with us today who's joining us today hey guys we are at your bananas the consistent bananas those of you who want to join the workshop like the handsome building workshop here welcome to join the network we birth a safe training boot camp environment we have a local network with there's a Wi-Fi there's lot of us are going to be more stable than the work right join the network over there and it takes you to the landing page of the of the workshop by the way this is also available online like from the internet so you're here happy to repeat those exercises with all the materials in your in your hometown those of you living walls we have been tracks here with all the content on the binary so you know throughout this may be quicker to tunnels is we will set up the Elizabeth cluster so we have a common pub prepared for you and you will be connected subjectiveness participates in the distributed computation on webassembly those of you who don't want to make coding session all right sit back and relax Otakon components on the ground the color provider two parts to join the network so that's your pc is actually posting there those of you who want to take part these notes the double image that contains the full development environment that is required for the session today that session will do play a my colleague here on the screen [Music] time to the tutorial now the tutorial has got one of the things you might not call it now but feel free to do this like play oh oh now for today's tents that night I advise you to do the work of teaching it so walking pace distracted essentially so every loss I just don't even taste any event you should be back on track and for those of you who are trying to join us the instruction and show me in the tutorial [Music] in the tutorial have you guys there's nothing to this okay so it can go our webpage about that but the fun that I work at that for slash these publicity for your post into my brother's gamers out the installation package and run it if you can the tablets we can try a mission - okay that make sense so so what's gonna happen ed you should see like an icon in your training it should be in the top right corner 14 height on that right you money tonight of the stolen and given you can give a sample taxes is just me market around here okay SP will be connecting air comes here and I'm sound if you go to up with a port number of 61 76162 and the 4 stock 4 stock index is abolished you're joining [Music] [Music] so you can eyes if you can see connect to yourself thank you let's go Unitas that this is crumbly also important and the packages based on Bubba distress danger contain one final state that will help us and please backends and Oh excellent fifteen minutes here they understand my plight [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay guys honor it's so funny the first place the worst year in that for practicing yeah yeah they ready to do some building familiar right guys okay so [Music] if you don't see good now that workspace we're gonna use it is all character tones we can actually it's actually there so so let me show you quite simple now please tell me they can see this small I can keep going anything like it's good [Music] so so if when you open door very good hello ji was another audio ah oh by the way we are fanatics it might strike the examples are most essential example as well for those [Music] so so we have to split exec and park as I said now I've done some nights Karen just to make it more conformist over you now we've also got this funky run and this is actually the glue that makes every report I'm going to go into details about what but fun things are about this so first of all the problem we want to present to you one of the new features and we want to go out and the results for each nos gonna be one number right because after some it is just one number so you split let's first say so that's going to be this nice and others integers so a size 10 separate that's going to be p.m. already superbee to mislead if you how many questions about Ross you get all thought of stop the others will be able to help you out if you get lost camera so I'm just going to create a vector of 100 engineers in science that people physically non-inclusive range and rust output asks now I know this looks awful actually we need they're wonderful that's because the president no I don't know everything is great but you know it's not that bad so now work for Trump and if I can say right now in this moment I see big chunks between so sorry not 17 magic ScienceDirect right from something has been 400 and we put it in our [Music] okay they're here now just improve protection works for you as well that's great I look at it Phyllis exactly and I you just put something difficult and challenging I thought I missed an instruction I I want to show you stars as Flint works so let's be very quickly we compile this for you don't worry sorry what's the thing with this one that I'm topless why doing it though that's a very good question I'll be happy to show it to you we use a scripted velocity using y stands for the moment of every bus I mean I was trapped [Music] okay so here so what okay so do you wanna fight over x why does it yeah my brothers [Music] they're here about this guy's and they don't want on in there minutes you see it again okay okay Ziggy - Dead we've got generates Neistat okay so going okay let's fill it in the exact very simple they said we've just won one number out of the festival and then again just perfect say backing out and that should gas so that's summing up everything separating from a great and then we're gonna get in scenario of powerful songs and identify son while it's very simplistic problem have you connect right there there's none it does work isn't hurt you trust me oh yeah I know we're gonna get there right so for the burn someone is my intervention so we take the results let me call it government or actually no burn final summaries or so let's take results now you did know this protein is a vector of all couples now that's because if you want to do something more fancy stuff like Amazon or whatever you can actually use that as well like to do something more [Music] [Music] it works my volunteer is pouring it economical choice it's okay to do it all the cup itself in Vanessa we talk every forever no way [Music] example this is exactly now in doctor and if you go incidence Patrick as well here [Music] [Music] Oh Edison you I did certain things that in the session actually [Music] okay well they're working let's try to get Spence yes I want to be expected by the me working on its own let's see here up there we go right so you can see excellent we're creating the sometimes it's reporting's machine for us - it's mine sorry I'm actually using [Music] it's something dying everybody out of the perfect is a nice you think [Music] just sometimes today isn't yet right okay we want to do it bracket just for torture let's do it after and you will need to team up like these to do it is too complicated to do on your own data what we see okay how many to turn interrupt you guys because RJ was fun that's that's why I'm still here yes I just got the news from headquarters we are under ever misses are buying their own and on their way but as I said we are adopting plans we managed to deploy a mesh of sensors in the Pacific Ocean in the water itself which are capable of tracking high velocity air horn objects we are accounting data as we speak and that others are collecting data and our analysts are preparing a predictive algorithm to actually detect the trajectories and imparts date and time of those helped to run the invitation only as I said together we can for the package with the data to arrive be available concern ready yeah is there yeah [Music] well but there isn't enough of you managed to connect so we need to do something about it and we decided to use our so called suppose decoy notes we have a number of undercover machines deployed on the Syndicates commercial tells and we use them to beat misinformation to syndicates analytics for example in English and that was their only purpose until today today we're going to use them to save ourselves we can use them to computed predictors of in these cells but some of you may notice as anyone that we've heard deserve the holy roman version for those of you who haven't it is a concept that allows computing on encrypted data so in essence we need to encrypt the data from the sensors send them to the nose alter the natural and so your computing name for the data to get the results and pass them back indicated on our sites another computation is safe so our analytics prefers the prediction our developer using capisci and that's what we are going to you know hey so donate some points right there's a very simple problem are we going to do it using boolean nutramax been encrypted run heads so you actually let's do stuff without so I come on well like I think in this case to secrecy without a cost so twenty got it whenever machines so this is an example gene the dogs in your on your arm is meat rice you can play with it as well so all the code is there isn't overlook the fully more on her account as well that's very poor people right so run all right for us and that's difference at the back end you let's say 40 okay why I won't evil [Music] okay very well thank you so we've got the results back you can see this little bubble here so the Rondo of estrogen I'll stop it was like encrypting the stop [Applause] [Music] [Music] okay if you go to build a nightstick Sophie it's simulator right right so again so three points double times hey just send it you got to become a live view no I mean there I'll ask them with the dartboard hey thanks guys hope we manage to find things to you right so that's that's it we managed to save that resistance managed to save the free world thank you for that thank you for participating in our workshop as I said you can do all those things online using them a few bills that you have seen the setup of that : unlimited cluster which was really quick I need some most of you for you today you have seen software bills and run on webassembly on the infrastructure you've seen a system routing fhe experimental simple ways but it is actually working in terms of yourself on webos empty you have managed to save three worlds where you're up with that Easter Egg for you to pick up and to try to run go spread the word and bring the others let's pound oh great thank you [Applause] you
