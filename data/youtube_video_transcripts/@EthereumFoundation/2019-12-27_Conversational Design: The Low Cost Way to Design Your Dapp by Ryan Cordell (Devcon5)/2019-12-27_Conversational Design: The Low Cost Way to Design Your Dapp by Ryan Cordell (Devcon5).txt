[Applause] with sine X variable - but what's a compliment is to fajn to you or what rift house house my look is everyone following Ohio's going to explain yeah yeah so you everything about path everyone got a pilot normal families or the anything else so yeah as I said you know ideal well the first stage of this process which means gather and get the dates of the new Jesus or informing this conversation again about time interviews or so we didn't skip that and you know just use all the best guess with positive x class tips on research done we've been talk tomorrow by georgia how about site okay so the best way to do this repeats s will split your screen paper in half maybe one size the system like the user I think feel free to Isis cope this exercise probable that you want to go like you can do the end-to-end experience or user landing on a page or this whatever if they want to pledge for the process things go through in order to you know decide how much money they want to pledge decide like should budgeted connecting their wallet maybe very soon after reviewing whatever else comes to mind really when you start adding back on call for a big incentive for money use a top questions in our way am I gonna get my money back while in supplying food with that blind trust thing so not make sense everyone just take ten minutes we'll give that guide so I don't want to be tend to be the system when we put up one of you four times babies [Music] that's these are our chairs you want to gichan's it sounds like it's candy and there's no way I destroyed it was on [Music] Oh [Music] okay that's it [Music] [Music] [Music] by my side yes yeah actually doesn't [Music] [Music] cowboy prosper my agent absolutely [Music] Dean if I would let people there without any smaller what okay what so I changed my mind I mean that question I was really quite nice of course is all about quite anticipating I stick them on the only good wanted to use it that they necessary spring to mind quietly useful don't think about things necessary in this in this possible conversational interaction this project looks cool I'd like to support it please show me who you are what do I need to show you I would like to know what tokens you have oh I need to explain how this process works before we continue this morning's something does when I tell them that you pledge you're gonna get it back as the project then he liked us okay good how much would you like to pledge or every one of these thank goodness you did that's a costume with $1 because oh and now I give you a new alert even if the project fails this project gets this much money which is like ten dollars cuz please approve the transaction my friend oh here's some other projects that might interest you so the next step is done you have your spirit in front of you and mr. star like annotating and start thinking about where some of this where some of the script might translate potentially it's a UI later on also to sort of start thinking about what's not noted down maybe where you use language to help explain certain terms like that in your example you have that sort of question one user who's opposed it's really something a sensible place for that to come in the inner journey or as we start to think about it more in terms of a product rather conversation so like yeah like down any what we're waiting like explained million and jargons are around the whole onboarding well it for example saw thinking about okay we've also the questions in this order of mrs. Howell it's gonna translate considering and Spacely it's wrong it's an example in what they like in the example for it's like okay this is going to work well on research but actually maybe we should pre-selected the technically if the user has won the wallet or something does that make sense ones like nine minutes to stop probably run I screwed up color right you're yeah never with that contact move on to the next bet I mean again I'm going to ask the right question but they don't want to like some of the stuff that they identified during this place because our script wasn't entirely a script and how are you is not entirely you I think we still got some decent IDs so maybe worth sharing first thing was we kind of went through the user questions like what's in the user mind even before the interaction happens so how do you write a project but then also what you want to know like why should you give money to this weird named project instead of the inspector so yeah basically it's like I think the main kind of like value proposition for this could be that since Kickstarter as the company doesn't need to like profit from this so you're like more of your contribution can go towards funding the project directly rather than like you know kick started making a profit off of you know platform kids or whatever and then just like the transparency and accountability and also the you know being able to support a project even if it doesn't get fully funded so communicating that upfront to the user before they even get to the point of wanting a FAQ wanting to fund the project and then basically after that point you would basically these would want to know okay I like the value proposition of this platform what can I do to like find the project that I'm interested in and how they arrived on a project could be you know how the projects external marketing or you know the existing ways for you know like on Pinterest you select which things you're interested in it shows you so that's kind of like already solved but yeah and then so then the rest of the flow is fairly standard but I think we do not assume that she was ever again you know as much about script or life if they come just to a weirdly named Kickstarter it doesn't mean that they have knowledge of cats so first question in their mind is like well I guess press the paper bride button but then next follow-up question from the system would be do your own print oh like any at all a cerium do you know that and if not was probably we need to provide a crisper like credit card integration whatever then the next kind of do you know wallets and we're lucky user do and we can probably check for that but if not then it becomes next kind of educational moment on a flight here's how you install minimize for most likely and then things get a bit easier so then we can suggest amounts and key words you get and just choose from the list and then you have this recap yeah so after kind of easily got just that point of seeing how much they can contribute in the different like levels and rewards of contribution I think it would be a good at that point maybe good point Akana recap the whole process and like you know reiterate that you know if the funding fails these funds will be returned back to you that this is a mine you're pledging for X amount of days or hours on how to use being funded and during this period if the project doesn't get funded your amount of contribution will just like you know accrue the interest that they could the project will still earn this much you know and just interest so at that point then yeah so the in terms of like gasps so instead of like saying let's say these are one such two hundred dollars or Twitter died and then instead of saying okay it's going to die and you need a pay like this much extra and gasps we just subtract the amount they this subtract the gas cost from the amount they give and so this the project receives us and this is other even ways to do everything you have like pre paying for gas when people when the actual project gets posted there's a fee better to post a project which could prepay for gas in a way for users to minimize the surprise for again people who don't know what disputed the the experience we want to compare with and not be any worse as Kickstarter and then kids start to you're never surprised like you say you wanna pay fifty and you may think you're never like oh there is a surprise feed which is variable from time of the day and I kind of you know just reiterating all these kind of things that are happening and then just the confirmed pledge button which would then pop up the meta mask or what whatever wallet connector whatever they whatever way that you people love it I also think you know one of the end I think that is the challenge that we've had is we're butting up against what for example I know the psychology of sharing information with an interface so for example linking a wallet asking someone to leave their wallet for the beginning is a really big step psychologically it's much easier to say how much do you want to donate and when they instead of having a pulldown menu actually physically type a number now you've committed there's a whole literature on like the psychology of sub costs the fact that you physically typed 10 means you're committed to doing so so when you get the prompt link your wallet the inhibition has gone down right and and so the challenge that we've had in working with this is that there's already stuff we know about how people commit to actually following through on things given that we know that every company out there is collecting every piece of data on everything that we're doing at all times and we everyone's becoming aware of that and don't want to share as much so how do you break down the divisions while embracing their willingness to want to donate etc so with like we already presume that they were crypto holders the mere fact that on the site we never determined that we were going to you know try to be an exact replica Kickstarter this is a Kickstarter for people who own crypto we don't need to educate them on it it's just like what do you got what do you want to support and we're gonna help you through that process right but that's it that's a strategic decision then our group would would basically based on rather than trying to appeal you want to say yeah here we're going to help you to learn all this new stuff that's not the role or the strategy of our organization exam I think quite as well as going today we didn't have a soul about the research which is why it's so important right that's why we have things like different experiences because no designing wants up it easily no design for nothing but that's that's all very need to move very quickly on to the third part of the exercise is doing that on key thing so the next part the next activity is just a sketch the house or start drawing an asset as a product as an interface and he's using that dialogue to tell anything that really forms or how you think about and yeah how it should look when you start to sketch it out so there's not an example I'll show you so that people could sense and yeah I think they don't have to do this like five six minutes I apologies make sense [Music] we're coming well there instead of going on Oh yeah sorry they wouldn't have too much time they also shot I want to show you that drawing sketches my own skills so he's that one nice thing it's like people make it simple but then the you are out to be a burger wallet and then they funded go in there and then they're sure that you're out with their girlfriends so they can test out that interface if they like I experienced something incredible well I didn't like that would be number one is for sec status to never bored because that's how life help you choose the amount and our system benefits then pledging the amount great idea of typing in the number to dr. pledge but keep the reward and just confirm the amount then if we can't detect that there's a wallet we skip sewing steps but if we can't we have to educate recap in some transactions so that's like third string and the fourth screen is a transaction state health transactions type help so yeah just just a closed session I think you know spirit basically act now it's like a design of accent making you have like working in a shed all of the things something that you can always look for that laxity like as usual it's right with the design that's you to remind yourself like what do users thinking and feeling throughout the process and the other script itself is it like you said that you changed your design based on something these doesn't set so this is something that I come back to if it's something new it's something new comes to life you find it more research what we need to build up a new feature script out that you know scope scope the script to that and then see where it fits into the original script you can try and figure out like is this an actual fish really building this but this makes sense within the context what we already had but it's not going to work and descriptively we're working and spicy though yeah sorry I didn't keep time very well but you've got a flavor for more conversational designers and I hope you guys yeah you get to try them with your teams and [Applause] you
