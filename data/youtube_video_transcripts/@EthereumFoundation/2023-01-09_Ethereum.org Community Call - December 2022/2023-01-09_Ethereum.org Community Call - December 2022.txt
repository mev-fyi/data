so hi everyone welcome to the last ethereum.org Community call in 2022 thanks for being here thanks for being with us throughout the year it's definitely been eventful and we want to spend today's call looking back on some of the key things that we've done new pages that we've shipped and the community-led initiatives that have had a significant impact on the site as always this is a community call for the ethereum.org website not for the ethereum foundation or the ethereum protocol with that out of the way let's take a look at what we'll be chatting about today so first of all Paul is gonna start us off by talking about the run a node and staking pages that we've added to the website this year next up Joseph is gonna talk about the energy consumption page and our work in preparation for the merge very on topic with the major events of this year next up Corwin is gonna walk us through the new layer 2 page the scaling pages that we've updated in the developer docs and the find wallet revamp Joshua is gonna talk about the learning quizzes and the learn Hub revamp as well as highlighting some of the pages that some awesome community members have contributed to the website Nuno will give an update on the design system Pablo will cover the code base migration to typescript and chakra I will give an overview of the translation program this year and what's been going on Nico is going to talk about our work on some of the other EF websites like the EF blog ESP cryptography and guest sites and finally Sam is going to give us a sneak peek into what we'll be working on next year at the end as always some miscellaneous announcements and call outs and that should be it so given that we have a bunch to cover I'd say let's get started and hand it off to Paul take us away Paul GM folks um so yeah thinking back it's been a long year do you run a note page I had to look back myself and realize it was launched back in January uh that was an exciting update in my opinion to the page trying to encourage everyone to learn more about what's involved in writing a note why it's important why why our Network depends on it so obviously you can get to that at ethereum.org run Dash a dash note uh there's some tips on there for folks who haven't checked it out to try to learn more about why this is all important to have you potentially get involved and get started your own node and participate um it's not necessarily as hard as a lot of people think it is so if you haven't checked it out I've heard uh the other set of pages that we worked on this is Google launch this is called back in this April time frame earlier in the year the staking revamp we took a look at the staking pages that were there which were pretty simple uh at first that we tried to expand on those and for more information about different tools that were available difference taking as a service providers different coolant staking options to help kind of inform the community of all the different aspects of staking that are involved because certain parts of it can sound pretty intimidating While others are much simpler easier for for new folks to to get on board and learn more about it get involved so if you haven't checked that out as well it's definitely Church same same thing etherm.org thinking that's going to be the main pages and there you can take a look at all the different ways you can get them all mistaken you'll learn more learn more about the risks learn more about the benefits and why it's important I mean yeah definitely have a lot of folks up today I'm gonna leave it at that pass it back to Luca yeah awesome thanks Paul was just chatting with people in the chat um next up Joseph is gonna talk about the energy consumption page and some of the work that we did in preparation for and after the ethereum merge what yeah uh well yeah to merge it was such a fundamental change to ethereum that it really touched a large amount of our content in some way or another um it was also a very hyped event that the community needed to be ready for which required one type of content but then also the moment that the merge happened we had to switch to talking about it in the past tense and start talking about the low carbon high security proof of stake model being the current protocol design rather than a an upcoming upgrade so our approach was to update the site in advance of the merge so that all the content was appropriate for helping people prepare all about what to expect and how to act and what to do and what not to do and that you know to explain the mergers and upcoming event that's still in ethereum's future but then we also wanted to be able to update the site on merge day so that as soon as we saw a successful transition we could pretty much do one click update all of our content for um for the post merge world and that means discussing it in the past tense showcasing the the scale of the improvements that it enabled celebrating with uh with Easter eggs on the site like the merge panda on the uh on the ethereum commons background and Etc so to do this we we maintained a separate copy of the of the website developed in the months leaving leading up to the merge um so if it was just ready to make live as soon as the moment arrived and we also went through the site seeking out all of the gaps in our merch and proof of State content so that we were as well positioned as possible for for helping the community understand how ethereum Works in in proof of stake mode come in writing some new pages on some of the more technical aspects of the protocol and specifically we added pages on the the architecture of an ethereum node after proof of stake uh how blocks are proposed to improve of stake proof stake attack and defense and we added FAQs page and a page about proof of sake versus proof of work and um coming onto the energy consumption page now one of the most significant things that the merge brought to with you was was a dramatic really dramatic drop in the amount of energy that it consumes the energy consumption dropped by 99.98 we used to require a country's worth of energy and now the energy expenditure is negligible and we also got more security and and regular block times as well at the same time so it was it was just such a pleasure to write up the energy consumption page um it's just really satisfying to change all this interacts from ethereum will move to proof of stake and reduce its energy expenditure to no actually if you did move to brutal stake and obliterate its energy consumption and that page got shared a lot the the bar chart on the page with the values that I created got shared a lot all over Twitter and various reports um you know sorry a lot in September October time and just after the merge a bunch of third-party reports started to be published as well they confirmed what what we'd said what we already knew about the drop-off in energy consumption so which is brilliant to be able to add those citations and back up the claims with um you know increasingly robust sources over time and I don't know about you guys but for me on The Bleak Daisy crypto that page in particular is is a real pick me up so um that's all I got to say back to you Luca thank you great thanks Joseph yeah the merge was definitely the highlight of this year for ethereum in general and as it makes sense there was also a bunch of work for um to get ethereum.org live and ready for all of that so thanks to everyone who was involved in getting that ready um next up we're gonna have Corwin who's gonna chat about a couple of different things mostly around the scaling section and the layer 2 page that we shipped this year and the find wallet revamp take us away Corbin thanks hey everyone um so coming into 2022 uh we saw that layer two solutions were coming online and we need to get some information on the website there's also a meme coming into this year of l22 I'm not sure if it's still alive but it's definitely strong at the start of the year um that being said when uh we started the year we were looking at building out a layer 2 page for um kind of newer people coming into ethereum to learn about it just a more approachable page um that we put into the use ethereum section of the website you can also find it on ethereum.org Layer Two um this page is very like approachable for someone looking to learn um like early in their Journey learning about ethereum and looking to learn about scaling Solutions on ethereum and so it basically takes you from uh the start of like what is a layer one why do we need Layer Two um what are the benefits of this how do layer twos work going into the different kinds of Roll-Ups a little bit um how to use them and on board onto the layer 2 products and kind of the difference between uh layer 2 and of validium side chain and some handy tools to use layer twos in addition to this page we had a Community member a manual who did a lot of work to revamp our developer docs content on scaling Solutions so started off with updating just our general scaling page and then moving on into this different subsections of scaling being optimistic rollups uh so this page also got updated talking about um the differences between optimistic Roll-Ups zero knowledge Roll-Ups how they differ from side chain plasma chain and validiums as well similar to these comparisons to the different kinds of scaling Solutions you'll also see that content and how they compare with the zero knowledge Roll-Ups page the side chains page plasma chains and validiums and this was all spearheaded by Emmanuel a Community member um so thank you to Manuel for helping update all this content around scaling for us last thing we wanted to highlight that we were yeah that we're working on this year uh was updating our find wallets page so initially I went to the way back machine here to look at what our page looked like before um we had some filters but when you use them it would it was all at the top of the page it was a little bit like confusing of the user experience um since this is way back we're not going to see any wallet data but the flow was kind of awkward for users so we revamped our find wallets page to make it much more streamlined and a better user experience for users to find a wallet and how we did that was looking at okay what are some of the main user profiles that um people would have coming into this ecosystem so you might be brand new um just looking for a wallet to hold some funds or you may be really into nfts or you're holding your crypto for the long term so trying to find a wallet that fit what a user may be looking for and having easy options as well to just come into all the features that we keep track of and let you toggle those to find like a wallet that fits your criteria um and this was done a lot by our team and uh the community is at large by submitting wallets for us to have on this website as well um yeah with that I will pass it back to you Luca thank you Corwin moving on we've got Joshua to tell us a bit about the learning quizzes um and the learn Hub revamp and some of the community-led initiatives and pages that we've shipped this year over to you Josh yeah thanks silica um yeah learning stuff so I'll start with the learn help um a big part of 2022 was making ethereum.org more accessible to everyone and we found that one of the best ways to do that was by creating simpler more curated learning experiences so what that means like is instead of complicated technical developer docs we wanted to grow our content with more easy to understand 3dm explanations but like the fundamentals and basic concepts and so to that end we created firstly this Learning Hub that you see on my screen just now the goal was to explain about the essentials of ethereum and straightforward language well so communicating that the finer details that helium has to offer that is sometimes quite complex so this page in particular it starts off as if you have absolutely zero knowledge about anything crypto related and it walks you through the very basics of ethereum of ifar of buying if moving through to different building blocks around like smart contracts web free wallet security and also into quite a few of the many use cases the fdm has built on top of it now I won't go through and speak to everything that's on this page but if you haven't checked it out I'd highly recommend it to anyone that's familiar with a lot of these Concepts it seems pretty obvious but the positive response that we've had from our user research um has made it quite clear that these types of curated learning experiences were highly useful to almost all users but especially beginners by pretty much every metric the learn Hub is one of the most satisfactory pages on the website according to users so you can see that we've got from everyone who's replied it's got a score of 4.78 out of five it's very easy to understand 4.7105 and people think the overall layout and design of the pages 4.66 out of five um and that really was quite eye-opening for us about the type of content that we want to prioritize moving forward so all that being said if you know someone who's at the beginning of their athelium Journey then consider sending them here to get started and yeah thanks Sam for sharing that in the chat building on top of those ideas and the learnings from the learn Hub we decided also to create these learning quizzes uh so the problem we were trying to solve was no matter how interested you are in ethereum Reading documentation can be pretty dry it can get quite boring um yeah so the learning quizzes were our first effort into trying to make our content a bit more fun a bit more engaging the idea here is pretty simple um people like to play games and people like to do well at the games that they play so we thought that if we could gamify our content in a way that forced people to comprehend less wall of text that you can see a little bit more filly and then it would make them a more impactful user of BBM and allow them to do more stuff so the quizzes themselves um they're very basic questions based on the content that lives on the page so I believe we've got quizzes currently on eight different pages on the website and every question is about the content that came prior to on the page the quizzes will tell you if you get something right so if we say that ethereum transactions aren't reversible I will say okay good job and I will explain to you why that ends but also probably more importantly I will tell you why if you get something wrong like why it's wrong the idea you're being that I can correct misunderstandings or broken mental models and yeah lastly you can also share your results on Twitter to let everyone know how smart you are or if you're Skyler maybe how smart that you are in it so far I believe there's over 50 000 quiz questions that have been answered so far uh the reception to them has been overwhelmingly very positive so next year we'll be expanding out the amount of questions that we have on the website uh as well as adding more functionality to this feature so if you'd like to try those out um I'm sure someone will be playing another product in the chat for me the last thing I want to chat through before I pass you back over to Lucas just to take a minute to thank all of our amazing content contributors if you didn't ARG is successful thanks to literally thousands of contributors and we value each and every person who is helping to build out this fantastic resource there are a few pages that I really like from 2022 that I would like to call it specifically um but we don't have time to go through everything so just as a caveat to this that there's a lot more to this and if I haven't mentioned something here it doesn't mean that it wasn't massively appreciated first one was the blockchain bridges that we collaborated with argen on very early on in the year and this was just as L2 2022 as coron mentioned was just starting to kick off and everyone was a little bit confused at that point about how did I take my if and get it from Meine on to something else so Pages like this and a couple of other supplementary Pages were quite pivotal to helping people understand that we also have a d side page decentralized science thanks to Vincent um yeah this isn't something that I'd hear of until maybe close to halfway through the year and there was a lot of hype and a lot of interest around it and it seems to solve a lot of problems that there are and the scientific community at the moment so we really appreciated Vincent coming forward and building out this awesome resource for us it definitely helped me and a lot of people on the team to understand this a little bit better but again we've got overwhelming um positive feedback from the community that this is a worthwhile resource and for the last two pages we've got decentralized social networks um I'm sure everyone who's been on Twitter knows that it's potentially imploding at the moment and a lot of people are looking for Alternatives so having a page like this has been great just to point people to what is the decentralized social network and what does it do and what are some options and and this was include as well as the decentralized identity page this was written by Emmanuel who core would mentioned earlier on and has been one of our most pro-ethic contributors in terms of content yeah so we really appreciate that yeah and lastly just the decentralized identity and explaining what identity is and how you can use various things on ethereum to build up your decentralized identity or perhaps many different identities using things like attestations and explaining some of the more difficult uh technical Concepts around this and how those work so yeah thanks again to everyone um lastly I would like to call her if you like writing and you would like to get involved with building out ethelium.org's content resources then we have some very big ideas for scaling up this effort in 2023 so we'd love to hear from you please do get in touch and you can Pang us directly or we do have our content Channel and Discord as well um yeah so that's all I've got I'll pass it back over to Woodcraft nice thanks Josh next up we have Nuno give us an update on the open design system hello everyone so uh you all know that we have been working on the design system for the past few months uh we are at the point that um we will start coding some of the some of the parts you already have laid outs on the design system for the next quarter so that's super excited to have something catching up in the browser for this updates I was focusing on the on the December update which I was almost focused on the markdown pages and um we've been tweaking a lot of details on those and uh we read to um uh to you storybook uh on our Tech stack to bridge the design into the components on code thank you Tyler for the help and pushing forward this um this idea of uh incorporating sorry book in our Tech stack uh we're looking forward that will help bridge the design and the coding and everything will work smoothly so uh some of the highlights that I wanted just to point out it's like small examples that design system will help like we came up with the idea of expanding a little bit the hero this will be something that we'll be working on on codes for the next quarter something new that will open up a little bit to the design on the on the on the big screens um it's just an example of how important week this work has been to update the design step by step without disrupting the normal flow of new content of the website some of the components that we have been working on for the markdown projects as I mentioned so small details and crafting the small um in small design details using chakra has a base as you all know we have been migrating to chakra Pablo will talk a little bit more about that and just to finish a quick example that this is a normal uh page that we have now and we will transition to something close to this which is a lot more cleaner a lot more open really easy to read but more enjoyable to to go about and we will update all those small details this is uh just one small example of the design system and how it will be applied to the pages and the work we have been done uh for this month uh we um we closed this page all the small details uh for and we are really looking forward to see this on the browser um and this is my appetite for design system thank you so much Luca thanks Nuno yeah exciting um shout out to Nuno and Jacob our two designers who have really been thinking a lot about how to make contributing as a designer easier and getting more designers involved with ethereum and just to drive that point home right now we have 36 people with the design role on the server so people who are interested in contributing as a designer versus a year ago when it was literally zero so amazing growth um next up we're gonna have Pablo cover the code based migration to typescript and chakra yeah hello hello everyone so yeah on the technical side of the website yeah so in the course of this year uh we did two big migrations that were driven by Community essentially um with the main goal of making our code base more robust and that that will help us um sorry you're showing this course screen okay perfect we can hear you yeah though yeah sorry change Windows enticement oh no you still see my display yeah yeah this is good yeah you're good thank you so much for my new skills on Discord salary so yeah we were we want to to make our code more robust and uh basically to to scale better in the future and then adding new features on top of that so um the the first uh typescript that first migration that we did was adding typescript to the code and so as you may see on on our repo uh we are we have a pretty big people we have our uh 20 000 comments and we have a bunch of a lot of contributors adding code constantly day by day uh on the repo on the project and this is really hard to to keep the code organized and what a structure so that's was basically the main reason why we decided to implement typescript on the code um we did this uh with the help of you guys with the community you can see here almost uh 10 parties participants 10 contributors help us in the process and I think we did a pretty good job on this we basically migrated a 150 files to typescript and and yeah this is of course not the this is clearly a an an ever living epic or effort uh this was just the first iteration where we just uh migrate all the files but in the future we we expect to to keep improving the typescript I'm sure that there are tons of things to improve and to fix that are related to typescript um so the next big migration that we did on the code base was related with UI and you can see the implement this epic the implementation of the UI Library so aniraco on December 2021 we were trying to improve the accessibility of of the website and in that moment we were also thinking about creating this design system that you know just talk about and we we realized soon that we were inventing the wheel in a lot of custom components that we have uh so in that moment we decided to to implement a UI library that set the the foundations of of our UI components where we can build on top of of them these components are more robust have followed the modern standards of web are well tested so we started analyzing and exploring different libraries different options and we decided to go with chakra UI that is a an open source Library uh that has a a pretty big Community around a super good documentation and the API for for this UI components is pretty easy to use um so we started implementing the UI library with you guys this website great success this is a great success because we are still working on this um we have around 30 contributors uh migrating all the UI components that we have uh recently we started this second wave of migration so we divided all the components that we have into um you can see the second part here that is in progress we are super close to finish we have a lot of PRS open that needs review but soon it's going to to be merged um another thing to to highlight on this is that in the in the process of this migration you the community have not only added a incredible value on this migration itself but also you have proposed uh some great ideas that are kind of related with this for example the the storybook proposal don't buy tire that you know just just said as well that is a great example of of people giving us great ideas to to improve our code so I I would invite everyone who has ideas or improvements or something that we haven't considered yet on the code to create a PR uh an issue sorry and propose those changes we are always open to to hear that and and discuss them um so as I said we are close to finish it I think early q1 we are going to to finish migrating all the all the components and and this will serve as the foundations for the upcoming goals for 2023 where we are going to basically try to implement the design system from from the designers that that they are creating from Nuno and Jacob and improve the accessibility that's those are the goals um so yeah that's that's all I have to say uh thanks everyone again who has uh collaborated and participated uh in in these efforts and yeah have a happy holiday awesome thanks Pablo yeah and thanks to all of the contributors who have been involved with all of these initiatives couple of pretty pretty massive migrations and it's always exciting to see so many people getting involved all right next up I'm gonna briefly cover the translation program and some of the highlights from this year just share my screen real quick s is a very basic way of just um highlighting some numbers so that there's a A visual representation there as well so it's been a pretty impressive year for translations on ethereum.org with over 2 000 individual contributors translating a total of almost 3 million words both are though both of those numbers are up from last year um because of all of this activity we were able to update over 650 content buckets across all languages on the site massively up from last year the number of languages available on ethereum.org has also grown from 39 in last December to 51 currently live my favorite stat though and one that I mentioned often is the ratio of non-english versus English page views last December non-english page views accounted for 14.3 percent of all visits to the website since then the number of visits and languages other than English has gone up in comparison with English page views every single month with not English page views currently representing a record high 27.6 percent of all traffic to the site so over a quarter of all traffic to the site is now in a languages other than English in addition to these brief stats um we've also worked on a couple of different translation related initiatives this year in the first quarter we published uh translation style guide translation program Playbook cleaned up the crowd in glossary so focusing a lot on resources for translators later on in the year we also completely revamped the translation program pages and resources available on the website we also had a couple of epics focusing on translation quality where we ran several quality analysis checks created lists of inconsistent translations that we'll be addressing soon and collected a bunch of feedback on the quality of translations recently we've been focusing more on the translator experience running some heart analysis and identifying concrete next steps to improving the translator experience that we're currently working through and the final translation related initiative that I'll briefly mention was adding internationalization support to the EF blog which is now available in 15 languages Nico will go will go through this in some more detail so we can give the floor to Nico who will walk us through some of the other EF websites that we've been involved in this year and just a quick shout out if you are interested and want to help translate ethereum.org let us know reach out to us we have a translation Channel DMS are also always open always happy to chat and meet new contributors and listen to feedback and ideas so that would be it on my end and now let's hand it over to Nico thanks Luka hi everyone so I will give you all the summary of different projects we have been working on different side projects along this year uh the first one is the site from the ESP team which was the first project that I worked on this since I joined the team last year uh basically this project was an opportunity to test a new a new stack um on on a smaller scale and to validate this stock to then start applying this progressively on a team.org as aloe mentioned the circular migration are in Thai script was possible to because we we first test this new stacking in this smaller projects so in the case of this site we completely redesigned the site and we redesigned the application forms we also iterative um the CRM software that the ESP team uses so this allows us to improve the application flow to scale the application funnel uh and to make the application process easier for for the applicants um the other side was this was a master much more simple and small approach like this is the site for the cryptography research team in this case the idea was to have a site to centralize the content the members the different members of this team have their personal sites and blogs an idea was to have like a hub for this content so for example now they have uh a vlog for the team and I can post a different posts here so so share the different research projects and Publications they have been working on the same for the bounties this was these parts around different places and now we have all the content on the same page so it's easier to to navigate the other project was the the blog and as Luca mentioned the main goal here was supervisable for internationalization and this site was also revealed from scratch using the the same stack we used on ESP and the other sites um so basically now for example if you if you go to the blog site we have this new page that wasn't available on the previous version uh where you can for example filter post by by language [Music] um and when you enter to a post you can't navigate through the different uh translated versions so I think this was a a massive Improvement to the experience of the site um we have also worked on some UI and ux improvements the performance has also improve a lot uh and we still have some ideas in in the roadmap for some future improvements I I share the post on Discord if you want to read more in in detail and the last one is more like a sneak peek because the site is not live yet but in this last queue we have been working on a revamping of the get client side uh in this case we also revealed and redesigned the slide from scratch the documentation pages are now have I think that a much better UI and ux than when you start to use it you I think you're you're going to notice the the difference uh the search feature for example I think it's quite cool um and also we have rebuilt the the logic in the downer space to improve the performance uh the filtering and Etc um so I think that's all I have to say uh think so and I'll see back to you to you okay oh thank you Nico yeah a bunch of pretty cool looking websites that we've just walked through um so we've all been looking behind um giving you an overview of some of the main things we've been working on this year and I guess Sam is gonna wrap this up by sharing some of what we'll be focusing on next year Sam thanks Luca hey everybody happy to be here yeah what a year it was awesome to see the updates I mean over 2 000 translators involved seeing GitHub contributors cross a thousand people this year I think yeah easily the most productive year for ethereum.org as a project and like major shout out to the community here for for helping out it's really inspiring to see and to be a part of um I mean looking ahead to 2023 hopefully you guys are are looking forward to the new year um I think ultimately the story is just a lot of the same right like ethereum as as a protocol as a project um in open source as a community and ecosystem continues to evolve and there's constant need for ethereum.org as an educational resource to to continue to evolve um to keep up with just the community that we have um as with other projects you know supported by the ethereum foundation um you know a major value and like guiding philosophy we have is just the concept of subtraction um if you're curious to learn more about that encourage you to yeah Google that search it on YouTube you'll find presentations from many people within the ethereum foundation talking about it and I think each project tries to exemplify that in different ways um but I think the major kind of ethos of this philosophy looking into the new year is you know we have a core team on ethereum.org you've heard from many of those folks today who have presented um and that core team will continue to to build out features and and contribute to the website but more and more our focus is not so much like what are we gonna do as a team it's more about like what can the community do to solve a certain problem or to seize a certain opportunity and like how can we help in that effort so if you folks are you know looking for ways to get involved like that is basically our job is to like support you in terms of like what you want to build what you want to write what you want to design or translate um and for us to help facilitate that for for the benefit of the community so whether that's applying for Grants through the ethereum foundation whether that's working with us just to like you know build up a resume or learn new skills definitely encourage you to get involved um in terms of like a couple teasers just to give a sense of where we're looking for like the next few months of the coming year I can say two big focuses are um one is just withdrawals for for stakers so if you've been following the ethereum protocol much um you've probably seen a lot of chatter how planned into this next upcoming Shanghai upgrade will be facilitating withdrawals for First Acres um our team helps maintain launchpad.ethereum.org and that's kind of like a go-to resource to to get up and running as as a solo Staker um so we'll be working on building educational resources on ethereum.org to explaining how do withdrawals work from a technical standpoint um ways to learn about just like considerations to take in mind continuing to build out documentation for stakers to help them you know to stake successfully at the end of the day um and latest indications are you know that might be as soon as you know March um April this coming year so building out functionality and resources around withdrawals um is going to be a huge Focus for our team which is super exciting I think the second one that you know you heard Nuno and Pablo and maybe even others touch upon but just like implementing the design system we've been working on for the past six months actually rolling that out into code um we think this is going to be a huge unlock in terms of just like improving accessibility of the website making it just easier to design and build new pages and new features so like that any developer any designer can come into the project and have like the building blocks they need to to be productive and be successful um and I think a cool part of that which others also mentioned but like rolling out storybook which is a really nice kind of developer sandbox if you will for us to you know build components in isolation test them in this isolated sandbox take image snapshots to make sure there's no bugs or regressions or accessibility pitfalls um should really help us kind of just improve productivity across the code base for really any contributor looking to help out um and I guess last one to just say is yeah like translation improvements is always an area we're looking at as Luca mentioned you know over 2 000 people contributed to translations on the project this year like we're thinking about you guys and how we can make your job easier and just more efficient um whether that's like QA tools building out our glossary and translation memory um empowering you folks with tools to just be more productive and enjoy doing it more um you know exploring machine translations to to help you be more productive um super excited about potential stuff in the pipeline there um and I guess I just end is like you know like what else we work on as a team and as a community like very much up to you so let us know whether it's in Discord calls like these GitHub Twitter let us know what you think we should work on um and let us know what you want to work on and we'll do our best to try to empower you um to get out there and make a difference so thanks a lot and yeah looking forward to to seeing you all in 2023 thank you Sam with that we are basically through with all the things we wanted to chat about um I'm gonna give it over to Josh hello my um this time I get to be the hero and come on sharing my screen um we do have a couple of other things that Luca is about to go through so I just thought that let's start this just now and we can leave up for the rest of the call while we chat um yeah so sharing my screen just now if you get some sort of QR scanner you can scan the pull-up code and that will allow you to claim your report with an address or your ens [Music] um and I guess lastly just what we're giving shouts um when I give a shout out to Scott oneapp who I did see on this call not sure if he's still here um but he has helped us a lot with creating co-ops across the year um all of the ones for the community calls but also a bunch of others that I'm sure a lot of you have already claimed and yeah so shout out to Scott and I'll pass it back over to Luca just to finish us up we'll use claim your waps thank you Josh all right so moving on to the very very final part we have a couple of announcements and miscellaneous things we'd like to mention um first of all events so the ethereum.org team has attended a couple this year where we've been learning attending talks meeting new people meeting up with our contributors we ran a booth we also gave a couple of talks um I'm gonna be sharing the links to Sam's and my talks at Defcon in Bogota in the chat right now with Sam talking about education as a public good and the history of ethereum.org while my topic was growing the global ethereum community Through localization feel free to check them out if you're interested and with that being said I'm sure other people on the team would like to share a word or two about in real life events and the value of attending them so let's open up the floor and hear from some of them as well Joshua nominates Corwin Corbin you wanna um yeah some of the highlights that have come from attending these events um comes from one meeting the community members it was really awesome at Devcon to have that booth and have a space for people to come up and meet us in person and to talk about all the work we're doing um on ethereum.org as a community other highlights that have come from being able to go to these events is connecting with people who are able to help us build out these resources and are more um and our experts in the domain that we're trying to build our content for so an example that comes to mind um would be like the bridges page we talked about we met um the guys that work at li-fi at a conference and they helped contribute to our website or the layer 2 website we met a bunch of L2 companies in uh uh East Denver who helped us like verify the information we were putting out and make sure we were making a good resource for everyone to look at so like a lot of the value comes from being able to meet people who are either experts in the domain or interested in uh this project as a whole and just like really awesome to meet the community members through all of this yeah exactly a lot of different benefits also I would say as um really applicable to anyone who wants to get more involved in ethereum in the space in the community in general is to go to an in real life event or two it's a great opportunity to learn and to connect with people and to share ideas and to pick up ideas um so yeah that's that's one uh thing we wanted to call out also if Porto's happening next year seeing Nuno just mentioning that so a new event if you want to check that out if you like sunny weather probably good place to be um when it comes to these IRL experiences like any any event that popsicles they're trying to get more involved I would argue would be valuable and beneficial they don't have to be the biggest events out there like Ethan or yeah Ethan was coming up in a couple months that's a very large event hopefully we'll see some folks there and I encourage folks to to apply if you can make it but if you can't make it something like that or any type of larger conference definitely consider meetups as well look in your local community try to find other folks who are also learning the vegetarian playing around building things try to see what they're working on any folks that you can get in touch with locally can really have a kind of miss your your knowledge and education and access in the space so I just want to put that out there as well and hopefully we'll see some folks at some different events this year yeah exactly moving on um sorry go ahead one last thing that no one I don't think I heard anyone really touch on um but yeah if you want to get involved and you don't work in this space but you want to go to one of these events one of the best ways to do that is to offer your time and volunteer almost all of the time that means that you'll get tickets to the event for free in exchange for you helping out with the event um but I've had loads of conversations with a lot of great people who are the volunteer at these events and just by being there and volunteering you get to have amazing conversations with a lot of really interesting people um and there's also the add the benefit that if you're interested you can spend a bit of your time going to the talks which I would highly recommend as well so if there's something near you that you want to go to or even not um check out in advance look at the events coming up and see if you can get on the list as a volunteer yeah exactly 2023 is coming up there's going to be a bunch of events going on if you can if and if you have time attending at least one is usually um a rewarding and beneficial experience but given that we're already on time I want to quickly run through to other miscellaneous announcements um first of all we published a survey for translators a couple of days ago so we can collect some feedback and evaluate how translators feel about contributing and the translation process and hopefully use these takeaways to improve certain aspects of the contributor experience I am sharing a link to the survey in the chat please note that this Channel and message are only accessible to server members with the translator role since we want to make sure that only translators are filling out this survey but if you are a translator and haven't filled this out yet please do please share your thoughts and feedback it means a lot to us and the more we can learn about how contributors feel the more we can work on improving their experience and finally you might have noticed that we've just announced an nft for active community members and contributors sharing uh the message link with all the details and instructions for claiming the nft in the chat as well basically this is just a simple way of us saying thank you to our most active and engaged community members and maybe also the start of us doing more things like this so in short this is a regular nft on optimism that you can claim if you have any of the following roles on the ethereum.org Discord so you can find the exact roles in this message the mint is free you do need to pay a gas treatment which is usually around 10 cents on optimism in case you don't have funds on optimism this seems like a good time to bridge some over and start exploring ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem which is growing rapidly and it has exploded with activities this year and if you're not eligible to claim this nft at the moment don't have one of the roles don't worry dealer will be more opportunities in the future I would say just try to contribute to the website in some way be active in our community collect a role if possible and you're good as always a huge thanks to everyone on this call as well as all other members of the ethereum.org community we've come a long way to the point where we now have a Vibrant Community and thousands of contributors to the website so all of these great stats and metrics that we've shared here today are very much the result of all of these contributions and your efforts so thank you have a nice break everyone and hopefully see you all again soon
