Maurice thank you very much I'm just going to spend a little time getting plugged in and set up here should hopefully be quite quick and easy and I hope it's not too boring for people watching at home on the livestream how you people watching at home on the livestream of course why would I use YouTube mr. Venson and actually set up now you can see it's actually working so okay okay Wow welcome thank you all for being here it's a real honor to be able to speak in front of you guys and like present at this etherion meter Thank You Maurice for inviting me and Christian also for encouraging us to come with the live streaming equipment I'm going to kick off briefly with a demo which I think I've already kind of done by showing you as live streaming this meter on the live band Network we're gonna learn a little bit more about what the life their network is all about but actually I want to say thank you to Matteo and Amazon who are working on the whole setup for live streaming footage from here on the blockchain but because part of my job within a Lightyear is to connect the technology with a creative people I've invited a friend of mine growing in satellite to come and play a little music for as well because I'm not sure how often you get violin play theory though I feel I would kind of  it up a little bit Berlin style and do something that's a big difference so I give you Roman Santa way [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] Thank You Roland Wow very nice Roland really inspiring recently when I learned that he'd been playing violin since he was four years old right yeah now he's 39 so 35 years you playing violin and that's how you get super good at playing violin so super inspirational Thank You Roman okay let's get back to it though so we've done the demo and the live demos actually worked we're live streaming on life bear that's super cool but let me tell you little bit more about what life here is what it is I'm doing here who we are so life theoretics that it's very cool is a really low level infrastructure blockchain tech project open source and what we're seeking to do is to create a global decentralized live streaming video network to allow people to transmit content so AV content audio and video and this platform built on a theory of blockchain is going to be owned by everybody who makes it up everybody who's kind of participating in running the software running nodes in a distributed decentralized way which has a lot of really interesting implications for sensor ability sensor resistance and also democracy in terms of how we allow information to kind of spread out to the world instead of being controlled by the few it's being controlled by the minute through connection with the Boche okay so I'll give you a little warning it's the first time I've given most of this presentation it's a bit of a combination of some some slides that get presented in the u.s. quite a lot the first time I'm giving this so bear with me if I'm a little and some of the stuff but I think it's a kind of like give an idea of the the the focus around life is around like simplifying and increasing accessibility for life streaming video so our target and our goal is to reach the limited number of users every device whether that smartphones whether that's laptops whether that's huge big flat-screen TVs or whether it's beamers and projectors in lecture halls in German universities for just every screen and also like adapting the bit rate that we're broadcasting on to allow people to be able to consume it in multiple different formats so if they have a really slow internet connection and they're in the middle of Africa they still have a an outside chance and being able to kind of consume the content that is being broadcast so a little bit about like the existing landscape of live streaming video I don't know who here live who said the live streams like from their smartphone it's an interesting practice like 1 2 3 4 5 you have I know ok so it's something with the I'm certainly seeing a kind of a growing trend as an opportunity to kind of share we will seen the Twitter we've all seen the Facebook posting medium as well but now like we're all broadcasters we all have the tools in our pocket to to be able to live stream content about us to the world so a little bit of how the landscape of this works right now you've got a lot of social apps stuff like periscope and Facebook live and do now on YouTube and also like proprietary decentralized organizations who are distributing news and media and then you have the other kind of like more infrastructure level organizations like twitch and like livestream and like they're companies like wowza that provide infrastructure services into companies that want to use live-streaming as part of their as part of their projects and I think the you know they keep the key point to note from this slide is around all these people you know that they're creating their own setups for livestream so if actually we can create one decentralized or Mis kind of like globally owned monopoly live streaming platform that all these guys can use like their and probably use it to cut costs out of their business which it's still to be seen that that's kind of the that the interest point there so when we're thinking about building life here we're thinking about like the use cases for you know white people might want to use life here over another service something we talk a lot about is that is unsensible life journalism so we saw this certainly with like the Arab Spring stuff happening there was a lot of energy brought together through the use of social media and through the internet I often talk about you know I'd love to be able to see live images from someone's smartphone of the Rockets going across the sky in a network to find out you know to get an idea of exactly what is going on in the world right now from cameras from from live streams and it hasn't kind of you know acknowledged fell about this for fake news stuff that's happening now it has some implications for maybe the reality of the news that we see if there's kind of a more open opportunity for those screening of video content the other thing we talk about is like automatic scaling so I can remember working for Sky TV big media company in the UK and they had a really big fight like boxing match two guys standing in a ring trying to figure out of each other and they needed just for that event they needed to build like they needed to double the size of their infrastructure for one night one I own because so many people were going to be watching this big boxing match and I think with something like a decentralized network where anyone can come and add a node to the network this allows the ability to scale up and scale down relatively quickly using existing infrastructure that's owned by people like you and me bottom left this kind of is about opening up new commercial models for live streaming and for media distribution so we've already heard about subscribing to your TV channel and paying $39.99 a month to get 17 million different channels if you never watch we've all seen things like YouTube and YouTube live where you're starting to watch the video before you must do this it must be skip add in five four three two one now to the interesting stuff so these I feel alike relatively old commercial models for monetizing content and I think what we're providing is a platform and a basis upon which people can really start to innovate come up with new ideas of how to how to monetize content in a peer-to-peer way I'm sending you information you're sending me maybe money back in real time and I feel with this kind of growth of cryptocurrencies and blockchain we we get closer to that kind of paradigm and I think the last one just around like video enabled deaths if if people are starting projects now or start a project recently to to build some new stuff on blockchain technology and they have a video live-streaming aspect to it then look no further than life there were an open solution which where we can all participate in kind of creating this this network so so yet sometimes talk about you know teenagers in their bedrooms saying hey I want to build this software like how do I do the video are good life to be a brilliant that's easy super easy you know what crazy new ideas can we build on top of it who knows okay I'm gonna go a little bit into the kind of crypto economics and this is kind of uncharted territory to me so I'm gonna do my best here but this is this slide gives a bit of a picture of how how the ecosystem works for today commercially so you've got on the left-hand side a broadcaster and they want to broadcast content and typically they have some kind of commercial deal with a video platform like whatever like live stream like you stream and this video platform infrastructure provider will charge the broadcaster a certain amount of money and this this money to to transmit content is going to be a combination of costs that are associated with with keeping the infrastructure alive but also margin because these companies need to make money for shareholders they need to make money for themselves they need to pay for their offices for the infrastructure and for their people and their salaries but they're providing a valuable service for the broadcaster they're allowing the content to get through to the end consumer who's watching so we switch this to like a blockchain crypto economic planner model we still have the broadcaster whose interest in in disseminating content out through the network but right now if the life in network is if they are providing infrastructure for live streaming video they actually have two sources of revenue coming in one is like a stable source of revenue which is newly minted live pair tokens which we'll talk a little bit about later so this is the cryptocurrency that underpins the network and effectively is kind of driving to network and the idea here is that this will result in reduced costs for broadcasters to be able to put content out there because there's a kind of a commercial incentive for people to compete with each other to provide a cheaper best at better service and now I feel like I have already explained that very well done I'll move on okay so a little bit about like the technology stack I'm conscious this is a technical session if only for beginners but I hope I hope this is kind of the rights that are leveled in terms of how the whole setup fits together protocols and so on so typically a broadcaster on the left-hand side is broadcast as a little rtmp it's what with live streaming from this map down here and they're sending rtmp content and this is you know maybe 30 frames per second of video and audio sampled at 44 kilohertz and they're sending this into you know the first step on the process between broadcaster and viewer is to process process the content so I'm broadcasting here at 1920 by 1080 that's full HD a lot of people around the world can't watch that so because or they they they they can only watch because they have smaller screens so the first piece of work that needs to be done is transcoding this video from Full HD down into smaller formats and this is what the media server transcoder does so included them all this as well you know when you're when you're live streaming content a lot of people want to save it as also and this is then maybe spec stored in some kind of persistent storage mechanism or content distribution network that's responsible for moving all these bits and bytes around the world sort of someone in Australia wants to watch that they can watch with low latency and then there's also obviously the kind of a whole digital rights management and how do we make sure that the people who are streaming the content actually have to rush the stream the content but that's a whole nother world of kind of complexity and then like focusing them on like the end user so if you're on a smartphone if you're on on on a weak smartphone and probably the screen is not so great or if you're watching on a big full screen TV maybe your resolution you can get is it's called 1080p but what life there allows is catering to all the kind of the different audiences in between so kind of taking taking all that complexity and doing the classic and a consultant's thing is just like putting it into a box with a pretty picture and some black and some green squares but effectively this is this is what life very seeking to do to become the live streaming element of the web 3.0 stack to condense down a whole theme of complexity just to make it substantially easier for people to get content out there to to be able to trust that no one's going to turn that kind of content off and they're not going to be censored and yeah it's an interesting place to visit so like broadly the the approach that we're taking in terms of building out this this decentralized live broadcasting networks step one is building an open source media server for the video people in the room that's based on FM a standard open sourced piece of software for presetting video and then secondly we're building some economics into the token and into the smart contracts that incentivize in fact incentivize the people who make up the network to provide good services and effectively to kind of compete with each other to make the overall network stronger and we'll go into that a little bit of detail in a minute about how to how that would work so like at a very basic level if I have a computer like this machine here or a hardened server in a data center I can install life as software on those on those servers as long as I have CPU GPU and Internet bandwidth I can effectively act as a media server node in this global decentralized nice clean Network so instead of it being like lots of YouTube here Facebook there and Ustream here it's like on like a fishing net around the world made up of lots of small nodes that are all working together to make something free and you okay so yeah I don't maybe maybe you want to go into too much detail around the media server other than we're working a lot with rtmp and the different kind of transcoding mechanisms and different formats for processing video we're focusing on kind of some of the more popular ones to begin with just so we can kind of get uptake but it's an open system so if anyone wants to come in and add more transcoding options into the mix then of course this is fully open and free you don't need my permission okay so this is where we get into a little bit the delegated proof of stake around how we try to encourage and incentivize reliability in the transcoding notes so think about it as a euro broadcaster you want to broadcast the content that you want to get out to lots of people you want to know that the person you're sending your beautiful content to actually knows what they're doing actually knows how to run a transcoding node actually knows how to keep hardware working actually knows how to make sure the uptime is good and also isn't a rogue actor in the system trying to gain the system by saying yeah yeah take your content yeah yeah transcoding and process it but actually not doing any of the work but still taking the money so a lot of our mechanism for crypto incentivization it is is seeking to encourage reliability and super-high level we if you are a holder of the light pay token so there will be 10 million near them minted hopefully end of March you have an option of participating with your token in the network and it's a little bit like micro investing so for example if Maurice is running a live peer node and I know Maurice and I know Maurice can you know if he knows how the hardware works he understands the software I can take some of my tokens and I can stake them I can bond them to maurices node and this will show everyone in the network that I trust Maurice it will show everyone who's wanting to broadcast that Maurice has the most amount of tokens bonded to him so he looks good and needs a new week we can check his halftime of his performance and his reliability and we see he's super good and reliable and this allows him to charge higher prices so if I'm looking for someone to do the transcoding work for my my video broadcasting I'm looking for a good deal and all of all the nodes in the network can set that price so if there's one hundred thousand nose making up a mesh network around the world you can sort them by price you can sort them by how much token has been bonded to them you can sort them by their uptime and how good they are performing you can sort them by how many black marks they have against their name so if they have black marks that maybe you don't want to use them or maybe if they have black marks you do want to use it because they're super cheap but like the long and short of it is that the design of the token the design of the protocol seeks to create competition within the network so that the overall network becomes stronger okay I don't know if that blame faces or just okay maybe maybe I'll try a question go on I'll try a question and maybe get your microphone Thanks are you very sure that the right person what and manually choose the nose at this is a broadcast too or it is just too can be an automatic thing and the competition is done automatically right so it's it definite wouldn't be a manual thing it's the way the process would work is when I am a broadcaster and I want to stop broadcasting I would publish a contract a smart contract to say I'm looking for someone to broadcast sorry to transcode this broadcast one hour this is the maximum I'm willing to pay and actually this is baked into the the mechanism of matching broadcasters transcoders so yes it wouldn't be a manual thing where someone goes hmm but the sort by stuff is more as kind of like that to bring to life how the concept could work and in fact sorting sorting by how much is bonded to you can also be a algorithm poor thing and done in software well how I asked the question oh wow okay AG lots of questions are coming the new let's list tenderness this yet it's free stylus yeah an ice-cream the microphone you mentioned that there is stuff like black marks and Uptown yes so you have some kind of reputation right right but I don't see in the token models and that reputation is build up so just by stating that doesn't mean that someone has like good uptime or no of course right so how does that work so the actually is a nice segue into the next slide thank you I'll come back to your question to the end if that's all right thank you so much so in terms of like enforcing good behavior on the network and validating that the people who are doing the work and getting paid for it in in etherium or ERC 20 tokens we're using a system called true--but connected with swarm to verify and validate that the work has been done correctly so it's done on a sweater like a spot check basis randomly selecting samples from different transcoders seeing what's been sent to them the content seeing what's been output and to verify and validate whether the input and the output and the process that they're supposed to have gone through has actually been done correctly and I'd say majority of times it will be it will be done correctly the content will be stored in swarm and true--but will be the work the mechanism for validating exactly how that works right now I don't know but I do know that our guys are working very close to the tree to make this thing real so this is the kind of thing that if a transcoder node has has been spot checked and has been seen to have done something wrong then they'll get a black gets them in any reputation that have will be tarnished or affected by this does that answer the question yes two out of two nice I don't know if there's any more to say on on this incentives an enforcement correct okay and this is a little bit more I didn't really understand exactly how this slide works was a little bit more around the architecture of how we're using how we're using swarm as a as a content distribution network maybe this is also aspirational I cannot be sure okay this bit I do know a lot about so this is nicely place and cool so in terms of waiver wrap roadmap and past performance we kicked off the project maybe eighteen months ago with research and development phase and like proof of concept stuff we spent most of the summer focusing on getting at a working test net launched so this would be like nodes running around the world talking to each other and sharing content peer-to-peer live streaming video so the test met with soft launch fact I think in September time and since then we've been doing a lot of work on like testing the live streaming set up against the test net Network ironing out bugs continuing to define and develop the solidity needed for executing the smart contracts we then launched a private test net back November time so this is actually now interacting or it was then interacting with aetherium local test environment and big milestone we hit last week was deploying onto the rinkeby but etherion testament who here knows what rinkeby is okay like fifty percent six percent knows okay so this is like a staging area before you deploy to the etherion network when you deploy to the etherium network any mistakes cost you a lot of money maybe but it's like real money it's like the mistakes are real then but when you're on rim to be it's like the stakes are semi real because you have some reputation you could lose if you screw it up and actually we've deployed a ring that we lost last week and we're going through currently a security audit trail of it's in the u.s. trying to break it trying to hack it trying to steal the fake etherion so that we can see if there are any bugs in the system and hopefully there aren't well hopefully the ones that any any of the to come will be able to fix relatively quickly because we have big kind of target late March early April to press that big red button or whatever it is that deploys all the smart contracts that creates ten million large pay tokens that distributes the tokens that are already been sold and like sets this network free to the world and exactly what's going to happen then we don't know it's going to be fun it's gonna be a wild ride but I guess like yeah high level what we hope will happen is that we could get the tokens into the hands of people who are incentivized and infused to help us build this new life streaming network and together as a community we can we can build a future keeping this for us okay so if anyone's interested and it's looking for ways to get involved in the project like simple basic step number one is run a node if you get life paired up or there are links there through to our code base on github which is all fully open source we've got releases happening every week or two and you can download the software run the set go set yourself up with some test aetherium and start live streaming on life here there's a very nicely and well refined kind of step-by-step documentation about how to get from where you are - life stream you know life here that's something you'd like to do the other thing I'm encouraging a lot kind of like my role here is around creativity on top of this platform that we're creating so if you're interested in any kind of decks that involve live streaming video of video content it doesn't need to be sensitive resistant but kind of this is the kind of thing that we're we're we're targeting yeah and you can build yourself a video based debt and actually one of the really interesting things I'm working towards is some way of being able to monetize live streaming content in real time so that's sending live streaming AV content in one direction and in real time receiving some kind of financial value in the other direction which I think could disrupt quite a lot of existing business models for how content is monetized but we had we're not there yet but we're working towards it the other way to get involved and this is like switching this is kind of like relatively hot news is we're gonna start giving away our tokens to people so these tokens are worth money not yet on the open market because did I say they don't actually exist yet but this is that this is something we're working towards when the token does exist and starts to have a financial value on the open market we have a big stock of them and we want to give them to people who we believe can work with us together build this new life streaming network it's going to be an opt-in airdrop it's going to be linked to ethereal because we're kind of pretty connected to aetherium and if you're interested in getting involved and the best place to kind of keep abreast of news and details about how to participate in the air drop then good Diana /live peer and you'll find some friendly people in the life peer community who can help you on your way to getting getting the software installed but also give you details which is like end of March we're looking to start doing these air drops about to coincide with when we launched the protocol so no pressure or anything okay so the other thing is we you know we're building trying to build this global decentralized project a lot of the guys who were working on that based in the US but kind of a core is it's East Coast in New York some people in California as you can see I'm here in Berlin one of the projects that I run here in Berlin is part of life here it's like a TV which is the the first ever TV channel on the life peer network so it feels good and I worked by lot with these guys anton on camera say hi Anton and Matteo on the same and say hi Mateo so we are we're effective like a startup TV network we broadcast them like they're obviously and we're a lot of lean our early concepts around music we we have some nice recordings which we've also published at places like d2 so we're kind of fully decentralized land and yeah it's kind of a fun and enjoyable way for doing infrastructure testing whose life streaming beautiful content and nice music through the platform so life here TV you know everyone else to me how do I get to it it's like it's just like big TV like old school going to a browser opening up a URL and there's no sign in there's no login you know your grandmother can do it so that's that's fine and I see you like like call to action for this one is if anyone has interesting ideas for content at the moment I'm really looking for people who want to talk about blockchain theory and related projects so if you come and talk about what you're doing and share it like in real time with the world and maybe you like a TV is the best place for you which is a nice segue into community space we have in Berlin it's Reichenberg on 155 which is supposed to buster tour it's a nice open space there's kind of studio area there's chiller area with kitchen it's not a huge space but with kind of skill a small project but it's definitely enough to come and call your living room or your home if you're in a caucus at all area which you know I have a lot and this is where we have some fun and games now again with violins and guitars and cameras and and life streaming equipment so you are welcome to our community space to come and do live streaming stuff with a live paint network maybe take my details later or take a card from here okay that's kind of it for the formal part of the presentation I don't know if it was too fast too slow not enough content to high level of high level enough but I've got well people I haven't even asked for questions but people are already putting their hands out yet I think I saw you first but maybe take the microphone and then then you'll be on the live stream just two quick questions one five five five and then you just summarize economics of it all just the economics of know right now the microphones are content provider yeah why should anybody listen to me giving me tokens like they don't have them like I'm kind of lost in this okay in terms of why they should give it to you specifically as kind of creator of content by I don't know but I do work with people who create a lot of content and you know the whole lives it's crazy content Roman for example is creating amazing music every single day is not about a year and yeah you can show your your your etherium public address to anyone who read this is more in terms of like paying the content creators or the producers or the broadcasters directly this isn't the likely project life care project is purely about building fundamental based foundation so like we're a nice big building here but this building has a big concrete block in the bottom that's like the core the stable bit what we're seeking to do is to build the best we can global infrastructure for live streaming it's a sense sometimes my analogy I use is you can put antenna on top of a building and broadcast radio waves for TV or for sound and that's like imitating where you can get to based on the earth so what what we're trying to do is a bit more around digital version of radio waves that anyone who broadcast on so in terms of the economics of how the this protocol is seeking to be to be built well I don't I don't know which bit maybe could you be more a little more focus for you yeah thank you and there actually answers part but up great still so so one part is providing some sort of feed and it's going someplace and you have newly-minted totals that you mentioned right so where do they come from where how are they generated just okay so so the the newly-minted tokens I believe are generated by the node themselves we have safeguards in place to stop people from gaming and just stealing all the tokens the the creation of newly minted tokens is an intentional thing to also create some kind of inflationary mechanism within the system so if new tokens are being created all the time the total supply is going up all the time if you are not participating with your tokens in the network if you're holding them and keeping them in your wallet and not playing nicely the value of your tokens is slowly going around based on the inflation has built into the the economic system this we're hoping and expecting will provide crates and incentive people to actually participate somehow even if it's just at the level of me staging like my tokens to Maurice is known but I feel like this is something that we that would encourage more participation more awareness a greater interest in what it is that the networks actually doing more participation and contribution I guess again I don't know if have answered the question so nearly wood tokens nice we needed yes that's right I have intended to provide the vector system and therefore I keep them back into the system and I'm just not too sure whether you know that the function of the stove Eliot really comes into this thing it's the kind of a financial the financialization of this basically immediately proceed you up tomorrow and and the spacing explained to me greater detail sure shop as as you like um but [Music] Mike there's a cool economic mechanism within life here where they target a participation rate and basically fluctuate the inflation rate to purchase to target a certain percentage of the flow that's being staked by the media servers and so it's a inversion of how we typically think of the economics of these systems where historically we targeted inflation rates and hope for certain participation rate like peers really inverting that so I think that would be something really fascinating to watch okay can you go back to the diagram with all of the participants from the colony to the poverty is colder and distribution they think you mean this one I think so yeah okay so where does the decentralized so what is your network doing so we here we are broadcast as we're sending you to a decentralized stubborn oh there's just one server who receives I'll repeat this is great right now I am streaming from the content source to one server that's receiving this on the Lifetime network I mean this some of those donors who you would stop or would it automatically automatically find another server right now for sure it will stop momentarily at the very least I'm not aware of exactly how like failure handling is built within the system right now but like eventually I think it would be that it would get handed over to somebody else okay December for example provides three different types that are sent to another server that is able to distribute in the district content distribution network artistís this is just one summer or is it the same two separate stomachs at the same time so what what I'll just clarifies if this is this isn't life here this picture this picture is how it works in the industry today so if you're for example streaming to YouTube the first thing you will do is transcribe your content and then it will it will disseminate this out into its network of content distribution yeah at home are you doing this using a combination of transferring nodes and read a knows who will spread the content forever Network there's also like the peer-to-peer thing that if we have one node broadcasting and another node transcoding in the third node viewing and actually that's all we need an assistant to be able to get content across and how I refused service all incentivises soul who I hated with life pure tokens of a decent orbit great question so we the life a token can be used for payment then can be used to pay your rent and so unlike any RC 20 token but it's primarily designed as the stake in terms of stating mechanism so in that regard in some ways it feels a little bit more like equity than currency but the payment to the trans made in 80 years in 2013 this is what we see is a value of being part of the etherium ecosystem so if you want to pay annalisa go if you want to pay in basic attention to open or anything and it's dead out of cases what does the transcoder accept in terms of payment and what are their rates in goal and attentiveness or whatever it'll be okay and for example something crazy happens somewhere everyone and I want to be like pregnant and millions of people want to see this means I need at least ten thousand servers or ten thousand loans to distribute the information and this means any ten thousand transactions would would take about an hour maybe longer to just to rush into anything else if we take an hour just to pay services and sacrifice it was rightly I believe not what I believe is that it would the smart contract and the money changes hands for the job of transcoding so that's like the fundamental base building block of what the nodes are doing after that in relaying has done exactly how that works apply the protocol I'm not the best person to answer that one okay who's now right right right this so let's assume I'm running a load yep so I'm transferring content yeah do I also act as a CDN or something else I guess it's the very base level if you if you are storing content and passing it on in the air this is this is the fundamental jaw of the CDN yeah so then can I just mainly not cancel but just for the trans folder and just keep passing it on because I don't door mother transmitting mm really yeah and say yes so do you also disrupt like Akamai or other stuff okay it's a great question possibly akame yeah right I mean that there are huge yeah right so the rhythm does a lot of potential value here there's a lot of potential benefits that can be gained by having decentralized live streaming we're starting with the first step in the process so building a protocol that is based around transcoding because it's the first thing that needs to get done before anything else happens can I in visitor a scenario where in some years time the protocol has been tweaked so that it's also designed to incentivize CDN like capabilities absolutely are we building that right now no like other startups and also potentially other blockchain collective projects but also part of the lively community you know if if the life peer token gets into the hands of enough people who have the ability to bring their expertise and their energy to to make the overall network stronger then they stand to benefit from it so and another question is like it's about distributed information at the end of today and if I block somehow the interior network do I also I also block your services like if it gets locked somehow let's assume like you can speed it up but okay how I'm gonna approach to it and is something that a lot of people who want to blow at some point if it gets bigger than bigger right so can an attack to your network like well what are the attack points that you imagine yes Wow it's a it's a good question is okay like like this does the level of thinking about this which is when the policeman comes to your house and says you must stop streaming this and you say no and he cuts a cable on a wire that's an attack point but then there's also like massive distributed denial-of-service on a theory and network and on the whole life grid network and knows all of these things are possible okay yes can it be make lakhtin agnostic can you see like yeah [Music] like we don't measure on them I don't know my job it's say again a cryptocurrency but what they're saying is that okay like one chain my somehow I get attacked so I'm gonna give you the cryptocurrency that runs all these proteins like interesting experiences right such a not be like to impart to delete them right so much and it's it's maybe I'm kind of going during speaking an attorney but I'm pretty sure it can exist on other block chains it's not absolutely tied to ethereal but we're using a theory at the moment cuz they provide the most convenient place for us to innovate on if someone came along and said we want to port the light they go to the Bitcoin blockchain we'd be like go for it good luck Wow okay and it's running even even more place it's cool but the details of how that will work definitely or not I don't have in my head right now but I'm sure it's possible but maybe some other people in the room I'm swinging me thank you beauty concepts nice nice whoa oh yeah you are school the hard Preston's nice let's bring it on I would like to your old world too technical details but just into that first question is that like if somebody's I think as a broadcaster there might be like an issue like that in a plot I don't know what the hell I like that tough meeting can it be like in a way like a potentially dangerous for me being like a zoo because I'm acting like the broadcaster we don't you may not like a control of life do you mean if you're breaking the law and broadcasting yourself on live TV can you get as a note right right it can get dangerous holy lady I saw you take a computing all private keys I think some small story each other you just use my CPU right so at the moment there are very there are lots of gray areas in terms of legal implications for running a node the kind of a sense of resistance stuff is interesting for a lot of people who want to do positive things with it but also interesting for a lot of people who maybe want to do things that we wouldn't want to see happen if you're setting yourself up as a node then you know I'm live on TV now I probably don't want to answer that question because I don't fully know the answer myself but I think a lot of it is going to come down to how the community deals with things like this certainly in the case of like if you see content that you don't like where's the button to say report this content the community this kind of thing life there we're not focusing on that bit yet we're kind of hoping and hoping that someone in the community will build that or we will at some point if we end up kind of trying to turn our system into a lot of YouTube but I feel if we do that then we might miss some opportunities but yeah right right now there was definitely some unanswered questions around legal implications for running transcoding node that could be sending out illegal content great great question so when we're live-streaming so I'm using a business optical OBS open broadcast studio and from this you can recall you can live stream content directly from live cameras and microphones but also you can live stream recorded content so it does open up interesting implications for piracy laws as well so that's but it's more of a curated push than a sea and massive underrated on-demand content that makes sense upon submitting your questions yes nice very nice okay maybe that's it Maurice I think baby it's worked and it's still working very nice community in Berlin we come and see anything that a community space yes thank you all very much for coming and please feel free to lay on here for the next half an hour to discuss with everyone I hope to see you next time next one and that's it the next meetup CD on the 22nd of March [Music] [Music]
