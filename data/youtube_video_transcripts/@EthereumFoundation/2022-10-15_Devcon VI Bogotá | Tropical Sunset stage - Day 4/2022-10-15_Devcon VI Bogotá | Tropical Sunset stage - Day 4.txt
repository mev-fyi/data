a small crowd because it's early this morning but I want to welcome you to the last day of Devcon thank you all for being here we're starting off with a panel on web3 adoption in Africa and we have a great crew here today um the panel is being moderated by Yosef and he is being joined by themes Tony Benson and Anda please welcome them good morning everyone thanks for making it out so welcome to this panel conversation about web free adoption on the African continent how many of you have been to anywhere in Africa here before awesome how many of you are working with anyone from the continent fantastic how many of you are just curious to know about the continent awesome so we'll try to do justice today to give you a little bit of a snippet of the exciting things the challenges the perspectives from the ground and one of the reasons why we actually wanted to do this is many each events that at least I've been to around the world we hear about Africa from people who are looking from the outside in as opposed to people who are actually building things on the ground so I think it would be really amazing for us to really understand this beautiful amazing continent that has so much potential that we don't even understand what that potential is um to give you an example and I don't know how many of you might be aware but Africa right now is 1.4 billion people uh and we have the fastest growing population the youngest population the median age is 18.8 years so very very very young and and we're expected to get between 2.4 to 2.8 million billion people uh by 2050. just to give you like put that in context um we're going to have twice as many young people as all the young people in China uh in the next 18 years 50 more than all the young people in India and our young people are going to be almost three times as many young people in the US and Europe combined so if you're kind of thinking about youth age Workforce Talent base a lot is developing in the continent of Africa and the economy is growing really fast as well we talk about Finance about 500 plus million Africans have access to banking infrastructure similar number of people who have access to Internet mostly through mobile phones internet money is huge on the continent the economic growth is expected to reach you know about 6.7 trillion dollars of consumer and retails and business spending uh by 2030. so there's a lot of capital it's not just you know sometimes we look at Africa as the probably like population to help and support was actually real talent-based real economic activity real access is not enough there's a lot more to build but at least that kind of sets the the core Foundation of um how we can think about the continent and the opportunities there so that's a bit of overview and afrobeatsis is actually going to take over the world yeah afrobeats is going to take over the world I'm a piano do you guys have any other genre Bongo flavor no um yeah so let's just do brief introductions of ourselves here uh maybe Tony could you kick yourself yeah hi everyone my name is Tony Orlando um been a software engineer for about 10 years I currently work at polygon as the senior education Solutions architect with responsibility for zero knowledge technology um I am a early member of developer Dao I worked at coordinape and I'm really excited about education opportunities in Africa and that's why I uh now I'm involved with the web with the web 3 Africa and afrofuture which um which has like uh the premier nft artists um across Africa and we have like fellowships and drops that we do um where we work with a lot of African artists hi everyone I'm andan NABA I serve as chief of operations at the University of Cape Town Financial Innovation up in South Africa uh there we essentially translate academic research into novel blockchain applications so we'll work with Masters PhD and postdoc students to convert their thesis ideas and topics into an Azure plugin application ranging from everything from offline payments to nfts for Content collaborations to privacy preserving table wallets great thanks via I um my name is femes I'm a dow governance engineer and researcher I'm helping Dallas and protocols build better governance I also the co-founder of the Dow governance education sessions which is basically a community of almost close to 100 people of Dow governance operators and enthusiasts so that we can learn different models and tactics to build better together good morning everyone my name is Benson yoguna I come from Kenya I I work with the ethereum foundation as a fellow to promote the next billion use cases from Africa I'm also a founder of safari Dao East Kenya community and contributor in Africa defy Alliance and also working with smallholder Farmers to de-risk them from effects of climate change glad to be here expecting good conversations thank you awesome uh and my name is Joseph Ayala I am from Ethiopia grew up in Tanzania and Kenya and a huge part of my passion right now is increasing the level of Education around Webster across the continent seeing a lot more protocols and projects that are building the future economic infrastructures and the continent coming out and also helping develop a new narrative for the continent which is so far we've been talking about Africa needing crypto to develop and back the unbanked and all of that but actually the deeper I go the more I see that actually here the web3 community really needs Africa to fulfill its potential and reach the stage where we have mass adoption and billions of people using the technologies that we're building as their as their plan a as opposed to an option to something that's already working so and we're supposed to have actually so many more African Builders here with us to share this perspectives but because of the Visa challenges many African Builders couldn't be here which is kind of a case in point that a huge part of the world is closed off for Africans at the moment and so we need to have Defcon and many events happening on the continent so that many of you can come and experience the full potential and opportunity on the continent yeah and to actually put a number to to that we had about eight Builders these are people who are building stuff on the ground in Africa who who couldn't get Colombian Visa so yeah yeah so Bogota Defcon in Africa sometime very soon let's make it happen yeah awesome so we have a number of themes to unpack here today and I guess the biggest one that many of us are really excited about is around the talent base and what that really looks like in the context of web3 and I love to just ask fiends just to share with us a little bit of what are the aspects of African talent that is really not understood and what are the biggest opportunities that you see when it comes to web 3 and African Talent yeah I think uh many things that are misunderstood around the talent in Africa is that we have close to one of the largest numbers of entrepreneurs in the region um you know there is this continual Narrative of you know helping the unbanked but there's an opportunity also to engage those in mid or senior level positions to transition their skill sets into the ecosystem um so I think that there's a huge potential particularly since majority of the population is under the age of 35. so we have an opportunity to grow to build together and the adoption when it comes to the internet or or TR or D or D5 will be growing rapidly but it should be led by Africans for Africans yeah maybe to contribute in what I've seen uh web 2 developers we very talented we have most high number of developers working for international organizations remotely others have moved out so we we see a lot of uh interests for web 2 developers to move to Earth three so in fact one of the barriers that we we were solving is the education bit because most of the web tool will ask you why should I move from web 2 to web3 then you realize it's a capacity building issue because of the benefits web 3 offers so a lot of work being done by polygon to move people from web to web 3 and yeah that has been mentioned as one of the challenges but we need to continually close that Gap I guess from my side as well we partnered with party on an impact plus to do a web 2 to web 3 bootcamp for developers about two weeks ago and we intend on doing their monthly now focusing primarily on people at the University doing computer science we're now trying to transfer over and we're seeing so much interest like our list was over subscriber people who wanted to attend and that just shows you you know how interested people are we also have the first Masters in fintech and blockchain at University of Cape Town every uh oversubscribed 55 woman this year 90 black Africans it's amazing to see and yeah thank you um yeah so for me I think um I see a lot of potential inside of the education space um specifically because I mean I was there before Google or Amazon or Facebook had presence in Africa and so a lot of my friends we were just like regular developers and um Google Google you eventually came and set up shop Microsoft came and uh and set up shop um Facebook came through andela and we saw like as a surge in terms of just like income and and then just impact and just quality even of like engineering and I think web2 understands the potential of Africa and I think I'm I'm not seeing protocols fully understanding the full potential of Africa inside of web 3. a lot of what I'm seeing currently are like extractive initiatives where um it's basically Shilling so I am export to call I'm actually going to come and set up and the whole goal is for me to actually get you to use my platform I don't really care about you as a as a developer and I think one of the the biggest challenges with that is that is the inside of web 2 incentives are really clear I am here to do a job you are here to pay me in web 3 I think it should be it should be slightly different and so how we how we motivate and how we educate existing engineering talent in Africa um really really matters um at the level of just base interest I think the the announcement of the polygon Africa boot camp um the blog post was a was was the best performing blog post in the history of the polygon blog so it like the interest is massive and then it's huge but if we don't have education initiatives that are centering around empowering the actual developers then you will actually show and the developers are getting smarter so they know that you that your protocol will offer swag and will offer bounties and will offer this and that fine I'll take the money and then I'll move on from this to that to that to that but so um the main thing that I would like to see really is like a the very sober consideration in terms of what is what is the level of Education impact that I want to have um and then I think anybody who thinks like that would have a massive Roi because you will be building Community you'll be building um the next wave of African developers one of the things that is a little different from many other markets that is hardly understood is actually most devs if you just even look at developers most devs are self-taught or learning how to do development on the job so recently Google and IFC did a study and they found actually it's only a third of developers that learned the skills through formal education the rest are basically self-taught and actually when I'm on the ground and chatting with a bunch of people at you know community events and so on most people I'm coming across they taught themselves solidity on YouTube without anyone hand holding them and so when you think about education yeah you can have programs and structures and all of that but also understand that it's a very determined hungry self-driven community that you're working with and I think that really sets African Talent very different from Global Talent because it's there's less entitlement less of a position of hey I have 15 things I can work on I might show up I might not show up it's the word really means a lot to people and they're building and investing their time and energy to actually build a career and get involved in this space and actually talking about web 2 and web 3 when I talk to people who are transitioning from web 2 to web 3 this narrative and this idea that there's no one basically creating a ceiling for you you're not moving you're not moving Upward at a rate that your manager sets for you you're not being told what you can work what you cannot work on in a way that actually boxes your potential I think web free and getting into this space means freedom means self-determination and that really speaks to that sort of individual driven self-learning mentality yeah I've also seen apart from web 2 or the developer Talent we have other talents like Community Builders people who are really good in mobilization really good in online social Media communication doing a good job because at the end of the day developers get to learn of things going on through such people and uh yeah it's still a space that we feel needs more and more people we see um change evm1 chains hiring relationship managers Community Builders ambassadors which is a really good thing since it helps push even the the benefits of web3 into the market but outside of a focus of development like my background is in public policy and information Sciences so there's a lot of opportunity for people to actually participate in this ecosystem I think what also sets Africa apart is that we're solving problems for today and not 10 years from now and so I think that we have the opportunity to support this entrepreneurial spirit that already exists there to actually not only help the continent but to help help globally as well because many people don't have the luxury to like you know wait for 10 years for something to get better we have to build better systems but we also have to build Bridges so that we can actually leverage the talent that is already there to build a better ecosystem I completely agree a lot of the work we do at the University there'll be lines of people trying to get into our Hub you know like when people found out there was a blockchain based Hub at the University of Cape Town they thought it was a lie so people would always come knock on our door back is this really you know for Wave 3 stuff and you're like yes it is and we've really sanded ourselves around solving African problems it's Unique African problems because we see the power of Wave 3 and blocking and what it can do and on your point I feel like this community needs us more than we need them you know and when you're on the ground you ready get to see that you know so it's quite it's quite telling I have one hypothesis and it'd be great to hear if it's true or not and what you all think about it so one pattern that I'm observing is uh a number especially younger Talent gets into web three initially it's all about how can I increase my earning capacity how can I earn Global income and stay at home and then once people get to a certain level of comfort and say hey I'm out of survival mindset let me actually think about what I can build what sort of problems can we solve together is that is that something that you guys are are seeing from across the continent yes that's that's for sure I can give you a story of myself when I finished campus where in fact education in campus I did computer science but it was only 20 percent programming you do the rest on your own self train all developers not one has learned everything from school you do it by self training now after I finished uh I started a startup in fact I was selected among the 20 uh budding entrepreneurs but then you have to pay bills you have to move or move from the seat I moved from the village to the city you have to pay rent you have to eat so without for example funding and you're starting such a startup you you your mindset is hey let me stop trying to build this let me start surviving let me start paying for my rent let me look for food and then I'll come back later so actually I stopped building the startup and moved on to former appointment for a while to save up but actually it's a real a real thing yes I think the other on the funding Point there's definitely a shortage but we're now seeing interests like CBC cvvc from zuk and Switzerland just open offices in Cape Town they're raising a 20 million dollar fund trying to invest in I think over 100 startups all based on blockchain and a lot of other VCS now based on the continent are not looking to web3 so I'm hoping the funding app can be filled but I think it's not just VCS I need to come to the table it's it's also the the protocols as well that need to fund these projects at an early stage kind of like what UNICEF is also doing with their Venture fund someone has to take the risk first unfortunately unfortunately you know and I'm hoping to see more of that yeah and I think that's a really important point because um there's a lot of aversion even when I talk to protocols about doing something in Africa um one one of one of the biggest questions I have is we want to see something you've done before we want to see like something that looks basically they want to see a model a European model that applies to something that they've seen before before they want to invest in Africa and it's usually a really frustrating conversation for me because I'm like if you're looking for if you're looking for something that is European then um please go and build there you know um but specifically for me and I'm sorry I I I just won't have a filter because I'm too tired of the rule of all these conversations and people have the passionate and they see yeah and every time they say yeah we have a passion for Africa we care about diversity and inclusion but nobody wants to put their money where their mouth is um but but but specifically to your to your particular question that that is that is my own experience but also that is the experience of very many people in terms of um there's a because of the because of the social economic like status of Africa you have you most of our developers have that initial need for like a Ubi that enables them to actually think and ideate and just be at peace you know and so which is why I think um some of those Learn to Earn models would actually be really really successful um because once it is I don't have to I I don't have to think about meals and all of these things and making my rent and I could just focus on building it becomes something that is actually really really powerful I remember I was in a um I was in a boot camp and a bunch of the people I was in this was like a global boot camp and a bunch of the people I was in I was with were from different parts of the world and they said that they actually quit their jobs to be a part of the boot camp and I at the time just could not afford to actually do that um because of the social economic status but but um over time we have to start to invest more and more and I think some of those Learn to Earn models um would be really impactful for protocols to begin to consider and just one thing I want a presence that themes touched upon is that you know at the moment we're talking a lot about devs but there's so much other type of talent that exists there and I think one of the most exciting patterns that I've also seen as an entry point is writers people coming in and doing technical writing and you know it's it's incredible amount of talent and using that to actually help Translate what this space is about to a broader audience um which is really about is really important it's really valuable and uh there's BankPlus Africa also like a a growing Community that's built on top of the bank list now I don't know if do you guys follow like the bank list down newsletter pretty much every newsletter that I'm receiving somewhere on top is an update from bankless Africa so that's a group that's got like their stuff together yeah yeah I think the thing is is that like I don't want to like there's a continued narrative that all Africans are poor and rely on a scarcity mindset and I think that that's what it's really important to really engage those in the middle and senior level positions because although they are in a mid or senior level positions when they apply for jobs in the United States or counts in the United States they say that they don't have like American experience and so for me working in Dallas provides me an Access not only to network but opportunity to actually build things and build my credibility within it too and so I think that it's really important to make those connections so devs transitioning to web3 that's easy right and so you bring in more writers you bring in more researchers you bring in more brand strategists and there we're actually going to be providing an opportunity not only for them to to develop funding but also build reputation which is acceptable in the globalized perspective and so I think that what we really should be focusing on is like our lowest hanging fruits and that that's really the mid to senior level because when you act on a scarcity mindset you're not going to be able or have the ability to take advantage of the networks or opportunities or take risks within those ecosystems and so for me I think like dials are an opportunity for you to actually build products test it out and also build a network so that you can grow not only regionally but internationally as well yeah and just my own personal hypothesis is dolls are just digital tribes and so basically the Tao model inside of Africa would have particular success and different kind of like um application big just just simply because of the whole notion of community and people working together towards they are towards a common good and people having that kind of philosophy I think is something that could be explored really powerfully I know in South Africa we have the saying I am because we are and I feel like Tao's really embody that it goes beyond you as an individual and I think yeah the uptake in Dows in Africa I think will be high based on our just our culture you know and how we look at working together individuality is not really a thing there you know it's all about teams and communities and yeah and tribes one uh one really cool project that I've been building a good relationship with so far that many of us know is called a web tree Bridge it's based in Nigeria and they've been around since 2019 and I find them like to do such a cool mix between Community Building Hanson skill skills education as well as providing the values based foundation so that people are getting to this space really know first why does web free even matter what are the values of decentralization why does it make sense and it's one of the projects that is basically like having people stay there full-time in person being fed being housed learning Building Together doing hackathons doing challenges building the online profile getting the GitHub Pages like you know populated and the credentials online and participating in an economy where actually no one really cares what your name is where you live where you're from how old you are if you know how to execute if you know how to build you've got a track record and people will work with you and I think that's such a game changer for a huge part of the continent um where you know people try to apply for jobs and all of that and like it's hard it's hard and there's a bias against you know you're from Africa people don't know what to trust uh but if you move to a much more meritocratic environment actually like your work speaks for itself and and I think that's such a a powerful aspect of what's being built here yeah and um please don't do location-based pay please because it's not fair it's not fair that um a a developer who has a similar output um a a African developer who has similar output to a to a sub to a SF developer deserves to get paid the same amount and I think we need to actually correct that it's actually it's not even just don't do it it's the other way around like people I know who are being paid a fraction of what their counterparts in other worlds are paying a fifth yeah they're basically saying yeah I'm just here to do what I need to do but as soon as I find something better I'm gonna leave so actually you're not getting someone who'll stick with you for a long time because this is an open ecosystem so you'll have more to lose in the long term if you start taking shortcuts the same way as you know layer ones and Protocols are coming during education as marketing um you're breeding mercenaries and people will leave you right away people are smart so if you're align your success with the success of people you will be the really solid infrastructure and and solid users solid team members well I think the important thing about web3 though too is that it has an opportunity for personal branding right and so independent of what location you live in if you do really good work and you promote yourself and you Pro like produce something that has a product Market fit and generates Revenue then you have that opportunity and so just to add with Dows though so Dows are not necessarily places for people to Just Vibe or develop a community it's a potential for you to develop a revenue generating model that aligns not only in value and purpose but actually output as well so for me Dows are not a place for me to necessarily build things but it's a place for me to actually Network upskill and then build things outside of it yeah I like to just shift the gear conscious of time towards financial services and access to finance because that's a huge part of this conversation and a low hanging fruit as well um maybe come to your Benson just to let us give us a little bit of a perspective from the lens you look at in terms of how web3 crypto and financial services are sort of working together thank you um in terms of financial services when it comes to to peer to peer transactions Africa is leading that shows a huge need uh we we feel the the problems of outright leading in financial services is some of the countries the regulations are not outright saying we support this you're just saying use it at your own Payroll use it or don't risk others are saying we completely burn it others are quiet so but in the in the ground people actually trading peer-to-peer exchange and the statistics show Africa is leading globally now on the other end in web 2 in terms of mobile money we see also the highest number of transactions coming from from Africa uh where the penetration of mobile particularly I talk about Kenya is very high which is over 98 percent and that means people are actually using digital money it's digital because they moved to a shop give out fiat currency and they receive it as a text message on their phone and able to exchange for goods and services so what this shows is the digital education people are ready they have for digital is not as high it's very easy to train anybody because of the experiences of using mobile money yeah just one example on that so every time I'm traveling in Kenya Ethiopia and Nigeria I'm not using my card I'm not using Fiat I'm only using peer-to-peer moving U.S a stable coin to local currency either through online banking or through m-pesa and basically pray for every single bill even small little shop to get a candidate to the boat ride in the middle of a village or whatever using that so some of the infrastructure actually is way more sophisticated than what you have in the West in terms of payment systems and all of that yeah yeah for sure for sure yeah so the infrastructure is good the internet needs can be better but now that we have challenges in still the same the transaction fees the the loan interest rates such things which we think need to be sold so what's the biggest need then if if we have some of those things what is the biggest need so the biggest need I feel is the for my in my own perspective is the credit Gap so more people need to access Credit that can help them in their Enterprises but then these people yes they're using mobile money but then there is what we call Credit scoring uh we are glad the new president of Kenya is saying we need to remove people from The Blacklist because most people who've done mobile money borrowing and they were not able to pay in some Blacklist and they cannot borrow again um so we we feel we need to to open access to credit and in a way build build economic identities through their transactions which now we can help them access cheaper loans here hmm well I just wanted to add in the areas of remittance as well is what the the benefits so remittance of not everybody knows is when you send money from to back to your home country and so those also have like a middle cost as well and then the like efficiency of sending cryptocurrency and the immediateness of it as well as a benefit and that's like a billion dollar industry right there so I think that we have an opportunity really because they're already using peer-to-peer to kind of merge that and also get paid in crypto so if you get paid in your stable coins or particular like it's not location based payment 88 of all crypto transactions are cross-border transactions um so the remittance part is actually really huge and and a huge part of it has been driven by shortage of foreign currency is really really hard to access dollars and a big part of it is we're just not exporting enough as we're importing and some countries keep part of their uh foreign currency Reserve in the French treasury so just to give you some education here there's this thing called the CFA which stands for French colonies of Africa 14 countries are on it it's Saturday 1945. what that basically means is they have a second currency called CFA in relation to their local currency and in return they have to deposit 50 percent of their foreign currency Reserve in the French Treasury and the French government also determines sort of how much you can borrow land and all of that as a nation and basically you're earning income but half of it you don't get to bring it to your country and that basically is in some parts like it's some people say it's helping create lower inflation compared to other countries um but you don't have autonomy over your money and it creates such a huge need and so you go to Ethiopia for example there's a hundred percent premium for accessing dollars and stable coins so you basically paying twice as much for one dollar as the bank rate is you go to Nigeria last week it was 70 premium compared to the bank rate because there's such high demand for foreign currency and people are basically overriding that and using peer-to-peer stable coin to basically buy things from overseas in order to sell like how can you do any type of Commerce if our global economy is highly interconnected so the the remittance part is actually to me is like more than a trillion billion dollar industry across the continent and we still haven't fully cracked it I also think you know when we speak about banking then banked Financial Services in Africa it's not one it's not one it's not one sort of structure there's so many countries like South Africa's Financial Services System is completely different from Kenya's yeah and the solutions we might need are very different like maybe we share similarities with sort of alternative sources of credit but in terms of peer-to-peer challenges or something it's it's you know it's fundamentally different so I think when you guys and anyone speaks about it B don't speak about it as one monolith uh you know idea there's so many different countries and cultures and situations that can be built yeah yeah um so I think one of the most impactful areas I live in Trinidad and Tobago and um my mother lives in Kenya and during covet I had to send money to her um and I think the payment reels that were available at the time there's virtually no way for me to send money from my Trinidadian Bank to her Canyon Bank none so I have to go through PayPal and not my PayPal but my my my close friend who lives in the U.S I kind of have to use his account and then he then settles directly to m-pesa and I think it cost me about 40 percent like in transaction fees um I got her on to crypto and life is a lot easier now um so I just want to I just want to shout out like some of those practical examples and I know this is an eth conference but bitnob um is using the Bitcoin lightning Network right now and they launched and you could actually trade and send like do foreign remittances directly to m-pesa using the Bitcoin lightning Network and those are some of the like interesting applications that we need but specifically um one of the areas that I think would be is actually severely constrained is like on-ramps and off-ramps and I don't want to preempt the next conversation which is like regulation but on-ramps and off-ramps uh uh continue to be like a bit of a constraint and so right now we have a lot of peer-to-peer mechanisms that allow people to exchange Fiat for crypto and the and there's there's need for um some some level of just base Innovation and Regulatory um support so that we could actually have sufficient well clear clear clear um specifically on ramps because Regulators realize that they could actually stop crypto on ramps and that helps keep the foreign currency within the area um but I did want to also talk about this not just in the context of foreign remittances and Africans need money and send us a dollar a day um but specific Innovation on I just hope I was hoping Ben could give us like a tldr of what he does and the specific Innovation that he's doing set at the defy space and specifically with insurance so Ben could you just give us like a overview of what you do because I think it's one of the most Innovative Concepts I've heard thank you thank you very much um so for for us we we Endeavor to solve the the insurance penetration problem so there was only two percent penetration of insurance for the Agri sector so the target was uh enterprising individuals who were able to generate some small income how can we ensure they're able to generate this consistently and it can help them grow and eventually without any help from outside they can build themselves so because we realized one event like one drought wipes out their savings wipes out their money to use for next season money to pay for school fees so we went uh so we started with the farmers and we we actually uh realized the lack of participation in insurance is the lack of trust so they they would receive Insurance somebody saw the problem traditional insurance companies came in brought in agents who sold but then they disappeared you don't see them after six months again when the next season comes when it's when they come then when it comes to payouts we don't know how much when how it's all a black box we it's very opaque so with that problem we now put this uh on blockchain where now we're able to put up the triggers so we are paying uh it's parametric insurance so if there is rainfall below a certain parameter then we trigger a payout and that list is generated and connected to mobile money uh which Now using a smart contract it's able to constantly check the existing weather conditions uh we and then after a period of time it can say now pay out this amount of money to this person the second thing using ussd that's where you dial State hundred hash Etc the farmers can now check the status of their policy by dialing thou be told okay you have triggered 25 percent so by the end of the season we foresee you will get around 400 Kenyan shillings so which is really Bridging the trust problem and helping more more people want now to adopt Insurance especially the farmers yeah yeah I really like the experimentation around the insurance space because we'll like as you said we talk a lot about finance and it's all about sort of sending receiving money and also uh just local payment systems but if you think about all the different sophisticated economic and financial infrastructures that you need basically we're we have some things but we've got a lot to build and I think what web3 rails allow us to do is build them with the right fundamentals and in a way that actually works for the local economic and social political Dynamics and I think that's something that sometimes people from outside coming in saying hey this makes a lot of sense let's just build it for you actually it's not that simple because um you're entering uh a whole economic environment where Dynamics are very very different from what you're used to and I think what your your example really shows sort of how you can build a bottom-up solution to addressing such a huge Market yeah let's talk regulation and policy but before we jump into like the specifics um I guess one thing I like to mention is um a lot of the conversations about crypto policy that have happened so far with policy makers is hey how can we legalize this token how can we buy this crypto how can we make it easier to sell and I think some conversations that really missing is really zooming out and helping educate African policy makers and leaders like why should we move to a digital economy let's have that broader conversation to really help understand why we're in it and then the token is really the last part of the discussion and like walk through the the whole journey of why this makes sense for you why you all have actually more sovereignty more income more stability and like make building that narrative so I just want to kind of point out that's the scenario that's really missing but I think it is important for us to also talk about the regulatory conversation specifically to access to financial services yeah so um so I hail from Kenya and we have one of the most vocal Central Bank well one of the most vocal Governors who speaks very um negatively about crypto so he is very team ngmi and um we've seen how that has stifled stifled Innovation inside of the crypto space because we had startups that would have would have um would have been much further along this is five years ago and I won't go into the specifics of all the drama that that occurred but essentially when we the the level of the intervention that is actually required is a lot more education around um well the education director towards policy makers and regulators and specifically showing their models of how regulation could actually work instead of this particular space that makes things that that basically allows Innovation and um and um and development to actually occur inside of the ecosystem and I think a lot of a lot of the Paradigm that they basically come from is that they see um they see crypto as being like opposed to what they are trying to do and to their existing Financial system while it is actually complementary and so um we need a lot more education in in actually showing that no there's actual there's actual economic impact and value in you creating a favorable regulatory environment for the adoption of crypto and I think Sheedy was telling us a story about how they intervened in um in Uganda and the central bank said we don't want crypto we don't want to see anybody using crypto and they went and they had conversations with the with the regulators and they were able to change and a few weeks later there was actual development we have no such luck in Kenya um but those are the types of conversations that I think we need to have in terms of just exposing the complementary nature of um of crypto hell even if even if it's a cbdc I'll I will take it but yeah yeah I know what we've done uh We've working with us African Reserve Bank so our Central Bank and they've funded two masters students and a PhD student to do thesis research around Financial stability and crypto guarantees and they're now coming to the table if you've listened to the South African kavana uh before they were very anti-cryptocurrency but in the last two months they are now forcing all the local banks to reopen their accounts of the cryptocurrency exchanges and this is months of us is going back and forth than speaking to them imagine getting Master students to write a thesis topic over two years and they were starting to listen we think you know because he writed that stifle Innovation a lot and African government so I hate to to generalize they want control of everything and unfortunately in this game that's not how it works so I I hope to still hear different yeah when I actually talk to people who are working directly with central banks across African countries the sentiment that I'm hearing is actually they're not categorically opposed to this space so it's not sort of a fundamental like no no no the challenge that I don't know about Kenyans but maybe I'm talking from the Nigerian lens here now um the the Nars that I'm hearing is actually that they are trying to get to act more financial sovereignty like themselves because there's a lot of foreign interference there's a whole lot of dependence even for printing your own currency more than 40 African countries prints their bills overseas and they pay six percent fee on all the currency that they have shipped to their country to whoever is doing the printing press work and I think they're interested in central cbdc's I think they're like what I'm hearing is they're building like an internal Network across many central banks across the whole continent to even be able to do settlement amongst one another without having to go through Swift or without having to go through these major Global players and having to use US dollars or Euro and all of that so that's those are the problems that they're trying to Grapple with and so I think working with them on a step-by-step basis I think as you talked about could potentially really yield better results long term yeah let me allow some government institutions because we have others who are really helpful in for example the capital markets where they're creating a Sandbox they say come and experiment with anything that is looks like a security which includes crypto so this is giving people opportunity to to apply then for example the regulator in Insurance also has a Sandbox come and experiment some of the solutions so such such if we see more governments going that direction to be really helpful because even m-pesa which is now really huge in the continent began with regulation issues the central bank we do not know where to place it is it under the the bank side is it under the saving side so it didn't uh yeah but because it was just an innovation they had to adopt so I feel it's the same thing with crypto as I read the commentary on line it's a host that has been let out of the race now it's already out it's running you can't block it so you yeah like you see one thing that the government's also noticing is the capital or the money coming in for example in terms of money that came in in Africa between May 2020 and 2021 was 1.105. something billion dollars so when they see such things they say oh it can actually benefit you can actually bring in development uh in the country so I think more and more The Regulators are changing their stance we even had some comments from the governor of like the Kenyan Central weeks ago and you can hear the change of stances or because now they understand crypto and blockchain better yeah um so just to add to that politicians are motivated by their constituents right and so why I got into doubt governance because I was a political scientist as well is that our systems weren't designed for us so I think Community design is really important when you're doing these but also you can engage people through experiential learning by participating in governance so they actually show up for those meetings and say hey we want this to actually be implemented and so I think we have an opportunity really to participate and design better systems that we can then replicate into the real world I'm into that um just conscious of time here um we have we had a number of other things to cover with with you all but would be amazing just to hear questions that people have so that we engage a bit more um does anyone want to ask questions here thank you how's it going um really enjoyed the panel I have a lot of questions but I'm just going to ask too I want to know what are the sentiments of pan-africanism in light of crypto and how it enables Nations to be a lot more collaborative especially on one network like ethereum and then second question is just are you all on Twitter social media uh for me I I can I can't say I've seen uh crypto or cryptocurrency bringing people want to become one one African no it's still a political uh uh issue uh the economics of it has not really influenced the politics yet yeah gotcha and my my Twitter is Benson underscore you gonna telegram is Ben juguna okay I forgot as one thing is because we can collectively you know design these systems or talk about it in like in a more like greater light but it is it has like 52 countries it's a continent right it's very deep it has histories as well and so I think that really aligns us is that we have a huge unemployment rate you know we have entrepreneurs and we have opportunities to build the continent better but that is not devoid of our individual like countries or cultures or motivations um and I'm on Twitter I'm themes chat so f-e-e-m-s chats c-h-a-t-s I think you're on the pan-african question it's it's too early to tell as well hopefully you know this growing youth population we might see something we've tried to bring different African central banks together to discuss crypto we had a conference in Cape Town in April it wasn't that greatly attended we're trying to do them sort of year on year and we'll keep you updated there my Twitter Anda a-n-d-a ngcaba and school thanks everyone um yeah um what's the question again yeah but um I think I think um where actually just to save on time I think what my other panelists have said is actually sufficient and it gives a really good outlook of where we are and I think we'll get there eventually um I have a slightly different view like a lot of the young younger people like 20 and under that I engage with um I don't I don't sense this uh world view of hey I am this identity your dad identity therefore like we're in different terms I think the the shared native that I hear is we want to thrive in this world we want a piece of this world as much as everyone else has right and the aspect of just like you know this shared experience of you know Africa in the current geopolitical and economic Paradigm kind of being positioned right at the bottom this is like that shared experience that's there so I think there's a there's a comment as people wanting to live a better life and have much of this world that we enjoy here in Western and in other parts of the world is is something that you know I keep noticing um and my Twitter handle is y-o-s-e-p-h-a-y-e-l-e all right um Tony Orlando t-o-n-y-o-l-e-n-d-o oh awesome well thank you I hope this is just the beginning of the conversation and I hope we give you enough sprinkles uh talk to us come to the continent let's make Devcon Africa happen somewhere very soon and uh let's do this [Applause] thank you all so much what a great way to start off the last day at Devcon thank you thank you thank you all right so a couple of announcements before we start our next talk the closing ceremony is today at 3 30 on the top of the mountain and there's going to be an after party in the Shiva lounge and also the venue will be open to anyone with a wristband on Saturday and Sunday from 9 A.M to 6 p.m for co-working um okay so now we're going to go ahead and start our next talk on the future of social coordination of daos and the talk is hosted by Chandler decog who does growth strategy at Astoria and Chandler focuses on building the future of web 3 by solving the problems that matter to people that work in the space every day please welcome Chandler to the stage wait [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] hello everyone if you're here I'm introducing him again um but this talk is on the future of social coordination of daos and the talk is being hosted by Chandler decoc who does growth strategy at Astoria Chandler focuses on building the future of web 3 by solving the problems that matter to people that work in the space every day please welcome Chandler to the stage foreign [Applause] just a quick shout out before I get into my talk the previous panel that we had before this was uh wipe web 3 adoption in Africa I really loved that topic it was really great um and a shout out to the fellow Africans I held from from South Africa so that meant a lot to me um so really great to see that uh today's talk um is really just around why do we need doubt um and why why do we need to make them better right many of us here are probably endos and I think we owe it to ourselves to actually make them um designed them for humans and kind of create a more uh sustainable system for how dollars work my name is chonda I lead growth at Astoria and today's lesson uh just uh thanks um why the dollar experience sucks today it's a story of uh things that I've been through in the Dow ecosystem um and really the three main topics I want to cover today is just um things around governance incentives and uh the organization around uh thousand as we as we know them today a little bit about what I've been up to I've worked in over 20 000 projects at the moment um I used to help Implement uma's kpi options that'll tie quite heavily into what I will be talking about today I used to work on an optimistic Governor module and help spread awareness around just what optimistic governance is and I've done a ton of research around governance and incentive programs what's up uh we all know what a Dao is I think this group is a little bit more advanced than most of them um but this is kind of like a very tldr version of how I see the life cycle of a dow start right and that was created everyone joins they're excited there's a lot of hype a lot of participation and a lot of contribution um this is actually like most uh the most like formative part of the dial and then we kind of move over to when Dallas really start to operate right and this is where the Dynamics change a little bit uh different types of incentive structures are at play at different types of contribution levels and skills and then you kind of like get to a point where that I was in like a sort of a heavy medium State and we kind of continue to see dials operate in the space and their life cycle really is captured in this so if it does operating you're in the space but really then it kind of moves over to uh when the Dow explodes and there are many examples of those um that will kind of like just touch on very briefly this is where um some incentive Dynamics are at play this is where some of the governance frustrations come into play and then this is also around some of the uh the the concepts around uh like infighting and who has rights in the space and who can contribute and who can participate and some of the reasons why um why does explode really starts around that right so we'll get into some of those in a little bit um but I think the one thing that's um one second um I think the thing that's really important here is the things that don't work right so I spoke about Community contributions and participation and those two things are actually fundamentally different my participation in a Dao is very different to my contribution in a dial and I think the way that dials were structured um at the moment in these big monolithic one token one vote systems don't really work because you're always going to have a sub-optimal level of of contribution why why do I say that right so participation is not the same so when I when I have a token Vote or a token in a in a dial and I can vote on some of the governance actions um I will always give the bare minimum effort that it takes to be considered a contributor for future rewards and future incentive programs and kind of just be known in the ecosystem most organizations actually Thrive and do better by by individuals contributing above and beyond what's expected right like if you think about your job you work for an intrinsic value and an extrinsic value and those values you combine kind of give you what your output is and sometimes you know the jobs that you don't like doing you need some extrinsic motivation and the stuff that you really like doing you can kind of just do for free right um and so con if you think about how down incentive structures are set up at the moment there really is no um way to effectively uh convert people's um lacking lack of willingness to participate um sorry a lack of willingness to contribute on things that they might not be you know so excited about right and if you look at the the vast majority of of how how dow participation work is really around token rewards right not every dollar has this but the majority of the ones that we all know today have like a token reward distribution mechanism that actually just is fundamentally flawed right if you think about taking your token that's that's going to ultimately govern your system and airdropping it put it out for liquidity mining rewards uh rewards maximizing um individuals um they're kind of like just do the very least that they can to get the reward uh ground scraping all of these kind of Concepts provide governance rights to people in the Dow that might not actually be there for the best interest of the dumb and we can kind of see that like the reward mechanism for something like a liquidity mining is is not really tied into the longevity of the doubt why do I say that in kind of the broader concept well like you're just rewarding capital for your Dow and you're paying an extreme cost for that liquidity show your particle needs to function ensure liquidity is King in the in most of the D5 ecosystems But ultimately you're actually giving away governance rights to somebody that's not going to have a long-term aligned incentive with your with your ecosystem okay the things that do work right now most of the the protocols that exist today that are highly successful have this like concept of um insert uh your protocol name labs and that's the foundation that works on the protocol uni swap Labs works on uni swap I used to work at Uma uh we were at um risk Labs that helped build out Uma protocol and these are normally highly skilled teams that are well compensated and have both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation right and those kinds of Concepts have been extremely successful at building really highly effective products and protocols how do we translate this into the the dial space is actually going to be an important part of what I want to kind of like get towards um but most of the time relative to the size of dials is that they're small highly motivated teams uh working on a particular problem right um and if you think about like some of the the dials that set up this whole conference the shelling Point dial small highly effective team and Community organizations the ethereum foundation again same small small relative to the level of participation um and most of the people that work on on these protocols or these dials or these uh kind of groups are verifiably uh credible so you you know you if I want to work in a developer dial I really need to be able to know how to how to develop so what are some of the lessons I learned um in my time working with all the dials and kind of uh figuring out some of the Dynamics on on like what makes somedao successful versus others and I think the one um the one key message that I mentioned a bit earlier is around passing the access to the governance within your ecosystem we do that far too cheaply at the moment we do it for the wrong reasons and we reward the wrong types of behavior and I think there's a very big difference between what is effective for your protocol versus what is effective for your um for your governance and your long-term management of your uh of your of your doubt I also fundamentally do believe that um the the kind of examples that we have at the moment I put up here the sushi swap example um that was like the it should be pretty much studied in every Dao business school when we eventually get to the size of the ecosystem for us to have like Dow Business Schools and Sushi swap will most likely be the the core fundamental uh case study on what what went wrong and what are the one of the things that we could do better about that and again token reward incentive programs a governance system that was extremely monolithic and the participation in that dial was was the the individuals that had the most context of what they were doing were being stifled by by members of the of the community that really didn't actually have the best kind of input in in that particular topic governance is not easy I think monolithic does as they exist today are are a huge issue um I don't think we should be getting rid of big monolithic dials uh we'll get into some of the the Dynamics of how I think they can change um but really right now I think they're extremely painful uh context is missing for everyone I think if you have to vote on every single vote you're not going to know everything that you need to do and why this vote is important and kind of like some of the decisions that get made Unchained through governance votes are also kind of they don't actually need to do that there's a big difference between uh being able to have like a verifiable trusted execution of a particular outcome versus actually something where you can just kind of agree as long as like you know there's some sort of like soft consensus around something you can kind of move on and I don't think everything needs to be voted on and I think one of the more important elements here is that attention in a Dao especially if you're in many like I've been is a fading acid your token isn't the most valuable uh part of your dial uh the the number of people are not the most important thing in your Dao the attention that you can Garner from people and of particular types of skill sets is the most important and then I kind of also briefly touched that not everything needs to be a blockchain vote like really um there are many elements around like how we can what gets put towards the vote and gets discussed is sometimes a bit over the top uh bigger is not better size size isn't really that important in terms of dollars um if you look at some of the most effective teams I remember how like I drew parallels to like highly effective teams building out something if you look at the size of uni swap their team is famously small yet they're the biggest uh asset swapper in our in the in the D5 space um and if you look at some a team like coinbase famously large and they roughly do the same amount of volume sure they've got differentiating products and sure it's not apples for apples here but really the concept here is that bigger dials are not necessarily better you the more people that you introduce into the dial the more elements of of like having a a a stifling force in your in your dial um starts to become prevalent and these like mass air drops and these Mass token distributions I kind of just go out willingly they uh they typically kind of like help perpetuate that these large dials um and it's not really designed for humans right we we as individual humans only can have X number of contacts uh between between ourselves right sure you might have 10 000 Twitter followers but you actually only talk to five people on your Discord or five people in your Telegram and then you ignore all the rest of the group chats right so um towers are built by humans and are for humans and we should always kind of keep that as like a core premise of how we design our interactions even in the data space so I've I've had some experience with some tools I'm going to go through three of them um this is just from my point of view on some of the things that worked and what what never worked um so the first one was kpi options from the Uma protocol um what a kpi option was was it basically a conditional payout token where let's say for example I was a a D5 protocol that wanted to get increase my tvl instead of just Distributing liquidity mining Rewards or or doing an airdrop to kind of help promote this you you built in a conditional metric and you gave that token to your community members or the stakeholders that could actually improve that and then depending on how that metric got achieved over a period of time you could get more rewards and you can kind of think of this as a really powerful primitive to to incentivize people kind of in a decentralized way right it was really great for Community compensations because you compensated people for an outcome that you got and so that outcome really really helped um motivate the the each individual kind of on a on an extrinsic level so you kind of gave that reward um for a total outcome uh token rewards and an outcome based results were really really useful for that so let's say you as a dollar really wanted to get some something done and you would give a reward or a bounty out for it depending on how well that that outcome go how that outcome was achieved you would end up getting a better result and we found this to be quite a powerful like primitive mechanism but then in my experience I found that there were a lot of issues with these conditional tokens firstly in Dows no one actually knows in a doubt what your important most important metrics are and this was the most shocking thing I ever experienced I'd walk up to a team and say hey um they'll come to me and say hey do you want to do kpi options and I say yes great I'm here to help and they would end up our first question I'd ask is what's your most important metric and they're kind of like just stood there and didn't know what exactly how to answer that right and then they were competing discussions amongst team members and so finding a core metric in terms of what you could do in a dial might not necessarily be the most valuable thing for that dial because they there's there's a wide array of things that dogs can Target but really um when when you have too big a dow or too big a an infrastructure it's really hard to figure out what's that core premise of what that does ultimately um achieving and then on the other side of this is that these kpi options were smart contracts and tokens um there was a lot of effort to put into place for like smaller um smaller incentive programs and in the case of like something like sushi where the the community really mistrusted the team and there was this conflict kpi options made sense there because it was kind of like an on-chain guarantee whereas most dials and most community members really do trust their dial so just saying hey we can do this um and we'll you know give your reward out if we achieve these results is actually something that is a lot more efficient and I think taking that out of the the the the small contract side and putting it in the in the social layer actually proved to be a little bit more effective um the other topic that I worked on for a while was optimistic governance I call this the lazy Dao's Choice optimistic governance for anyone that doesn't knows most actions of governance get executed by multisigs multi-cigs are a legal liability for the signer and also a security hole um and so you what you can then do is instead of actually submitting uh everyone sign that and again attention um attention is the most important thing the the multi-sex sign is ultimately really struggled to um to keep up with uh the context of everything that they're signing right just like every vote you don't have all the contacts every every signature for a multi executor is the same so um what you can then do with an optimistic Governor is basically submit the transactions that would execute on the on the um on the on the wallet and that execution can can be vetoed by someone in an optimistic sense so transactions can be submitted and all you have to do is have one person disagree with it if there's anything wrong right so let's vote less on-chain actions uh so great idea right um there was actually a talk on this stage Yesterday by someone called Isaac that that went into a lot more detail so if you want to know more details of how um how that all plugs in from snave slap to reality.eve and how that process and the configuration of one of these are that's a great idea but really these are extremely um new and untested and one of the biggest issues that you can have is you could actually submit a transaction and if no one is watching steal some funds right remember how I said like attention is the the most important part of of governance even in a in a tool that allows you to uh govern um in a more optimistic sense um there's a security hole there because the security is based on the assumption that everyone is watching these transactions so optimistic governance I think also induces a lot of anxiety for individuals when you as a as an executor execute a transaction on a multi-sake you know when you have to do it you can see that transaction you know nothing's going to happen if you don't do something the dynamic with optimistic governance is flipped around where if you don't look at something something might happen without you you kind of like paying attention and that's hugely scary right you're not going to be sitting here going every single time checking your multi-sig if there's a new proposal for a transaction coming through and so conceptually I think optimistic governance doesn't really sit so well for those that are lacking in attention or super monolithic and maybe they can be a bit more effective at the smaller scale and also a smaller treasury size so um Isaac yesterday I spoke about how he stole 17th ethically he returned it because the safe snap team weren't paying attention right and they even paid attention try to catch him out and so they blocked the transaction he re-initiated and then they forgot to pay attention again and then he ended up draining that small honey pot and so optimistic governance again kind of an interesting Dynamic on on how you can like improve just that monolithic governance size but really the most important thing that I think I I've seen be a lot more effective in my time is this concept of PODS unit to cause there's not a clear vernacular on exactly what we're going to call this but these small highly effective teams that fit together within a larger organization and these effective teams basically uh are are focusing on One Core element right Mega does this in a in their kind of units breakup and that's somewhat have has somewhat been effective and they largely live within the maker ecosystem but if you look at something on how how you can kind of compose these core units into something that's far more effective you can actually start moving your core mini dial or core mini units or pod to other dials right so not only can you live with the dial within isolation you can start having this Hub and spoke mechanism where you get dials within dials and those dials help out other dials and you can kind of see a far more interconnected world the teams are far more efficient and far far more effective because they're smaller they govern themselves they choose the tools that they want to do with and the tooling that exists right now can kind of help in input them into a lot more of the ecosystem they can govern themselves with a choose that to be optimistic or not or if they do it on a contract layer uh with the multi-sig or they just trust someone in intrinsically but we can kind of see that these core units become really really effective and I I'm sure many of you have been to some of the side events that happen um at this conference and many of those side events actually are done by core units and those core units can actually be helpful to other teams so um the one that with one example is that Divinity event last night I went to it for a little bit and they can that team really highly effective can do side events for a bunch of other um dowels or or projects if they if they so choose Joe highly effective core units that govern themselves that fit within a larger organization or can be part of multiple organizations is extremely far more effective and a better return to scale um and so ultimately what I kind of get towards is what does the future look like with the kind of lessons that I've learned and some of the the things that I've seen so what does the future look like to me um I think any sort of data structure needs three core elements it's incentive it's a an incentive program it's governance and it's organizations you really want a small team of Highly Effective and motivated individuals to work on a particular project or a particular problem that they all agree is is the common goal that they're wanting to work at work on and that the smaller you the smaller your unit or the more effective your unit uh the more the more you can do in a daily basis and the other side of that is you can even have these small units within a larger organization right people naturally like to fit within a small group and that small group can identify as part of a big ecosystem all right and then the other one was being clear on participation versus contribution right I can participate uh in the ethereum ecosystem I can also contribute to the ethereum ecosystem those two things I think are really really really important uh to be to be very clear uh on when when you're kind of working in in a doubt right I'm part of a many many discords um sometimes it gets a bit noisy and so I don't necessarily contribute to every single one but I do participate in many of them and keep up with the news and as I as a participant in many dials I know what my role would there be is I have a vested interest whether it be intrinsic or extrinsic to want to make sure that that dial survives and grows and becomes a vibrant ecosystem within the contribution side should be an active decision from my side to contribute in that space um and I think that right now a lot of people mistrude being a contributor versus a participant and you get a lot of armchair commentary from participants pretending to be a uh contributors and I feel like that often is quite a stifling force with any sort of like governance issue in action now now being a participant that raises a valid concern and a valid issue is is not kind of the point I'm touching on here um the point is is when a participant that has no understanding of the problem that that the contributors are working on is um is a big issue like I can't tell you how many times you've seen like these long well thought out Forum posts and you just see two three people go no this doesn't make sense to me I don't I don't like it in in Forum posts and that governance happens on a lot of these foreign posts and that's that's sort of like disheartening to the actual contributors that leads to the inviting and the ultimate explosion of of the doubt cool so that's mainly what I want to do and talk about today I have one last shout out um to do not really relate it to to my talk um but my ex-colleague Clayton at umer sent out the Tweet where he is asking everyone for um for laptops phones you know for everyone that's got that's upset secure that bought a new phone bought a new laptop for for Columbia um you can actually put that to use these are going to um to students for on an education path to basically learn have the access to the internet to to kind of just learn and there's going to be web 3 Focus so it's basically onboarding more people in the web 3 for people that are in need he's really collected over 20 devices I think actually I didn't I checked with him yesterday it's closer to 50 at the moment so if you have a new phone um or if you have an old phone or an old laptop or an old iPad any internet connected device um downstairs in the um in The Vibes room with the chair in the music there's a guy there that's called John you can drop your device there um if you do want to still contribute to this and you don't have your device here here I also recommend handing it over into someone in Miami they do have an office there so if you're in the US you can also contribute to this and this I think is just a really great way to say thanks to the um the team in Bogota and the entire city for hosting us it's been a really exciting experience and I've really loved my time here in Bogota so thank you to Bogota this is a good way I think that you can say thanks to the Colombian people for hosting a really awesome Devcon um I've got a bunch of time for questions if you'd like one question yeah one question uh you mentioned uh you know small teams working towards a common goal but I didn't see you talk much about how you come up with that common goal and how all these small teams could agree on that common goal because that's in my experience has been a big problem in a couple dollars where they don't agree on the common goals so then they break apart in their own ways and the arguing starts happening yeah um I think naturally when when like-minded individuals get in a room they're often like oh this is the this is the problem that we're working on this is the kind of solution that we're working on uh let's go do that right like I I'm gonna use the sharing Point example again they're fundamentally there to like help public goods and the the conversation the discourse and the whole like uh Dynamic around public goods funding um and so they they all work towards that common goal right and if you no longer want to work in that common goal you can go in and out to that that was like an organic formation based on people just coming together I think dials that come together that aren't part of a like common goal they just kind of want to you know get get together I think that's more like a social club and so I think I think being intentional about what you want to do uh with a group of individuals is is multi it's extremely important right because then you can direct your effort you can direct your attention and you can direct your your um your like common Collective outcomes cool thanks guys [Applause] okay so we'll have our next talk in about five minutes so stick around if you want to see that [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] so before we get started on our next talk we have a couple of announcements so today is the last day of Defcon and the closing ceremony is at 3 30 p.m on the top of the mountain followed by an after party on the Shiva lounge and also the entire venue will be open on Saturday and Sunday from 9 A.M to 6 p.m for co-working for anyone who has a Defcon wristband but please join me in welcoming our next speaker who is going to be talking about growing the global ethereum community Through localization we're going to be joined by Luca who is on the translation team for ethereum.org and also works on the ecosystem development team at the ethereum foundation please welcome me in joining Luca foreign my name is Luca and as Madison already mentioned I work on ethereum.org mostly focusing on the translation program thanks for coming to this talk it's um happy to see there's interest in this topic which is something I feel quite strongly about being in South America for this Defcon which is Amazing by the way big shout out to the Defcon team um yeah uh being in South America for this Defcon the topic of providing content in different languages to make ethereum more accessible and inclusive is even more relevant this space is highly Technical and a lot of the focus and effort is on technical breakthroughs and progress which makes a lot of sense and is key for the technology to mature and reach its potential however with ethereum as a technology growing and improving a lot of the focus is and will continue to shift towards other things like education Community Building inclusivity this talk will touch on all three of those as they're often closely related ethereum is a global technology that is inclusive and accessible at its core however a lot of the content including educational content application front ends websites or anything else people use to interact with or learn about ethereum is usually not very inclusive and accessible as it is often only available in English we will look at some more detailed stats later but the main one we should all be aware of is the fact that over 6 billion people in the world do not speak English at all by only providing content in English and not translating or localizing it for the global Community we are often limiting how inclusive ethereum is for all of those non-english speakers my aim is to drive home the importance of this issue and look at some potential solutions that we can use to grow the global ethereum Community by just providing content in the language that they can understand you can see some stats for uh Languages by the number of native and non-native speakers here just two numbers that I'd quickly highlight are over 7 000 languages in the world and 10 languages with more than 200 million speakers so one number that I've already mentioned but it definitely warrants a repeat is the 6 billion non-english speakers there's a couple of stats like this that I will repeat throughout the talk because they are significant and important to think about so English is the most widely spoken language in the world as a first and second language it is also the um it is also the most learned language in the world as a second language and yet still only about 17 percent of the world's population speaks English at all if we really want to gain worldwide adoption and on board the next billion people to ethereum we need to remove this language barrier and make our websites documentation and apps available to everyone 61 percent of websites are available in English but English only reaches about 26 percent of global internet users I know we don't like to compare this space with traditional companies or existing Tech Giants due to different ideologies goals and approaches but the fact is that they've all done a great job at gaining worldwide adoption and increasing their total addressable Market including by breaking down language barriers this list could really go on forever but I'd just like to highlight a couple of examples the most popular websites in the world by traffic are Google YouTube Facebook and Twitter they are also available in 150 80 46 and 111 languages respectively and they all get billions of views these companies aren't translating all of their content just for the sake of it um they are all aiming to address and be accessible to the global population and realize that by providing their content only in English they would be limiting their target audience by about 80 percent another example that more people here might relate to is Wikipedia which doesn't make money from visits and is essentially a public good while not exactly accurate based on the definition you could also think of Wikipedia as being open source it is available in well over 300 languages simply because its purpose is to be inclusive and accessible and its target audience is the entire world an english-only Wikipedia would definitely not be the seventh most visited website in the world yesterday about 48 of all page views on Wikipedia were in English however the English version of Wikipedia also has about three times more articles available than most of the other popular languages so even this 48 number isn't telling the whole story in fact Wikipedia gets about seven times more page views in English than in Japanese but the number of Articles available in English is also five times higher than in Japanese accessibility and inclusivity also on the only aspects we should think about when talking about translations another one is efficiency understanding basic English is often not enough to be able to read and understand a lot of the content around ethereum which can often be quite complex if you've ever tried to read up on any of the latest developments about ethereum you'll find that they're often very complex topics um studies in bilingual countries have consistently shown that people who learn in their native language tend to learn more perform better on tests enjoy the experience more and are less likely to drop out or lose interest in the topic in fact a study from CSA research has shown that 65 percent of non-native English speakers prefer content in their native language even if they are highly proficient in English this doesn't even take into account the complexity of many ethereum related topics and content and the new terminology that is often exclusive in this space and the we've basically made up or are keep making up so maybe you're not bothered by inclusivity but just want to drive traffic to your project gain users increase dvl or the number of transaction that your app gets and just want to increase your Revenue in that case you should still definitely be thinking about translations again a lot of chat stats to choose from I've just identified a couple that I think are pretty telling from a company perspective Fortune 500 businesses that invested in Translation were one and a half times more likely to observe an increase in Revenue and the second one Fortune 500 companies were reported to be over two times more likely to improve profits when they invested in translation if this is true for Fortune 500 companies which already have massive existing customer bases and product Market fit we can assume that it's even more relevant to a new and upcoming technology and products in this space and from a user perspective 75 percent of consumers are more likely to buy products from websites in their native language around 40 percent of Internet users said they will never buy from websites that are not in their native language and another stat that I've already mentioned but is telling enough is 65 of non-native English speakers prefer content in their native language even though they are highly proficient in English so almost half of Internet users would never buy from websites that are not available in their native language how about using dapps or depositing their money into D5 into a D5 protocol that isn't available in their language probably not right I hope all of these help get the point across which is really as simple as we should be translating more content make it more accessible reach more people educate the world about ethereum and onboard people from all over the world to this space and if anyone has found themselves thinking that they should be consid start considering translations for their content or level up their translation efforts we'll move on to some concrete ways of how we can solve this to be honest addressing this is pretty simple we need to be aware of why translations are important and basically just start doing it my main goal is just to highlight the importance of translating content and providing content in different languages making the space more accessible onboarding more people to ethereum it is up to individual projects users people organizations websites and content creators to decide if they want to start translating their content and expand their translation efforts going about it is fairly simple there's many different approaches to take for example you could just order translations for your content from a translation agency or you could create a translation Bounty translation program or something else to get the community involved the quality of machine translation is increasing as well so post machine editing is becoming significantly significantly more used in the translation space where text machine is translated where text is translated by Machine translation and is then reviewed and edited by a professional linguist probably not the most applicable to the content in this space because as we've already mentioned there's a lot of new terminology and a lot of things that are still very much in the works and keep getting updated and changed all combinations of the of the above approaches are possible and many more and then there's also the review process quality analysis process all of these have their advantages and disadvantages which we don't have time to get into but you can find more information about all of them online if you're interested we've also come up with a translation program Playbook which is mostly aimed at ethereum related projects and covers some of the basics of translating content you can find it right here if anyone is interested um hopefully it helps answer a question or two we created this as a resource based on our experience with translating content on ethereum.org and a couple of other websites and if you do check it out and have any input or feedback or can think of a way to collaborate with us even if it's just looking for help translating your content please reach out to us I will share a bunch of contact details in a minute I would also like to mention some of the results that we've seen on ethereum.org by focusing on internationalization ethereum.org is an educational resource that covers many different topics has a lot of resources for beginners to teach them about ethereum and blockchains to help them get onboard it to help them identify the right tools to use when they're new to the space so making it accessible is very important to us there's also resources for more intermediate and advanced users community members developers basically anyone else the approach we're taking is very much in line with the open ethos of ethereum and focus on open source the website is fully open source and anyone can contribute to the content features code design and Community aspects of it as well as the translation process since the translation program launched in 2019 our community of contributors translating the website has grown to over four thousand the program represents a simple and low barrier way of getting involved and contributing to ethereum without needing a lot of technical Knowledge and Skills basically the main requirement is just being bilingual these contributors are also the main reason why the website is currently available in 50 languages for quality assurance purposes we're also working with a translation agency to make sure that all of the translations get reviewed before being added to the website so our approach is really a combination of the community-based and professional localization processes while participation in the translation program is voluntary we do try to acknowledge our contributors as much as possible to the point where some of them have transitioned from joining contributing to ethereum.org and are now working full-time in the space or have launched their own initiatives or communities the ethereum.org translation program is also very much a community building effort and this aspect is an important part of why the community-based approach to translating website content works for us getting involved and contributing to the website is a great way to join the ethereum community make an impact add some value contribute to ethereum in some way without needing a lot of technical skills and it's also an amazing educational experience we've heard from many of our contributors that the knowledge they've gained about ethereum by simply helping to translate the website is immense as it allows them to really read through all of the documentation that is available on ethereum.org while also contributing at the same time translating content has impacted the website in different ways as well not just building an amazing community of people who share our passion and goals analytics on the website clearly showed that the more translated content we have accessible the more non-english pages we get the number of non-english page views still depends a lot on the general traffic to the site but the ratio is going up constantly in fact this month has been the 12th straight month where the ratio of non-english versus English page views has gone up and hit a record high with non-english page viewers currently representing around 26 percent of all visits to the website over traffic over a quarter of all the traffic to the website is in languages other than English this chart shows the total page views on ethereum.org in the last couple of years you can see the total page views on the website the non-english page views and the ratio between them as you can see regardless of what the general trend is and how many people actually visit the website page views and other languages continue to Trend upwards and and now represent an ever-growing pers of of visits in short the more translated content we have on the site the more people read content in their native language the demand is clearly there for multilingual content and all of us are very well positioned to ensure that ethereum continues to be as inclusive and accessible as possible on ethereum.org we always appreciate feedback inputs new community members new contributors to the website if you have any feedback for us or see a way to collaborate in any way feel free to send us an email to translations ethereum.org if it's anything related to translations or to website at ethereum.org about anything else really you can also stop by our booth on the third floor if you want should be pointing up not down yeah our booth on the third floor if you want to say hi to the team get more information about contributing to ethereum.org give us some feedback collaborate on translations or anything else really and if you want to talk about translations feel free to reach out to me or catch me here at Defcon I'm always happy to chat that should be it for the most part I'm going to be showing a cup like all of the languages that the website is available in right now if you wanna surf the website in your language um just want to leave you all with a few few closing thoughts everyone should be very proud of what ethereum has a technology all the projects building on top of it and the ethereum community have achieved so far and we can all be even more excited about what the future has in store there is obviously still a lot of research development and building in front of us but it I think we can all agree that we have a lot of reasons to be optimistic if there's just one thing that I would like people to take away from this talk it is the fact that everyone can make an impact and play an important role in the present and future of ethereum there are countless ways to get involved and provide value to the ecosystem and sticking to this topic this is especially true for making sure that the ethereum that ethereum content websites interfaces and communities become increasingly inclusive and accessible to everyone repeating another number that I've already mentioned only about 17 of the world's population speaks English at all this doesn't even mean that they are proficient in English but that they can understand the most basic words and sentences in English if you're bilingual translate content create content in another languages make videos podcasts Twitter spaces whatever in your language spread the word and build your local community if you're a project protocol dap website make sure that your content is available in other languages this is how we reach most of the world's population educate them about ethereum blockchains wallet dapps defy all of it this is how we onboard the world to ethereum thank you amazing we have time for a couple of questions does anyone have a question for Luca okay I saw that ham first hi I wanted to ask besides going faster what do you think are the advantages of a community-based approach to translations so we have thought about this a bunch really um one thing is that we've seen is a lot of the people have this assumption that you need to be highly Technical and have a special skill set to make an impact to contribute to ethereum we feel like the translation program is a good enough proof that that is not the case anyone can get involved anyone can contribute anyone can make an impact and like I've said we've had a lot of people who started contributing to the website learned enough that and were exposed to the community enough that this led them to get full-time jobs in the space or create something of their own it's the translation program in our mind is a great starting point to join contribute add value and then level up doing whatever people want foreign thank you so much I actually worked in an AI translation industry before migrating to um web3 so this topic is definitely very close to my heart I actually have two questions first you presented the translation Playbook but what are like the efforts from the interior foundation on creating a glossary with shared um terms on the Webster space I mean you mentioned of course like every day we come up with a new technology with a new term uh With A New Concept but I think like having those foundations would be important to also escalate and to also like people create uh independent initiatives on translating the content the second one that I wanted to mention um translating text let's say static contact con content is already challenging enough but what are the also uh Alternatives options what are like the efforts to also translate videos infographics um any kind of dynamic content thank you thank you those are two awesome questions that we've really thought about as well so the first one is we have a glossary that we have been building up through basically since we started translating ethereum.org it's not open to everyone but if you visit the translation program Playbook or the translation program page John ethereum.org there are sections in there that basically say do you want to use any of our resources reach out to us and we will share them um the reason they're not open is because we're using a translation tool that really doesn't make it easy to share the glossary and also another point on this is there are a lot of independent efforts to create glossaries of terms for specific languages countries regions which I think is what how it should work um we make a lot of efforts to translate the website into as many languages as possible but not everything is a problem that the ethereum foundation should be solving for if you've listened to any of the talks from any of the people at the EF there is this philosophy of subtraction which is pushing power outside and empowering everyone else to do whatever they want to grow ethereum and that can mean a lot of things but that is also creating glossaries is a good example of that we are not best equipped to create a glossary for every specific language whereas there are organizations and initiatives in different countries of native language speakers who are far better equipped to do that than us and your second question was ah translating videos infographics yes that's also something so at some point we started a trial project to translate some videos it didn't go great it didn't go as good as we'd hoped um but that's not to say we won't pick it up and try to level it up at some point again as far as infographics goes there's been some people on our team advocating for creating infographics for the website that are made in a way that they're easy to translate also something that is very much in progress but it is something we are thinking about and want to solve for thank you okay so that's all the questions we have time for and we're taking a short one-hour break for lunch so we're coming back at 1pm but please give a final round of applause to Luca thank you all [Music] today I'm losing control [Music] [Applause] me through my hair just to match me [Music] [Music] all right [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign

break um just a couple of announcements before we start our next talk we have the closing ceremony today at 3 30 on the top of the mountain which is on the fifth floor and then after that we have an after party in the Shiva lounge and one other thing is that this weekend the entire venue will be open for co-working from 9am to 6 p.m for anyone who has a Defcon wrist band okay and now for our next talk on the web 3 social layer web3 social the next way of innovation by Stoney coolidgeoff stani is the founder and CEO of Ave companies he was studying law at the University of Helsinki when he first began learning about smart contracts and dust about the ethereum blockchain network this led to an exploration of how blockchain technology could impact the traditional Financial system please welcome Sony to the stage [Applause] Jim um who is feeling good nice um yeah so I want to thank the ethereum foundation for organizing Defcon it's been very very busy week um at least for me and probably for everyone else there's been a lot of good talks here and um and it's the last day so you know the the best talk is probably uh amongst here too um um don't want to brag too much but so okay today we're going to talk about web3 social um and as a next innovation see if we get this yeah perfect so something I want to talk about is that um The Innovation for the past um years or decades has grown quite substantially and has accelerated so um if you look at that for 100 years we have Technologies for example like telephone that has been invented over 100 years ago and it took decades to actually adopt uh automobiles cars for example took decades as well um and more recently for example um uh the television has got higher acceleration and and also uh the infrastructure underneath the internet the the computer and what we've seen different kinds of patterns is that the more we get infrastructure The More We Get compounding acceleration of innovation and this is one of the reasons for why for example the internet infrastructure has grown substantially um and if we look into the um I guess oh it's oh okay cool yeah perfect if you look into the actually uh recent Innovation what is happening in Internet um ecosystem is that we have a lot of adoption uh in a very high acceleration uh curve uh on line so what it means that when you have already a complete infrastructure it's very easy to innovate and have this compounding effect and recently we've seen for example Tick Tock being one of the uh recent examples of of how we had a scale adoption from uh zero users to one billion users in uh about roughly um seven years since um the beginning um and I don't know where is this thing I need to point out where should I point out okay oh cool yeah so yeah so what I want to say is that the internet adoption um is global so we're dealing with technologies that are affecting everyone every single human in the planet and there's a large-scale empowerment um uh that is related to not only the internet what what we're doing here um and the um the ethereum community and across across the blockchain space um I mean even though with high amount of adoption and penetration there are still places where uh in some regions the adoption of the internet uh isn't really in its fullest at the moment so for example if you look at the graph of uh sub uh the sub-Saharan Africa we have adoption of roughly 30 of population using the internet itself Colombia is at 70 so it's very Regional and and they're still places where uh we need infrastructure to to innovate um but regardless of the infrastructure um things are going to change quite a lot in the future so the way I see how Innovation Works and specifically this particular chart kind of like a I would say like a circle of different components um demonstrates uh what Innovation is for me like how I approach Innovation um and what are the ingredients to come up with a product and also get that product into a growth cycle so obviously you have the opportunity there so basically you recognize a a problem or an opportunity to solve having knowledge about the problem you're trying to solve expectations understanding what people actually need the talent the team members that you're building with and they actually craft and the craft is what I call the the product itself obviously there's things like funding related and also uh Road now what's super exciting about uh web3 and innovation in web3 is that we rely on open networks and open networks they create accessibility so they create access for everyone here today for example to contribute not only what we're building in the other team but any project in the ecosystem because they're relying in the open network idea and open source technology [Music] um yeah speaking of Technology so yeah and one important component also is the the the um culture aspect so culture equals for me um also community so uh when you build open networks open infrastructures uh you're actually in a different kind of a dynamic setting then as if you will be building um a product within a company or a service for example this means that when you have accessibility uh people across globally they need to find a way to connect share ideas um and and build actually different kinds of Concepts and an actual Community around a product because accessibility also means that the users are the ones that are part of the um Innovation flywheel and in in an important part actually of making that Innovation um happen um one important thing I have realized uh in the past that web3 is something that's going to touch everywhere so it's not only specifically related to one particular area to solve and we've seen obviously with how web3 has borne so Bitcoin tried to solve the idea of how we can actually transfer value between humans across globally without intermediaries and create a public money as public goods and obviously with the innovation of ethereum and the ethereum virtual machine you could actually create programmable applications on the blockchain because we try to solve financial problems and opportunities in the beginning we started to actually continue solving those within our community and that's where DFI has been very successful but yeah oh yeah good so but to get actually beyond what we have today uh in our community uh and the user base we actually need something more um than for example the essentialized finance um and just an example is that these interests Finance is incredible Innovation what our space has been able to uh create it means that every one of us has accessibility uh to a fair transparent market across globally um and decent just Finance doesn't look into your background what you are doing when you're actually participating in these markets or when you're building uh part of the community but to get into more bigger adoption we need to realize that we have to go beyond Financial applications and find more things that solve uh human problems and um feed their needs as well and I personally with my team uh think that social is the next uh or at least the killer app for web tree and the reason is that we currently have almost 5 billion users on social media and it's growing constantly we also have um equal amount of almost equal amount of internet users um social media users then we have Internet users so there's a big opportunity in social media and we also see that it's Global phenomena and effectively if you look at this chart here um we see a lot of social media usage in Southern America but also in Asia compared to for example the regions of Europe and North America um and we could actually ask ourselves why do we have um social media why their why social media is important um in in the first place so what I have been looking into is that there's definitely a need for people to connect with each other uh for particular different reasons and there's also need for create so humans has have always had the um idea of being a Creator so here's a picture of one of the oldest findings of creativity um uh back in a long long time ago um pointers uh unbelievably yeah so um social media it allows us to connect with people uh one-on-one basis create relationships um and also in groups coming together and forming a community um on topics that we care about care about it and social media is very vital to our lives because with internet and being able to connect with each other we are able to learn from each other directly from the people rather than example from institutions we also have the sense of belonging when we can create communities and part of the adoption also is that we can actually do this connectivity in scale across the globe and I really love this particular slide because um there is this concept of Six Degrees of Separation uh which means that we all people here um and everywhere are connected to each other across uh six hubs of uh friends of friends so um to any person um in the um uh planet and there's actually recent studies as well um that this hope distance actually is becoming even more uh narrow and we see that it's roughly 4.7 degrees so almost every fifth person you are connected with in the planet and part of that is because the connectivity is more easier we have access to Internet we can connect to anyone any person in the planet on the topics that are interesting uh for us so what happens when we are actually using social media is that we create Social Capital social capital is something we all have regardless of the technology so we have social capital when we are forming friendships uh when we are connecting with people when we are sharing ideas uh or sharing news the big problem at the moment is that we create a lot of this social capital actually online and we're using uh platforms such as the bigger social media platforms where we are creating this networks and connectivity and at the same time we're publishing uh content and these platforms are designed um to thrive as a basic platform instead of actually striving to preserve your social capital or aligned with your own ideas so what I see is that the web to social is at the moment a zero-sum game for many participants that create uh social capital and one of the issues is that all of the users are actually locked in a particular platform so you can't actually take your social capital and do a digital exit and transfer transport it to a a new platform or a new venue where you might find uh interesting ways to connect with your peers and share ideas creators at the current state lack of distribution and for the same reasons you are locked in into these particular platforms and also it's very hard to actually monetize Beyond um sharing um the traffic of what you're getting to maybe your home page and for the developers there is actually lack of freedom to come and and build and innovate um ways to how to connect with people innovate on the experiences as well and create new applications and and new Networks so I believe that web2 social is right for disruption at the moment and I think pep3 social is something that creates the positive some value so it builds the value for the users and it builds builds the value for the community and what I want to introduce here is the web free social layer the components that are actually and the ingredients that bring that bring these benefits for for all those three parties the users the creators and also the Developers so why web3 is a game changer especially in the social space is because the creators are getting ownership of their content distribution so you as a Creator can actually decide how you uh distribute content to your audience you also own that relationship between you and your peers and it's not locked into a particular platform and because you're not logged into a particular platform as a user you have the choice to actually select the experiences and the algorithms that serve you the most and are aligned with you the most and for developers it means also when all of the web3 is built on top of the open networks you have the accessibility to improve these networks and actually develop them further so you have access to develop the networks and web3 space I mean it's still growing quite a lot there's more investments in the region we also have locally here in Colombia 6.1 percent are owning um cryptocurrency and we also see here in Colombia that it's one of the countries that are getting um accelerated adoption at the moment including uh some of these countries in Asia like Vietnam also India turkey and and amongst others so we're uh in this perspective we're in the right place to talk about web3 as a an open networks and and how it could we could build them further so we see web3 social has a green field of opportunity there are ingredients that are very valuable when you build web tree social so the networks must be open meaning that anyone can actually compute on the data that is on web3 social can actually use these components smart contract libraries and also take what is already existing improve it and make it available to people um and also one key point is the decentralization so what makes web3 social very valuable is the architecture and the architecture is where you as a user uh owned your profile on chain and you own your social graph and connectivity which means that you own your social capital and here's the social layer where individuals they have their identity you have social verification when you are connecting with the peers and for the groups uh what you can do is that you have community-owned interest graphs open algorithms so when we take the base layer and give the ownership to the users and what it allows us to do is that first time ever anyone can actually build new algorithms and these algorithms do not need to be black boxes they can actually be transparent algorithms where developers are explaining what kind of algorithm and what data points that algorithm is using and that brings alignment between developers the users and the communities and for creators it means that actually when you own your um distribution Channel it also unlocks your you a new ways of actually creating content and creating experiences based on the web3 social footprint and also monetization is key part so monetization is and financialization is something that is part of the web tree value proposition and with with the idea of opening the identity at the same time it means that um you can actually own the way you monetize and you don't have to be relying on the platforms but actually find a venue with your social graph and with your profile and actually distribute the content and monetize the way you want so web3 social it unlocks the power of creativity connections and it brings more Innovation so what we did with financial applications we can actually do the same for non-financial applications and the reason why it's important for us is that this is this is the path how we can bring more users into the space it means that um people who don't necessarily have that Financial Capital but they're rich on Social Capital can actually have their ownership of that and enter into the space and use non-financial applications and also generate value for them and what's interesting about social capital compared to financial capital is that Financial Capital you can spend but social capital is something that you can carry through your whole life and this is why we need actually people to come uh to the web tree space to also non-financial applications and building more uh utility so one big question for us is that um who will build this new generation social media applications and we have a perfect answer for this one it's you since you are here at Devcon and it's a developer conference I'm pretty sure that there are people here that can take the opportunity and build some very interesting applications and use cases and Empower um the users and empower the the the creators and other developers and even create social media applications that have better values transparency and are aligned with with different user bases as well last thing is that if you don't have a lens profile yet you can scan this QR code and later you can claim a lens profile and you can actually test drive web3 social as well thank you everyone [Applause] yeah sure we have time for one question who wants to be the lucky person okay I saw that hand first hello my question is I see and it's hard to defeat Instagram or Facebook and how do you see as an opportunity like how we as a niche as a community of people specific but how do you go to the masses to go to defeat Instagram for example how how do you see it happening that people will stop using Instagram and will use another web tree social media platform yeah that's a great question I think um well there's a couple of um things one is related to the actual development uh any infrastructure so building applications for social media should be in terms of the user experience um at least the same guarantee that you have in normal web applications and that means that as a user you don't necessarily need to see all the blockchain transactioning and that can happen in the back end uh delegating signing power and having a relayer to pay gas so that's the technical component the the actual the application and the growth component will be to create applications that actually satisfy new interest graphs and New Way new ways for people to connect together and new experiences I think I would not go towards the direction to build rebuilding a Twitter or let's say an Instagram because those networks are very powerful so this companies have worked for over a decade or so to actually make those networks strong enough and because you can't actually take what's yours your Social Capital out of that platform um you're pretty much locked into that uh Network so it's more about building the new and showing why the new is more successful and why it's creating a bigger Network effect in case of lens protocol for example every application that is built into on top of the protocol actually is bringing the users together across the whole whole network and those applications can then decide what they actually can curate and also I think building better and open algorithms is something that brings people into the space so I would say building new and better will be the right answer uh thank you so much thank you all for coming we have another talk in five minutes so I encourage you to stay around for that foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] that's probably we've had some not as good ones and you're probably hearing some bottles and stuff happening with the response times are amazing yes yes [Music] I think my mind [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] okay everyone we're about to start our next talk but before we do I have a couple of announcements so today is the last day of Defcon the closing ceremony is today at 3 30 on the fifth floor top of the mountain the same place where the opening ceremony was and afterwards in the Shiva Lounge there's going to be an after party and also this weekend the entire venue will be open for co-working from 9am to 6 p.m for anyone who has a Defcon wristband okay our next talk is on mental health and avoiding burnout in your crypto gig and is going to be hosted by Hudson Jameson Hudson is a long time ethereum contributor having previously worked an ethereum Foundation For Five Years on numerous efforts including protocol development coordination specifications and co-running devcon's two three and four he co-founded the ethereum educational and coordination group ethereum cat herders he has three cats and five chickens and lives in Texas with his spouse please help me and welcome me Hudson to the stage [Applause] but hello thank you so much for the introduction all right so before we start I gotta apologize I kind of partied too hard last night the element Lido thing so my voice is out however dead ass I was just at the coffee table and I had honey I just grabbed it and just like squirted a bunch of my throat so I should be okay all right so yeah today we're gonna be talking about mental health and avoiding burnout um next slide I also the clicker's not working I'm gonna have to be like click a lot because there's animations click all right so just a bit about me uh I've been in crypto since 2011. um I am have been in the ethereum community since 2015. mostly at the ethereum foundation doing stuff like the all core devs calls EIP management and Devcon um I left in 2021 and joined flashbots for a little bit and then I also co-founded open Innovations and ethereum Cat herders if you've heard of them um I'm trying to get a hobby outside of crypto that's hard we'll come we'll come back to that later but uh I like ice cream whiskey and uh taking VHS tapes and make them put them on YouTube uh also can we start the timer okay so before we begin just a quick heads up presentation is going to be on some heavier topics around mental health uh maybe like mentioning self-harm completely relate to not being in a place to want to hear that you can just walk out at any time or you know turn off the video if you're watching you know on the internet until you're more comfortable hearing it or never um I'm also not a doctor I'm not trained in mental health um this just draws from my real life experiences in mental health and should not be taken as medical or legal advice click all right so let's get to some mental health tips today I'm kind of like structuring this just not to like be like Webster's defines mental health as but just kind of doing things that I thought were like important to say to people that's it's not always talked about um next slide so tip number one adjust your perspective on Mental Health it should be treated as serious as a physical injury um so like if you broke your hand and you can't code anymore you're going to do everything you can to like heal that hand until you can code again um I it seems like there's like a stigma though especially in work some workplaces where it's like mental health things like severe anxiety depression other stuff like aren't taken as seriously in some parts of the world uh when really that's going to cognitively affect your work much more sometimes than a lot of physical injuries so it's a taboo subject but talking about it helps um there are many places around the world where like it's kind of like a suck it up uh you know just be stronger that kind of stuff I really don't believe in that I think that you know if you're not okay it's okay to be not okay you can talk about it you can reach out and get help for that um so the first thing yeah first tip adjust your perspective it's as bad as a physical injury we should treat it more seriously next one okay build and maintain a support system click I do not mean this support system we are all addicted to crypto and if you were just in if all your support is people who are also in the same Echo chamber as you then that's not going to be as effective uh next so don't do that next instead next yeah do something like this my support system is my parents uh my friends in the middle and I have a therapist a therapist has been one of the most helpful things for me but again it's just one piece of your support system and um hit one more time click and you can have a little crypto friend support As a treat like if you want it like there are like some really good Discord groups I'm in where we have a mental health Channel and we could just be really open about what we're feeling that day and everyone's support system is going to look different I mean maybe you're just like a total introvert and you just have like your cat great that's part of your support system everyone should make sure that work isn't encompassing their life and that they have some kind of support system where they can like actually say this is who what I do to uh clear out by mind and to make myself understand the issues I'm having click all right don't be afraid to ask for help I kind of alluded to this in tip number one you are not weak uh people around you especially people from different Generations than your own might not understand what you're going through and that's okay like you you should be the number one priority to you I had this problem for a really really long time it was very difficult I was helping a lot of different people not taking care of myself uh still struggling with that to this day but I'm starting to finally come to an understanding myself that like if I can't help myself others are going to be affected as well and if I don't help myself I'm just going to keep burning out harder and harder so yeah that's kind of um yeah the tip is just don't be afraid to ask for help next slide now we're going to talk about burnout next right so burnout is individualized it is different for different people um I I I I've never admitted this publicly but um some a mistake I made early on in working for ethereum I was at the ethereum foundation early like 2015 2016. and I would travel with metallic a lot and we've all seen how vitalik works so in my mind I was like oh if I'm not matching vitalik I'm not doing good enough but in reality vitalik does take time to himself he does take care of his health and his body and breast and stuff but I I was kind of naive and just thought I just need to be pushing myself harder and harder and harder to accomplish things and I mean I'd be I'd be lying if I didn't say that got me places but it was at the toll of my mental health and I've had a multi-year mostly burnout period because of it like 16 18 hour days of nothing but ethereum for like three to four or five years gets to you um so yeah don't don't compare yourself to others and and do yourself check-ins this is something where a lot of people I find in the crypto space are very analytical they aren't going to do like a body check of like their emotions I had a lot of therapy before I could come to empathize with myself and I think that's something more people should do to maybe put a reminder in their calendar and say you know how am I feeling like is everything good do I need to adjust things so yeah um or check it with your support system too my spouse Lillet is amazing um I'll go up and I'll be like hey am I Manic and they're like yeah you're a man it goes like I had no idea and they're like you've been up for 20 hours I'm like okay so uh yeah next slide here's some resources also just by the way uh start thinking of questions we're going to have a good amount of time for questions um additionally if like people don't have exactly questions but like under 30 second personal experience that they want to share um that's fine too at the end of this um okay resources next slide all right internet's your friend there's online therapy that I found a lot of people have found very helpful I have a therapist in my town but we work remotely um it's not like super expensive and you can sometimes get work to pay for it so I'll talk to that about that in a second also something that was really good for me and understanding myself and coming to terms with how I operate as a person is taking a neurocycle to neuropsychological tests one of them one of them was a general one and that once they said you have bipolar two you have ADHD you have OCD and I was like okay cool and then years went by and uh everyone in my life was like Hey you really seem autistic and I was like you're diagnosed right it's like No And so I I'm not the kind of person who likes to self-diagnose with when it comes to medical stuff so I did that test and the autistic testing people came back were like yeah you're autistic however you're so good at masking and mimicry that and I and eye contact that like you just naturally or like do that but it's unnaturally do that but it's taken you a while to get there I didn't have any friends till High School no one wanted to talk to me so I kind of just learned and I think a lot of us do this what we what what facial Expressions we have to do to get a positive response from people so yeah join or start chat rooms that are crypto or non-crypto to build a support system those are really important don't let all your chat rooms be work related that'll just drain you uh touchgrass go outside don't I mean you can walk with your laptop it's not the weirdest thing in the world maybe um and being outside and getting exercise is a very important thing I've also heard there's like Sun lamps or something that might be helpful I'm actually really bad at this so like do as I say not as I do but going outside and getting exercise really does do physical and chemical things to the body to help with a lot of the emotions we struggle with slide okay so in our ecosystem in ethereum what can we be doing to push the topic of mental health forward slide so if your company doesn't have proactive mental health measures advocate for them we need to make them common um some examples mandatory vacation days I've heard of this working more so recently for people who are truly Workaholics um I mean it's going to be an interesting subject but when you know if you're approached about it or if you talk to your work but I've heard it works uh stipends for therapy or Psychological Services I mean they give you like what like a couple thousand dollars for a new Macbook and you get like a rolly chair that's really cool if you're working from home why not monthly stipends for therapy I think that's going to be really important and going on like everyone's going to have to be doing that eventually um and then the last one's very important and close to me because behind the scenes because I've been in ethereum so long I've dealt with a lot of mediation uh and major projects where they didn't have um like a traditional HR or anyone that would mediate conflicts within their organization so I don't like the term HR because like HR is hired by the company to protect the company's interest so sometimes they're great and they really do go to bat for you but there needs to be like a new term or a new kind of person that is like paid by the company but is like legally and in all other ways separate from the company so that they like if you have a problem with the highest levels you can go to them instead of having to escalate it through other means or being too scared to escalate it so if you're a crypto company right now and you have employees um see what your employees need maybe they don't need any of this uh they probably need number three at minimum and I've talked to a few companies about them implementing this and I'm going to see how this goes uh but yeah just really advocate for this stuff because I mean they're going to be Pricks if they say no right so yeah all right next slide okay be kind take care of yourself and ethereum we'll continue to have a soul ethereum is the best cryptocurrency ecosystem project because it has a soul and what I mean by that is that unlike other projects that kind of like uh have uh devs they hire just for a short amount of time and then they get uninterested and drop them there's a lot of fun cool things there's a lot of great people there's a lot of good discussion in ethereum and there's values that the earliest people in ethereum have like instilled in us around censorship resistance and decentralization and other stuff but also just like not being a dick like you see it with metallic you see it with Danny Ryan you see it with Tim baiko like they all exude this value of like not getting into sticky situations or you know having useless fighting with people so um yeah and also like when you're on Twitter just stop for a second when you're about to like just post that rage tweet like to reply to someone and think like they might be going through a hard time right now I've actually reached out to people on DM if someone's acting a little off about something they're saying and I'm like hey are you cool and sometimes they're not sometimes they're in a manic phase sometimes they just had a rough thing happen and they're just trying to escape that by going to Twitter and being off off kilter so uh yeah just like have empathy in that area I guess it's the best way to put that next slide thank you so much we're going to do questions now we have at least 13 minutes so yeah uh oh thank you Hudson thanks for the talk I like your T-shirt what's your take on psilocybin psilocybin oh oh I'm not I'm not working anymore right now I can talk about that um so um psilocybin is an amazing amazing tool for mental health um I've tried a lot of non-traditional things for my bipolar 2 and depression one of them is IV ketamine it's very expensive it's legal in the U.S but it's very expensive that is I've it's helped me a ton sometimes other times it doesn't help me at all additionally uh psilocybin um I've heard on when you take a major trip it can do a lot of things in my case when I took a major trip on mushrooms it gave me more empathy because that was a hard thing for me additionally I uh in a very dark dark time when I was had to be working I microdose psilocybin for a year and it was one of the only things that helped me because the prescription medicine wasn't doing its job exactly and I was doing them together but you know I just was on the wrong stuff for a while so yeah love psilocybin next up excellent so psilocybin is like a scientific term for magic mushrooms oh um wonderful talk Hudson um I wondered what your recommendation for like post Devcon like recovery is because like Devcon you come here it's like really intense I'm like really tired it's like you know doing stuff I always decides interactions and then after this I'm going to get on um do 18 hours of travel and then like sit in my house again like how do I recover from that like Drop yeah there's gonna I mean a lot of people actually go into a little bit of a depressive slump or anxiety slump after a big conference where they're like overly social for a week um I used to go way harder at Dev cons and I would crash for a whole week afterwards I'm actually pacing myself this time but uh to answer your question everyone's gonna be different some people like just want to watch Netflix all day after they get back from a conference and just not do work for a day or two others need like multiple days to sleep depending on where they came from others want to get right back to work because they stay energized I don't understand those people some of the time but you know it's different for different people so just um just kind of like really focus on what you think is the most relaxing thing for you and what will help you recharge okay uh yeah thank you um so in the title of the talk there was like your cryptocurrency or gig your ethereum gig um you have any particular advice for people who are doing gig work where they might have multiple projects or you know not just have like one full-time job that's a really good question so yeah if you're just doing gig work um it's it's there's good and bad with it because I've also been there to an extent as a contractor and stuff usually depending on where you are in the world you might not get benefits um things like that I would set aside a little bit of money for like therapy and stuff like that especially if health insurance in your country if you're if you're lucky enough to be in a country that just does it for free great but like for us uh that you know you need to like set aside some money and time for it um yeah also like one thing I'm not going to show this company because I don't know the ins and outs of it but as a gig employee check out opolis they do some stuff around having gig employees get Group Health Care through them in a cryptocurrency way it's actually the East Denver guy John powler runs it so yeah check that out that might be a good thing for Gig employees thanks so much um hi that's an amazing talk thanks so much thank you um I noticed that a lot of people in crypto often have like Mania or like sometimes just a little bit like myself included when I first got into crypto I was like very manic um and people tried reaching out to me about no no I'm fine um so I was wondering like what is a good approach to dealing with like someone that you care about who may be manic yeah so um if you yourself romantic and you're kind of coming to that realization um definitely talk to Medical people um the ones that I would recommend um to look up for would be like therapists can do so much but then there's other ones who can prescribe medicine like psychiatrists and sometimes um them working together or like getting a piece of paper that the therapist says like yeah this person's Manic and then the there then the psychiatrist is like I agree and then they get you something that's one thing um as far as other people in your life um just like if they were having any other things that you were concerned about in my in my case I think I would just message and be like hey I'm concerned and wanted to get your take on this I've done that line a lot um and also it's gonna depend on the person some of them are much more responsive with that kind of feedback some of them are like no no talk about health don't talk about health So like um showing that you care is usually going to break down a lot of barriers to people so that's kind of what I've done uh so quitting a position for mental health after a certain period of Time how do you deal with uh the sort of the drudgery of not doing anything and not triggering further mental health issues yeah that's a tough one because I've actually been on a mental health break since February and I know other people who are struggling with this too um one thing that I did was try to make myself busy with um non-crypted stuff like explicitly non-cryptos stuff so um we had a friend move in with us temporarily so we were getting their room together we in the last year we've acquired nine chickens please don't tell where I uh my uh my uh County in Texas that we did this we technically have an illegal chicken there's only supposed to be eight uh but so yeah so like just dealing with like you know and there's like a garden we have like there's a lot of things to deal with and so it's like manual work like that gets your mind off it additionally rekindling old friendships is a good idea like finding you know support groups that are in or outside of crypto to just kind of stay up to date and um for people who are just getting out if there are opportunities for little bits to help little advisory roles or like throwing in a few GitHub commits that can kind of help a little bit with like I'm you know I'm still here I'm still doing stuff um but yeah don't ever Rush getting back into something just because there's that kind of void that's just something that maybe a therapist can work out or you can find by doing other little tasks oh someone over there thank you so much such a great talk uh my question is somewhat related to that is with your spouse how do you you guys have three cats um yeah I'm going in that direction as well so what's it like like when you're when you're off the mental break and you guys discuss crypto do you not do you intentionally just leave it there or yeah if you get this if I don't mean to produce your privacy yeah you know it's kind of like how do you interact with those closest to you about this while you're going through this is kind of what I take from that so I can kind of give my personal thing I really don't mind um so uh my spouse lilit who's amazing um does is it exactly like crypto that much uh to be fair they did volunteer and actually work on devcons two and three which wasn't the best experience behind the scenes so that was a little bad but also like they just they don't jive with many people in this space um it's just not their interest they're just like artists and artists and stuff so and not into nfts so uh basically what I do is uh I don't really talk about crypto that much sometimes when I have like interesting conflict resolutions or like uh hot tea for crypto like I bring it to them because it's kind of just fun to talk about like oh I can't believe this conference video is ridiculous I can't believe uh well what's what's one that I showed them oh like a dfinity the launch video and stuff I was like they look like robots so like showing cool stuff like that is fine but like yeah in general um there are some crypto power couples that make it but for the most part most people I know that are happiest with their spouse in crypto try to keep their work separate and because it can blend so easily that can cause further problems so yeah um and then also I actually you had one more point which was when you start getting back into it after leaving um just be in close communication with that person to say let me know if it's too much or like hey today am I spending enough time with you I had a lot of problems early on where like ethereum would replace my friends and family so I'm now like hey are you feeling do we need are you feeling connected today like do you want to watch a movie like that kind of stuff and that's helped a lot we have time for one more question anyone else hello uh great talk thank you so much I would just really love to hear you riff a little bit on how managers can be empathetic and caring when they have to give corrective feedback or or sometimes even help an employer realize that it's time for them to part ways with the organization yeah I can rip a little bit on that um empathy is really important managers should have that and my personal experience um my two most recent full-time Employments were the ethereum foundation and flashbots uh the ethereum foundation I had to I broke down and I was getting sent to um I took a grippy sock vacation to brain jail aka the mental health hospital so I was doing synth there and I messaged um the leadership at the EF and I was like hey I'm coming here so sorry I feel like I'm letting you all down and they're like no you take as much time as you need you will have a job when you come back that is the number one thing I think managers may not realize is that they think oh if I'm going away for one two three four weeks at a mental health ward you know I will lose my job because of what I'm doing but though they said you take as much time as you need we're here to support you everyone's covering your back so shout out to the EF for that and then later I worked for flashbots first but I got into it too quickly and um there was a point in late last year where I was just like absolutely a mess with like home life stuff and or family or family stuff and other things and uh I just was like bawling on the phone till to Phil dying and I was like I can't do this I can't do this and he said there's nothing we have full support you are getting a two-month paid mental health break and at the end of it you can come back if you want or if not we're totally cool so like flashbots had a policy in place to like you know deal with this and I was really happy about that and it took me a while in February when it was over I said I can't come back yet my medicines aren't right Etc since then I've been doing a lot better but like it was just amazing to me that like they're so Progressive in that so as a manager yeah you need to just people are P people first that's what like the EF has done in various ways and flashbots does in amazing ways so um yeah put people first be empathetic and make sure they know they have a job thank you so much all right thank you so much for your talking for sharing your story all right we have another talk in a few minutes so stick around for that [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] we are about to get begin our next talk but before we do I have a few announcements for you so today is the last day of Devcon and the closing ceremony is at 3 30 on the fifth floor on the top of the mountain which is the same place where the opening ceremony was and then right after there's going to be an after party in the Shiva lounge and this weekend we're going to continue having the space open for co-working from 9am to 6 p.m for anyone who has a defconrest band okay and our next talk is on positive Framing and communication for web3 the talk is hosted by Oliver Renwick Oliver is a terminologist SBC Enthusiast and translator he currently lives near Cleveland Ohio USA with his wife and two kids he works at consensus creating and maintaining support documentation for metamask infra and other products and in general tries to explain the madness of web3 to those who want to know more he speaks Spanish and English fluently and he get himself into trouble in Italian Arabic Catalan and French please help me in welcoming Oliver to the stage gracias is this on yes okay cool Hello everybody um welcome to Tropical Sunset stage um uh I am Oliver Renwick as was explained in my introduction um before I get started uh I just want to say a shout out to the interpreters in the booth back there they have been doing an amazing job all week um and I will try to speak evenly and not use really strange words um so and one last note um I will be giving the talk in English the slides will be in Spanish if you see a slide that's all in Spanish don't be alarmed I'm going to say everything that's on it in English so uh okay so with that let's get started okay so uh the current state of affairs uh here we are it's 2022 uh crypto is going through its Rises and falls and we had incredible user growth um during 2021 uh and the ecosystem is expanding outward and rather than sort of uh homogenizing and becoming less complex it's opening up and becoming more complex more people are doing more different things and we have people who have heard about this crypto thing and want to get involved or they've heard about web3 maybe and they want to get involved so how do we explain that to them oh come on okay good so um as a terminologist as a translator I focus on Words it's my thing and what I've noticed about uh web3 and the terminology that we use to describe distributed or decentralized technology it has two sort of main features that Define it um first of all it's very technical right this is the language of Engineers of computer people and second of all you can see in the terminology that we use sort of the origins of this technology that it was born in a place at a time that was rejecting the previous generations tech stack and their philosophy right so as a result there's this sort of uh what I call negative theology but in general it's sort of a negative framing that that permeates web3 and in its best moments uh it can be sort of like edgy and cool and like makes people interested and want to know more um but I find especially dealing with people who are new to the space um that it just confuses things um it it makes things impenetrable there's a lot of jargon sometimes people use metaphors to describe things that are a little bit like unsettling or weird um and a lot of things just get framed in negative uh negative ways instead of in positive ways so how do we go from the negative to the positive briefly in this session we're going I'm going to lay out for you what I have um what I have categorized what I have uh observed about this terminology um and then hopefully we'll have a little bit of time to uh sort of dive in and I'm going to be like pointing at people and asking for things as well hopefully hopefully we can get interactive um so I will say I do have a background in linguistics I've done qualitative studies I've done quantitative studies this is not that this is more uh you know I've been working at consensus writing documentation for end users talking to people that are new to the space explaining things to my wife over and over again um not because she doesn't understand but because probably my explanations need to be improved um and uh so uh what you've got here what I'm showing you is sort of my gut feeling about where we're at in the space this isn't meant to be a a prescriptive model of what we've got going on this is not Based on data this is trying to start a conversation so okay uh so this seems to have stopped working um cool thank you um so uh in my time as a word Smith uh as it were I've gotten a lot of people saying things like yeah but who cares man that's just implementation details right um that's just words if we make solid Tech if we make a solid product people are going to use it right right I'm here to argue the opposite um I'm going to argue that if we want adoption to increase outside of our crypto bubble we need to learn to explain our technology in a clearer and a more empowering way the empowering part is important and we'll come back to it soon so um I'm going to now break down a little bit of sort of what I've observed about the way we talk about crypto first of all there's what I've been calling negative framing or negative theology um the second sort of big category of language is impenetrable jargon that should be improved got a laser here um so yes oh oh it worked okay okay it's working now um so uh the third uh so we we all know what I'm talking about and we'll get into some concrete examples of that soon the last one gets into um sort of marketing or branding a little bit and it's more subjective um and that's the question that we all have to ask ourselves is what I'm saying edgy and revolutionary and is it going to energize people or is it like kind of cringe and like edgelord so that's that's not who we want to be okay gracias okay this is I'm really excited about this topic so uh uh negative Theology and negative framing um so look at this look at this set of terms right this is terms that we all know from being in the space non-custodial wallet immutable transactions and things uh governance free trustless permissionless permissionless is one of our favorite words right there's a whole event called permissionless uh decentralized censorship resistant and arbitrary arbitrary is in bold and we'll come back to it um so uh let's see here uh can can somebody tell me what permissionless means anyway yell it out and I'll repeat it you don't need permission to use it yeah I think that's actually what it means yeah um but like uh but from from like imagine like wipe your swipe your brain clean and imagine you've never heard of crypto imagine you've never done this stuff and you're like oh it's a permissionless computer network what like that doesn't yeah you decide how you interact with it that's a really cool definition but it's I I don't feel like that's inherent in the word you see what I mean like if I'm completely tabula rasa like I don't know what what that means um and and trustless is a similar thing trustless I love right because trustless is like old Bitcoin OG speak right and they're like it's a trustless system and that's so cool and people like I've had I've used that word and people have been like that's bad right like you can't trust it um and I've had to be like no no it's because like you don't need to trust it it's it's provable it's math um and a lot of this comes down to it being technical so we'll move on to that in the next point but I want to talk about non-custodial because non-custodial is one of the biggest uh examples of this kind of language in our space I I threw up a screenshot of what is a non-custodial wallet look at all these explainers bit pay uh Gemini I can't tell what that one is uh but by bit um economictimes.com um so uh I was up I was upgrading rewriting the metamask uh documentation for users last year and I decided to try and translate some of them into Spanish and so I sat down with the first article that I was going to translate and it was called metamask is a non-custodial wallet and I just sat there staring at the title like how am I going to say that in Spanish um and so so I ended up sort of as they say in Spanish and I ended up with uh metamask is a self-custodial wallet so this is what I was saying about making our language empowering so if I say to somebody check out this wallet it's a crypto wallet and it's non-custodial they say what's non-custodial and I'm like oh the bank isn't the custodian you're the custodian so I'm telling somebody this is a good thing because screw the banks man you're in charge right so I'm automatically putting them into this like power struggle right and that can be exciting and that can be interesting but it's also like a lot of information whereas if I said to somebody here's this crypto wallet man it's self-custodial whoa right there I've given them the power the crypto is theirs right and they understand it immediately so that's the difference in framing things negatively versus positively um you don't have to do that mental gymnastics to work out how the negative thing is a good thing the same way what we're saying with permissionless and trustless right you don't have to figure out oh I don't have to trust it because the math proves it and that's a good thing like anyway so um okay dresses okay there's a lot going on here um impenetrable jargon that should be improved um uh so RPC Network what's our PC remote procedure call that's right what is an RPC Network a network of computers where you can do remote procedure calls so where does this come up this comes up in your metamask like you're you're like oh I want to get onto polygon how do I do it oh I need to add a custom RPC Network um it doesn't make sense so RPC RPC is from Json RPC which is an old web 2 era uh standard for passing Json blobs which is a type of data around computers right so um so we we refer to our evm mostly not necessarily actually we refer to a lot of our public blockchain networks as RPC networks as a sort of technical shorthand um and those of us who are like initiates into this technology we get it but for users this is this is putting too much on them we had a lot of conversations I I brought this up in a slack Channel and was like we need to change this um and we had some conversations and we didn't settle on anything firm so this is an area where I think we as a community could maybe come up with something better in a way just saying network is a better option like add a new network or add a new blockchain network if you want or or I don't know and a connection Point connection Point might be good right because sometimes like let's say you're somebody who wants to connect to different endpoints within metamask wallet for the same network we might need a term there to differentiate between well yeah I'm connecting to arbitrum but I'm using a private node right and so what's the term for maybe we call it Network endpoint right and maybe that's a a better option so RPC network is a great a great example there's this whole mess how many of you do you think know the difference between a wallet versus an account versus an address versus a public key private key seed secret recovery phrase and you use them correctly every time you do good job good job um so like a lot of the time we sort of shorten it right we're like yeah I sent it from my wallet yeah you sent it from your order I sent it from my address or I sent it from my account like they're kind of different things um and getting so I work in customer success within consensus right so I help um like I'm writing the documentation and in coordination with a lot of our support agents and the support agents kind of have to work with users who might be using these things interchangeably right like the coins got stolen from my wallet the coins got stolen from my account what do you mean so there's a lot going on there um so smart contracts they're neither smart nor contract I know I know I've read about the history of them I know where they come from but I'm like a word geek and I care about that most people don't care about that anyway smart contracts I feel like that that ship maybe has sailed and maybe I shouldn't fight that battle um so I wanted to point out this example though I saw this while I was like months ago and I was I was like this is perfect so this is from mirror.xyz and for those of you who don't know mirror it's kind of trying to be like the medium of web3 maybe don't don't at me um and so this is a little snippet this was like a clickable thing this was supposed to make me want to click and read more for the first time ever convex users will be able to collateralize their vlcvx positions allowing them to earn yield I.E bribes and leverage their assets at the same time this will be accomplished through new technical collaboration with tribe Dao and redacted cartel yeah yeah right so um I work in this space and I don't entirely understand what's going on there um so thank you thank you um here's here's another great one this is from one of my favorite articles uh front running the Mev crisis or Mev whatever I don't care how you pronounce it um so this is a great article explaining crazy stuff about uh how MAV Works um and so what is Mev definition minor extractable value is a whole paragraph of definition um then we get to the next paragraph the term Mev can be misleading as one is would assume it is miners who are extracting this value laughs cool cool that just makes me want to be like I don't I don't know how words work anymore um so uh one one thing that we've been talking a lot about um that I've been talking a lot about during here during the conference is uh layer twos and ZK snarks love ZK snarks they are like the most empowering revolutionary technology not just for the web 3 space but like web3 plus ZK snarks is we could do so much with it um they're called ZK snarks I don't know what else I need to say uh so obviously like any discussion of ZK snarks could be sort of massaged right so you could be like okay there's this new technology it's called ZK snarks this is what it does what does a ZK snark do anybody you don't know well right that's the whole point right we don't know that's good um seriously could anybody offer me like a succinct succinct explanation of ZK snarks prove a true or false statement without any other information being shared yeah yeah um or or prove prove that you know something without revealing what it is or something prove that you know a secret without revealing the secret maybe um say what without interactions yeah um yeah so I don't know that's like I love the technology and I want to be able to talk about it better um and Roll-Ups right Roll-Ups are really cool um anyway okay I'm running out of time I'm getting I'm getting excited okay last one uh so this is uh branching out from sort of terminology into sort of softer stuff well softer uh marketing branding perception right um like I was saying our technology has the potential to do really amazing things we can change centuries old power dynamics with our technology and that's what a lot of the biggest Advocates and Minds in our space say that we want to do and say that we're trying to do that's awesome for some people that's going to bring them in the door right they're like I want to I want to burn it all down I want to start over other people are like uh I I don't want to burn everything down um right so the question of how you brand your project is a delicate one um moloch Dao they're sort of my favorite example of this uh they're like a cool public goods doll right um they do awesome stuff and they have satanic branding um uh it's cool Dogecoin maybe maybe they kind of nailed it with like yeah we're a coin but we're a meme and apparently that caught on right um dark Phi I had the privilege of sort of encountering them at Eve Barcelona over the summer and they had this awesome patch that had this logo on it and it said like I don't know something really sketchy about like you are your keys you are your Finance or something in red lettering um their their Manifesto is really powerful it goes into some some pretty hardcore they're they're trying to work on uh uh more more Anonymous D5 if I remember correctly um really cool project uh but like it's very much like are you into Edward Snowden this is for you right uh so there's a lot of people into Edward Snowden and sure in this room um but you gotta you know as as you're come as you're coming at it you are you are you pitching for a public audience are you who are you pitching for uh I'm gonna I'm gonna chill mildly here um and say that I feel like ipfs kind of nailed it they kind of got a middle a Middle Road for their product um this is on their home page you scroll down a little bit you find this the resolution isn't great but um they've got sort of these web 2 uh-esque friendly diagrams explaining what their technology does right it kind of illustrates it and they've got brief um uh um Pro like like statements about what their product does uh so this one down here let me see if I can back up and read it a little bit read it here uh it says today's web is addicted to the backbone ipfs Powers the creation of diversity resilient networks that enable persistent availability with or without internet backbone connectivity so that sentence there it's a mixture of techy people talk and normal people talk right they say it enables persistent availability that's sort of like signals to the people who care about cloud computing what what it is but then they they gloss that by saying internet backbone connectivity right so they're saying these are these are two different audiences they're speaking to this means better connectivity for the developing World during national natural disasters or just when you're on flaky coffee shop Wi-Fi this is a very powerful like sort of value added statement right they're they're breaking it down for you and they're saying look at what ipfs can do asterisk what does ipfs stand for interplanetary file system right so this is where we get that mixture of like yo man we're the interplanetary file system we're ready to go to the Moon um but but then they bring it back down to earth and they're like look we're going to make it better to browse Wikipedia at the coffee shop um okay uh so okay I talked a lot um these are these are the takeaways that I I wanted to sort of dissolve uh distill all of that down into um as we're writing as we're talking about our space as we're branding our space we need to find ways to phrase things in the positive rather than in the negative overall in general because it empowers people it it is a lower cognitive burden right and that's what we want uh we need to find ways to approach the technical jargon from the point of view of somebody new to this base table arasa we need to use phrasings metaphors and explanations that assume as little knowledge on the user user's part as possible um making comparisons to web 2 might help sometimes it might hinder sometimes um think about whether your users want to be empowered on their own so this is the example of like self-custodial right here it's a self-custodial wallet now you have the power versus they were part of a social political economic technological movement right like it's non-custodial because screw the banks right there are two different audiences uh so last Point consider whether you're you're branding your image your slogans Etc are culturally bound um culturally bound this gets into translator Theory stuff but um basically does it translate well is it uh is it something that means something else in a different language or sounds like something else in a different language and if you think I'm overreacting ask a Spanish speaker about the Mitsubishi Pajero uh okay this is this is the the final uh the final run here siente before this is a comedy in three parts this is from Twitter if you guys remember when the axi chain got hacked like a year ago um so much money got stolen so this guy's this ape is narrating it you cannot make this up hacker steals 600 million in eth from Ronin blockchain the one underlying axi hacker then goes short Ronin and axis axi token knowing as soon as news breaks that tokens will plummet but no one notices and they get liquidated on short before news breaks second what is Eve who is Ronan what's an axi what's axi token no clue what short is what language is this again people are followed um and then somebody very helpfully explains it's a cryptocurrency it's a blockchain network it's an nft it's another cryptocurrency and says asserts that this is English um I have my doubts um so this I I thought this is a really good illustrator a really good illustration right of like we're on crypto Twitter we're like oh my God they shorted the position and they liquidated in the Arbitrage and the I don't know like um and and normal people are like I'm gonna learn about crypto oh I hear it's big on Twitter I'm gonna follow people on Twitter okay okay I'm done um so now is the time for Q a I've got four minutes here um I have lots of examples but questions in this space what's the best way that we can disseminate with respect to educating um designers and people who work in crypto ux how would you best want to disseminate this knowledge through like workshops or like blog posts or company um yeah no that's that's a good question um uh yeah I mean this space is supposed to be the space that's all about how do we collaborate together right um I don't know are there are there already like ux Dows is that a thing yeah okay so I'm just ill informed um so I don't know um as a terminologist like my approach to this is very much like I'm gonna make a glossary and I'm gonna study the terms and I'm gonna say this is what this means this is these are synonyms these are homonyms and I'm gonna map it out and make decisions about which one I like and then I'm going to uh with an iron fist enforce it um so that's maybe not the most crypto attitude um I don't know I don't have a good answer to that beyond that one more super quick question I hate to put you on the spot it is a super quick question yeah uh if you could uninvent one word using this space what would be the one word oh man sorry oh no no what was it I was talking about it this morning oh man um no no there is one huh mining oh God it is it is harmful but don't worry about it we're on proof of stake now that's fine um uh I don't know I I hate so much of it um oh come on I mean I said okay I'm I'm All About clear communication right so I don't know I'll think and uh so real quick there is something that I failed to mention um I had lots of examples but obviously I'm not gonna have time uh one thing so within consensus we're we're aware of all this we're looking at this we're seeing this um this education Gap and I think across the field lots of people are seeing the education Gap right and what I'm excited to see is that during this bear Market lots of people are bringing out educational resources um and if any of you saw the my colleague James Beck speak a couple days ago uh he pitched a thing called metamask learn um it's a thing he and I are working on together along with a lot of people at consensus um and uh it's we are sort of relearning a lot of these lessons in there we're writing we're trying to make um sort of that intro that intro platform to the people who maybe maybe bought some eth but don't know about web3 right um so that's going to be launching hopefully at the end of November and we're very excited about it so um man oh yes on Twitter I am mapachuro like mapa m-a-p-a churro like the cinnamon sweet stick uh thank you all very much I'll get off the stage thank you so much thanks what an incredible talk okay stick around for the last panel at Defcon 6 in like five minutes [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] another time in my life [Music] hello okay it's working now great okay hello everyone so I have some exciting announcements to make in just one hour is the closing ceremony of Defcon it is on the fifth floor in the top of the mountain which is where the opening ceremony was and right after we'll be heading to the Shiva Lounge for the after party and also this weekend the venue is going to be open for co-working so anyone who has a Defcon wristband can come to the venue from 9am to 6 p.m but now we have the final panel of Defcon 6. on the topic of sustainable ecosystem scaling how do we fund community and ecosystem growth please help me in welcoming the panel [Applause] Million Dreams thank you it's my first Defcon but the last panel of the day so that's gotta count for something well thank you everyone for coming I know it's the end of the day I know it's the end of a big week but we're all really excited we got a great panel here for you and I'm super excited to kick it off um so my name is Anna I currently lead Community programs on the ecosystem team at the cello foundation and I was previously at maker Foundation and I'm going to first give you a little bit of a background for how I ended up in this space and how I kind of started thinking about this this panel and this idea and why I became really fascinated with the topic of ecosystem growth and funding ecosystem specifically um so I want to give you an example like working for nobody works for ethereum and in the same way nobody works for cello but a lot of us work on ecosystem and it doesn't mean that there aren't people working for it but there's people working for different entities that are funding ecosystem growth and ecosystem development and watching the ecosystem maker first being bootstrapped by maker foundation and then decentralizing to be entirely managed by Bedell I started thinking about how do we think about different levers that we have to leverage ecosystem growth at a foundation the primary lever that we have is Grants um but in and and usually they are coordinated by a pretty centralized group of people but at Adele it can be managed by a governance Community uh you can tap into unchain funding and then you can also have various new methods of ecosystem growth like uh Delta doubt swaps and other various tooling so I want to give first everyone a chance to give an introduction starting with Juan and maybe you can tell a little bit of a background for how you've seen this happen at maker yeah thank you Anna I'm Juan from the sustainable gas system scaling core unit at megadel a joint maker um right before the foundation started to to dissolve so uh yeah it was very very chaotic and extremely interesting and since then I've been pretty much working on scaling the ecosystem we used to do a lot of different things in the beginning um we were very a team that was very um that different uh it's a very the skills were very were very mixed and that was extremely interesting and then through the last year and a half or so we've been like specializing and now we are we're on building the like operational tools for the centralized Workforce um then legal resilience and and finally what we call governance design because we haven't found a better name yet but um yeah that's pretty much what I've been doing for the last year so very much looking forward to to speaking here with these great people thank you and kicking out to Abby hi my name is Abby my role now is the head of community and governance at radical so for those who don't know radical we basically build decentralized collaboration tools and infrastructure for people building decentralized Technologies um and so uh but we really consider ourselves even more so than a crypto project we consider ourselves more so a free and open source project um and so my view on ecosystem scaling definitely comes from uh the concept of like ecosystem in open source projects and communities um and you realize that in like web3 everything's open source and so inherently you know we're actually Building open source ecosystems and communities and so it's been over the last couple of years there stewarding governance and working on community I think that it's all been about like combining our crypto community and ecosystem learnings and what it means to scale crypto ecosystem with what does it mean to scale like an open source project in an open source ecosystem so um and I think the difference there is how do we progressively decentralize to support the emergence and autonomy of an open source ecosystem and I think my focus has been on like optimistically designing new Futures in which decentralized Technologies can better support the coordination and growth of Open Source ecosystems and the resilience of Open Source ecosystems so um so yeah so right now how we're acting on that and kind of what we're trying to do in practice is one of my main projects right now is helping lead the our transition to the Dao which means a lot of things but basically means progressively decentralizing the project from where we were prior which was basically like a venture-funded startup to a foundation with um you know a token governed Dao to now the next stage which is you know dissolving aspects of the radical foundation and transitioning those responsibilities to an autonomous decentralized entity that lives within the Dow is funded via the Dao and acts as a participant within the Dao among other orgs that will slowly emerge over time so yeah in that process we're thinking a lot about what it means to not only scale an ecosystem but support an ecosystem that's scaling and what foundations do you need to put in place to um you know kind of actually support the growth and resilience throughout a progressive decentralization or transition and so we're excited to chat about that today yeah and Progressive decentralization is the reason that I'm so excited to be sharing the stage with y'all because I feel like we are we've been at different stages of this and we've seen this through the ecosystem perspective but ELP I really want to hear your background and how do you think about ecosystem yeah thank you hey guys it's Al I started my journey like as an entrepreneur let's say like a couple of years back with a web to start up working on like Agriculture and like food Technologies uh then I started to participate in circular economies researchers in United Nation and European Union under some organizations there and worked a lot on the ground and try to understand actually what we could do to improve the lives of people in developing countries more then I joined purse with Git coin then I started with prime doubt and now I'm doing something called inverter Network which is we're trying to learn the traditional know-how from International organizations like United Nations and European Union which they have something called Data portal where they receive like all the applications like Grant applications and they pay milestone-based funding to these organizations and like individuals try to empower them trying to teach them with mentors and program managers such as like ourselves in the end of the day and now we're trying to understand basically how we can design an ecosystem where the whole empowerment of the individuals can affect the coordination throughout can generate this crypto Network effects that can improve our basically the games that we play you know with economical senses I'm excited to share this stage with all of you to be honest thank you thank you thank you again from my background I actually also started within the maker ecosystem and the reason I'm so interested in funding mechanisms is because I myself originally started in web3 as a beneficiary of a grant from what we then call Community Development at the maker foundation and that was really a program to incubate the next generation of people that will eventually take over a lot of the functions and be able to manage maker protocol through the dell and so through through that experience and I I learned I learned so much because that was such a pivotal time in our um well for maker but also for the entire ecosystem because maker I think was one of the first and really big projects to do that kind of transition and then going to sell a foundation I so I saw the same thing happening but a lot earlier on and I kind of had this I had the front row seat to seeing how to make this the ecosystem scaling sustainable you really have to encourage and you have to design for intentionally for people to be able to have this independent thinking to be able to decide on what things are meaningful for the ecosystem an independent process which has to do with like how do you apply for Grants how do you access funding and a dow this has to do with a lot of core units which is a framework that we'll jump into next and then also independent sources of funding because ultimately having funding at your disposal is what allows you to have agency and if you have agency then you can really execute on the things that are really meaningful for your ecosystem but to jump into what ecosystem development really means I want to ask this to each one of you because what I learned going from protocol like maker to a project like cello which is a layer one is that a layer one your ecosystem is really dependent on your application layer and on your projects and companies that are developing in your ecosystem and also of course like your community and your users and your Advocates and lots of other stakeholders but primarily it's about developing an application layer but what is ecosystems development mean a project like maker yeah I I like what Abby said but I don't think that that governance should be an afterthought ever you really need to work on the supporting mechanisms and structures and all these Frameworks that will allow you to scale properly otherwise you end up with this type of yeah people screaming at each other um I don't know um so pretty much it's like you have this bricked version of governance that doesn't allow you to to keep going and and looking forward and um and you end up with a mess um I can I can speak a bit more about maker uh if you guys let's talk about the challenges and why why it feels like sometimes it will get to why it feels like running into a brick wall of course riddance yeah so to just give you the the very quick overview um the way we organized it in the beginning was very optimistic if you'd like uh and that's why right now I'm a bit uh reticent about any any type of optimistic uh kind of Grant or or funding mechanism and what it is that anyone can come and permission permissionlessly start a core unit and get funding um and it is very very hard for if there's no structure there to actually report on progress on Milestones on on what's happening what's there to be achieved uh you end up with uh many delegates that have never run a company uh trying to judge a topic that they might not understand and there's no auditor or auditing function within this so you end up with MS and that's a bit what we're trying to work on nowadays through maker governance and governance design nice um nice um so yeah I think that in the case of radical and maybe more generally like open source ecosystems I think that there's like different layers of ecosystem development right so I think that there's like ecosystem scale which is related to increasing the number of participants whether that be like users contributors maintainers whatever you'd like um and that's kind of also Community right which is like building um obviously for an open source project that's your maintainers and your contributors and being able to grow your contributors is um a really important part of ecosystem development and then there's resilience which I think um and I would also say what interplays with that is like diversity so like resilience and diversity so what you're saying is like having a really strong diverse application layer Network ecosystem is really important for like a layer one it actually goes the same I think for like open source infrastructure in which you want to be able to have um a more diverse client ecosystem or at least least like technical ecosystem to ensure the projects like longer term resilience and so I think that that's like a really important part um and is why like things like grants and rfps and bounties are really great because basically you're growing the number of people who are working on the project and you're also increasing the diversity of the project so um so that's one and then I think that there's this other con like dimension of development which is like um I I guess it's kind of like developing the ecosystem you know what I mean which is like not just having a bunch of people but actually um having kind of more of an idea of how you're growing people in an ecosystem so like what you were saying like how um you know grants Were Meant to empower new people to take over leadership roles I think that this is like an incredibly important point of ecosystem which is like ecosystem development which is not just like bringing people in and then just like having them there it's like bringing them in and then developing them and like helping them support and empowering them and growing them into leadership positions and and just becoming like long-term participants and I actually think that this is like low-key the most important and hardest one to do which is like how do you get people uh to stick around how do you create longer term incentives um and how do you embed like longer term commitment because often this is what's actually necessary to um kind of like realize all of these ecosystem Visions um and so I think that all of those are yeah pretty hard to do they all interplay with each other but I think um there's a lot of ways to kind of of like stimulate each type of development so yeah it almost seems that we we had all the tools and smart contracts and to make it very programmatic and we just copied what we've seen from from companies or startups and we said okay we'll run with this yeah so I think there's a huge Miss opportunity there that that we're not exploring I'm like kind of I'm like kind of pessimistic on just programming incentives because I don't think that it often introduces or encourages the correct Behavior but it is true is that we do have kind of we have different tools and we should be experimenting with like how those tools look like in the long term I mean we kind of are with like tokens right like that's basically like a long-term incentive mechanism that we're trying to experiment and build governance around um but yeah we're definitely like applying the Corp reform like way too much and I think it's just us trying to like process a new design space and like also trying to make things work at the same time you know well I think this has to do with um like we all like to talk about onboarding but what are we actually onboarding into and I working at maker I really saw this very clearly I think there's the onboarding into the technical protocol and then there's onboarding into social protocol and the social protocol is what's really difficult because that's like that's at the core of how do we coordinate with each other like we can have all of the tech stack in the world but how do we actually Implement those things how do we coordinate how do we agree how do we govern well together like the social protocol is the one that's much more I think difficult um to build um and so I'll I think you have a really interesting perspective that's external to like an ecosystem it has more to do with maybe like developing Regional ecosystems so I I'd love to hear more about how you think about ecosystem thank you just to add really quick like the other day A friend of mine told me flow of capital is the flow of trust so when it comes to ecosystem design as well like to understand the contributor taxonomy and like uh kind of building the development projects in the regions where it's required we really need to understand like the kind of the requirements of the system we want to design on the ecosystem side as well and like once we understand the system that we want to design them we can understand the goals that we want to achieve and in the meantime if you have data sets to insan twice we can understand and like we can basically build on parameters on Pro projects that we actually want to kind of interject into that region so for example if you would have a specific development projects in some regions and you could actually have a database to basically see those milestones and deliverables that they need to do and also like we can incentivize understanding sanitization methods that have been used by different protocols and different entities whether they are centralized organizations or traditional organizations I think we can also like kind of have a different perspective to the ecosystem design where the focus would be public goods plus empowerment of the local communities and I think like also maker and like cello are very focused on the regional based ecosystem design which I really enjoy so I think like last year we were talking with you like you were kind of mentioning some a custom design perspective offers in the local communities and economies would be interesting to go into that level as well if you remember the whole Grant programs in like in African regions and because we could actually establish like a kind of block spaces for people to develop themselves and Empower themselves yeah yeah I love that love that well actually this ties in um into how like the next question that I wanted to go into which is like where are we coming from like what is the past case scenario and like how did we used to think about ecosystem growth versus how are we thinking about it now and what is to look forward to in the future and when I got to cello a year almost a year and a half ago um the cell Foundation was the only uh entity that was thinking about ecosystem development and so Foundation kind of like set a lot of the goals and like regions and priorities for where we want to develop but now we have created a whole system of governance where people are able to tap into unchain funding from the protocol and establish their own independent entities that are able to set their own priorities and their own goals so right now in the Forum there's actually several proposals for a latam regional Dell and for Africa Regional Dell that will access funding from the protocol and have this like have the benefit of the independent thinking which like they are actually based there like they are in touch with the local community they're able to make best decisions but then also we'll be able to set their own process for how they want to manage grants how they want to like plan that entire ecosystem how they want to manage deliverables and also have the funding and they're multisig to be able to act on those things so if there's like a hackathon they want to sponsor regionally then they can and I think that is huge power and like a tremendous responsibility but this is yeah this has to do with where we came from and where we're going but um yeah the next question was going to be for kind of talking about what was the past case scenario and where how is it developing now at each of the other projects you want me to start sure I can talk okay I'll talk maybe about General previous state as I've seen and kind of what nuances of like our current state that I think are different so I think in like previous state at least not for like open source ecosystems specifically because those are basically you know like decentralized ecosystems in at their core I think that there was obviously like a much more like centralized approach to ecosystem development in general in which there is like a directed Force that's like kind of um yeah just like creating the community and like running the community I think of like um I don't know if like notion is a really good example of this but like previous projects that have like have been built on like Creator communities in which there's kind of this like top-down directed Force um that's driving an ecosystem forth right and it's very branded it's like very um directed it's very structured often has its own hierarchies because um ecosystem is being looked at as like a means of like growth right and um so yeah I think that's like the previous state and so I think that like now what's different is that we have a lot more headless ecosystems right like headless Brands headless ecosystems in which people are um identifying with different ecosystems and communities without being explicitly tied to it itself like we're all part of the ethereum community like I think about how I got into ethereum and it was through hackathon and I just started like hacking right I know it's I didn't know that I love it no that's like a very OG hacker with like Griff green at like common sac and everything um before I found radical and I think that this aspect of community is something that again very much so um parallels like open source ecosystems in which like for example like Russ is this like insane ecosystem right and but it's very headless and that there's like obviously because it's a language right it's like a bunch of people building this language and Building Things on top of it um and other open source ecosystems exhibit this trait as well and so I feel like um now we're seeing companies try to frame themselves as open source ecosystems because they're building open source software you get they're also building uh companies and projects right and I think now we're seeing this like mesh of Two Worlds in which this previous state of kind of like Central top-down community ecosystem growth and scaling and this like more decentralized immersion um headless ecosystem approach in crypto right now and I think that that's kind of like why it's I think hard and people try to apply the corporate form because at the end of the day we're not building on entirely Vault volunteer volunteeristic voluntary altruistic volunteer based Network yeah you know what I'm trying to say um we're you know we're building projects that have um actually like a lot of like long-term incentives and value networks attached to them yet we're building open source ecosystems at the same time and I think that that's why it's so tough for us to try to like process like where to go and I think governance is actually the answer because that's the tooling that we can use to kind of figure it out but um yeah so I think we're just like seeing this Clash of like this top-down versus headless approach um and I think it's really exciting to start embracing new forms of the Headless ecosystem growth approach as we start looking forward yeah hold on maybe you can tell us why governance is the answer yeah what we've noticed is that um it's a I mean we we kind of predicted that this was going to happen and make her scale to a size uh that it's hard to tell like the kind of contributors is some somewhere between 120 to 170 um and this is because again it's it's decentralized so it's hard to tell but what we failed to build uh when we when we started this this Frameworks to to allow for M care holders to Direct Value so we went from a foundation very clear top-down um and if we can argue about the benefits of its grants and how that worked for better and worse and then we went to this uh to this mechanism where we have a lot of core units uh and there's really no incentive to integrate or to collaborate so every core unit is uh we have a very flat hierarchy and there's no there's no way for M care holders to push core units to work together or to integrate or to um yeah to make things happen and to create value for the protocol so I think that's something we will see in the in the next couple of months is we're going to see a trend that shifts from onboarding people which is bring as many people as you can to how do we build this coordination mechanisms to make sure that we can actually coordinate so right now there's no tool that I'm aware of and if you're building something please reach out to actually build consensus and make sure that we can create a decentralized strategy that involves the owner of the projects that are the ones holding the token so um yeah I might be diverging a bit too much but uh no no I think this is great and actually I think that's this is a great example of like a past State and moving into a current state but can you give us an example of like what what what is a core unit and how did you um because you really helped write the mipset that established core unit so can you tell us a little bit more about like what what core units were what core units were meant to be and what the promise of core units was versus like where it is now a year almost a year and a half later yeah so we we got inspired I think from from software a bit so we went to the highest abstraction and we say well we said what what do you need and every single project organization anything it's it's work which is what are we trying to get done it's the workforce which is who's contributing and it's the the incentives of the capital so basically that's that was it uh you if you feel a mips 39 um there you declare what your mission is and what you're trying to achieve for for maker the mid 40 is and then maybe some maker Improvement proposal um me before is the budget so I'm requesting this much money I'm going to hire all these people and or yeah and and then the 41 was the the facilitator which is the kind of like the responsible person accountable to governance regarding this um regarding this process and I think that everything that could have gone wrong went wrong so we learned a lot from it uh we ended up with the facilitator less core units we ended up with Anonymous off-boardings of Koreans that were not working out we ended up I don't know upsizing and downsizing budgets so it was extremely messy we learned a lot and yeah that's that's a bit the where we are today and if you have heard about the end game plan the end game plan that's why it sounds so uh so crazy but it's because we need to um make the I think we need to make the X the implicit complexity we need to make it explicit and we need to make sure that everyone understands otherwise you end up in this in this Dallas where the the very strong personalities kind of like Get Away with everything and and you can call them the nice people I guess as a euphemism uh end up like push aside so so that's a bit we're trying to to work with right now The off-boarding Proposal is really interesting and really really key and when I got to sell I realized that we have a way to tap into this pool of money at the protocol level and the Unchained funding but we actually have no off-boarding proposal to claw those funds back whenever something goes wrong if something inevitably at one point does go wrong um because we are all still learning and we are still trying to understand like how to operate and how to operationalize this new paradigm like we all can talk about the ideas behind it but then once you start to operationalize it you realize once the core units have been out in the wild for a year you realize all the things that have gone wrong Abby do you have any like parallels to core units uh radical and how do you think about like how independent entities can tap into that funding and yeah if you've thought about onboarding and off-boarding proposals wow so much we took a lot of inspiration uh so again we're currently like in the midst of this like transition right so we're currently designing the organizational framework that will um absorb the responsibilities that currently only remain in the foundation Council for directing coordinating and funding all core team development so our core units are technically called core teams right um and so in that process we've kind of like scoped out like a new ecosystem design in which instead of envisioning the radical Dow just funding One Core team again in the essence of Open Source and decentralization we envisioned the Dao which is a community governed treasury funding different orgs which act as these like nested polycentric you know organizations that kind of resemble sub-dials in the sense that they have their own governance processes they have their own memberships um but they still require certain trust level delegated from the Dow right and so in that process um in these orgs then become responsible for being independent thinkers funders and have their own process within the Dow using Anna's framework um about like that they all are then kind of trusted to allocate Capital within their mandate and so then they fund teams and so teams instead of making proposals directly to the tower making it to the org themselves and the org is making the decision on how to onboard or offward teams within their own like local jurisdiction if you will um and so the reason that we did this is because again like radical success will be in how we deploy this treasury in the long term to fund the growth of the radical ecosystem the growth and the resilience of the radical ecosystem right like we're not a D5 protocol you know we're trying to build a self-sustaining community-owned and operated open source project um and so for us that means um you know learning and taking learnings from Dao's about how we can like make it more effective to you know coordinate budgets and goals so we're not just like negotiating like haircuts all the time you know is um I think that that process has led us to this like more emergent model that supports the autonomy of these orgs themselves and the governance processes of themselves so um in terms of like onboarding and off-boarding that means that there needs to be like explicit like I said trust levels between the Dao the Orcs And the teams um and so there's actually like a lot of really going back to what you were saying about like designing like smart contracts and how we can like be trying out new things instead of like corporate forms is that there's like a lot of really cool tools like being built by like gnosis Guild right now um uh and with like the Zodiac mods that allow you know like the like Dao the Dow is like a community governed um entity to delegate trust and revoke trusts in really interesting ways so like one of those is like I forget what mod is called but like the Guard Mod I think um in which Adele can send funding to a multi-sig but then there could be a mod built into the safe um that allows the community to revoke the funds from the multi-sig um overriding the the signatures on the multi-sig when you think about that that's a really powerful thing because we're able to rebalance and redistribute the power of delegating and revoking trust among an organization and create more autonomous flows for that which I think better supports the emergence of an ecosystem because you're not just having these like Gatekeepers deciding who's onboarded and who's not off-boarding and so that's really important when you're trying to develop more headless brands in which people can be onboarding to the ecosystem and doing it in a way that's autonomous meaning the power is distributed yet the community also has the power to kind of keep it in check and so these checks and balances I think are like incredibly incredibly important and that's I think our current challenge that I'm really excited to be diving into now which is like how can we be encoding those rules that embed those checks and balances between the community the orgs themselves which represent you could say The Trusted actors in the ecosystem and then the ecosystem that those orgs are funding um and then the general community of people who are participating and and supporting like the radical projects so it's all about like kind of like looking at all these different participants and figuring out how to best distribute power and Trust to support like the emergence of the ecosystem without just kind of doing this like whole like spray and pray approach to just like know with no accountability or like no um you know mechanisms for recourse so amazing that's super interesting and that's super important trust is super important but then also like I want to talk about process because I think both Dows and like more centralized foundations really struggle with this because like we can give a grand but then how do you ultimately like report on the success of that Grant and how do you track Milestones because same as in maker like a core unit or a facilitator can get money but then it's it's the facilitator's sole responsibility or like the team's responsibility to then like see through how that team is allocating funding and like Juan you can talk about later uh more so like the challenges with that but I know you're developing a lot of actual like tooling with the proposal inverter for how you can um how you can go about like putting together a proposal getting funding for the proposal tracking milestones and then reporting on those Milestones so I'd love to hear your perspective on this process perspective um so I think like we have like this traditional again know-how that has been working for the last 20 years like that has circulated around to two trillion dollars I think globally um United Nations World Bank EU they always fund milestone-based funding they require proof of work as in like upload documentations they assign you mentors and program managers and I think that's kind of what you touched upon as well like it's kind of mycelium like a mushroom Network in a way if you if you would like to say where you need to have hand holding in the culture and you need to make sure this hand holding has a cultural infrastructure that has been built upon right so that's what's really interests me in the end of today with Milestone and deliverables so if you could actually write a proposal and every we could separate the funders to ecosystem funders and verifying funders so I custom funders being trying to incentivize the communities and individuals to build on top of their infrastructure and verifying funders being the subject matter experts who can like look at the projects and understand the again requirements problems and what can be done and if we could coordinate that I think like we can get to a level of distrust layers where a custom Founders can trust verifying funders by verifying Founders can bear verify the actual Builders of the costume so that's kind of what we're trying to achieve with the emergency Network now we are building like this mechanism where you can write a proposal applied to any Grand application or like dial funding through that or traditional organization funding gaps as well like African grants program in Tanzania and then they will ask you additional questions according to their cultural infrastructure that they built upon may that be kyc or like a specific requirements about the contributors and Builders and then it's basically Milestone based funding where you have to upload the work you have to provide the feedback as a funder you have to provide the feedback and as a builder you have to provide the feedback so we can have this feedback loops in the end of today it's just a give it an example I'm doing what yeah I like the mycelium networks I think checks and balances should actually be reframed as like symbiotic relationships it's technically the same thing I actually think we have more potential to build symbi symbiosis between like participants in a system than like just checks and balances to like reframe the language and instead of applying like all of our like political corporate form stuff to it you know yeah and I agree that I think that eventually we need all the the tools to make it super easy for anyone and make sure that it's uh that is extremely easy and the guardrails are in place um yeah I'm curious you know if you're in terms of Grants and if you're using any type of specific tools that you have liked or or if you follow a more manual process a personal ad maker is extremely manual uh can we like notion like all of the dials run on notion everything runs on notion pretty much version pipeline how many times can you say notion on this channel we've been telling with the with different tools um and yeah looking forward to find one that will actually work I think that's also an industry that will help us a lot in terms of tooling and grounds but I think we need to reach that point where it's almost permissionless and there's almost no no one to to yeah to verify it right eventually I don't know use scleros or something but uh I hope we get there yeah yeah and we've experimented with a few um like grants automation tooling I mean well first of all like yes we do actually use an ocean pipeline to track grants and we we have an application that comes in like we have this whole process that we build out where like an application goes in it gets assigned uh like a few reviewers um they like based on their area of expertise the way that we do grants is by vertical so like if there's like a kind of T vertical or like I personally fund community and ecosystem or community and education grants so like I would review that vertical and then we have like a whole process for moving that Grant down a pipeline we in the future like we really wanted to experiment more with um like open decision making and being able to post um all those applications to like a public forum but then the challenge of the foundation is we can't always disclose um like exact applications or like what people are the amounts that people are requesting for so some of the way that we've tried to solve this is one tool we're going to Pilot is Quest book or not Quest Book quest book yes Quest book is one of it no yeah is it yes okay great it's not an accounting software that's not what I'm trying to say um and climate Collective which is actually one of the first or I guess the second uh independent entity that has gotten money from the protocol to specifically fund like climate and refi related projects they're going to experiment with Quest book as a way to do like more decentralized and more open um grants process then the other way is like we just use git congrants as well and like we match we do matching rounds on git coin grants like that to me is one of the like best open source like open Community participatory ways to do grants that's external to an ecosystem um and I think we're still learning so yeah if anyone is building uh grounds tooling I don't have to know I want to give a shout out to our grants lead uh boredom who was actually someone who came through the community and now leads our grants program we're only in we just finished the first season starting up the second season now um but their approach to Grants is really cool and I think it's something that I'd like to see more in the space in which I don't think Grant should just be this like single singular like one-dimensional type of funding and that grants are an opportunity to again like not only source more people and grow an ecosystem but to provide and develop people within an ecosystem and so um what they're doing with like the grants program is actually trying to reframe it kind of as a little sub-dial build its own governance processes have its own management um that allow uh for people not only for other orgs within the radical Dao such as like the core development org which is the core teams to direct work by submitting like rfps or something but to also um experiment and this is what they're going to start doing now uh with how you can even decentralize the decision-making of the grants itself right which I think is like another me means of creating more autonomy in these funding sources instead of it being kind of like our it's like not our foundation grants program right it's boredom's grant program and boredom is listening and kind of creating a symbiotic relationship with like the core teams themselves and so there's a lot of Cool Tools like for example they're using um outer space badges which are basically like these like non-transferable nft badges to um create uh you know a like spawn a membership model that exists within the down can be recognized by the parent Dao but have its kind of own structure integrate that with snapshot and now you have like a decentralized governance system that's like very very scoped to the participants in within that certain Realm of the ecosystem and I think that that's going to be a really cool experiment and how can you again support the emergence of these kind of like independent funding streams that have their own mandate yet also um you know create these trusted relationships so that like other orgs can kind of check the power of the grants and the Dao has to kind of approve of like allocating funds funds and so I think that that will be like a really good experiment moving forward and you know seeing what tooling can kind of support that type of organization yeah totally and also um I'll I know that Prime has done a lot of work on like Prime rating and conviction voting as a way to also like separate signal from the noise and understand which grants are like worthwhile funding can you tell us more about how you think about that yeah um so basically the main concept is conviction model so which would be uh again a trust layer so if you would to recognize specific Grant programs and like be satisfied with their approach to the grants hand holding the projects that they select and the the way that they actually onboard them to their culture and their organization at a very high level so they can actually participate in their governance participate in the decision making process so once the conviction model works like when a grant program approves the Grant and provides the feedback so how how can they track the other Grant programs in the ecosystem and see their feedback and like kind of generate this feedback loop on with for individuals and also the projects that individuals are working on so that's kind of my Approach like we need more transparency in terms of like the grant funding we need more transparency in terms of like the the way that we build things together because we have this coordination which it's a human coordination we all know each other for a while we've been working together for a while and uh like this kind of accelerates us as well to a certain degree we have a specific understanding of what we're building I mean to provide that to the newcomers to this ecosystem to our ecosystem and be kind of neat so I feel like uh you know like built Brick by Brick and make sure that we have a solid infrastructure and onboard people to that um in a way yeah totally and from the perspective of a contributor or from a perspective of someone who is maybe newer to the ecosystem like do any of you have any like key takeaways or advice for how can someone get involved who wants to like grow an ecosystem um either like at a protocol level or like open source ecosystem in general or or build tools for grant funding anyone can jump in yeah um now I find that uh I I I went out a bit on the bull versus bear Market situations and and it's crazy how um when it's a bull market you see a lot of I don't know dowels or contributors uh popping up like mushrooms after a rainy day but then when you move to the bear Market everyone's panicking and then everyone's thinking about the the token holder so it's interesting this perspective of how you go back and forth um I was actually thinking about what Simona said about that not all the organism needs to move at the same pace and then how do you manage like how how do you know when when it's time to cut that part to make sure that the hole survives to to not uh yeah do not kill the whole thing because of of one part and with that in mind um it's uh I think it's a it's a great time to to build and focus on providing value I think the the market is great for that it definitely uh cleans a lot of the of what Peter Pan was saying about the Kumbaya that was um so we'll we'll see what the what the real value is um but but yeah if you're a contributor and you want to join potentially find uh yeah an organization that you like that aligns with your values start to provide value and eventually you I think you will be picked up right now we like to say we like to say that those are our leader of uh Liverpool instead of leaderless um but the truth is that I don't think that everyone wants to be a leader maybe so some people really like the framework to and be like yeah being told what to do so we need to find those Frameworks to make sure that we can onboard not just the the Giga brains and the and everyone that that can do that from that perspective so yeah I think that um I do think that now in the bear Market we're like laying the bricks we're laying the foundation for kind of the ecosystems to develop um in the next cycle if you will um and I actually think that there's a lot of projects that are currently navigating successions of power um for the first time or maybe for the second time and that there's actually a lot of opportunity for ecosystem leadership to kind of shine it's hard though because I think actually how you get involved is different from data down from ecosystem to ecosystem and often I think um uh grants or kind of like trying to achieve some sort of like funding stream through an organization is like a great way but there's something more deep there in which like finding um an ecosystem in a community that you align with principles wise and trying to kind of like participate in that Community for like and align yourself with that community so it's it's tough because I think that a lot of people like um for example like as we were trying to get like our grants program off and running there's a lot of people who like didn't know how to engage in the process and maybe we're like since we didn't understand how we really wanted to do grants a lot of people had expectations for how other people did grants and maybe we you know like miss a lot you know didn't meet people's expectations and so I think it's tough but I do think that there's like if I've seen like I the most Prime examples of ecosystem development in the radical ecosystem it's come from community members who just started like showing up and and being in the in forums and in the community and talking and asking questions who then started answering questions for other people asking questions who then started being you know the people that you'd go to when you want to distribute power permissions or Capital um and while for us we're still kind of like learning about what our ecosystem growth should be as we also figure out all the other things with radical it's I think that what we're trying to do is like lean into those like more one-to-one like individual like relationships of supporting people like growing into leaders within the community themselves and empowering um them as they emerge instead of again like gatekeeping it so um and I think that that comes with like a lot of like I feel like my answers are more about like what we can do to support people coming into the ecosystem better and it's like a lot of like like intentional program development you know of not just uh building an audience but building a community um it's a lot of like thinking about grants more intentionally not just as distributions of capital but as uh uh gateways into kind of like other means of development within a project um and also kind of embracing more like ecosystem relationships I think um and kind of like Partnerships just uh really quick um so basically I feel like also as a web trip free agent let's say you know like kind of product project agnostic person the most important thing to the new one board is I would say like first of all learn like to read a lot we have a lot of learning curves and that you need to go through but most important is mentorship like apprenticeship that's that's that's helped me a lot in web 2 web 3 in my life in general and I see like uh we have amazing leaders amazing people that actually cares about like what they're building their mission is uh how can we generate public good stuff we can actually improve our society Prosper our society and if you can find these people and like uh just reach out to them and don't don't be even shy you know like I just ask them to mentally because I think like many people that I know great leaders in the psychosystem they would love to mention newcomers and like teach them what they know and learned because we learn as we teach our new teachers you learn now so just want that on top of that I wanted to go back to yeah to the expectations and Leadership it seems that the default or the first one out there is the gold standard for anything which I think is extremely wrong an example is the delegates in maker though the first one just started the Forum thread saying this is my platform and we had a call with them and that was it so now every delegate in pretty much the whole industry has the platform which is just a forum thread and maybe a call introducing themselves to the community and delegates in this particular case could be so much more than that they could provide Frameworks they could provide reports they could provide so many more things and and all we're getting is just this oh I'm voting this for this reason and this applies to almost everything so try to think outside the box going back to Ops Point try to provide value when you approach someone instead of give me something to do it's more like hey I thought that this could be of use what do you think if you think it's horrible try to get me in the in the right direction but it's extremely important to try to be proactive and and to help your Mentor or your team mentor to to help you otherwise you just take a burden that the normal is occurring I mean I think we've come full circle to ecosystems being a mycelium Network and all of us being mushrooms in the network and the dowels imitate nature as Simona pointed out earlier in the week and with that we only have five more minutes so if we want to take a couple of questions or just say some closing remarks or where can people find you all and connect with you after after Devcon we can talk about where we connect and then I can hand my microphone off to anybody who has a question um but yeah you can follow radical radicals r-a-d-i-c-l-e on Twitter and you'll probably see be seeing a lot on our Forum radical.com Community about the transition I write discourse like this is my job now discourse posts and so we have a lot of really cool ones that are kind of like outlining our transition and a lot of really cool stuff there that's happening in the open uh in the open and you can follow me at Abby Abbey underscore tick home t-i-t-c-1b because I also tweeted about this a lot so awesome you can reach out to inverter Network and also help ergin TR I got a haircut so the profile picture doesn't represent it but you can still find that um yeah thank you I'm 0x7u4m which is Juan just in lead speak yeah I have a very common name so all the combinations were already taken sorry mum mine's just Anna Alexa K on Twitter and telegram so anytime feel free to reach out and continue this conversation and I'm guessing that this is our cue to get off the stage you have time for one question yeah totally Louise hi yep um you were mentioning about like these difference between symbiotic relationships uh instead of check and balances and I would love to know like uh could you expand a little bit more on that and how how would that look like uh yeah so I think that it's about um I think well I say this word way too much but I think it's about resilience right and that like when you look at our natural world actually everything is built off of not really checks and balances like you I think that that's kind of more of like a competitive way to look at it like when something spins out of control something checks it however when you look at like natural symbiotic relationships um the difference is because checking balance is like constraining power um and uh kind of creating means of like limiting power where symbiosis is creating relationships that grow and that Thrive and that like spawn um and I think that that's kind of the difference in which I think symbiosis symbiotic relationships are often less of this like linear um check and balance and more of this like Dynamic exponential growth um at least from my limited Research into microbiology um and I also think that but I do think that this concept of like thriving versus constraining is the difference that I see in which when you think of an ecosystem you you see an ecosystem not again is this like um I mean some people do again it goes back to like natural selection if like what you think about like kind of biology in general but I think newer takes on biology are looking at ecosystems as these like very diverse interconnected networks um that are all building on each other and are all and I think we're now realizing the interdependencies um and I think that's those interdependencies are not like a check in a balance they're kind of a dependency on each other to survive and so I think that that's a way more for me more inspiring take on kind of how we can be building ecosystems in general because if you're working on interdependencies instead of like one person checking versus the other um I think that you can build more resilient ecosystems because we're focusing and it's like how we it's honestly something that we embody and I think in the ethereum space off the bat right is that we want to be composable we want to be modular we want to be supporting each other's ecosystems because together we're more resilient together we are this like headless listing that is ethereum that is like web3 and that's more of a symbiotic relationship than like a check and balance kind of like competitive thing so I think it's coming from like a personal opinion but I think what makes sense to me is like it's switching the model from like one to many relationship where it's like one person at the top having connections to many people to many to many relationships and it's the bonds between the it's it's the bonds between the nodes in the network versus like one person towards many people any more questions okay great thank you so much for coming and we're sticking around at the end of Devcon everyone wow thank you all for being the last panel amazing and I will see you all at the closing ceremony in like eight minutes I think nine minutes perfect [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music]
