you [Music] hi everyone I'm Igor with consensus if you have interacted with me through consensus it's most likely been through the consensus Enterprise set of the house I spend most of my time there working with clients kind of helping them define blockchain strategy going through implementations etc so if you are an enterprise and you are looking to explore blockchain technology feel free to reach out to us and your keys and team we love being a resource and we would love to help you explore your use case with you when I'm not doing the enterprise stuff I like to spend my time thinking about identity kyc and what these things can look like on the blockchain and I'd like to frame the discussion I guess by this question what is the size of the address space that we're dealing with when we use you know etherium so if you read the yellow paper an address is a 160-bit code used for identifying accounts and 2 to the 160 is roughly one point four six times ten to the forty eight which looks like this which is one kwinda Cillian and so like 1.5 kwinda Cillian and possible addresses and this is mainly mainly to illustrate that math is cool but you know we have we have a large address space to work from so with that kind of framing how how can you demonstrate you are who you say you are on these systems and turns out identity is a really difficult problem the United Nations has a an initiative ID 2020 the goal of that initiative is to provide every single human being on the planet with access to a digital identity by the year as a fundamental human right by the year 2020 so identity is a problem that's you know at the a love of humanity now if you live in a you know an economy that's developed and has a you know developed financial services industry and you know you can have things like credit scores if you live in the United States you're subject to a FICO score a FICO speak-o is actually a software company who aggregates all this data about you and then resells that data as an aggregate score and you don't really have much say about that and I'm so not really an open or decentralized system and if you live in an emerging of an emerging market where you might not have a robust financial infrastructure you don't have access to these kinds of services so you can't get you know access to financial services because you can't establish a credit worthiness and then of course you know users may experience denial of identity by identity providers you can you can get your Facebook account closed and there's nothing you could really do about it which is a little crazy in our ultra connected mobile world so our goal is to provide stickiness for your public address and really what I what I mean by that is trying to convey this idea of probabilistic confirmation of a human being being behind a public address and we liked we try to address this in a lightweight user experience where the user has control I do want to say there are many ways to skin a cat given that we have such a large address space and this is an open platform I think there are going to be many different approaches to solving kyc identity et cetera you know what I'm going to talk about is not the only way and it's not a one-size-fits-all solution you know you port at stations or different kind of attestation than what we're talking about here and but I do I do think that registries are fundamental building block of this kind of global operating system that we're building on the world computer so this is my registries registries right three slide I think I think it's going to be a pattern that we see emerging over and over and over again Oracle's providing access stations and the underlying mechanism is a registry of addresses that people can reference I think that's just you know like a UNIX command so given that you know this market is immature and nascent you know we took the approach of just building something and putting it out there and getting some feedback and iterating on that feedback you know the viability of an attestation platform I think is probably still early too too early to tell so what did we build some of you might have used the part of this I know some of you here have used this if you have used proof of physical address thank you thank you thank you I think it's super cool that you're engaging you know with this platform and really what it is it's a it's actually a simple kind of state machine and it's simple by design when you navigate to proof of physical address comm you see a simple web form you've seen this kind of web form a million times every time you order something to be delivered to your house it's just your address you input your address you hit submit the app will generate a deposit address you pay some ether and when you pay some ether to that deposit address we actually physically send you a letter in the mail that letter contains a unique identifier when you get that letter in the mail you come back to the website you input the unique identifier and you input and a serum address anyone that you want it could be the one you use to fund the deposit address but doesn't have to be and when you submit that we will update our on chain registry and provide an attestation that we consensus or proof physical address sent you a letter and we are attesting that you were able to receive that letter in the mail so I don't want to say that proof of physical address is the solution to blockchain kyc and our founder Joe actually he calls this proof of the ability to intercept mail at a physical address but I shortened that title down but you can imagine kind of an ecosystem of these kinds of attestations providers emerging over time different small lightweight primitives that the users can go out and reach out to and get access tations for their accounts and so I mentioned we have been in production a few months now and it's it's pretty fun to see where we're getting responses form and interest we've had over three hundred submissions worldwide purely organic traffic we have submissions from 24 countries including library land which i think is hilarious and you know we do have a road map where we're working on this we do want to provide more proof of services and we are working with the DAP ecosystem you know we're working with you port for badge integrations ether loans safe market had lunch with Gryphon we might do a balance three integration as well and we're working on infrastructure improvements on our side and also one of the things I'm excited about we're working on an MVP of our platform API I don't want to promise any dates or anything it's still very early but that's something we're working on behind the scenes but an idea I want to illustrate is that to build proof of physical address so on the bottom it's all the components we've used it takes a village to raise a child we are able to plug into the etherium community and all the different components that exist and we're able to build a service and as small as it is as primitive as it is but app apps apps and services that are being built on aetherium can kind of reach out and use that service so I think it's super exciting that over time as we keep building these things out you know the ecosystem just keeps getting stronger and stronger and stronger so yeah that's proof physical address you can go check it out use it and stay tuned we'll become with more Thank You Igor Igor village [Applause] [Music]
