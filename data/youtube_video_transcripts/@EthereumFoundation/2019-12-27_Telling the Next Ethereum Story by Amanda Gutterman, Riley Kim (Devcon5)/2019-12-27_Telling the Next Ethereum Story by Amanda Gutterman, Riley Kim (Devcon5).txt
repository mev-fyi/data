[Applause] thank you so much for coming really appreciate that I think this is going to be a really fun workshop that actually delayed it or the exact number of people we were talking about this before and we want you good my name is Amanda I she's marketing officer I have briefs blockchain consumer projects and death adoption is ah the blockchain that people actually use those are problems laser focus this presentation will definitely drop my experience and the workshop hopefully that was all kind of talk about how we tell our stories and but don't worry they'll be made-up stories I am the agent of a PR fall consensus-based opposite appalled by a colony agency region and this is a human America love you accentuated century and etiquette like beans Malaysia and actress anything y'all stories fight countries so we're gonna kind of go through the history of the area Media East and West the present store and the opportunities to Atlanta to certain kinds of Nair and we're going to braiding to small and we're going to rain strong pitches for the meeting up they don't have to be real pitches it should be pitches for a theory of startups or a theory I'm going to get back together as a group and we're going to catch and we're going to workshop the pitches I think it'll be really valuable in it a project or an idea that you sharpen your pitchfork this'll be great first we get a sense of where people are from new years from North America so a lot of people who years from Asia but also be interesting to camera you wrote all rest of the rest of the world we're great always works who s look who has project I work in nature [Music] yeah interesting so when we talk about your who is he listening to us the first thing when I'm creating a narrative is thinking about your audience here are some facts about the audience for crypto and love champ as its today Americans have Durden worked up pretty saturated 81% of Americans have heard of at least of one type of cryptocurrency according to the above all I believe that but ethereal name recognition is 75% I've heard of Bitcoin 24% Bitcoin cash which I don't believe by the way I think they just answered Bitcoin yes think about big cash so have to think about all and actually what we're doing in this workshop is thinking about how people think rather than thinking about the facts so this is a workshop about the reception not necessarily the workshop about the facts although sometimes you have to create in fact for real in order to create narratives that will work usually but so 25% pick my couch which i think is actually a part like one person at 17 percent of her death aetherium so that's a big gap between 75% and 17 you go 75 on a test versus a seven two really different options for you then we tend to think about adoption perception narrative so much in terms of the US market but there there are all these metrics by which Europe and Asia are outpacing the US even if the US and the english-speaking market is the one who drive the global news cycle which it mostly is so 41% of watching encrypted deals in q2 2019 Asia 34% in Europe and 28% best witness it's a definition of a deal I'm so I can't do the PwC report so this is any kind of funding activity or an acquisition so I'm like everything ordered venture funding so according to these metrics the u.s. amount of investment Karin in comparison to Asia and Europe I don't know if it's always going to be true or but to think that everything is about the US market just because the English meaning again is to find near cyclones just isn't true so the audience is truly global I think if you asked people where they thought the densest adoption that worked or what maybe they'd say like South Korea maybe they mistake us but they wouldn't say Turkey Brazil and Colombia but those are technically the deficits per capita adoption of correcto today so who is the audience so in my role that consensus a lot of time identifying who the people are that are searching before aetherium that are interested in the space and these aren't all of them right there are a lot of different people if this doesn't a few minute area organizations and NGOs on here it doesn't have a small [Music] the biggest are potential hires and they're looking for market signals they're looking at the price they're trying to figure out what they're poor lives you have tech enthusiasts so that staying up-to-date on the insurance and the industry maybe they're also researching machine learning robotics space travel maybe they follow with Elon Musk and TechCrunch government officials are looking to form opinions on emerging technologies is this risky how should my agency act regarding a new technology tech professionals what kind of wages should I cops kill myself do I have a potential new job in a different kind of industry that I could business decision-makers so that's of all different levels of an enterprise or startup is this a new way to make money could I make could I make new kinds of partnerships but I integrate new techno would make that way my business more efficient where that would allow me to sell something entrepreneurs what kind of companies that start what kind of companies that join startup investors whether they're ready to head over or not they were thinking about investment targets and then news consumers about ethereum blockchain Bitcoin if they just reach out whether we do stories but they only care about it very rarely so they just make these a couple of the Rechabites so this is the reality check this this little presentation is a look sort of real-life stuff and I know at Def Con we tend to be very idealistic and optimistic and I am incredibly optimistic about the area about this about this community but I think it's important to recognize me most people searching for that area have cared about the price period full stop and that's just true it might not always be true but it is true right now and if you look at the numbers they'll make you cry ever change and if you didn't believe me this Google search volume for a variable chart maps on to a certain set of activities in 2017 certain set of facts and they're gonna see that more people are looking for a theory during the moments when the price was imminent there were other news stories about the very nature time those were often connected to the fact that the price was increasing which was driving other news covers there's a flywheel and so I guess the pointing to animate within says that the news covered about the price increases genuinely brings more searchers into the space even if you end up capturing those searchers and funneling them to everything else so just because people come in price you know they might come in for the for something something else maybe we have together and then just to put this in perspective I think having perspective on all of this is really important so this is the theory on versus Bitcoin search volume remember that 75 percent seventeen percent 75 I attest is a sixteen seventeen percent on it has to get out of town yeah that's where we are so what have people heard about etherium so well mostly nothing but that's an opportunity there's a story in marketing about the marketer who goes to represent the shoe company and women is sent to a village where they're thinking about putting a shoe factory and the marketer reports back to it was boss they don't wear shoes here so we can't work open a shoe factory so the other one says we don't wear shoes here let's start a shoe factory so the fact that people haven't heard about seven Americans is an incredible opportunity and to clean slate to educate people about the Vietnamese are just amazing because the etherium or crypto in general as having a negative perception from all the different market cycles are from the ICO though but most people just have no perception at all so it could be a good thing this is a growth from a position at Bloomberg we interviewed a bunch of journalists creating this presentation sort of reverse interview them to be able to present to you straight from the source what journalists are saying and what they want so Matt leasing has been covering the space for years since 2016 the same year I joined the space at Lubert and he wrote I'm not sure the PA he said to me I'm not sure the public notice without appearing at all but I explained the book I'm writing I always have to start a Bitcoin and most people say sure I've heard about the theory on is the next level yeah so there's nothing that there's no there's no narrative now for the vast majority of so here are the journalists that I interviewed once from East which which Riley in tribute he's our world's I'm not leasing from remember flourishing from Unchained who used to work for Bob Hackett from fortune and unfortunate spin up spin off that's a eternal publication that specifically covers Krypton watching reject Hackett Josh quick back have you started decrypt and the queuing around my desk and these are really different publications and we're going to talk about that a little bit so Bloomberg is a business publication so if you send if you send them at leasing a pitch about a start-up that's doing Spurs [Music] that's not the right thing but if you pitch Maithili saying about Microsoft incorporating the etherium watching into a hundred percent of its to life Laura shins she has a podcast so she's not going to cover it he's not going to cover like a single kind of Daily News I have a scoop on a podcast she's going to bring someone on to have a thoughtful conversation that takes a long time about the issue that's at so it's going to be someone so she'd have someone on speaking about define as a concept or a speaking about at the AMT right now but she probably wouldn't have someone she wouldn't cover the latest release of your about your death even if it has a ton of users pocket what you would love to cover story about usage and same with Josh quick Mary from to credit they both would cover and so it leave all three of those would cover more like a daily a breaking news kind of story decrypt also that's deep dives and all three of those sort of to keep types I wanna say that one desk can be very critical it can also be a it's also one of the best-known industry publications about watching a crypto decrypt tends to be more positive about BIOS but it has a pretty high barrier to entry to get coverage there and then the Ledger same thing because they're part of fortune they're a little bit more interested in this side as opposed to like the culture in the community that I live in covered like potala for a cap t-shirt they would have covered Kasich from the community where I was going yet sometimes really covered gossip time which is interesting because they're often these are all really different publications and when you're thinking about telling your story to a publication it's not making you have a fixed a story and just blast that out to everybody you think about what they do and what they want and he Taylor how you communicate with them and how you tell your story to them based on what's actually up do you wanna talk about so for a sure which is quite refractometer not hypnosis almost by definition in a different stage of maturity compounds to the west and my vices is lashes from USA last Eurocentric so as a schemata which is English which comes to the point of language one main thing that is quite fragmented and part of it is because of language and language is national so if you look at someone from the advice basically no interested in anyone any stories then it has national alignment of national interest for essentially if some sort of it could do something I wouldn't push that tempo be exciting it has to bear with the country so they are interest as was about a minor mention there are different players but we can begin mass off in the versus quite asked in Asia is largely still national so if there are stories which are transnational that perhaps which tends will have a region of view of how the agent trends up with this guy's however with the crypto media by bottom it has to land in their own backyard so that is something because this this high-tech manager and announcing so I'm gonna go through the widely known etherium story so far and this is English [Music] from that same point I start Bloomberg and it's going to be translated over but the media coverage is different by region so this is not the story of the most important things about according to this community these are these are themed things that passed some kind of activation threshold where a lot of people ended up knowing about them and let's keep a lot of people in so these are the things that register in the global consciousness among [Music] and this is according to you the journalists we spoke to these were the ones that they all mentioned as kind of temperaments so bitcoin is emerging in 2009 as a price the price goes over $1,000 Len was Silicon Valley funding wallets and exchanges for Bitcoin than the Silk Road scandal in 2011 and the silver scandal has been quite headache over $1,000 blue opened the Bitcoin space but not even that one but let's keep the 75% in perspective - so you early news of etherium the things that all of the journalists we talked to agree register Vitalis identity so the fact that he was the 19 years old really registered with people this persona the initial coverage this sort of whiz-kid narrative and journalists are trying to tell story about people because people tend to be interested in people and stories about people tend to spread them it I can't as a Bitcoin alternative social good potential she was covered a lot and that's something that the it was successful at earlier that was going to help people and you can talk about how that movie was a problem way but talk about the social good potential then in downtown writing stuff that was I remember I was at a barbecue and I was with okay you got a text from his mother saying is this the thing you work on grandma and grandma you know the area [Music] we're talking about perception and regs that we're only talking perception this is so frustrating for people there deeper this gap that this is this is what registered so then this rapid growth moment in February of 2017 the enterprise aetherium Alliance launches super significant no you have these big corporates that are very exciting this is something worthy of exploration I'm giving it some more thought Jim Missy because even though we have this young genius metallic story it looks that kind of gravitas cosine and we have the ICL boom for caring about token fever we have crypto kitties jamming up the ethereum blockchain with the overuse which highlights the Mina for scaling and then restart having competition for l1 we see together a certain bill more than x squared you get a lot of projects positioning themselves as aetherium killers just actually just create a good area one has to go so yes as you start you start having my credit narrative in 2018 2019 in a period that I'm generously tear mender into the calibration regulatory activity is getting started so you hear about SEC enforcement cftc you're getting market contraction you get the rise of something called defy lightning and you've got some really interesting enterprise activity you can face about the be Brad Callie bruh you got JP Morgan point you gotta understand young which are registered for adopting public watching so those those are some examples of stories that registered I think those are really the only stories that registered for most people that were within the 17% within the community we know so much more than this but these are these are what everybody that we talk to you among the journalists agreed on but really kind of broke and just a reminder that sometimes stories don't do what you think they do so this is from Bob packet equation the Tao packet gave the period Bishop kind of like any press is good press it was an early test of the barians let me explain that a little bit so you have etherium dow hacked on the front page of The Wall Street Journal and you think that is a bad negative word so that's bad for aetherium right not necessarily because the fact that someone hacked something means that there was there so it seems like someone was trying to get something the amount of money is a high amount of ice pay attention and there's a swirl in Syria that's picking up SEO juice because it got that big front page story which means something else that spirit is that you learn by putting up covered because the journalists who are incentive traffic aircon or why'd you want to put this theory on that headline more than they did not that much right 17% but more than they did before so if you want to tell a positive story about the area you're going to have a higher chance and being able to tell the positive story in the area after the area now have to see if there's everybody separating get that but it's in the moment especially if it's in your project you're like oh my god this is bad and sometimes it is best sometimes bad press is really bad press but they're just all these nuances to it that are really important to think about to you so you'll notice that right now on there certain kinds of stories that are told a lot about blockchain Kryptonian theorem and certain ones that we talked about in the community the time that art why are some stars told that some words not called false stories funding sales acquisitions token crisis regulatory actions prominent individuals prominent companies user numbers untold stories the fact that we've been filming this whole time with so much enthusiasm despite the market contractions that's what very widely Nova story that you know at least in my opinion US regulators have taken on a nuanced position period it's not like there's something smart down it's actually been a really available conversation and then people have associated all the kept up with crime stuff because of Silk Road and the best way to run crime is still - because it's drinking an anonymous currency so the association of crimes with all Kryptos it doesn't always make sense and comes from there just the types of media narratives that have broken through and formed the false associations so what do these tall stories have in common and what are these untold stories have in common so these two told stories have properties that make for a headline and that's going to go to share a lot so the names of common individuals I'll buy those that has like SEO juice or or regulatory actions you know down the SEC Monday people always want to hear and she said gossip but what went wrong user numbers that can be a really big positive people want numbers of people at journals to look at numbers at once like you're not numbers is such a such a consistent thing because they want to journalist care about convey their value and delivering information and the fact that they can take a number and tell it to you is a way for them to be delivering value in those stories gente share horn finding sales acquisitions those are really concrete facts and I think right now journalists scarin to talk about anything that's not super concrete because there are so much stuff that wasn't true so what stores when we tell about it this is what our journalists say that they're looking for that we spoke to so one thing that Hannah was the growth of deep I decentralized finances so leak human senses the ICA room this concept of decentralized finance has really taken off Matt leasing was skeptical I didn't even know what defy me it feels very best for you I think it's just a paradigm that people are creating to escape from Bank of America so then prices and numbers matter so John I'm saying you know our readers really care about the price making a theory better bigger and more popular and so really users real problem solving which gets back to the numbers are evidence of some sort is important you need to explain the facts and statistics why the other thing that helps the journalists understand is make sure they understand the problem and how the thing is going to solve the problem a lot of times she was saying blockchain projects seem like their solutions and certain problems and then people want to cover at the area 2.0 and the roadmap the scaling of the technology and getting it to work work well will define whether or not we end up meeting to talk about that area about one contender's so unless unless this and 2.0 jam works out from the lens of media perception but that's going to define whether it was on a bunch of other about one's become major topics of conversation this is stuff that journalists say they probably won't cover it so ideas furniture plans without some kind of factual around so this is something I've overheard 17 to ignore the ideas and just focus on the money so another one was I like I love where everyone is hungry for bacon lots of people don't want to cover another blog site startup unless it's premier to work different people don't want to cover yet another Enterprise press release Bob used to cover every press release he got of transitioning a back-end process to of watching now it's so many other reasons that it's boring so if you won't do it and then like we said before people don't want to be pitch their own story for their outlet and it keeps me on the journalists with pitches aren't right for them they'll remember that forever it is they just don't like being bothered about storage [Music] I think just keeping us off that's always this issue of Asia but the problem is how you define agent itself right now we are in Asia but if your first visit was to Japan it's gonna be very different in their first visibles than Singapore Malaysia Thailand China other parts of China and that's the sort of situation it's a reality that we didn't but we have to dissect it somehow so if you look at a definition of you often get this toss around a lot asia-pacific which has conventionally covered Australasia Australia which covers the Pacific Ocean the term the South Pacific comes with us in ocean and I got this attracts them on the background especially how the society were affected Lucas and his young son Hasan Russia via North Pacific now in the past 17 years with Salceda term in DuPage of the Pacific comes up via the Indonesian Indian Ocean that s our job [Music] sorry yes so that's where the work in the Pacific we may see more of it but he really depends on how the job we've probably seen what the decision quite frequently and that translated generally speaking Japan Korea China and somehow and then Taiwan itself and then there's nothing South Asia now Asia generally China definitely in it salvation generally in the other person unless husband and a son positions around a lot as well this are some of the most dense most culturally diverse it is I think Valley Pacific most culturally diverse enough services itself and at the ASEAN technician block I didn't attack shot when because that's really much imagination generally speaking West Asia sort of fashion I would say is you know fact that space is kind of offer that maybe this opportunity we don't know but we have to start from some kind of departure but the better the approach I feel would be looking at the region as a whole is the end of track speed economy the state of the economy instead of modern modern mechanics generally indicated by a advance of developed nations and oneself in developing and what does this mean for your story now advanced economies tend to be the ones on this year Japan Korea Hong Kong Taiwan Singapore China it's a pedestrian because there's some a lot of qualification it is largely still developing but definitely as we all know we're not a huge growing middle class the common things of this nation is that were familiar with fetish instruments they really have records of savings they know about trade you know of that you know about credit cards the question becomes from ichiran from dr. Perry wasn't hapless for them if they are in it for the trade what's in it for them for historic one of you after just training if all they know is I know when I talk about achievement or got you to them if all you know is prizes like white panda find out what's what what's in for them after this wedding we were less for this developed nations were in Venice people a lot of them it's all about compatibility because there's a mature nation by default yeah infrastructure is required mature if that is the case whereas your story coming whereas your product come in how do you come in what's our solutions and you've been destructive in a good way and you seen that destructive in a bad way this is inherently you have got Japan right now and that I think there's something you guys the type of experience Japan is a very interesting case across Asia because yeah extremely I would say so you culturally in order to cash amazing convenience machine all over the country that you can use your coins which I'm sure you have a lot right now it's really good I really love the Machine one thing I asked why is this why is there a stickiness with cash and I didn't think about it but Japan is one of the safest place on then you literally could lose our wallet and thousand of dollars and then it will be returned to you providing you have your ID card that probably will happen in a lot of other places there is this truss element that is very inherent here and is something to think about for anything about the concept trust because that's inherited in indochina it's here as well with South Korea made us to Japan a bit of tension going right now but they focus much more on the use of use so again anything about the infrastructure they have how are you going to be compatible with that it's in about we're from so post-war rapid growth we are seeing a bit of a generation gap because the nation has will be in three decades become possible there is a gap between what we call me how the generation will not have a play with it and I thought we get that one Bob if your product is gonna really serve the masses at some products claim to be how do you reach them we have a talk about China is a radical sr8 in mass epilim which I find out I thought these are trying to products transferable and their Mauser hit from that point of view do you mean universe adoption just as a fun fact the government of Singapore says you'd be very impressed by how China has gotten pretty much cashless is something that the government is China Quecha without many people behind the developing nations these are ones that we hire of all as violent as most of them like in the Southeast Asian region in Malaysia will be the largest market Vietnam has something happen in China because of is becoming the the place to go for manufacturing SS labor cost rises in China production is meant to do together Thailand is coming becoming more interesting for watching that briefly ovation in LA and then for them as opposed to the previous light when we talk about when we talk about business developing markets from blockchain we often talk about were financially internship you have to remember for the fall for this market Financial Inclusion really matters because a large portion of the guys who robbed a bank pocket of a second and deserve they don't have ID they don't have a background this is what really matters to them you know it's something I was raised like that but it makes a huge impact on their communities and from that can carry on to determine what the government think of in terms of why do we work not yet in our back yeah because it helped to the education it helps you are skilled in them and it brings about to speak with the resin envelop nation so this is the sort of point that is really important yet I have a visibly the biggest worry not about financial illusions doesn't matter to me if I'm a Japanese citizen information I'm very nervous I don't really know financial inclusion but if I'm in the Philippines I mean the rule island I would look for man the fact that is a truck into the system I need that in the developing markets someone naive question but do you know like the cell phone model and coverage yes so broadly speaking I would say in way depends though we were still again is so diapers it depends on where you are as a broad stroke most of the develop new mothers they will have more cell phones then Bank and ice so that's opportunity come in from you know in the neck content and there's a certain level smartphone that's the dominant and drive Chiba and when a penetration level I have to get a stats for you but I wouldn't believe okay give us back country back um just off and he will probably miss definitely seventy percent versus the actual number of users who don't have you know a back unit how that is parent figures I can get for you get TT but it's very very clear so again we come back to infrastructure so for this country's itself is all about opportunities to plug the camps in general are just some general standard states indonesia's interesting what they have to sort of OST Indonesia who instance always been to go to market to test for countries that sorry gunshot in Southeast Asia when they wanted to go out stops so find says police because there is so much gaps in the infrastructure so if your product can be compatible can provide a good service adoption is actually Paris gratis out in fact we displaced through the outer space so that's how fast Russian calculate so these are something I can talk a little bit more but maybe not right now approaching IUI something that consensus work on with the Union Bank of Philippines the I was in the thesis behind it is Spanish inclusion for the bits is one of the nation that cancer about 10% of the Gini covering intensive and if they rely on the existing service are paying up to seven seven to ten percent of fee on remittance that's really not something that's careful for them if we are able to bring it down to you know five percent I don't know whether that that's the name that we're trying to create so if you do the univac I do I actually see a lot of kids and we were happy about it Thailand so this is the one that's kind of interesting we haven't really have a lot that's on that but you would again you couldn't you see a lot of new legislation coming up just like this so I will sort of look at it from this do attract decorations that where are you and was a problem that we saw and what I can cover the whole of Asia as impossible it's about for bias agreement but we now just focus a bit more on East Asia by definition that we here hmm I'm a cash on hand really quickly so right now it's an exciting place to be so next year obviously sound it fixes here earlier this year the g20 summit so as well they talked about Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe he talked about it shouldn't trust the digital trust economy they expect really lovely to come up from the digital economy as a country itself Japan and somewhat be interesting because in oppose war is really successful household names sworn in to Panasonic they have sort of fallen behind a little bit including crown Chile where he came back best will you take a look at a stage so they are aware of this the banking system in Japan has very aggressively looking at exporting money because the demographics in in Japan like most other developed nations its aging they need so though they need to look globally so you have think of that when you are thinking of if I provide something that doesn't financial services in Japan how does that come into play sorry on tickets to of the matches that cancer tomorrow after South Korea just as a fun fact for for wacthing side if you have them live the boyband BTS apparently they become four four one six but millions of the country's GDP just so you know how impactful you start by not meeting you okay just give you a bit of context that puts them in the space of some some time that's a sort of a place where Korea is right now so when we look at when I look at some status experiment work from fascism and we get a lot of hits from career development news every other week every other day we see something comes up a new development suddenly stopped and it's exciting place to be is not only China which as a region is a bit trickier I labor it by languages they where China at the magnet spinning region obviously esme night China Hong Kong Taiwan to some degree Singapore by linguistic heritage so this space itself is is a bit different that's not what mainland China itself I mentioned earlier would be chat with China I think so so far this was actually what I took when I just came in from Seoul from you and a shot that wasn't ever done they didn't take my credit card it was moving a half cash though it was never expensive but but that's when I start asking around and I found like that it's just a culture thing because it's such a state nation use of what you can get well the automatic so it would affect the slide about how can I pass around about the Dow at my box apparently and wasn't really a thing it's back in the news again just by location but it's actually not in the public imagination of the same yeah the interesting thing that we mentioned that that I mention about to people anything else on here Korea yeah what I mentioned let's dig in cash as opposed to Japan which emphasizes quality of service Japan is very I would say culturally perfection is important to them so I think from a part of you has a contract audits so in Japan the tolerance level for errors is very normal to to you everything about it in Korea the different much more conservative efficiency that's the give catch this code itself why do I have to unlock a map he might be because just swapping my cat came from a journalist said earlier times and we're talking and it's kind of make sense if you think about it again if I'm already in the developed nation I have about credit cards I have a if I use a my phone right teacher the credit card to sell what makes what let me compile it for me to do not use that and use some sort of you don't chain a neighbor payment system if I have to unlock it key my appeal we are talk about the inability to remember your child faces so this is something thing about again if you are looking at something from a consumer point of view I'm not sure already from the tribals that's the family traditionally family-run conglomerates so the and I would say the economy is largely driven by this is this culture it's the sums of the LG for them this is a largely conservative traditional family-owned businesses they wouldn't be as risky as a lot of other countries a lot of companies in other countries so that's where we start to see a culture of that removing and patterning startups what this mean is they may not want to actually do it themselves they're happy to find effectiveness to define and it's something that that they can partner with Clayton in operatic record Clinton is something that can have a cow but I was basically the platform the way the checkers we checked KakaoTalk is named after software obviously you know line you have you have Telegraph back come is basically so this is one way that a big company like Amazon thought not liking in their department perhaps is a you know ran and risk management profile by just something to think about if you are the more these companies do some extent if you can't handle one it probably gives you a lot of knowledge because they will have massive again a lot of news around the existing financial system with similar news from Samsung Hana bank image itself again actually the Chinese in javanese how do we go get by for China Leslie that first tiger in itself is you know I don't know buddy I don't know where to begin that's why I spoke local journalist and we can forget it bacteria the first image of the testicle cities of Beijing Shanghai Control Center and at the second one 1970s not fighting because of geothermal energy but I would say with China it's a tricky one for interior partly because I'm sure you guys would have thought the 2017 ico pan and when the Chinese government does something the Chinese government does something was pretty much known as a as a good education platform so the universities government's exploring it but when the bad happened they start up late conservative if you want to talk about it Syria if you came opportunity for Heppell edge of fabric so universities governments actually want experimenting on it just as a you know as a perfect we did a hackathon in the country representing another country Robin Hood yes they were surprised to see the number of people using it Syria what I meant was the developers in China and a hackathon they was about ninety percent ninety percent I believe didn't eat cereal and the local resident recipe surprised because of how evasive the computer the conversation around fabric is for the business happening so I think there's something we want to be aware of representing the materiality as about what's what's for there moving ahead the combination that I'm a dementia defy from the development of you yes they see the wider furniture were accept the media however they are speaking about practice self again so this is something you have to do this meaning you have to get it from that as far as where we are if the ICU pack does move and a composition is around kappa larger fabric for enterprise where do you come in when you're under 70 0 with time i have is a bit different although he was obviously a stock exchange interior scene isn't very likely and i understand part of it is the the job kudos to the foundation factoring has been very is that what Amanda mentioned earlier in this I would say about 15 30 60 if I can't be probably still seen as a prodigy they're everywhere gas is legalized oh yeah so when we talk about blockchain they tend to equate with material that's good it's actually over big so we're talking to developers they acquitted quite strongly with material most of them most of the developers definitely familiar with the programming is not on track when I asked a little bit more I got a sense that everyone knows it but no one knows the dev of it they know that with each other it's not everyone can say that must be on them sharding such it that's something that's a gap itself you see that's again something that you guys should know as well so when I look at it when I ask the question but what about moving ahead what are stories you see they are starting to say there's a sense of fun I guess to put it frankly impatient they are waiting up to pie hole and they want to see what's gonna happen when when when he was writing pen life they obviously will be curious experiment they are or biscuity we already familiar with the contract what is next they are waiting for to buy always business is what I'm saying for Hong Kong I think about financial trading hub for them the main thing I would say is largely similar to Japan Korea a really very developed credit has about debacle they were training digital banking is something that's fairly new in fiscal market so earlier this year in Hong Kong and in Singapore the central bank announced that they will be issuing what we call in to them digitally banks some region we kind of neo banks it's something that believe is varying with this new markets the idea is that this will digital banks will be able to challenge traditional financial banking so the interesting thing for that is you don't have to come from your Genesis doesn't have to be a bank to apply for this license you could be Google Finance you could be a telco and it's interesting because who birds have goes by default they already have a large following and they are forcing the traditional banks to basically make changes this leads to the question whether it's even be when we talk about the Germany faction trading house we already have we already have otherwise reveling in a pale eyes I mean as bigots in a bar and across the sophism so this is a sudden penis you should think about if you're technically dismounted this is something I've already called country but really by by by the fact that they share common language lastly as I recovered the three main regions I wanna cover for East Asia and also running sort of it I guess bring it back to where medicine now when we talk about a show we have talked about stories itself it's very linguistic focus is very national folders and the reason I brought up I meant that and then thank you so much was when we're thinking about this topic itself when we look at it we all speak English but what about leaders who are based in Japan or Korea and then they could only that's a contact with the our language whoa they immunity obviously content from kind as believe junus yeah unkind as will be translated and he gets pickup but what happens to content that's freeloader if I were to represent the car in Makkah if I'm a journalist I'm hungry for Korean or my stories whether we can where where where the opportunities early on and member hadwin slack that talk about the tempo moments again iguana as foreign markets flower really wasn't in the public even now a NASA editor D Street there a comedian in Korea he was showing me how things rang it was basically a lot material to bio vitality thou isn't even up in the top five this what he this one in cooking a commission however I will still say the influence of where news come from in the u.s. is still interesting because when I think about what happened in Asia when the interior pockets were public imagination this previous 2016 2017 2018 we don't know what about the 2017 2018 so 2016 two things happen on a global stage that affect how Ichiro is covered and how blockchain was covered in passivation this new things up if you want to make a guess what is looking is on him in 2016 anyone that's not 2017 so 2016 two things that happen in wasn't really age itself it was the brexit vote and it was the presidential election that got strong so what happened was when this blue thing happened in Italy the prizes of cryptocurrency is back a little bit and then from there you have the conversation on it it became a crypto assets basically a safe harbor and of an alternative that is all that is the moment when they just other people get price of the stuff in a way that's the moment when people suddenly can eat cereal blockchain big fine so that happened in 2016 so it's good to know that the one local store is in Asia but is good to know that there is still some form of can tag along with globalization and that's something that is in and then that story really register and English you can market they nobody was thinking and very few people think there might have been one or two stories on it but that's not was capturing attention L so that's like yeah he was using this product that we found really interesting like a matter seven market Markov stop that truly didn't land where but instead it was president he was from and at least an Associated prizes and a fortune is up in ICU Canadian enterprise discussion the 1919 I think what have been dimension about recovery as well it is pretty legit the conversation Asia is not pretty much the enterprise side of things I think moving ahead we asked the question what's the next narrative achiever for Asia was the next narrative we have explained how the regional blocks were the two earnings and the question that we comes back to you is there a narrative of Asia is there a single narrative of Asia these are a single article from Japan or South East Asia if that's a space you want to go after what are they you whether the median mean what kind of story started to bring up that that wonderful court they connect season so I think these are kind of a conversation in wanna kick start in this workshop what I will be innovating and what your acting right so now it's time for us to do you want is not a baby's depression service two questions first I had a question back to like sorry Oh slide one you not go back to it if you said that oh there's more growth outside of the US do you feel that's attributed to regulatory culture in the u.s. even though so much watching is shaped by the english-speaking market not all but some the absolute not all of that is touching dominant in terms of where all of the activities happening and there's so much activity in Asia and Europe even though they're not the ones setting the story oftentimes so that was not to say not so much to say that we're like why the u.s. is not interested it's almost to say these that these other areas are increasingly interested yes I've looked throughout Southeast Asia that China the u.s. is only a quarter maybe 1/4 the market at what's happening and I think it's because the population in the United States's million as opposed to the rest of the population around the world so that's probably why there's a lot more interest and activity outside that states but a lot of what we're seeing is what I'm seeing outside the United States is a lot of the thought processes being driven by the United States even though it doesn't even make that a quarter of what is happening in the rest of the world so how do you how do you include and how do you promote because supposed to be over 22 different continents and two different sides of the planet how do you guys collaborate and how do you include and how you get that message out as a singular message to the rest of the economies and the rest of the activity and how do you make sure that when you do report on such a matter that you're taking in the perspective of many different economies and many different perspectives of many different countries and report as a one information that everybody can understand them apply in their ecosystem I'm going to tell you too many stories that quite - the necessary to assess just and the first is that Thank You cryptic or decentralized or literally into Japanese it means that makes sense you know it's like in a metaphorical way it's like you're like soul thing is all over the place and it seems like maybe it split apart into little shards and you know that that also makes sense and the word to send the word I think I know if it's fortunately right etherion right essentials agent but there's one one of our core key terms it's very close to Mandarin - the word revenge and actually what we were working on it was in there was a movie and it was in Korean we were localized I was working with the EF public to localize the etherium duct work website and we had we did like an algorithmic suite let me have a human suite and the human suite was like oh my goodness every time this thing says watching and said to be interred that it was really this is exactly I mean after living in China and learning how Starbucks went into moved into China see my cup they had to think of each of the characters or Kentucky Fried Chicken in the GE or McDonald's might not all here they had to have a cup like a common thread to the name to advertise who they are but they had to have it communicated inside that community and that ecosystem in a country in that language from my perspective what so everybody kind of got it so how do you and that's exactly the soleus is what I'm thinking about and the different languages being applied to the messages what's not even about just the words of different languages the word words and language as if you kind of believe the Sabre work at both of those converge from like ASIS that's embodied by the language and so it's not just about to realizing that Thank You Otto translated something into Japanese about something your soul exploded it's about really thinking about the Japanese narratives around stuff like the community centralized it's not like having a very rigid hierarchical business over here the way that they do and how to explain that to them and that might be different if you have a company like consensus let's say it has a project you're going to explain that project a little bit differently that while still being accurate about the nature of the project so so and you have emphasized different things that you feel like you're going to resonate the most with different markets and that's why you're not just literally translate but genuinely bless them based on a real understanding of of people in that market here so treasure chest just really so because my role is about my cover agent as a pigment so this is something that muscles the agent thought Pacific is really in Australia and Australia is English busy so I don't have worried if I mess with them for Asia I speak Chinese but I don't speak Korean or Chinese Mandarin happy and repurposing Ebony's of the tricky thing is even that is a bit tricky because cannabis is totally different it uses a Chinese cream but it's totally our words that doesn't express yeah so we sort of learn it's learning process but I think to do song as a question it's both it's a it's an you know this term is plus around a lot by HSBC like yes Global global but it's true because when I put also the hospital from stateside and I just let me sum up distributed amongst our different is offices in the region we find our breakfast attics like we have a piece of nerves collided which is business class on Jeff had for some reason such an object beckoning to me that is something that was really interesting then we have something else that can give up another character was disappearing one the translation however is something that we get vocal patterns we accept them the log office they do them because you need that that ever it comes back to a point my heart the reservation is specific emphasize that the local media represents the local readers they are your audience ultimately they are considered and so they need to understand so if they are reading them if they really come along or something or they read something and you know on a website on your website English they hit Google Translate they can see the word Solars don't think that something you want so I guess it depends on from from our view it depends on how you could have plan your you know type of attack of resourcing and the make sure you have the proper representation the computer community decades ago from a marketing point of view it was easy for companies to make a lot mistakes the one that I mentioned and it's not just Asia when they translates that are brand names you know France aw oh I'm so sorry about classic company I lived in Nigeria and there was a air-conditioning company tire that moved into Nigeria they wanted to dominate the market for air conditioners but they didn't understand the local pigeon and when you say I didn't know that I know but now I it means that I am going and so this why the marketing guys came in and he said I'm going to put a billboard up and it's gonna be an air conditioner and it's mistake we know cool which means we do not pull in the local language but he wrote KN o W you not in O so we have full there's a lot of a high level to the diversity in the area so if somebody says hey what does that say eight says we know cool and has the air and understand that air conditioner does not pull that job for very long and this is the reason why I came to talk because understanding the etherium in the lower it's really funny about the language Sookie but I feel you you really have to commit to you really have to put in resources that come in to get a translator accurately right and the challenges because our space is so new no chain is so young history so we have a lot of the words coming d5 that came out no web internet and that now exists as concept as a philosophy lesson as a sermon and how you translate that into the Korean Chinese and if you are going to the market you know if you couldn't in mind the language should be different I have no idea what that transition would be but you have to start with your ability to do because this is so it's not a Yemen in establish space where they start a bed chair but what's our destination the lexicon is there the Mexican is is still evolving for us you know thanks we may have been totally in Mexico so sorry Judy wanted understanding question so for you you guys is about communications practitioners what do you see is the key titles or maybe journalists or social media channels what are the what are the key to the university you guys pull to get your I think it's completely dependent on the message and the goal so I mean I think if you start with I want to if you start with I want everyone to know what I'm doing and who I am and this is the story about how that's a very limited way to start and they give to work backward from I want to take my product to Japan and and I want to get this amount of users in Japan and here are the media outlets as you can things that they covered here the cases they jump here's what bothers them here's what they like so I'm going to craft a story for my project working backward based on where you want to place it so it's never communication in a vacuum it's always communication based on target audiences I would say that communications is a protocol or a practice rather than a set of stories or any sort of don't you agree with this really any any specific piece of content it's insane as a way of behaving an intellectual exercise of connecting in point with the existing and to the work project well well well being representative does that exact so so a lot crypto projects want to land love crypto projects as a your standard issue thing is looking for they're often looking for numbers adoption of nurse then you really care about is just high numbers of users Indonesia as Bradley mentioned it's a great place to experiment and just users visit the cost of user acquisition is really below but the spending company your average users really love to so that's a great place to optimize your product and her marketing and then take it into there's mother whispered that's it and then take it into a higher price point market but then you might have to have two different price points one for the folks in Indonesia that can't afford it once implemented so you have to be thoughtful about it and you have to be respectful about it otherwise you're going to have a negative brand back with that flash so let's say we've got a bunch of users Indonesia now we're back after transmitting those a lot of a lot of companies want to have some if they're going if they're going for adoption in the crypto community they want pointy nose by telegraph if they're doing a product rush don't want it on TechCrunch thought they might be able to get something into the fortunes of the ledger decrypt the blog because there's a cadre and you know usually startup founders in space don't understand that they're gonna get Manish covered early industry coverage version burn first first because you usually like the way that we talk to each other in this space is often a little bit grandiose you know we have changed my thing is changing the world why is this not the front page news times you know and um and any lose track of what other people are thinking about other people's incentives are endles are how much technical knowledge people that really have especially when they're getting outside the end yeah and so that's why I put this book with math Lisa at Bloomberg on camera just don't dumb it down but think of a colorful colorful way to get your message across so we're going to something English what you're doing and then maybe you can learn some national stuff so like ft is a great place to land a finance story that popper is really hard to get a hold up but you can't it's really really now the saying it has to be helping you at the wall street journal' all of the republic are also people really wanting to some Reuters people can get the front up yeah I think there so that doesn't like total of everyone's because of the juicy ones that everybody wants and then I mean towards back when you were just omit just make it really personal when when humor reported reports I I had item parts like very much enough those to my mind but Aaron okay yeah and Forbes for saying Michael Douglas two years there now or shed their effective presentation others of the people just people people on a bandwidth and then Twitter every every ceramic heiress this board Department escorts now what what's the list of those people in Asian markets Asia is got different by languages is practically for media itself is tricky because what we consider the talked about the other window they are very hot men by before market in Asia upper focus on and the price-anderson biggest earlier and I mentioned to him career Tarantino sign Miss Korea they focus as various related career if you are doing something is not something helps always also let's say then impacts you're doing something that helps elderly in so that's a correct story it's it doesn't it just makes no sense for me to push it last our simulation now with the blooper writers writers they have national desk we blew the CNBC they tend to give original they like regional stories highly competitive if CNBC what Texas already love it all you know like versus lose it this is this volume under the social platform that's a bit tricky because as extremely diverse each have like I mentioned that is the dollar that form for China and it sort of comes in a contest of you literally don't have to get out each I happen to live your life in China everything is fun things it does me that you wanna stories about each other so I think you matter of things up I think open collar finance they if I'm right they God in that off each at because they were seen as like doing too many hit commentary at that affected a man they're not personally so we chat obviously in parts of Asia line like other people group that is business well Facebook in part of develop naka social media it's interesting in part of the and it's something that you talk about you talk about in parts of Asia social media equals internet you wouldn't think of it that way I mean us they would in in a more in order to achieve attack or something jovial but you you do that impact of people a marker social media is is how they get information that's why there's so much concern with Facebook nicknames Facebook something X that we have a hidden agenda of the exact reason that's that's the tester challenge Facebook is facing any other social media Facebook is in fact very innovative I thought a default this is the case with developed markets or line lines because so far is that if you be able to get a piece of news in back the host which is the sort of a national English language in Tyrell that's a that's a huge ship if you want a champion because it the English but if you want a local or perhaps you want to read in he or she is is another in the back of course he or sees this given see was online what's up Facebook so that's a start of it sounds like Spencer not if you have to split everything but you have to like well that dimension also have a audience what is the goal what is and then you move backward what comes to the channel slightly disturbing so the way that we organize the PR team consensus that we have Asia and us your representative in music starts all over the world to get more treats are coordinating with full-time folks with external agencies as women you're interviewing we're thinking about having a PR agency and in South Africa and we were interviewing these PR agencies and they kept sending me decks for content creation and I didn't understand I didn't understand why and all of their assets obviously if we contact your says that we have we have a Content team just PR that justice just talk to the journalist and localize the message for the job site and then it was so confusing that they explained to me there's no difference the PR sites every story and then they polish them and there's no there's no like there are certain videos we've got loaders that there's this but they're like what are you talking about what are you so there's a different thing going on with just like what media is and how it works and different markets and surface everything about fairness construction works and actually do you think that parties well I think that's really like where you have a dominance of cellphones are gonna have the dominance of media through things like we chat online and Facebook and that allows you the opportunity to do your own PR as news right and also to use influencers in those communities another big audience like what you are suppression early on about that additionally more boxes that is that is that's that's like the case if in the developing region where by average becomes the world and if you compare the second or the u.s. or Hong Kong so you're gonna have a head for yeah not going to have a laptop and experience is different they're not going to look at and use another summer at the Artemis shadow games and computers rather if a farmer I'm going out the farm I would really like this well forecast so that's very that sort of an understanding the purpose for them to communicate we say content but they want enforcement of us today wasn't in the weather forecast price of grain is there a of people effect they are in sugar so listen this is how they Yahoo is gone from them and I think there is very opportunity for informative and because if you are you going to get those thing the pickup is Farrah Fawcett I mean you mentioned influencer but in different different markets have very different perspectives on especially right now like right now I would never english-speaking market explicitly huh [Music] scepticism that there are markets where I would think I was okay and I've had an english-speaking country genuinely go out in the market that are very following and say do you actually like this thing that will you help me as opposed to like Harrison tokens I think particularly in like the brand an e-commerce marketing it's all influential totally it sounds really really different perceptions about over here and it's a great incentive so I have a question on that system for localization because so I mean I think I mean if everyone else were to be that if you wanted the narrative consistencies one of three factors but if you have a look when you're trying to do localization of those narratives it is very different very difficult to kind of fall to do to provide QC because you don't know the language and if you have them like a kind of a local national in a team it can be provided but that's not the case I was what their common kind of mixture of imperative is white as well on how it is how you get directed because any if you have partners maybe ability to but again you cannot ensure that those partners are doing a good job so that you have those suspicions if you have those belts how do you get the feedback how do you make sure that the narrative is yeah so it's a a bigger problem outside of that is that experiment no one run is in the market or Meredith like that to look once we don't know that so we will probably help they are out from that in terms of like consistency and control and then on top of that be a one there in I got the your question there sometimes he messed up you know but there is a marketer we have a partner that we realized pretty quickly it wasn't we're doing a good job and maybe doesn't have a good reputation we the moment we found out which we found out from you know just growing our presence in that market we switched it so I mean not not a huge deal but just like that this intermediary wasn't doing a great job translating everything and we want to have a better answer so you you find out from other locals but that's the way to find out so you find out feedback and so triangulation is also super important triangulated with another disinterred stick group so let's say you you go into a market you're translating your content and it's a blanket where you don't have anyone on your team so you've hired some kind of intermediary you ask someone that they don't know to review the thing by or just I can tell you there was like an algorithm part but I think manual conceptual kind of problems is because globalization can be disastrous okay but you need to do that in a certain region especially for here maybe not so much farther protects since its decentralized anymore nation that someone likes a violation of its axis best narratives they are without our definitions that we won't have big development I could be done in an open-source week let's say or any hardware ever and there are local people are interested so if there is a weird those who can have some sort of replication check that you know it's not something nobody can officially all projects then you can reach out to them and they can so translate it or so that completely existence and the etherion  war website is that so ever so there are translators from all different languages translated call for content Imperium don't work which is the site with the domain they may be will be order to put our victory HDMI Roland which this wonderful woman has been running a program and therefore in other languages there are no hundreds and hundreds of contributors and all of its doctors github so exactly and houses hundred percent it's been really strong right like crowdsourcing translations and then having a professional look at over well none the other thing that I would definitely recommend getting involved with because I started at 3 days ago but with with the bigger people with his marketing down so the idea is to if we launched it at the at the moloch Damita and the idea is to get a bunch of stakeholders and spades together to create the funding and governance mechanism properly marketing of messaging area [Music] you know there should be something dependent entity that does that that has the proper expertise to do it so there's a telegram channel there's going to be up Twitter looking for members and and help work on it probably it'll end up ain't opportunities with people kiba's twitter is true India but I had a question so as you know you guys are gonna mean hustlers write narrative peddlers what about narratives that you're selling today what's what's augmentation what's all in Asia I would say it's not actually defined yet but it's a it's singular the lady will just that she mentioned that a lot of the thought process do originates from what we call us combat which is in this case agency very focus on enterprise like that it's extremely focus on the business out of these I don't represent a business business room but that business side of it is about how we get something greater so the conversation has shifted from what is the chain how does this work - POC is way past Busey now businesses don't need you to explain they don't need assess my stop change what is it why is this magically how the question is issued on the problem how do you make this work and it had already have us a good idea that they want that the process has really been I just I mean if I'm a business in a certain sector I want something another way can you create this for me what you wrote this upon that is a competition at the business that is beyond kills is already yourself yeah I think I think I think the stories that people read our story so I heard or it's something with with major customers so if there's a number like that right now we then define people are trying to figure out what it is try to follow it the theory of 2.0 and roadmap scaling those are coming thanks people are looking for it now some people are interested in this next round everybody I can't given the enterprise thirst do you work with like EMI and nightfall to push that into the enterprise space in Asia or is that to partner specific and your level I don't have the information specifically it's something that I think should attract because of we have because I have not develop a background myself so like that that maybe conversations about this that I'm not familiar with so I kind of I answer that but this was advice knife all right yeah it's just seems like they're doing really great things on the enterprise to make use and publish that or have those enterprise users interact with the public change space there speaking of it I saw them yesterday look we're getting sump'n time message yeah what does happen message that you're giving us that looks like a strippers okay great I guess we're just not gonna do that exercise otherwise the peach died to call you Betty you know that's news that maybe you guys can do this to be more about the belt and know this well cheer to Annette do you have a desk sure so my the argument goes like this news is a comment and a public good and who should fund that probably good the answer is the people who are affected by the news so if you want to create a new source to cover cryptocurrency then we can imagine you know the top ten public chains the top ten exchanges the biggest wallets to pick a species they should all be members of this step they should put Funston down so that thou can allocate the resource to create news gathering teams to cover this conference and if you want to make it a revenue generating down then that now could go with some essence like that's called it Dow desk accom and down s comms in place that the news that's approved by the Dow gets published and it's a place that advertising things sounds like we should definitely work together with marketing down valley that is right just do the cue okay let's try any more questions from other regions or something something you guys roblox I'm just more of an annuity this year so I spent a lot of my time reading a lot of the publication's hear what I said I still feel like people use the word Bitcoin to represent blockchain or then there's a great article that comes out on news and etherium it's like they've gone through the article and remove the word aetherium and put the blockchain into it do you know why this presentation well you're trying to appeal to a larger mass of people sorry guys it's a co-write it's like it's a calculated decision infuriating from my point of view just so I was hours of having to post in 2013 and one thing that we would do is we were just put like it's Kim Kardashian into the base about that URL for a barely so you would go to you you would never select any views aren't and there are be all this stuff in the basement but they around that just was stuck right like keywords and so it's not like something malicious that mean animus against aetherium they're just going to go with what's the most recognized it comes it's like they're gonna cover like a zero bombing down Fifth Avenue they're not going to cover Z brothers and I'm not going to cover you know something that smokes but quite makes it stand out Marx is better known we went over those numbers and so the way to fix that is to get a theory on yourself and the more know the theorem is Media is to put it in a headline there's a really funny Twitter account called the Beltone builds on you wish a little tweets out every article that is about something else on oh they're really they do they do a really good job and the other thing is what friend I've noticed with this is better that they don't mention that there was blood jangle but then they're they're mostly on the barium make the last time I checked something ninety-six percent of projects built on the area built on the bar chamber built on the beer now when people say watching they usually mean the area but you know block jam so much bigger keyword very still keyboard than watching and lots of companies don't even wanted to be the cryptocurrency because of me because so that's where we are right now that there need to be applications of Miriam it is give me more so it's a big point so that here's a challenge bitcoin is digital gold historic value they're all these mediums about Bitcoin at the area doesn't really have right now and so there's a there's a zillion dollar competition of God or an infinite and infinitely scalable remunerated a competition for who can figure out a program as programmable money it doesn't really cover it smart contract harm like nobody's looking for that last minute the biggest blockchain actually gets the larger plastic we were talking about I'm calling it the biggest blockchain and then and then there to be a sister company come the bestest the biggest and that's not that's not oh so there's a great there's a great book called the domani two immutable posit marketing we don't like to think about one thing how cute so you have a little space like you got one in there it's like the safest car although no one else can be the same as a car it to be this something else is courage to be the flashiest card it allowed Ascari up to them to enter play like card sorry it's all negative you know like if you have to have to be with something and here I'm still working on that and gosh did I try to make that which is true that's so many personalities in a few guys know some people people think that Joe is this is just talking about like objects good people or what they eat for breakfast but just talent is a zebra walking joke about him because of his age it's very unusual and so and also being so articulate so that's why that was listed as one of the core stories from the very beginning because I'm because of that persona whereas you get some like Joe's background more often in that kind of position that doesn't lessen his as a storyteller in the space but it's certainly like a less unusual profile and that's better for certain situations that works for other situations so what I'd like is that there's actually such a variety of characters in space that sub into the situations that make the most anytime the two of them are the ones that I think of the most is that does that because maybe viewers I just maybe I don't want to hear from the jurors eyes and guess for ages like Singapore vitality Joe yes but Joe isn't a specific they'd have to loot anything from the because think about such a financial heart they were getting from a financially and it has been it for vitality I imagine him in a death is his video the Chinese speaking the Taiwan Association so you have a China it's our coverage is there anyone that that you think that as being much experience I guess super here and then then they they're a bunch of they're a bunch of other people that Danny Bryan and then piracy of people died any people on the other I think we've got some folks here though that would you go to the underpriced time that's our domain like Jordan that's like it's a pantheon of different Nick prenta T these three different occasions what else I think that we as developers get stuck in marketing to this tiny little go system right and if we're gonna actually get this story to be a bigger story we have to find the means that actually where we get the story because yeah it's something that we get a lot of defend us not necessary businessman [Applause]
