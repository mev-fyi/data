hello guys nice to meet you acronis actually is not a start-up as much of the company's presented here with Cronus's really big company with 800 some place in more than 20 offices around the world and millions of customers and business clients though it's still full of entrepreneurial entrepreneurial spirit 20 is well known as a provider of cloud and on-premise bakaba disaster recovery solutions data storage file sync and share solutions of course not all there four hundred engineers are working on the blockchain products though we apply a lot of efforts in this direction and I would like to share with you our vision to tell you about our achievements use cases and the lessons you've learned our first product is acronis notary it's a it's a platform that allows customers to store and exchange data in a safe manner a bit the guarantee of authenticity and integrity of this data you may argue that the mutability probe that the immutability property of the blockchain is not in use but what differs a whole product which acronis notaries and the feature is the set of interfaces and features that allows customers to solve their problems not really has a combination of unique features such as synchronization between nodes advanced search of protected metadata built-in verification of stored data and have to put algorithm I will tell you in ma details about it later basically the blockchain the best I it for cases where multiple parties and multiple entities involved and especially when those entities do not complete the trust each other and there is no a trusted intermediary that's why the thing that our solution is best used for a consortium that needs to exchange data and sometimes big chance of data that are impractical to store in a blockchain you may argue that there is for example I PFS for that right but it's a PFS is good to share photos of your dog or your white papers but when you deal with medical records and personal data you would definitely prefer to to do with something more secure so we found the tower product works well with consortiums where data is shared between the parties let me say few words about features of the product first the certificate of course when you anchor your file in in a fingerprint of your data in in the blockchain it's not it's not a new feature of course every one of you knows about it but what differs our certificate our products our note is written authorization certificate allows you to verify authenticity of your file you're safe by well provide you'd be providing you with all the necessary information for this and the certificate contains all the necessary information for this and you can prove authenticity and integrity of the data even though you would have stopped using our applications so it could be done independently the verification could be done manually or by using the API you provide you verification can also could also be done in dently by a third parties search another necessary feature is the research as you know it's blockchain and athyrium itself are not very good for this so we provide this feature for you you can you can sometimes you need to know who and when applauded the file to the storage as well as you need to filter your data by date time and status for example we developed this convenient user interface and rest rest api for this another feature is synchronization d found that in many cases especially when private block chains i used a party's wants to have this sociability on premises on their own they're not that's why that's why we built this feature that allows users to synchronize metadata metadata using etherium blockchain mechanisms optimization it's also not a big news for you that block chains have a limited throughput and in case when you need to notarize a big amount of files like thousands or millions of files as we did in our use cases this limit should not stop you moreover it would be very costly with public block chains if you would not arise each file in the blockchain that's why we use Patricia a miracle tree structure with very variable chunk size to solve this problem so how does it work there have two basic scenarios the first one the second one is when you upload a file in the storage the storage sense events to the acronis notary which in terms communicates with a theory on blockchain and receives data from the tree on blockchain proving that the data was recorded then this metadata is stored in acronis not remade a data storage and distributed between the nodes the second scenario is you can use this product with your own application not on it is not necessary to you to use it with the storage you can use any your application and send events why rest api or mpq to the notary storage then you can search and send purification requests or Krishna tree and do the blockchain how a theorem is used here we use Marco tracks for data protection events for synchronization miracle Patricia tea for optimization of stored data and proof of work in the public blog chains and proof of authority in private block chains acronis uses the film and a score parity at the main block chain components the product is built using robust microservice architecture product can be deployed in the cloud in the acronis cloud or in asia or on-premises let me say a few words about use cases some of them are already in production in the production stage some still in in a pilot stage first storage we found that there are several very good scenarios for it for this usage for example it could be used for long-term archiving especially in the industries in the industries which are heavily regulated banking industry health care it also could be used for for notarization of footage from security CCTV cameras another use case which is already in production mode open pixel is an open source tracking software for mobile advertisement advertisers publishers and that advertisement network not usually trust each other if you you probably face this problem already it's industry when sometimes you download logs and or your provider gives you logs and you do not really believe that it's this information was not altered our solution increases trust build parties by neutralization of the logs in grantees that data was not manipulated afterwards and it actually it's not for fun it's for money because this solution decreases transaction costs between parties smart contracts for a company for holding company this case is also in production mode how it works there's a holding company which was developed by acquisition of different companies that's why there is a zoo of different earpiece systems within the holding company and they need to integrate some features like they need to approve payments going from each company in in the headquarter actually they had two options the first one is to hire is to hire consultants or to consultancy company to integrate all the earpieces teams it would be very costly and would take a long time another solution it turned out to be very simple it was the integration what was completed within less than within a month earpiece systems was integrated using our notary feature and what is more important it allows all the companies to be sure that the data was not manipulated the major takeaway from this use case at that usually it usually big companies consist of several entities which do not completely trust us at each other for example each entity in the holding company always has its own CTO CEO who are responsible for P&L and budget the last use case became for I became for Ben consortium in Russia banks exchange information between each other for example information about people who try to prod them or exchange information on credit issues to class and their client score the major takeaway from this use case that usually companies in many industries find have already found the way to arrange communication for major use cases like banks already have Visa Mastercard or field because they cannot live without payments but when it comes to exchange information in less important cases like exchange information about products they just cannot arrange consortiums because they would need to arrange a company elect the CEO distribute shares manage the company and so on it's it's so cumbersome that no one is going to do it and they also do not like to use a single provider to to help them that's why our solution can help big companies in not only big companies in many industries to arrange consortiums it is very pleasant to show you a smiling faces of our clients yes I'm I'm closing and by the way if someone wants to share your ideas or ask me equations you can find me in the whole trading your questions or your ideas for this funny t-shirts I still have some thank you thank you very much Victor much appreciated
