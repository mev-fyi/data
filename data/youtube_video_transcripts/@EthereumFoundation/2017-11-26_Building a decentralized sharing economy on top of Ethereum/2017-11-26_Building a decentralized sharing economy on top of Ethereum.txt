[Music] okay so thank you very much for having me here it's an honor to speak at Def Con so I remember I've spoken since Def Con zero I've got 1 2 now 3 and I see the crowd is really crowing like doubling every year it's really great to see the crowing of their if you make community so I want to tell them a little bit about what we are doing it's Lockett so our goal is to build a decent life sharing economy and since last year I was speaking a lot of things that happened so we have done several projects one which is worth mentioning a Cheyenne charge this is a project we did for energy and help building it and this is a platform where people can rent out their private charging station for electric cars that other electric how users use them so it enables to to help that we will have a lot more charging stations especially in Germany they're already 2200 charging station life and the public is them chain this is backed up by a large corporate such as energy in Germany I think it's one of those rare occasions where a large corporate is using the public key food chain to to connect their assets to it so I think this is a really great project another project we are part of as energy web foundation you will hear more about it later today from talk so I would not go too much into this another project we did last year we did we use the DAO framework and in an auto setting and at Siemens there's a large competent Germany I guess you all know it there is a live cow running there with a lot of people participating inside the siemens company so seamers employees and they are using this for donating to a charitable causes so it's similar to a charity now that they yeah use the funds they gather together and make voting's together and send it to some places so we are working hard with larger corporate and Germany to make them use a medium and help them learn how to develop technologies on top of this but this is just one part of what slogged is doing the more important part in my view is our work on the so-called universal share network so what is this about our goal is to connect smart objects to the blockchain by managing the access control in a smart contract to see who is allowed to use certain devices so we know that the number of connected devices growing and growing you have smart locks you have smart plucks and a lot of other devices and we want to control the access to them via a smart contract which can be a payment can be another logic behind this so let me show you the architecture of the universal sharing network so first you have the UN registry and this is completely based on the es you could even say it is DNS because we just use the domain there which then resolves to access control smart contract this is another part here and the access control smart contract has the logic inside to rent sell or share things or even pay as you use connected to a payment channel or just have a white list of friends and family which are allowed to use the object but every smart device can be registered if you ascend with a nice human readable name and then pointing to a small contract managing its access control of course another thing you need is an actually access control device because most of the smart objects do not have enough bandwidth and computational power to actually run any through even light note so and for those who do don't don't have it we have built an access control device that runs in a film light can light line it can run an IP FS node and it runs a library for home automation so it can be used to connect to all those devices at home I've also come to this point a bit later this access control device is then connecting to the smart device or door lock or other things in sending a Bluetooth SIG B or set wave signal to control it so that's the basic architecture then of course you have the mobile app a mobile app has the purpose of managing the keys helping vistas covering objects could be something which you're close to the NFC or scanning in and QR code or something you're not close to just showing your map and you can discover those objects so this is the general architecture now I want to go explain a bit more about each of those points so first the USN registry which everybody can use it has falled following the following format that has a device name an optional device counter because we often found it use one smart contract to manage a lot of devices you of course can have one smart counter to a device but it's not very efficient also when it comes to gas costs and often you have one owner renting out several objects so therefore you have the device name optional counter and then the contract name and the contract name then resolves to the access control smart contract on on DNS so it can look something like this a city bike number three at a pool and bike rental taught us and all these this is the ID of this small object which would then be resolved to the smart contract and can be managed from there so we're very thankful for Nick who developed the ens this really create system very well thought-out and very usable today so let's come to the access control smart contracts there are a lot of different use cases and you cannot have them all in one contract so actually those small conflicts have only one required interface which is similar to the ENS it's just the supports interface function and there you'd say which in the face of supported which can be several something like the rent functionality which is the most basic one where people can pay a deposit use something and when they are done they return it they get a deficit - to cross back and the costs go to the owner this is one interface another interface could be to put something in the future and we serve something for you you can have white listed groups which pay nothing or can get it can use it with a discount or you can just pay as you use and in this case you can resolve to an address which is managing a payment channel missus payment channel you can pay directly without going through the small conflict all the time and just pay as you use so those are the access control smart contracts the access controlled is this something you have played around with a long time in the beginning we just use raspberry pies they are nice we can use them for a lot of things but they also have their weaknesses it's just not an industrial create device which everyone has used em for a while knows the SD card can break and a lot of other things can break and so we have choosen the Samsung Arctic 7 as a very good chip for our use case it has an 8 core 64-bit ARM processors has Wi-Fi Bluetooth SIG pthread everything on this little chip here there's 1 gigabyte of RAM 4gb of flash and this is enough to run an ECM light line very stable in this device and also you can have the ipfs node running in this has enterprise class security and has a hardware secure element in it which you can use for storing the keys but you can also use an SMT 32 on the chip to do this software as I said the light lined we have home home open-source home automation software running on it and of course our user and access control logic as the other script on OGS code so it is actually the stuff I showed it here but some of the devices this is a sweetie printed box where we have this I never show you in a minute how does hopefully works and life demo but let's get to the user interface so we think use under faces are very very important if you want to target mainstream so if you hired a very good designer helping us building a nice use on the face let's have a moment switching to my phone here see if this works so you should see the screen of my phone which is connected seems like it has a very weak I'm glad it worked so this one I show you now is not the real life app this is the design of the app and afterwards I'll show you what we have built so far which is about 70 or 80% of the stuff you are seeing here so bad it's not it's important to show you also the design to get a feeling of how people can actually use the system so in the beginning of the screen showing you what's some filters like available now with 0.5 kilometers certain kind of things so if you go in it makes them suggestions let's say I want to drink something morning well I'm not a coffee drinker so I actually may have on I have a bike ride to the office for example we can switch to the map view to see what's available in my neighborhood or close to me and so let's say I didn't want to rent something I can also search for stuff based on time or just based on which kind of object I want to use so let's say I'm in the morning I want to take a bike to get to the office so I can go for bikes I can check out for the current location it shows me several bikes which are close to me shows the price shows also when it comes to reputation like how many people used it like actually liked it you can click on the bike and see some information about how far away is the bike who's the owner is he verified so this person for example is verified as key base but we are very open to also use other mechanisms such as you port or pick up some parity it really doesn't matter the user can see how he's verified if you can trust the system or not which features of this kind of things and then you can click on rent you can see how long do I want to rent it 2 hours or maybe even several days let's say let's go for 2 hours here when it comes to payment of course easier it's the preferred way of paying it but we are aware that not everybody wants to use either as a currency to pay it so we also say we expect a Bitcoin or US dollars using PayPal or credit cards and how it would work in the smart contract and this then needs someone it's any proof that the money is received this also can be just the owner if the owner says yes I received the money I can call it a function of smart conducts as yes I received it of course you have not all the features that you would have if you would have paid in either such as the depositors hold by the smart contract and only released once you return it those features you only have of course if you pay an ether so if you go next get a summary of what's the bike the date how long the payment including a deposit in this case and then you can just like rent the rental successful I can then go in the future me all the stuff I'm currently renting which is the bike I also rented up a co-working space they were top on the bike it would open the screen to actually go in front of the bike sending a Bluetooth signal to open the bike lock so let's go here's for exam two office space which I also can use let's say it took the bike I did talk about to the office I'm India now and so what's next how could you also use it there's also a way of just looking for objects which are close to me so I could check for QR code or even NFC so vertically let's say that is a nice 3d printer I want to use in the office I once I want to use it I go in front of the the thing it is locking and able to have a nice locket logo on it your career you click on the near-field communication it is showing your device because you're standing in front of it it's a 2d printer you can have a look and you can rent it so this is just an idea of how this app looks like and now I want to show you the diversion which we have right now it's just a moment it's loading so let's see so that we have this map view we are here in Cancun just go a little bit so we of course put some objects here so this is an outer wheel app and we want to use this microwave here this is what you can see here if I click it it shows me the white microwave which I can then click on it shows me the price 0.01 ether per hour shows me some features of the microwave and I can now rent this lock I can ask how long it shows me the calendar I just want to move it one day not too long say even 9 hours a long time again select the ether account I can of course have several easier accounts in the app a few days a movie there's the microwave the renting time 9 hours the price total costs looks good so I can now rent the object this is sending known transaction on the blockchain and you can see this device here those nice LED lights going up so what this box is in there you have this access control device if you have the power plug power supply everything in one box then I see it what you can do with it you can unplug something in such as the microwave and then close it it's actually key to change the stuff you plug in you can off if we actually would like to show a washing machine because the washing machine is a really nice use case was just too heavy to get here and so that's why we choose the microwave but you could think about like sharing a washing machine in the shared apartment you have like a students living there one guy inspiring the washing machine every time somebody wants to use what he pays and this just completely without even talking to each other or having a shared calendar or something like this so if I can go in a few on/off the object I can see all the stuff which I'm renting here so let's go in a popcorn microwave which I am renting so it shows me to turn on and off so let's turn it on let's see if this works this is a real life demo yes it is Queen so it got a signal let's use this and make something in the meantime so this is the microwave which I just paid for using it running so let's show some other stuff go into discovery mode you can also go look at the list of things without bikes and of course that is an apartment which I may want to rent this is this locker department and Wi-Fi space loads of the pictures are loading a bit slow but this is apartment from out in hometown made Veta germany so it's remotely now controlled i can see the price and features where it is and also of course went this lock i can set the date from today until start here those three days payment I'm using ether show me the summary yes everything looks good can render object so now it's also the new transaction this is the our office and divider very nice place so rent was successful and now I have control over it so this is the smart log you can see here I can maybe put this a bit up so we are using a new key smart lock so we are not a hardware manufacturer of smart locks they use existing smart lock infrastructure to connect to so the smart lock here is now because it's not smart enough to run a Cline in there we have this access control device here which is just running one of those light lines connecting to the door lock so let's see if I go now on this locker Department I have control over it since I am rented it moment still loading yes worked so this is right now locked I can now push the unlock button this will send a sign message to this box saying I want to unblock it and then the light line needs to verify that it actually work so nope let's try this again the Wi-Fi is a bit shaky yes okay now the lock opens I can enter and use this apartment okay and then on later if I don't use it anymore I return it so I don't have access to it anymore okay I think also the microwave should be done now so I just saw it who wants some popcorn it's here get some popcorn to enjoy the presentation you're welcome so let's get back to real presentation okay it's a bit small but well so what I wanted to announce today is that we want to start the minimal Viable Product now we it's still not perfect so that's not a public release of a product that everybody can use it yet but if you go an MVP dots lock it you can register to become an MVP user and try the system out so that's what you want to do now for the next coming month and see get some feedback optimize the system until we feel it's really stable those users the MVP users can use it reliably and once we feel it's safe then we are ready to release it to the public and everybody can use it but please registered MVP dots lock it and try the system out so all of this cannot be done alone because we want to integrate this as much devices as we can and so we have a lot of partners and friends from smart lock manufacturers also of course people they film ecosystems such as you port or ether risk and many others so we're very thankful for all those people we can work together with and of course also I want to mention a trusted IOT aliens which we are part of which are a lot of pride people which are thinking about how we can secure IOT devices today using blockchain technology by giving them for example identities and that you can securely transact using the using the blockchain and of course last not but not least I want to thank my team have a great team of I think this is a whole picture of you about 17 people right now plus some students and freelancers so in total up to 20 and working for on the system and I have we have two Sanctum for building all of this they are great team I think the next couple of month or next year we can release something which everybody can use we have mainstream users renting out things and connecting smart objects to smart contracts I think this is something where a theorem is very good at because maybe mainstream users will not use ISA as the main currency maybe maybe not but machines don't care and to pay machines this is something we can really use it for and machines can verify the payment and act accordingly that Sampson you want to build together with you so thank you much for attention [Music]
