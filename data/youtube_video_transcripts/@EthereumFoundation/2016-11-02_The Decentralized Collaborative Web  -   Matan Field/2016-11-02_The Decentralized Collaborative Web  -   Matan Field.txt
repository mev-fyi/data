okay so I'll tell you about the decentralize co-opting web and the black feed recipe for the centrist organization and let me just dive straightly to here let's start with a quick overview so you all know you're familiar with the blockchain 1.0 such as Bitcoin the value system is hard-coded an objective which means for example in Bitcoin the value system is defined by proof work so providing hashing power is valuable and it's hard-coded into the client it's an objective value system the gist of it is that really it's really an tracking system and the thing that is decentralized the ledger itself you can make it trust as cash diamonds are achievements and overall I would say that this class is in the early product stage then blockchain 2.0 if you you can now softly code your value system it's still objective so still valuable contribution should be a machine readable machine measurable the gist of it you can deploy smart contracts and now the dissenter is Asian is about the execution and you can basically write self executing accounting systems banking gains IOT contracts and so on so forth and this stage of this class I would say is roughly the prototype stage in third class which is also the class that I will focus on today is dealing with the emergent and subjective value system such a value system that human the people define the G's to feel it it allows you to basically engage with collective intelligence and really hear you decentralize the governance itself so examples would be the centrist collaboration curation of content or even curation of physical objects such as restaurants decentralized insurance a networked p2p insurance the central investment funds and so on so as long as you want objective accounting system blockchain is just fine if you want in the central insurance system with it with a subjective assessment of claims for example you need also this kind of collective intelligence protocol or the central governance and this this class is totally in a instill in the research stage so let me let me dive into the back it really really quick a high level overview of the defeat protocol is composed of three element inventory layers the subjective layer the objective and the inter objective the subjective air is really about the p2p view and flow of content basically I won't get into it much but this is it's kind of a decentralized social network algorithm and then the the main the main layer is the objective there which is about the network consensus is how to allocate in a decentralized fashion to allocate reputation score and tokens to agents in the decentralized network and then of course the curation of objects through the value system of that network and then the inter objective layer is about basically the relationship between various networks so in the following I will consider the case of the central corporation but basically much of what I will say will hold for the other use case as well so ok so that's just imagine network the the balls are our agents with private keys the circles are agent without private keys basically smart contracts or if you want decentralized networks and all of them are agents of the centralized network number one so this is the worldview as seen by a network number one we'll get back to that later so the objective lair basically or the intra network dynamics looks something like that so anyone let's see yeah anyone can post a contribution for example you can post to the network a code library and then you also post your own evaluation of that contribution and then every every agent in the network any agent in the network can post his evaluation of that contribution what is the value of that contribution the subjective value you say different agent may have different irritation in that network and they also can have different assessments at some point when you when you get a majority threshold the network will now issue new tokens and reputation score and allocate them to the successful contributor but also successful evaluators ok so the objective there is really about a repeating reputational weighted voting system for the location of tokens and mutation per contribution to the yeutter basically the outcome of the voting is the median that's pretty important and one consequence of that is that you only get issuance of token once you reach a majority threshold we'll talk about that later and then most importantly there is also reputation will flow from non-voters later borders and misaligned borders into early aligned borders that basically create the the the backfield loop which means that the the majority the majority is that is a systematic align is its reputation is increasing and increasing and that creates that's basic create growing alignment in the network but also growing incentive to fork the network that anyone can do in a click of a button so that that brings us at the inter objective layer which is the existence of multiple value systems so this is the view the world view of network one so now maybe this is the world view of network two you can as you can see different agents sorry the agents in different networks may have different reputations according to the network and the inter objective layer in the protocol is basically about defining the the network as being an agent in other networks so that the outcome is multiple value systems that they can have various relationships they can be complementary competing or mother-daughter relationships or any combination of those and then the match of that protocol is about defining the network as an agent in other networks which means how to take the aggregation of internal contribution within the networks and triggering with them training the external contribution evaluation of the network in other networks so that that part of the protocol and the outcome is the federal governance network or federal governance structure as well as economic relationship between networks and in terms of token Redemption so if that was the dynamic the intra network dynamic the internetwork dynamic looks like something like that so once once there is a threshold and distribution of internal tokens the network also post the evaluation to a larger network but now remember that the agents in internally can also may also be having reputation in the external Network and then this process can go on and on like that so the outcome network topology in the simplest case may look like that something like that and in more general case it can also be more complex so that brings me to the problem of in solution of governance scalability so if we go back to here a quick look at this can can show you that well the governance scalability problem is that it's in order to remain resilience you need to have majority threshold for each decision to make which is which is not very functional so for example here the 45 agents below let's assume they have equal reputation if they were in a single Network then you'll have 20 you'll need 23 of them to agree about any decision but with this network topology you can reach the station with only 12 agents attending every decision so that's crucial but since not not every not any 12 configuration 12 people configuration work for that reason you can show that resilience is actually kept the same ok so solving the governance occurs in progress made by semi compositional network topology as well as added with delegated voting system and also non-voters leaking reputation okay I'll just keep a subjective area again just beautiful flow of information it basically based on trust scores reputations and endorsements and let me quickly just if I have some time left yeah let me quickly just discuss the block to implementation which is a based on a novel architecture so the idea the question was how to implement all this protocol on the blockchain in a scalable way so the point is that the blockchain only have a I would call box a minimalism the smart content blockchain is also very very simple smart contract which is basically a reputation weighted multi-state contract to change the state the state on the blockchain is just the reputation token balances and established the established votes and then there is also the state change protocol or the of the protocol and then the rest all the messages between people the the signing of masse of contributions and evaluations as well as the calculation of the protocol itself is all export beyond the change so off chain so how it looks like something like that someone is stunning contribution is posting into the network someone else is a posting evaluation like that they reach the majority at that point he has a package roughly look like that and then it only then is posting the state change claim proposition into the blockchain and then all the reputable agents are being called to calculate locally under the machine the state change according to the protocol and if they agree with that to sign that a state change so let me just end with a few few shanks um some timeline so firstly let me tell you that back feed goes nonprofits or we opening a non-profit foundation to continue the research and development of the protocol stack for the centralization in the 19 to 23 of October there is a protocol workshop if anyone is interested in that domain please just email me and you can participate and then we are expecting until the end of the year to complete the protocol specification and then three months later to release an alpha stage life central organization thank you thank you very much thank you
