foreign [Music] is the One-Stop solution to run an ethereum node the easy way ethereum originated in the beginning of 2020 when we started with a Toca pose setup and now we have a full-fledged UI um that is focused on ease of use and flexibility so how do you set up ethereum so the the requirements are you need some kind of a desktop like Windows Linux desktop or a Mac OS and you need some Ubuntu 22.04 to run the note on we will support other operating systems later on but for now we are stuck with Ubuntu and this is how it looks you start you download the software start it and discreets you so you just enter your SSH credentials of the Ubuntu I mentioned earlier we support password authentication as well as sh keys of course then the ethereum launcher checks your operating system if it's supported or not it gives you a thumbs up after that just click on the one click installer and you can choose between running on mainnet or test net in this example we just run on test net and setup is taking note after that um you can see the setup already pre-chos a execution client and then consensus client this is of course changeable so the user can easily with the just clicking on it choose something else right now we we support uh three execution clients three different execution clients and four different consensus clients you can also use checkpoint sync if you like it's a little bit faster than um syncing from scratch the next screen will just confirm what you just entered it shows you where to install where it will get installed and what gets installed and you might notice there is also some monitoring tools installed namely promoters and kafana and then the setup already starts it downloads some operating system packages installs them that's all for making ethereum work on your Ubuntu um after that it also configures the firewall and of course write some configuration files for steering itself and the services and that's how it looks when it's done then we have the control page this is really nice because on the left side you have all the um all the services that are running and in the middle and the right size is a big panel that shows a lot of widgets some of them are still work in progress but it shows you the sync status it shows you um how many peer counts you have from the different Services also some other stats from the host like CPU search and memory usage and that's done in three minutes so how about staking well that's the staking screen looks quite similar right um and it's pretty easy to stake you just drag and drop the files the Json key files uh on the serum launcher or you press the big button on the bottom and then I file the selector appears you can choose them that's it ethereum will ask you where you want to stick them you might notice the small button at the bottom so we also support we will assume support multiple validator clients to stay gone then you just enter the password and the staking process starts the import process starts if it's successful so is your password Works correct then it's taking um starts already and the sticking key gets listed in the list on the right side you can also modify the graffiti you will use and of course you can remove the keys in case you want to migrate to another ethereum server on the top of the page is always two small buttons that's for confined Tomatoes you can easily access them just click on the button and the and steering will open up a tab or a window of your default browser of your OS and make an SSH tunnel to access your grafana and parameters directly so how do you configure and make it a little bit more customizable what we see here is the service configuration we have an expert mode where you can basically configure the whole thing um you can edit or add and remove flags from tiku for example here you can also Tinker with the docker settings that we use the other two options are a little bit easier to configure because it's not Tech space it's just yeah select how much memory limit tiku has and of course for stickers very important the default fee recipient we also provide an update panel that shows you not only the launchers version but also the notes version and of course the service versions all updates will be all available updates will be of course on this panel visible to the user also some other settings for steering itself well what's next for ethereum first of all in the next couple of weeks we will release a new update that we're going to use custom installations these customers and installations will allow the user to not only um not only remove Services they don't like but also add new Services it will also enable them to run multiple um consensus clients execution clients validator services on the same machine this is just a small peak of what features we already implemented and what will come in a new future so we also have an impact booth just around the corner if you have any questions please drop by and we will show you how to set it up and answer all your questions because unfortunately my time is already running out see you bye
