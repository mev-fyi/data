thanks everyone for for being here today so I'm Alex to understand I am here to talk about mist but I do a little bit more than that on the foundation I am the I'm a designer for NASA for the foundation and I do some other stuff like the website and I'm not sure if you ever look at the website I suppose so but we do have some outrageous claims on there like buildings tappable apps have a rub rowboat run your organization or how the internet was supposed to work those those are sort of outlandish claims and a few people got a little bit mad this year that they were there and if you're one of those peoples I'm sorry I'm kind of responsible because I wrote them I put them there and I'm here to explain what do we mean by that and why do we still stand for every word so what does that mean how the internet was supposed to work right in order to understand this let's see what the problem is right the way that internet works right now is that if you're building a service you first you put up a server a new server client and if you have five clients then your server will serve those five clients what happens is we have five hundred or five hundred thousand clients then that becomes a problem and there are normally two things that can happen the first one is that your server will just burn down and crash and if you take with it a part of the internet history your users who give abandon and if you were doing any sort of public good then that will be just lost so the second option that most people take is the funding route right get some VC money put a bunch of super servers out there and they will reach your five hundred thousand users but now VCS are not donors so when they give you a million they expect a billion dollars back somehow and since we don't have any like easy currency on the Block on the on the internet right now the easiest most accessible currency are eyeballs and also by the way we have all that private information already on our server so let's just sell everything to advertisers and that's how we get where you are today right because all your users are just products are you're selling to your shareholders on your advertisers and it gets even weirder when you start seeing the division of labor because those big pink guys they are there to serve your content they keep their private data they connect the users they solve any sort of conflicts and the other guys here they just show you your stuff which is crazy because the computer you have on your pocket right now is probably a thousand or a million times more powerful than the most powerful server when the web was created and I'm talking just about one device you have in your pocket just imagine all the devices that you have that are connected to you and it becomes even worse when you start thinking about the ecosystem because every one of those guys are separate islands they are silos and if you're if you build your reputation on Airbnb then that reputation is locked to by Airbnb you cannot take it elsewhere unless Airbnb wants it and if Facebook and YouTube doesn't want to work together they want if it doesn't make sense for them to work together they want so that's that's how that's the problem we see on the internet right now and the way it even really tries to solve it is to distribute distribute all the tasks right so files are served by anyone in swarm and your apps are all and all the apps that reach conde need consensus or just run on every one of the node of the foo nodes and that's how we got it even where we are today and we launched this at that consumer with just like we've just gone so it's just very developed developer oriented it's like the dus era so before before the US came along whenever you wanted to build a new software you had also to build a new computer and the dust came along and then now I have a developer you can build software for all computers the same thing with the Tyrian tools where now as a developer you can build blocking apps just for oh you don't you don't need to build your own blockchain for that but there's no graphic interface it requires the from download and then and DEFCON 1 last year we were talking and we launched did your wallet and I think it's a great tool it's a defensive tool for specialists and I like to think it of more like physical correct cell also taking the personal computer example back then if you were an accountant if you wanted to do spreadsheets you would take Excel or VisiCalc and you didn't need to be a developer anymore but in still needed to be someone who wanted to use specialized software because what the wallet does is that it builds dynamic interfaces for the contracts that you want to interact with but still requires a full blockchain and requires you to have eater in order to use it and that's how we get to mist here at Def Con jus it's meant for enthusiast users and by that I want you to think Netscape Navigator or Firefox in the sense that when they came they weren't for everyone but they really where they really helped broaden the Orions of the types of users that were using the web back then and the idea is that we bring the full power of web interfaces into smart contracts or you could say vice versa and it has a light client so it doesn't want to require full blockchain download and we are doing some creative ways of funding so let's look at how it looks right so right here in the corner we have the I launch a light client right here we have missed being launched and this is a disease recording unedited and what you can see there is it's connecting for the for the first time so we choose the main network or you can you can download your preset wallet and then you create your password so maced will take you to the steps necessary to create your account and once you create your account it will generate an ident icon to you and you can start also funding it you can find it with Bitcoin or any sort of other cryptocurrency and we are working with going days at some point you'll be able to find it a credit card and all you need to do is deposit and all meanwhile I was doing this it's already downloading it's download you're already more than half of the whole chain and if you still if you it's you not enough we can like offer you a little bit of reading material so you can try to understand more about the children on the mean time so for example we can let's learn about how to build a democracy on the blockchain that's I love this phrase over there which is on the blockchain no one knows your fridge but we don't have time to read this I'm not going to talk about dows right now or democracy on the blockchains so you close it and it's there it's launched it has already synced so in less than one minute and 30 second and of course it will be depend on some other factors we were able to sync from scratch in a clean machine and you can start using it even right now and that's the main ad and I want now to switch to the test net to show you some other very cool stuff right so this is the tearoom wallet I think most of you have used it at some point it's really meant to help you use smart contracts so I created a smart contract that there is called donut coins which is just just a token that you send around and I want to send five dollars to a friend now here's something cool right because right now it even has the to address the from address and a few information like byte code and that doesn't really communicate anything to the user what we are doing right now is that we are able to decode whatever that byte code means and show the user exactly what what the transaction he is about to do is supposed to do at least so it's a transfer function it's going to transfer to that green guy on the bottom and it's going to transfer five five watts five Donuts coin those are the parameters and of course if you want to check the contract you can always click on the top to check act or source code of the contract but you're not doing that right now so all you need to do is you just check if the parameters are right type or password on your gun and I think that's a great way of idea of of interfacing with smart contracts but here's the nice trick all this wallet we've built its built in pure HTML and CSS and anyone should be able to create another wallet with a such a rich interface as this and that's what you want mis to do so in the left here we have a browser button where you can just browse to any app you want and it will and we have some so many apps already and more are being built and you could just type type any address on the top but here you cannot really see it but in the top I'm not pasting an address I'm pasting a hash so what does the hash means a hash is not a location where you find an application a hash really describes a specific version of an application it's a bunch of files a specific version of a bunch of image at a bunch of HTML a bunch of JavaScript and when you paste a hash there what it does it's connecting you to swarm and that's also recording of a live prototype and you can see bzz up there and what it's doing is that it's just downloaded this whole interface from swarm meaning that it's now running on your local machine and now since it's running on a local machine it doesn't necessarily know about you and then the first thing you have to do is kind of authenticate yourself but instead of the apps requiring to have every app you go you have to create a username and a password and that's depending on the central server that can be hacked instead mase provides you with a few accounts you can just choose so I want to identify myself to this voting app with that second account over there and once you authorize it your app can kind of change the interface to reflect that now it knows that you or this given account and now I created this little DAP it's just a voting stake voting thing you can just you put a parameter there like say something let's say Game of Thrones is better than Star Wars and anyone can vote to agree or disagree and their vote to be counted in stick voting and here's here's the magic right I created all this whole interface and the whole purpose of it was just to get to this point where I create you a transaction and once you create that transaction now the user is back in control because the user can see all the parameters you can see that he's about to do a vote application he's doing a vote on that on that account on the top and he's using a first parameter is a hash of whatever he said the first is just a yes or no meaning he'll agree or disagree and in order to an in order to vote all he needs to do is type his password so he's back in control so think about this right I just run this whole app and it runs completely without servers because all the files you need to run them or where downloaded via swarm for a peer-to-peer network and that are like locally on your machine all your private information your login your account information is kept by you by your computer that is safe and finally all the information that you need to be public to be common to be synchronized is kept on the blockchain and you can see that well it seems that everyone agrees with me and and I think that that's the kind of architecture that we want to move moving forward all depths to think about an architecture where all the private information is kept and managed by the user in himself and there is no central server than anyone that goes to that particular depth will always find this exact version of the application and what are their next steps that we want so the next steps yours is first of all hashes or terrible ways terrible user interfaces because they are long they're not even friendly and they're not updatable so you can just replace them for the ENS system that Nick was talking yesterday also we have a solidity now has authenticated contracts which allow some nine things that form and right now the way we are doing this decoding thing is that we just download a bunch of signatures with myth when you download myth and if you it's not enough you can ping a central server but we've authenticated contracts what you can do is that we can once you interact with a contract we can download both the source code and the API directly from swarm and show you exactly what it's about to do another very cool things that we are working on is easier installers we already have a dmg we already have Windows installers and a lot like this related we are we are starting to do signing signing with pgps and we want to do a full app signing so we can eventually be on App Store's too and there's another interesting thing it's not right now I think most people underestimate how much how users come into the ecosystem affects how either things because everyone who has to come into the in the ecosystem has to have bought either in an exchange at some point so a lot of users are get in with this trading idea and back in the beginning we could allow mining where anyone could just use their computers to get eater that long past gun but what swarm allows us to do is that by just sharing your internet connection you could get a little bit of eater if you have a file that just suddenly becomes popular because everyone is using that application you will be paid a tiny amount of eaters which is not a big amount but enough so you can start playing around with smart contracts without having to buy in an exchange another thing we are excited to be working on is swappable backends GAF is a great node but I mean there are some other people doing some very nice work and parity basically saved our asses this this in the beginning of this week so we are trying to work with area with other developers to see what do we need to make swappable backends where the user can just select another node and it will download it live and you just I think if I would have all the configuration necessaries to work to form ace to work with any back-end that you want now another things we have on the roadmap right and we have tons of things that you want to talk about we don't have time for them but so first of all each year in our c67 is a very cool it's a very cool thing I want to work with it is the idea to create a single link that you can it will definitely make creating smart contracts a lot easier because instead of having to download a JavaScript library and creating a transaction out of JavaScript you could create a new transaction by just clicking on it so you would click on it it would the link would come with your I saying the the whose address is it's going to what are the parameters and then and then just by having static files with affected link anyone could create a file a link that you would open missed with the right way to do a transaction invitation files we saw on the beginning that the first thing you do on the wallet is download your priest a wallet of course fewer and fewer people still have priests a wallet but what if you could use that same mechanism to create some sort of invitation system where I can create a new at tiny rule lira wallet with a small amount of feature and give to a friend that will for from his point of view it just looks like an invitation file that allows him to be a part of it even he drags it and then it already has it already has some some parameters and functions and things that allow him to connect your back to your friends we want to work with the table the Dominican paper wallet and we are moving the account management from the load to the client it has two big advantages one of them it makes the node swappable backends easier because now you your node only needs to be able to think of the blockchain it doesn't need to actually do the account management and the user doesn't need to to have new accounts for every node they want it's easier for them to switch and also allows us to do more extensible things like at some point allowing you to do anything you want to do with a client with an account you could do with a contract let's say you could do with a multi-sig or you could do with a scheduler or anything like that and there's another thing and and the reason I chose that picture is it's it's something I want to leave you guys with it I come from Brazil and then Brazil there's literally nothing that's five more than 500 years old and mostly not nothing that's more than 200 years old but here is different in China in Europe we you still can find roads that are thousands of years old those are roads that are viewed by Empire that have long been gone and that after those umpires other kingdoms have come and gone and the rotors to there and the rotors to useable and they're not usable because they were magical or they are built very well in the beginning they are still usable today because those people that came after the original purpose of the road was gone those people could just do their own road maintenance now railroads are not like that you can find railroads that are 30 years old that because a single company has gone bankrupt or because a government just lost interest on that it just lies there abandoned and nobody else can do it can keep using it so let's try to build an internet like you build roads not railroads what think of Twitter think of wishes think of all those app that we use every day that make a big difference they can now simply go away tomorrow if there's they are blocked by a government or if their board makes a bad dishes decision that go take the app in a different direction than the community is let's try to build apps than allow that allow that just like roads will allow anyone who is the community that once you take that allows the app to keep be alive and keep running long after the original purpose and the original creators of them are gone AB that other communities and take over can control and can take forward apps that are truly unstoppable and are truly there for long time and their phone door for the long term and I would really like to thank my hope team for all the good work that they've been doing and a lot of other people are not directly part of my team but are also a very important step into having based where it is today thank you
