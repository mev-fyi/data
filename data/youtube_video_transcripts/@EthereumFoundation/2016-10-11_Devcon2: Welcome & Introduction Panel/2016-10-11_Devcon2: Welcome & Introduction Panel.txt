okay I'm going to start the introduction our introductory panel and I've called the panel but really what it was meant to be was I wanted to on spend five minutes to welcome everyone here and I mention that this this is generously supported by our sponsors Museum of ELQ stock of the manor especially the premier and Latin sponsors Microsoft dinar German watch on watching laughs we also have wolf on sir Santander consensus either camp camp and scenario in addition you may notice on the website we have a number community sponsors and those were specifically created for smaller companies startups and companies who support this ecosystem in order to be involved if they're not able to afford a corporate level and type sponsorship and very very happy to be able to be inclusive in this way if you look at your program the one√∂ learns that there are two thumpers and researchers missing the speaking last we have mark amazing system sitting in the first seat here dr. Christian Alexander than okay I think I'm just going to go ahead and let them start speaking and as they as they start that I get into their tops we will also be joined by Peter slidy who's representing the goatee and then the Potala cool we'll finish out this panel so thank you very much and welcome hello I'm Martin Izzie I'm working on me and research the PM is really central to the dairy envision what really distinguishes the etherium box came from other block chains and there is a focus a lot of research and development there's going to be three talks they brother first of all one second about what I'm doing I'm working on researching EDM to replace the freedom on looking into easily possible and we're going to talk very much at today about virtual machine called pulping the DM is today at the team and they all said enough listen up here great Alvin is going to talk about making the p.m. screen and we really just we talk on optimizing the C++ interpreter that would be at 30 - 40 and and then lastly oh I will be speaking on with my coworker Alex on the VM lots of assembly today it to be quite so please short and thank you for listening tell your money somewhere a speaker sorry recycle a we have some Network issues I'm not showing a all about anyway so basically as long as Jeff is visiting with other populations he can adapt the project to me so that is our main release for this year just a legacy so of the technical side appear we try to address a few interesting things that you that the ecosystem dearly needed and I hope you will really be happy for them one of them was we are actually placing the light client and George will talk to you about that tomorrow so that's something we're really proud of this one was just much to develop that's also will back the quicker will mention quite a few things about it that's also something we're really proud of and we are looking forward to it for over a year now and let's see what else yes something a time of update about tomorrow was we kind of prepared going therapy which is a library in other processes as well as in mobile platforms so that will be awesome and a few things that Nick was working out of the main domain name system he'll also presented tomorrow and the other couple of things that you will be really happy about one of them was that we finally written push notifications so we don't need to bold and the notes for everything else I mean you know me to cosmetic all the notes and and yeah that's pretty much it we are still running a few trial things in discovery protocol and you whispering that patient and that's it's like order a pump even become a breath now the hostile and concerning the plus plus kind implementation we mostly focused all yeah including the build builds of stuff dissing tacking the repository we split up select year is now running committee Seminole Dimitri will tell them more about testing clients tomorrow I'm are 47 racks a long time including the interpreter today and Pavel is working on the just-in-time compiler and we're planning to make that modular so basically plan which mission monitors that differently regime implementations can be combined with different clients and we managed to do that already with pioneering anatomical power and together so in order to get solidity stand alone we created CPP adhering with a special testing room that has been sent - oh that's really nice to use for unit tests of small contracts and we're working all the rocking on Rita Mae licensing the C++ client 240p outer edge then we're also working on for small projects which we called remix that's a reboot of the old Lee's project that we have to abandon because it was really comes out to to compile the distribute and the idea there is that we want to create reusable JavaScript libraries that can be yet deployed and used with various ideas we already know and the overall go through remix is to create several s IDE that can can be used offline in the browser and that's important to deploy those for government we will tell more about that tomorrow yeah concerning solidity yeah there will be a detail talk about what we date in the last year tomorrow also I talk about what we plan to do concerta clarification about small contracts Thanks hi I'm Alec I'm eating the distant so last year at that point one where we lived it your wallet and in my opinion is one of the best and easiest ways to interact a smart contracts today and I think with great earlier because really helped mark contract developers get viewers on tell you how to use our contract and we had over 20 Peter resistant step on one with bug fixes more and more features and we are probably in the are we do keep doing them and if it's been such an important project inside foundation with that before last year we were two sometimes three people working alone inside the material didn't hear this year we meet now is its own team we have our own dedicated full-time developers and we were able thanks to that to make our first public releases of mist and it's out there with the new changes in the go tyrion and for the light client to back clip with it and i might you to come on web initely talk or enter then how much the changes how much the Wi-Fi network backs and all the new features that will be worth working on and also the blood I would like to tell you a little bit of our vision of the internet and how railroads are not as good as rope for Internet and also we have the EMS system it uses its own Internet miss itself uses hashes which needs name if you want to know more about it I will be talking a bit about how the hash register words also Wednesday at that 50 so the Dalek you have this on you have to live a few minutes so if you want to spin your box a minute if not we can actually move we don't have to move them oh you are a feature on the stage because in the house kana conform just being merged is I think a bigger thing with women waiting for her if it's called for a lot with our happy identities okay so I should have slides over the current did I say this maybe that's what you are here at them discover meet so at the moment we are teas hopefully spending so so we're going strong developments takes the four minutes the code base has been urged to to GUI theory develop branch this code base I'm talking about is the gulag reference implementation which is going through like a series of proof of concept stages and at the border to process to and that implements they basically but hopefully correct a version of the swab including you know five file up you know talk about connections virtual server routing tables and you know the big physical table it has built in them accounting for bandwidth and a lot of projects are planned for the and the future and which I'll talk about in the incoming talks so okay so if these deciding them three things that that are missing from that from the cabins local version are the exact implementation of for three years we can represent in the in the first photo entirely which is the start engines Swiss Kriss storage for storage so this is on so I did want to mention that things are going so well putting this conference together and then we had this little glitch with the badges important and I was gonna go up here to the developers plant developers developers developers but catches patches that is still much me okay fine so without really do is how the thank you yeah so what else someone else some of you already know there was like Asia incident with you here of networking couple hours and goes to like all this wonderful military style wake up at about 5:15 in the morning fortunately MERS if there's coming out around now so congratulations gentlemen yeah so I need a chief scientist of the theorem validation I guess as even general the part of the etherium project that I'm focused on is the research side so research general we have so one more thing here a project is basically working on what's out there right now which is the code and the other part is working almost protocol is going to be in the future and that's basically what researchers so it's exploring things like for stage exploring things like sharded such sharding exploring privacy preserving protocols and applications on top of aetherium written signature developers formal verification so we have a team of like about 5 to 10 people including myself lab margin opportunity before you know we have optimization working on all of these wonderful things and so one of the presentations I'm going to give today is actually an update on your stadium charting so we are going to at this point the algorithm is kind of filtered I'm going to talk a bit about what it is how it works and we have a micronized test flight that's being developed right now so that's pretty far away it's very exciting and was at the same time July it is going to be here today and he's going to talk about so it guest side of the story and other people and research efforts have been at alpha and if the roam ability 2% so this will all be very fun hands this was basically working here we're here in Oregon where two or three years from now so and that's the part that I'm I probably first off personally one of the things that I personally the most excited about all the things like that included the contributions of the other 140 members probably the most the most wonderful one of the last couple of weeks is probably supply it so yeah and things about you can now use empirical equations without sink without sinking needs are watching yourself
