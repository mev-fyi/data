[Applause] Ramon each linear I'm really glad to have a legend as their profile I'm sorry Tommy a Japanese high school student and the budget protocol Daniel so today I'd like to introduce a new protocol to share the villages and that they are one projects maybe you have already known what about a church and dependable it's pellet that where your world watch chains such as Bitcoin and Italian have equivalent vegetables it can't use the existing protocols so I designed a new way in this protocol a chair which a chair which impulsivity that doesn't need to depend on other genes and chain which exposed to it is false killing it doesn't need to be changed the name of the total is group of units it's a kind of civil control mechanisms like to work for total stake it can integrate with mountain villages abstract retreating and elements such as the password or second talking unit summing up cost shield to police box thanks to an abstract model of civil control agreements this has some abstract variables and functions to listen to describe civil control mechanisms for example to describe proof of work just began the Tilden of a niche product began August as - what can body and terrified and confronting with the fascist Western targets and also their to combine bounty mechanisms the most important value in this model it units any kind of products are transformed into units and they are used as both power in the contents as algae so it can innovate bounty business however if one unit is joined it from one product attackers can have attacker can get the majority of units but performing the easy task with small cost it has a problem from the viewpoint of security so it adjusts the amount of giant units to explain with adjustment system I also defined two variables a best ask it's best cost and one function to compute the value of units and products this is the medical equation to adjust the mass it means when you consume the cost is X time and as you imagine the excess best cost X unit agility product if you until the equivalent amount of course has to be consumed to generate the equivalent amount of units no matter which tasks involved in this way so community describes civil control mechanisms abstractly and integrates them securely then integrating the mechanisms of external change if you sum up the consumer costs and increase the total amount of units per unit adjoining it where cost attackers have to ensure so it can include the stability it has more advantages a channel which in politically it doesn't reach information by working together it just with information and stability so the important change does it need to be accepted by other chains and the chair which exposed facility doesn't need to be in to be changed this is why this protocol has shared utility and as barrier one block chains in the case of improving security in the case of a problem unity it's proof of work energy is defined like this it enables actually import the cost consume for environment I would like to I would like to continue with research and design for complete models thank you very much [Applause]
