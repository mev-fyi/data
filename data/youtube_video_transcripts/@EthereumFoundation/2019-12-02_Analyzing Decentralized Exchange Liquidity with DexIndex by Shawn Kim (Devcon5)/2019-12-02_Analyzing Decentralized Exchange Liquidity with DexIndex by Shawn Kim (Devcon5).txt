[Applause] hello I'm Sean and a software engineer at herself and today we'll be analyzing these mice exchange their quiddity so since the dermis reduced in 2015 the popularity of popularity of these centralized exchanges has exploded and as expected mainly individuals and businesses took advantage coming up issues this moon birth a lot of amazing projects and the red tree innovation but it also created a saturated market of fixes so currently there is hundreds of nexus in a while with most of them in etherium and cysts the source of liquidity for each of these nexus is different the mice can also vary drastically whatever still can be more than a 1% difference in price across texas so this makes it very hard to keep track of which sex has the best price well a month target so that's why we decided to build VIX index thanks and next is thanks to my second grader that fetches what's from 13 popular indexes from me and it's powered by open source JavaScript library that that is anyone can contribute to and also use for their own projects but also it's open source so that we don't give any particular advice unfair advantage it also has their clean and simple UI so you can do what you need to do riches finding the best price as you can see you just select an action cell or by an amount and token and you look at it feel this of fixes what's ordered by best price using mix index is very simple you just import the library and you call main function which would get you the list of the quotes given the parameters ordered by best price you can also look at the documentation to see other features that fixing this prevents like the command line tool and since we launched the X index in January we gained some popularity from over 4,000 unique users from their three countries fetching more than 43,000 quotes almost 1200 tokens and we also saw some open source community activity as well we believe that this growing popularity of next index is actually due to a growing issue in the eternal community and that is that needs consolidation so while diversity and innovation is great and produces amazing projects people still want a consolidated data so but this palace well the community needs your health to build tools that not only finds the best Mouse competitors but one that actually creates a friendly and easy environment for users currently in and entering live dental community next indexes can also do the health yeah we currently have thirteen popular next to this integrated but we can always use more whether it be thanks is you love and want to see and or exit you're currently working on so feel free to so I'm going to progress and our team will let me take a look at it thank you [Applause] you
