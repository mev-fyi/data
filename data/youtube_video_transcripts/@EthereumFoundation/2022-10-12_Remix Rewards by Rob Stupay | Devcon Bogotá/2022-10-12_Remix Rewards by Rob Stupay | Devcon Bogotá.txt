foreign [Music] Ty vermouth and I do Communications and ux research for remix which many of you may know is one of the first tools a developer encounters on their journey into web 3 in the ethereum ecosystem we are very strongly open source and with at least 67 contributors to the code base to date so we're very uh fortunate in that and we're here today to officially launch a program we've designed and built in order to stay engaged with that growing open source community called remix Rewards essentially remix rewards is a collection of nft badges that characterize our users and our contributors support Floyd is an upgradable contract on optimism where the upgrade ability allows each reward holder to Mint an additional reward for any other user of their choice essentially remix rewards is a oh yeah we've already done that at the beginning of this year we set out on our roadmap one of the important goals was to consider who exactly are our users or how do we know exactly what they're doing out there the initial answer was obviously no we didn't know at all so we started by using some design thinking principles and tried coming up with the user persona which we quickly realized was kind of a futile exercise when we tried to match that method up with what we were hearing from users on our support channels particularly Twitter those channels displayed a much wider array of different people in different countries with different workflows and remix so to connect more directly with them we started doing monthly ask remix anything calls and then started inviting our users to beta test new release is a remix we also began interviewing users willing to talk about their specific workflows and some of the use cases they were working on we'd also started tracking analytics on the site and then putting all of this together we were getting the idea that our users were a much more diverse group than what we thought we had a handle on originally we also realized lots of those users were excited about feature improvements excited about developing new plugins for new networks and we were now engaging with them in a more genuine dialogue about these issues this year's roadmap also included dog fooding of the IDE by our team as a way to better understand user pain points UI and workflow issues so following some success with the team at East Denver developing an nft song playlist and minting dap for public radio beyond our team lead over there started building this program Rewards program again dog food and remix customizing an ERC 721 contract to allow minting of an additional nft from a non-transferable nft we decided to make these rewards non-transferable both as a way to kind of have a soul-bound credential for community members and to identify each other as engaged members it also as a way to kind of stay away from any kind of Market in trading them for money the nft kind of craze for the look and feel we engaged the graphic artist who had designed our Remy hedgehog logo over there on the left she came up with these old-fashioned Lo-Fi framed uh card designs you see here they came to represent our kind of user archetypes that one on the right is a Dev connector that was our first nft badge that came out at devconnect in April so in simplest terms this is all about our desire to create a more genuine two-way engagement among the team contributors Champions and users of remix of all skill levels so one of the big ways we're doing that is that this this feature in the contract contract allows one additional remixer badge to be minted to any wallet of a remix rewards holder and then that additional minted remixer also becomes non-transferable the remixer is never a new it is already already spinning contracts our hope that this is a way to build more interest in new users to keep it leveling up their engagement by making contributions to the code base for beta testing or championing or teaching tool set to others it's a club where everyone is invited and everyone is welcome the payload on each of these nfts is tagged to a remixed version of beta tested that has been tested for a specific PR that a contributor has authored and merged into the code base so if in the future we can see a way to integrating these payloads with GitHub or LinkedIn or another third-party cert platform we are ready to do that here's the DAP that was that was built by one of our team members Joseph isang for display of Rewards again customizing for our own needs we we did consider using quixotic just kind of becoming the Open Sea for optimism as an app for display and minting but at least for now our own build of this dap gives us that better idea of user engagement and uh them that open source mindset here's the DAP for minting of remixer badges in this case maybe you'd contributed five PR's over time and it beta tested 14 versions of remix you'd have the ability to Mint a total of 19 additional remixer badges mostly though if this experiment has enough uptake from our community we'll be ready to use these badges as another way to measure engagement and possibly allow kind of token based proportional voting on improvements or major changes to the remix tool set essentially that's the story we might as well say we're officially launching this program right now so check it out if you get a chance there's the URL up there the DAP is also linked from our project website and obviously we're looking for as much feedback and uh engagement as possible on this so hit any of us up after uh here or on Twitter or getter or Discord they're all up there and lastly as always hope everyone's having fun with whatever they're building out there thank you
