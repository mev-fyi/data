the public testnet so this is similar to our recent discussion on robson so if we create a public tester like this and even if we set the difficulty to something very long then anyone can actually start mining on this and raise the difficulty very quickly and because trouble so will we limit the block miners by ip or by adding some signature and extra data one of the two we have to do or just restart it every so yes my suggestion is to aggressively restart the chain okay and move it every time you restart so yeah and i guess he's following you i would yeah like once we have a solution for robston i think and we've tested it on robson i would be fine moving it there but just in the meantime till i get this out asap i yeah i'd also be in favor of restarting the chain more frequently um then trying to solve this problem as like a blocker to getting this test that out yeah i agree we're starting the chain here as uh like we cannot restart the robsten but we can restart this testnet so there should be no attack or maybe if it start being the problem then we can do something yeah yeah um probably good to just have a simple process that allows the people who involved to easily coordinate for where the new chain is because you have to be able to find it and you don't want the attacker to be able to automatically move so you just want some just human process that you just all you know agree okay we'll post it in this private channel you know or whatever the chain id so we can we can use the 1559 discord and if that becomes a problem we can use a chat between just you know yep yeah just something that's not easily automated for the attacker to automatically follow like they have to be a human paying attention sitting around good point yeah so let's let's start with the fee market channel and if uh if that gets uh compromised we can find something more robust yeah sure um okay and yeah then oh sorry go ahead yeah i have question about jsonrpc um so do we need to expose two additional fields on transaction structure on eth get transaction by hash endpoint yes this is a plan yeah i will write those four aips i already wrote eips for the block data and i will write the ieps for the transaction data yeah yeah we exposed that but uh we checked it with uh on vessel and on this so it's returned the old yeah yeah yeah we still not have implemented a get transaction by hash and yeah yeah okay anything else no okay cool uh yeah so on the test nets we have the poa we said we'll finish that we've we've tested i think we did do this right abdel like we did run like the base u1 and we yeah yeah yeah okay so this one's done and then these two we're basically combining into the fork of mainnet um yeah um and then i guess yeah under testing uh so uh nethermine you mentioned you're using 1559 as part of a of a [Music] client network uh falcoin also has 1559 near protocol also has it i should link uh the uh there a bit had the had the write-up about it um and then from celo uh yeah they're also working on 1559 and uh they mentioned they can kind of help for testing with our work if there's overlap but their implementation is slightly different from ethereums um so i'm talking with them to see if there's you know anything where there's there's a lot of value for them to contribute if people have ideas about testing that is kind of falling through the cracks and where not having exactly the same implementation can be valuable uh please ping me um and then yeah just on the r d side uh i guess uh in terms of theoretical analysis for the eeps uh since the last call the biggest change is vitalik put together some slides about 1559 that were quite good so if people want to have a look at that um they give a good overview um and then uh yeah in terms of comparing 1559 with the alternatives i linked your notebook here uh barnaby um and then bartabaya in terms of simulations uh on the last call you mentioned a couple more things so i've just linked them there uh for uh people to be aware and then the final bit is um the community outreach so we shared already uh we've done a report with the cathodeers about uh people's thoughts on 1559 we're continuing to do more outreach mostly around wallets and exchanges uh it's going a bit slower now uh so i'm not sure exactly when we'll have an update on this but it's kind of happening uh in the background and that's basically all i had on the agenda is there anything else that people feel we should bring you up okay um so i'll share uh well i guess we'll have a full transcript for this i'll share an update on twitter today um and i guess the big things are just continuing to work on the tooling getting the work started on the test net and trying to specify this transaction pool behavior uh we have another call scheduled in four weeks does that seem reasonable in terms of timeline for people yes okay cool well yeah thanks everybody for joining appreciate you all taking the time thank you bye
