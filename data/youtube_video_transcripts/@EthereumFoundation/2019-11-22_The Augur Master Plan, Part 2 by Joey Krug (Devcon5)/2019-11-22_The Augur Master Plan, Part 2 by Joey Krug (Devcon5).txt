[Applause] so a thermometer and pintura anywhere you go through Auto V to and yon so the idea behind auger really is to provide oasiz actually feeling poured on its own okay so the idea my my honor is to provide universal access to tools that increase its attack wealth through finance today and so this really goes back to this concept of anybody anywhere in the world should be able to create a financial market at home whatever they want secondly anything from a horse race a soccer match whether Trump will be impeach when the price of Tesla Friday closing bell in so our mission the way we're going to actually do that is by creating the world's most accessible No Limit Data Platform and this really goes back to an eyes in the middle school is dying on these horse races I bet 25 to 30 paces a day and I kind of you're good you'll actually get cut down to your limits to produce get all the sudden you can't bet very much and so that's really the problem we're trying to solve the limits problem the accessibility problem it's longer meet wanna Julia proof of concept I wasn't really a great user experience yeah effective download a half two hours sometimes days to sink I got get this kind of big landing page and I you connect with all it I had to jump with meta mask and once you got there you know there were the markets really wide you can't really see that much training page is kind of indecipherable it scroll down place your bad bunch of text more intact more text and it is pre bad experience we just wanted to prove out that it was actually possible we're doing a lot of things to people super super crazy people said that you know it possible to do all the stuff we wanted to prove that you could do it even if it had a really bad user experience and so the original tamil is Lisa P you want this functional but not usable then add 0x to allow off chain training so you can get opportunity or replacements and cancellations and modifications that's really important because it allows market makers actually market make and be priceless especially and eventually move quickly then I'd die I knew her and the reason for that is if you're betting any evening confident on the each price up or down over time ago and the event you're betting it was really difficult and it finally released a personal treat has high throughput and low latency even on border fills and at that point you should be no different than a regular that your training site except it allows you to access it from anywhere with no limits and it's mobile and it's just a great user experience and so q1 2020 we're going to release all of it each month like 5 of 0 x v2 with die and then shortly after e3 it fast trading in so here's kind of preview of ography 2 so the markets are much more condensed that's much easier browse if you log in there's a sign-in options become like I'm looking email Google phone number that announced as well so it's really simple sign-in process if you want to add funds you can activate with a debit card eventually credit cards that's a much more seamless process actually using the notes to the stage will be able to use die on me so you don't you don't either at all on any other part of this process you know really that you're using Experian and I think that's really powerful it's up here you can see something spent another chunk will end there and then now they want to buy the price and then we actually show that it's pending if you want to just automatically appear at like 30 seconds to a minute later here it actually gives you kind of real-time updates based on what's happening on chain your orders placed and that's kind of a train in honor if you two don't believe you know you know you're getting these and so what's next for all berries really kind of a master plan part two which is all PC life is sort of designed the mobile first starting with a mobile experience that's where the 60% event takes place and working backwards to a desktop experience making tools it really easy to make I think this having a clear you super important focusing on user acquisition growth and also bringing sort of the offline social vetting experience online hour-and-a-half some features coming up pretty soon that they do that and there's one more thing we're going to do which is we're going to release event in line so this looks pretty similar or something like that there it's a little bit more modern and it allows you to back back in way individual events the numbers there are how much money you'll win if you bet so six point three extra money how many dollars you can bet and then we're going to eventually release the even simpler version of this that's just really easy to lose and that's that's basically what we're working on this one really final tactics up ten seconds it's an honor b1 14% of markets that were created burn pal this is a huge problem people historically associated Walker after we implemented changes in the end of June to alleviate those problems of the most recent one hundred and forty three markets better and lager only one was enveloped in a BT we got even more changes to try them over than a tea party next [Applause]
