foreign [Music] this Talk's going to be a little bit different we'll get into we'll get into why I think to many people what is about to happen in order to to make ethereum scale as promised will be a bit unexpected anyway let's dig in so I'm going to be talking about summoning the spirit of the Dank shot um this might be a strange idea to to many but uh we'll see so as Skyler was mentioning uh we have some problems in terms of fees scalability Etc the idea is there's this power we can call upon the power of dang sharding uh which basically massively scales the data that we have access to Within ethereum and the state's availability will allow l2s and whichever other platforms that would like to build on top of us the ethereum chain to massively grow ethereum um so the fees will be lower for averages while at the same time we can stop State load which is a I think most of the client teams will attest to a serious issue so how does what does this look like um the idea is that we have these massive Blobs of data where the l2s um and whoever else can basically just dump crazy amounts of it um like orders of magnitude more than is currently possible and then we have this this Black Blocks Gadget that's a cryptography Gadget like Daniel was talking about earlier these black boxes uh cause a kcg commitment which allows us to take this data and only put a tiny reference to it on chain um but we can also prove wonderful things about this data using using this tool then what we do is we take this um the the the data and once the chain has progressed a little bit we can throw it away and what we've been guaranteed is not that the chain stores the data forever because we can't we can't keep doing that but what we can guarantee is that everyone had access to the data so if you cared about that data you could have downloaded it and you can now be rest assured that your your data is there and available and this is the power of dank charting and is how ethereum will achieve the the ability to scale to hopefully the entire world's needs so what exactly is inside this box it is a bunch of moon math some polynomials and most importantly for what we heard for today is a a secret it's a secret that I can't know that you can't know the client teams can't know no one in the world can know and it is vital that we have the secret in order to enable the powers of dank sharding but it'll also the paths of dank charting are completely decimated if the secret is compromised so the idea is we're going to summon the secret from out of The Ether um the there's a ceremony that I um everyone else sitting here at the entire theorem community and hopefully members from around the world will participate in in order to produce the secret in a shared manner and once we all have contributed and attested to it the idea is that as soon as well sorry as long as one of us is honest one of us doesn't try go in the code change the code and throw away sorry sorry keep sorry one person make sure to throw away the secret that the computer knew for but a moment um then we will be good um and this again ties into a bit of what Danny was saying about resiliency uh there are multiple implementations of this that are needed we need as many people running it as possible institutions homesteakers whomever because they could be that final burning candle that keeps ethereum secure um thus uh the the idea being not that you trust one person to be honest but that you're pretty sure that amongst the thousands of people that have participated there's at least one of us who have done the right thing or in this case not the wrong thing in order to to summon the secret the idea is uh we'll have many interfaces but the primary one will be browser accessible the goal is to have some somewhere on the order of 5000 contributions will take five minutes of your time so hopefully a trivial thing to do to help improve the security of the network and be sure yourself because if you participated you knew that you didn't do any of the the weird things to try compromise the security and the files very small relative to some of these other ceremonies we've seen before my idea was to do a demo to show you uh quite how simple it is that it's gonna be fun interactive people are going to get on stage there's going to be a blast there were pandas that were going to be thrown around but unfortunately I've been let down a little bit by the the Wi-Fi conference Wi-Fi and the gods of trying to do demos on stage I was warned against that I still persisted and here we are anyway um thus the the idea is uh there's this interface you'll come to um the ceremony and there's this guide which will walk you through the processes that you need to partake in to invoke the spirit of the dunkshard um it's as normal you'll sign in with your ethereum account um you'll wiggle your mouse around a bit it's collecting all sorts of data you can draw pretty pictures uh write names of lost lovers Etc uh with your mouse you can type some secret that uh hopefully means something to you but ideally you're going to forget and all of this will be combined with some additional secure some additional Randomness from your computer with the idea being that you don't know it and if even one of these little steps are compromised then uh that's that's not super important um the uh then there's this this contribution phase where your computer starts getting all the um the data um there's a one one server which will send you this information where you are now the person who's been entrusted with the powers of Tau for a moment it's your time to shine you'll take these secrets that or your computer will take these secrets that you've just generated you'll mix it in with everyone else your ancestors in the ceremony who've come before and uh then you you will uh return the powers to the next the next user um and this is how we're gonna have the powers of dangshad uh and dangshotting drawnia um this very complicated chart of what's Happening all that's that's needed to know is for uh dunk charting in eip4844 I don't know if those mean anything to you but this is all part of the uh the search phase of our scaling um that uh in about a month or so we'll be going live with this this main ceremony um and uh hopefully all of you in this room will join me in participating all the people listening um that would that'd really be fantastic Let's uh scale to these these thousands of participants um there'll be grants um I want to encourage people to write their own implementations um you might be scared of cryptography or think that um this is not a not something you've practiced or whatever but you can't really go wrong writing your own implementation there's nowhere to break it it will just tell you sorry you were wrong if you made a mistake so please if you want to try dabble in some cryptography this is a great time to try otherwise if you've got some crazy ideas on how to create a secret um you want to do Vision trips in the desert or something flying airplanes um you're gonna like destroy your computer afterwards whatever you you think is a meaningful way of creating this the secret or destroying making sure proving to the world that you've destroyed it afterwards in a fun interesting like narratively relevant way um that would there'll be grants that you can uh you can join for doing this so um sign up uh on this thing to be notified I'm sure everyone will be seeing lots of this happening on all the twitters there'll be a pope which uh I know means a lot to a lot of people shout out Patricia on the front row here um and uh yeah so look look forward to this I encourage all of you to uh to to be ready to contribute and uh if you'd like to hear more I have another talk coming up later in the week to dive into the details explain really the the nitty-gritty of the math and why this is a secure thing and why it's a necessary thing um in order for ethereum to achieve our goals thank you
