first of all thank you all for coming thank you for the other presenters who will be speaking after us thank you to Imperial for hosting us obviously and I know a lot of work goes behind the scene in organizing these things sending out the invitations managing the list so thank you to the crypto compare guys especially Vlad for doing this month after month for the for the last I don't know how many years I have been attending the etherion meetups for the past two years and I normally sit at the back and keep close it's you know it's nice opportunity for me to actually take the stage and present to the community about what project the project we're working on so as I mentioned our company is trauma necks and we're going to present we have a presentation we want to show you and then we'll open it to QA and we we work in the payment space specifically we we have an existing business in international payments where we can execute the foreign exchange our clients are in mainly in continental Europe emerging markets Africa businesses that do import export shipping companies Airlines of a variety of corporates we were very much b2b and as we build this business over the last two years we had to develop a lot of internal procedures about AML compliance risk etc and we obviously we have been working with the FCA the financial conduct authority very closely we are regulated and our license is passport it across all EU countries so last year we were doing a bit of research and development in terms of what are the emerging technologies that will have a big business on a big impact on our international payments business and you know you you you cannot escape coming across blockchain it's it's it's in the news it's in academic publications you you cannot escape noticing it and we as we did our research we noticed so we are we are we are familiar with the existing problems in the existing banking infrastructure which is sort of one side of the slide and then we discovered that this emerging blockchain cryptocurrency space also has some some problems so namely on the banking side you have often clients have to wait for two days when you're in emerging markets up to five days to receive the payments there is no way to track the payment so you don't know if it's if it's the sitting with the bank in your country with the bank in the other countries it is it you know what is it waiting for which is amazing because if you look at UPS and postal parcels you can track them every step of the way they get scanned every step of the way you you know if your parcel is in the delivery van in the distribution center whether it's been picked up what time it's been picked up the name of the driver when it comes to payments it's a bit of a black hole so the money goes in and hopefully a few days later it comes out in the right place and and and the amount of sort of exceptions and issues that arise to give you an example if your if your company and you're making a payment of 300,000 pounds and you want to convert it to euro to fund your account you have to send 300 pounds if you say if you send 325 pounds chances are the payment will be rejected and then because of the 25 pounds excess and then you have to do it again and each time you do it there's fees involved there's time involved people phone calls etc so in theory block chain and cryptocurrencies can address a lot of these issues in terms of providing transparency in terms of providing speed especially i'm referring to public blockchains not not the private permission blockchains so so that's great we why don't we all start using a cryptocurrency an etherion to transact well so it turns out like cryptocurrencies are in a regulatory grades out so in other words if it's not very clear are the exchanges regulated that trading crypto currencies once you have to keep the currency it's not very clear well what what rights do you have as a consumer is there a public body you can turn to if if things go wrong and I mean regulators in many countries and central banks are watching this space and regulation is evolving but at the moment it's a gray zone so we came along we studied very closely the technology we have our existing business so we put the two together and decided well is there some way to bridge these two is there some way to do crypto in a regulated way so that is our solution we try to position ourselves as a bridge between the regulated financial system and you know blocked a blockchain based payment services and and and the way this works in the in the context of etherium its if you go on the theory and web page you will the first thing you will learn is how to issue your own digital token on the Tyrian blockchain it's very straightforward the problem is that token normally doesn't have any value doesn't mean anything so we are giving value to our token by holding collateral in in fiat at a segregated bank account and we're able to do that because of our regulated status and because of our knowledge and expertise in in the traditional banking environment okay and and why why do we do this we think it will enable a lot of new businesses things like micro payments which are currently very difficult to do because of the the cost of processing a payment so in theory blockchain should bring a significant cost advantage to block chain based payment systems but also as we know a serial is natively enabled for smart contracts and later tonight we will hear about various smart contract projects that other companies are working working on and a pain point for many of these projects is if they need to move money they either somehow need to interface the blockchain with a bank API which which which bank api's are very very notoriously difficult to get hold of or if someone like us can provide a digital token directly on the etherium contract on the etherion blockchain you can your smart contracts can interface directly with them so whether it's an insurance contract that needs to collect premiums or make a payout whether it's just a direct payment link to your cart whether it's something more complex like we will show an example later of sort of government money how you can restrict the uses of money so so in effect you know on the block chain so we want to have the benefits of national currencies because people understand what they are you know people understand pound sterling people understand US dollar people don't understand Bitcoin unless you spent five hours explaining it to them and then they still have their reservations on the other hand block chain is a fantastic and ending helium especially the fantastic technology with a lot of benefits built into it so I mean this these are some of the benefits of this kind of arrangement you can see it enables quite quite a few things so what I'm hoping is people who are working on very smart contract ideas or other business plans where the pain point is the actual moving of the money we please come and talk to us afterwards because we potentially have a way for you to do it directly on the block chain which means you know nearly instantaneous and transparent immutable etc etc so that's from me at this point I'm going to hand over to Dave our CTO to walk you through a few more slides and then and then I'll come back later I think that's quite a big question I'm not hugely familiar with this slide so you're gonna have to bear with me but actually if we go if we if we do stick on how does it actually work the one of the things I like about the model we've come up with it it's very very simple anyone who has done any solidity development at all will be very familiar with a solidity token or the etherium token it's Nick pointed out rolling out your beloved unicorn token is probably the first thing you're going to do if you come across solidity or a theory more generally we are very much stuck to that paradigm the token we are issuing onto the etherion blockchain is just using the standard etherium token interface there is no I'll be honest I'm going to stand here openly as the CGI say there's no technical genius going on here what's really interesting is kind of the operational component factored with the etherium token covered by that regulatory umbrella so what we do is we let's say you want 100 digital pounds worth of of these tokens you essentially send us 100 pounds we're a regulated financial institution you can wire it to us you know you know potentially a range of forms we're looking to put a payment gateway in so you can just do it on your credit card if that's what you were looking to do and we would hold that money in what's known as a client segregated bank account so this is like an FCA reg oversights they give their oversight to these client segregated accounts that really means that if we go bankrupt we can't touch that money nor can administrate er it means that money is safe and would get re you know delivered out people you know were we to go bankrupt the idea is that you send us the money once we can acknowledge receipt of those funds we will issue the tokens to wherever you have which would ever address you have requested they be sent to we need to perform some kind of background checks on you some you know some kyc know your client checks again from a regulatory point of view to know who you are but once that's done you've got these tokens and you can do what you like with them they are as we see them essentially digital banknotes they behave exactly like a bank name there's almost no difference apart from the fact that you can now interact programmatically with your bank name which is pretty cool we are normally careful how many people I say this to because it it can start to raise some other concerns we are essentially acting like a central bank if that we we essentially are behaving like a central bank have some implications you know I'm not sure how you'd value a central bank for example but you know it's the fact that it is you know has regulatory oversight does the thing that you know we really considered to actually be a very powerful thing we have a number of clients who are interested in using this who who wouldn't use it if there wasn't that regulatory backing turn so that's very important to us I originally got interested in this because my background is banking for my sins keep the booze to a minimum please we we we really got into this because like Nick said you can't get away from the block chain in the financial technology space right now nor would you want to the current model for if you actually take a foreign currently transaction for us is pretty much someone comes to us with their sterling they say I want to make a euro payment but I don't have a year a bank account nor do I have any way of getting older two million euros so they come to us we take the sterling we go to the bank or the street or the FX market place and we do a foreign currency transaction it'll take two days for that to settle and to move actually those final that euro payment on to the final payee this has got a number of risks it's two days for the payee to send us the money in two days for us to get the payee the beneficiary the final beneficiary their money there's two days of credit risk as I see it that's two days too long for someone to go bankrupt and for the money to just never arrived so what we would be able to do if there were national currencies on the blockchain is for someone to say look I've got some digital sterling already you'd hope they have it already you'd hope that this stuff was kind of in circulation and being used and we say okay fine we'll use a smart contract to act almost like an escrow two parties can simply put there you know put their sterling in one side there euro in the other side and can just exchange instantaneous settlement and accept McNiff risk no credit risk and it's instantaneous which is pretty nice everyone gets their money straight away brilliant so additional benefits though specifically of actual the national currencies on the blockchain or the fiat currencies on the blockchain are things like this the Nick talked about one of the first things that came up for the British government when they were looking at the use of blockchain technologies was conservative government how that we cover making sure people can't spend their benefit money on things they shouldn't be spending a lot so this is a pretty interesting way of being able to do this this means that if you were to take this national currency and you were to you know to wrap it in various smart contracts you can start to do some very powerful things with it you can if you want to and if that's deemed appropriate you can control where the money is spent not to mention all of the other interesting things you can do with it if anyone's familiar with foreign currency markets people regularly want to buy or sell money based on sorts of triggers you could use oracle eyes or something else to you know to trigger events that occur and move money based on the back of those events there's all sorts of cool things you can do so right and this is the point actually like I said there's no technical genius going on here I'm taking your money I'm giving you some tokens and i'm giving you the promise backed by the FCA that when you want your money back i'll give it to you back and that money is safe whilst we hold there's nothing revolutionary going on there but finding someone who is prepared to do that who understands the banking sector who understands the earth it enough kind of ability to interact with the regulators or the background to interact with the regulators those things have not yet been come bind there are certain competitors out there to products like this but none of them have regulatory oversight probably one of the most significant companies is based in Panama sounds like great for them but probably not so great for me so I'm going to try and kind of rattle through here but you know real money on the blockchain it provides you know all sorts of benefits I mean here we're talking about providing private sector alternative in a regulated fashion regulators an alternative for AP is exactly i mean this is this is one thing try and like this Nick mentioned actually trying to get banks it's very easy to find an API where someone's going to be prepared to FX and head your FX market risk it's very difficult finding a bank that's actually going to be prepared to set all those currencies extraordinarily difficult to settle say Garnon or kenyan shilling for example you could start doing that with this with you know considerably greater ease with considerably greater protection again removing that credit risk which is often a concern in those areas Internet of Things microtransactions it enables micro transactions in a way that you know has just not been done before you can do micro transactions with any cryptocurrency I guess but it's not back to buy central bank it's not a real currency it's not necessarily something that anybody outside of this room for example would want to carry around with them let's be honest in my mind could take some heat for this not everybody wants to carry Bitcoin around people want people like sterling the public at large Lee they like that pound sterling they want to keep their pound sterling I like the idea that we could bring it to them in another fashion they're going to have the money in their bank account the notes in their pocket and maybe the national currency on that phone for an exchange on the blockchain something you can do off the back of this again automated via smart contracts but I went necessarily dwell on that too much but again it makes the remittance market particularly interesting transferwise claim to be able to peer to peer match you love your effects you would no longer need transferwise to peer to peer match your effects if you want to exchange money with someone you would just be able to instantaneously do it you no longer need to give up that one percent fee Nick o yours man sure think thank you Dave so I mean if you've heard what you know if you've been listening and you sort of trying to draw comparisons like oh are they a little bit like like this one company or this one company we we think we're a little bit like each one of the companies listed there with some and with each one of them in comparison we have some differentiating factors again being all shore regulated on a public block chain and and what you see on the other side of the slide is to market size the current global you know market size for the payments industry mean it's it's huge 650 billion pounds per day I mean it's it's you know we're just a drop in the ocean most most big companies you read about us just to drop in that big ocean so it's a huge space with a lot of you know opportunities for multiple players you know this this is so going back to our business model we've come from sort of conventional fx2 to FX done by AP ice and we do believe the future is effects on the blockchain I mean we'll see in the next two to three years if it doesn't materialize then we'll have to substitute FX on the block chain with something else but for the moment we're quite bullish we we think with the right people to do this because we haven't established you know an operating and growing financial business and because we regulate it and and we'd like to think that we're the center of the center of the universe yeah everybody thinks the center of the universe but yeah so I mean if you're interested in our company history I mean this is public information we've put it on here for everybody to get an idea of when the company was registered you can see this on companies house you can change check our license information on the the register of the FCA and you can see we by the way something I forgot to mention we received a grant from innovate UK which is an agency of the British government responsible for innovation and we're developing an FX settlement prototype using blockchain technology and we're planning to start commercializing it in January 2017 which is our wonderful management team and if you want to get in touch that's our information so i think at this point we will open to Q&A we're going to pass this microphone and we have another microphone at the front so I'm not sure Nicole do you want to run up the stairs with microphone or how we're going to do this hi yeah mine I'm just in front my name is arif so I had a couple of questions so the first thing was a question on whether if you were providing the currency or you're essentially enabling the networked of onboard market makers which are providing currency and second thing is how do you guys make money so okay we're very much in testing phase with the fiat currency on the block chain so any partners that we partnering with right now we're not making any money we have it we have an existing FX business that makes plenty of money this is the start is as an R&D project for us which is now getting increasingly serious and we would look to commercialize in the future but right now we're not in terms of your first question the aim really is to allow anybody to put their hands on the fiat currency not anyone in particular the idea is that if you it really is i do I keep coming back to this concept of these banknotes if you if you leave some digital sterling with us or if you so if you leave some real sterling with us or some real euro with us we will give you the corresponding one-to-one value in the digital tokens with the promise that we will exchange them back if you'd like to do so in the future what you then do with those tokens entirely up to you very similar to the banknote really once they're in the wild they're in the wild does that does that kind of corresponding value to the pound so economically the reason you have to retain a full Reserve and so absolutely everything we can't do anything with that money pardon I wouldn't know sorry you don't need an exchange price I'm saying if you give me five pounds I will give you tokens worth five pounds and like the central bank if I'm going to hold your five pounds in reserve your tokens now have value of five pounds in the same way that historically you would give your gold to the central bank they would issue you with a note that you can carry around and you can spend and you can return for your gold at a point in time it's just that here you would peg it one to one and it's the full reserve that allows us to hopefully retain that value hope there's always a small chance that they trade a premium that we'll see yes yes that's we are under no illusions that unless lots of people want this mmm it doesn't work very well so um how available is the currency at the moment the tokens it's not at all available at the moment we we launched in this month we're actually our first partners are in the room alice is somewhere kicking around oh hey guys and we're working with these guys first is our it's like kind of our first partners it's not out in the pot is not out to the public yet it will be on the public blockchain but the as I said we need to KY c and get checks off with various regulators with who we would work with first so so can I just check I understand then so are you saying that for example FX market makers could be clients of yours and use your bank account facilities to make a market and therefore enable effectively same day or instantaneous yeah so now I'm at risk of people throwing things up even my background prior to this i spent seven years of goldman sachs there's absolutely no reason why you couldn't load Golden's up with a bunch of stuff like JP Morgan load maybe the other ten kind of leading FX banks on the street up with this and from an interv and settlement point of view they just settle between themselves using this stuff instantaneously so yes from a market making point of view you could you could do this at which point it really might start trading a premium because of the lack of credit risk you can arguably discount I'm not sure I really understand the credit risk side of things when you put the pounds that you receive in a bank account which bank account are you putting it in and and you say it's segregated and that you're working with the regulator does that mean they're backing it and guaranteeing it or what I mean isn't there still a risk of the bank's liquidity which I mean can you can you have the information on custody risk so okay so the credit risk i'm really talking about is current existing credit risk if you doing you and I do an FX trade right now for example we agree on the price of euro dollar I'm going to give you some euros you're going to give me some dollars but there's not actually an expectation for me to deliver you those euros or you to deliver me those dollars until two days time which means we can have agreed a rate the markets can be moving against me or in my favor and in two days time you can phone me like sorry Dave Dagon at which point i'm out and I've potentially exposed myself to two days worth of volatility in the market and I could make a very significant loss or a very significant game that's the credit risk until you know I'm talking about my exposure to you once we've done the effects in the context of the bank that where we hold the money yes our clients people who use this product they are exposed to that manky and the bank will be regulated there will be protection if you know from the bank under standard fco regulation but let's be honest if we put all of our money with Lehman Brothers and they completely vanish it's going to take a few years for administrators to sort that all out so there is you know there is an element there what we would love to be able to do is store our money with a central bank and the bank of england are talking about potentially opening up bank accounts but we think there are a little way away from them hopefully if we go to market with something like this it might kick them into gear a little bit Nikki you can take a few hi my name is Daniel um so my question is if I I'm interesting the remittances marking right and I I don't really perhaps you can expand a bit on that if I wanted to set myself up as a as a competitor to western union right so i would get money in for people who want to sent to the granny in colombia in some village in the middle of nowhere how do i work how would someone like that work with you in this drug thing sure go on I feel like so let's start with do you want do you want to do the effects or do you just want to send the money you know no one cares about how the money what happens they just care that the money that the money comes in and it ends up with their granny right so what would I do you know that use case as someone who's basically in effect just setting themselves up as a money changing business or something selecting some money and trying to put it in somewhere in another country for your specific scenario your grand would have to want digital currency right or you know you would need you would need a model which could emerge in the future where she could then exchange that money locally for cash for example you would imagine that that was that was probably gonna be a service cash machine is essentially how that would work and we do have partners who are interested in rolling out cash machines for this so let's envisage a scenario where you know maybe your granny lives in the US you've got some US dollar and you can give it to us we'll give you digital dollars you immediately and instantaneously just move it to her address to her a theorem address i'm talking about there at which point she could exchange at an ATM for cash one for one does that kind of yeah that makes sense but then in what way is it different from me say buying a lot of bitcoin and sending her the bitcoin it's not apart from the fact that bitcoin price could change a bit in 48 hours or however long it takes together it depends on whether you from in that context it's no different from bitcoin apart from the fact that one of them is bitcoin and one of them is pound sterling or US dollar and there are some differences there with one being a central bank backed currency and one of them being a standard cryptocurrency have a head of tether tether dollars so if you trade on Polonia x you can use tethers as a settlement mechanism it's conceptually very similar I'm not aware if they hold reserves and and how they hold them and what they regulate if they regulate it or if they're onshore offshore I don't know so I can't comment but yeah conceptually it's very similar yes but what I'm saying is I don't know how that peg is enforced whether they using some some complex technical algorithms or whether they're holding full reserve whether that reserve is in a segregated status in which country so I don't know yeah my name is Daniel so much so my question is about how you operate all this thing let's say you've said that you have a secret account for every customer and more or less you have to balances one on the account another one in in tokens on smart contracts let's and the transfers and tokens are settled quickly on the block chain but the transfer some accounts are not so quick so how could you manage to do to ensure that these balances are synchronized and another question is let's say I receive the money on your system and so I've got the settlement on the blockchain so I've got some money on my balance and talking about the military I would like to get money from that account itself but you didn't settle yet so how you handle this situation too so this is it let's take the first one actually let's take the second one your if the money has not actually physically reached us yet then yes you are limited there is a kind of a loose idea here that's may feel we're hopeful that you know when you want your digital currency your you are in the long term people will keep their digital currency and that's what will be used so yes if you when you send us the money there could well be a 24-hour delay and you sending us the money you won't get your tokens until we've got the money and when you want your money back it could take us 24 hours for you to get you you know the cash into your bank account in that case is you know there is some settlement delay yes definitely again the implicit assumption here is that you want those tokens because you're going to keep them for a period of time does that does that make sense yeah okay so cool so in terms of the first one you know what we're really interested in is is again like releasing the bank notes into the wild what we care about is making sure that the total number of tokens and circulation matches the total amount on the bank account and that's actually very easy check to do you can simply inspect the blockchain fair to see how many tokens there are in existence the tokens can't be destroyed apart from by us so they're out there they are in circulation and then you just check that the balance in the bank account matches the bounce and block chain one more question are just you just said that you will not receive your tokens we've got the money on the account does it mean it's the settlement still really connected to the money on the account yes it is and actually is very significant for this so it means that my balance on tokens will not be changed until you've got money on my secure gated account so it's the same time for settlement right yes and when we're not claiming i mean this is this is a very important part for the effects we're not claiming that right now as soon as you put these tokens there that we can solve the FX problem for a for anybody immediately it only works if that both parties are interested in having the digital tokens and retaining the digital tokens settlement of the tokens is instantaneous and if people want those tokens and they can be used for other things then there's value you know which is why we're working with ATM providers were working with gay payment gateways we're working with merchants who would potentially accept them so they become a commonplace currency that is is used across the board but if you want to say do an FX transaction and you've got to wire me the sterling we wait until we've got it we issue the tokens you convert it for some euros and then we wait to set of those euros that's not really going to spell anything up for you is that that make sense yes thanks I mean just well from my side so we're working on the assumption that in the future central banks will willingly want to issue digital currency on a blockchain either they're on blockchain or the etherion blockchain or some other blockchain so in the future a lot of these things will be just natively possible but until then we would like to be able to take care of this in the private sector and hopefully do it right with with support from everybody so so we you know we have a long term vision but I mean there's still a long way until we get there yeah probably one more question to get to the bottom of that story but say if I receive money in the tokens you mean I will not be able to use it until like into the ad with delayed two days now so in theory once you have the tokens you know we're working with merchants want to accept the token us as a means of payment we're working with a you know existing cryptocurrency payment gateways were in addition to that 20 crypto they want to add a stable coin like ours as an additional option so I mean we have to build out the whole ecosystem because it's just not there at the moment so in the future hopefully you will get your tokens and be able to spend them right away or or or or send them to smart contract for to do something no once you've got your type games you can do anything you like with them if you can find someone is prepared to take them as payment you can spend it could be a cryptocurrency but it uses the etherium token interface because it's a common programmable interface that solidity developers are experienced hey guys so talking about this from a trading perspective so say for example you know say for example all the streets on the bank sign up to this let's say all the banks on the street sign up to this they each have digital sterling hero dollar yen for example they all train trade between themselves so the exchange rates will essentially be defined OTC okay they'll trade with each other and eventually as it starts becoming more prominent within the market eventually exchanges will start coming up to determine exchange rates between your digital currency how do you ensure parity between the digital equivalent of the currency and the actual physical real currency because for example I could come to you and I could say give me 100 pounds and I 100 pounds worth of digital sterling but for example is trading at 86 pounds on in exchange for example how do you ensure that parity so FX is all OTC across the board there's it's that full reserve concept so economically there's the concept of a partial réserver or for reserve what the full Reserve does it means that if you've got your tokens you could exchange them back for the full amount so let's say you find someone you're able to buy them for eighty eight pence on the pound then that's like the world's greatest arbitrage opportunity because you're going to wanna I highly recommend you go out you just buy as many of those guys as you possibly can because you can exchange them for you know considerably more worth when you come back to us and get your money back so thats what stops it happening the market just stops it from happening anybody that's prepared to sell you them at a discount is a real idiot the really interesting one is going to happen as if they trade at a premium are they more valuable than normal pounds because you can interact with them programmatically my inclination is probably not but it's possible so that's what keeps them pegged basically the full reserve the fact that you know all times you can come back for your money and they were will be exchanged for that enough in the same way that the Bank of England retains the value of but a quick questions how about this let's say you've got 10 million pounds worth of coins in circulation so on sends a million pounds to buy million pound with for your tokens the bank recalls that money because it was fortunately transferred to you what you have a credit risk of like a million pound hole in your book and your currency is unbalanced by that time so in that situation you're talking about the money hits our bank account we've got the million pounds we issue the tokens but the bank issues re cool right at that point we go into negotiation with the bank we can also pull those tokens back if we really want to like we have as the issuer like I said we act like a central bank way they exchanged so that's a very good point so at this point we need tools to track you know what's going on and how to pull this back but that's exactly why the FCA is involved that's exactly the same model as I why you some euros you why me some sterling and then someone recalls it that actually just doesn't happen when you're talking about million pounds sorry no it doesn't know I wouldn't have a Bitcoin because well it's Bitcoin and in this specific scenario day there are regulatory agreements in place to handle those kind of situations in exactly the same way as if I were you the corresponding amount of euros you are me the sterling and then the bank like makes a recall but actually in the kind of banking infrastructure weird talking about that doesn't happen like one bank can't just recall from a bank account a million bounce they would have better compliance office that can freeze it sorry the compliance officer can freeze it precisely yeah precisely they can freeze anything they like at any time they like if they don't like whatever it's good actually in this specific scenario the FCA would be pretty pissed with us if we didn't freeze it so sorry so here's a really interesting 1 i'll be interested in hearing people's thoughts about this afterwards but there's absolutely nothing to say right now that we couldn't freeze the assets but that's an interesting question do you people like the fact that we're back fire regulator and the regulator might say freeze the assets freeze freeze the million pounds freeze the assets or wanna know what's going on or someone gets wind a government gets wind that there may be moving to someone on our sanctions list freeze the assets here's all no legal stuff to say you need to do I'm not sure how I feel about that and that's you know something that's that's out there now something actually we're still discussing with regulators that's something we have to put in a regulatory requirement or not oh yeah massive problems that's a problems we are acutely aware of that said yes yeah yeah so I think that that's an excellent discussion you guys should move it to the pub later on because I do want to get a few more questions I still see quite a quite a few hands yeah I mean it's sort of on a related topic but it seems to me that you're issuing a digital representation of pound sterling you're effectively issuing a security really and you know one of the reasons that we've been in Bitcoin and these sorts of things is that bitcoin is not a regulated instrument and the FCA has just said you know bitcoin whatever go for your life don't we don't care it's outside of our parameters as soon as you do this you're effectively crossing a live wire and and i think it's very dangerous regulatory territory for you so I mean you do is you're going into the whole area of issuing securities to retail investors and and all the oldest sort of thing I think I think it's extremely dangerous have you have you considered all that so we are we are we're very much be to be so we don't we don't deal directly with consumers some of our partners may have may may have consumers and they have to manage those relationships and we work very closely with the FCA and they do want to understand every step of the way what are the risks how is the ultimate consumer protected etc so the bay at the point is that's why we're working very direct closely with the regulator we're not trying to do this behind their backs or or or in a offshore unregulated environment the other thing is because I you know I think I'm a big fan of Bitcoin by the way I have Bitcoin on my phone I think it has its uses but in terms of mass adoption I've given lectures on Bitcoin two years ago three years ago four years ago to various audiences and some of the questions that always come up is well who's this bag by which government is backing this you know what how is this regulated you know what if the exchange runs away with my money who guarantees the exchange rate etc so we try to you know my bitcoins great I don't have a problem with it i use it i recommend it to people but it has some let's say niche applications in my view and what we're trying to do here is to issue you mentioned the word security from a regulatory perspective what we're trying to do is called emoney which is a different regime it's actually the same money that's in your paypal account cine money license you know same principle that's then as another analogy I like to draw and it's the paypal analogy hi blog Paul and one of the announcements that was made at Def Con and Shanghai recently was by santander who seemed to be doing something quite similar to this I'm afraid I wasn't there so if anyone can help me understand is what you're doing the same or if they if not were the differences so according to the media reports it's very similar I don't know how far they are in terms of pilots in terms of partners why no and I'm not sure cuz there was there was an announcement of Def Con where the company doing it was regulated out of Panama so I'm not sure that's the same one oh that's a different one I'm this santander scenario my understanding is that what they've done is if you imagine the reserve is obviously quite key to this and you can obviously tell by the number of questions around it what Santander have done is they have an internal pool of money and if you want to wire money to someone else of Santander right now that's going to be a pretty that's actually going to be a surprising laborious leap rising Lee laborious process form they've actually almost done like internal internal netting so that all of the money is kind of sat in a central pot and then when if you want to money why money to someone else's san tan there you can do it and it's done on the blocking so it's kind of a similar system but it's private in the context of Santander that's my understanding of it please jump in if okay one more question thank you just one quick question about kyc and do people who deposit and withdraw money are the only people who have to be kyc in your system or do any any recipient of the token have to be KY seed and one more question can anyone become KY see if I live in Nigeria say will you KY see me or are there limits to that as well thank you only those interacting with us need to be ki see so if you want tokens or you want to retrieve tokens they're the only points of kyc required same as with your bank again back to cash if for in order to open the bank account they're going to KY c check you once you pull your cash out of your bank account do whatever you like with it and there are no fees well there are no fees right now so tell me do they take this afterwards you talk to them they'll be here so and we are the presentations to we already kyc check people all over the world including nigeria so that's just part of our regular business model that we do doing FX
