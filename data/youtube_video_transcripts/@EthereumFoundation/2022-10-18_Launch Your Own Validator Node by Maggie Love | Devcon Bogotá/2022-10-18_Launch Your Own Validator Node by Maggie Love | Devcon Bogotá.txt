foreign [Music] options if you would like to launch your own validator node and talk about what the node infrastructure landscape looks like in ethereum currently and you know why it's important that if you can you consider running your own node so my name is Maggie love um I guess next slide Clicker cool so my name is Maggie love I'm one of the co-founders and director of ecosystem and Partnerships for web3 cloud I'm also the founder of shifai and that's me on Twitter and this is Shane so Shane is the co-founder of decentralized authority and our teams are working together on some different plays in the node infrastructure space and uh just a bit about web3 Cloud so we are a compute and storage Hardware infrastructure provider powering web 3 and we're also a joint venture between consensus in Advanced Micro Devices and really our goal is to provide the infrastructure for many web3 protocols so the protocols on the software side can just focus on scaling and building it web3 natively so building infrastructure that's web 3 native okay so uh why is validating important right so ethereum believes that validators will play an active part in ethereum's future and that they are key to more secure scalable and sustainable ethereum um I got this quote from an article I I post all the things I take from and really this is uh the validators are really important to ethereum if you heard Danny Ryan's opening talk a resiliency is incredibly important in this space and we're going to touch on that again today in this presentation okay so I had a spicy tweet uh earlier this year and it kind of sparked me to go further down this rabbit hole and sort of why I'm here today it got a lot of airplane and they spent like two minutes on it so I was really surprised all right so uh you know what does it mean to be decentralized and should uh protocols like ethereum and others be concerned if more than you know 50 of their nodes are running on one hosting provider what are some of the things we have to consider uh you know decentralization is a key tenant at least the ethereum ecosystem not every ecosystem and so I wanted to challenge that notion that if we say this is important uh are we actually decentralized and um because of this tweet hurts nurse so you can see her 16.9 of the ecosystem I'll responded to my tweet saying they were Banning a running ethereum notes on their infrastructure so they're a data center within Germany uh that a lot of nodes are running on so we can start to see the issues here uh if we're not thinking about how to decentralize the cost hosting providers uh because Searcher did it they're smaller but potentially Amazon could do it um and one of the ethereum uh Foundation members Peter uh right kind of commented on that you know it's important to update the validator ecosystem so more people can run it at home update the protocol itself and you know if that's not happening then people are gonna go with the easy hosting providers they may not be aware of some of the risks that could happen so um that was a fun fun week or so of notifications and so really quickly I just wanted to do a poll uh because this was a big part of the debate on on the Twitter thread how many many of you think a centralization about infrastructure is a concern for ethereum okay great so all of us are here because we're probably curious about decentralization and believe it's important through for a resilient uh vertical and so then the goal of this Workshop today is to teach you about the importance of running your own note to contribute to the resilience into centralization of the network and also to protect yourself from penalties so what we'll go over today actually the ethereum uh protocol incentivizes you to be running your own node and not to be aggregated in a majority of any kind and so we'll get a bit more into that so really quickly the agenda uh why did ethereum move to proof of stake node infrastructure landscape and examining decentralization across layers in that landscape and then node Runner options and so Shane will get up here uh to run you through different node Runner options at the end okay so proof of stake and solo sticky 101 so she buys an educational shift at onward women and non-binary folks in the crypto ecosystem so I am a teacher a part of my time in the space so some of this is familiar to you um I like to make sure everyone's on the same page by explaining things before we dive in so a quick proof of State glossary for those of you who may be unfamiliar uh so proof of stake is a consensus mechanism where evaluators put Capital At Risk by staking it to validate blocks of transactions and secure the network a consensus mechanisms are just how a blockchain protocol or a group of any time any kind really uh comes to the source of truth about something and it's really important in blockchain protocols especially ethereum that we have one single source of Truth in order for it to function properly a staking is just the act of locking up or depositing crypto an a validator note so really what we're focusing on today is a note that processes transaction uh sorry adds new box to the blockchain and stores data a little misspelling there and so they're responsible for proposing blocks of transactions and attesting uh the transactions and blocks are true so if you're running a validator node there were sometimes responsible for proposing the block transactions and sometimes for a testing at the transactions a different block proposer is proposing our true so that's your quick glossary for those of you who are familiar and so why did ethereum move to prove a stake of reducing barriers to entry through Network participants so more people have Capital to stake uh that improve of work where you would need uh gpus electricity power a lot of capital in order to validate transactions and secure the network uh reduce ethereum's carbon footprint by 99.5 that's really exciting for the ecosystem especially when we're thinking about attracting new applications and users who are extremely work [Music] and so also means that we need to issue to incentivize validators to secure the network and so 51 attacks are more costly and difficult to do than they were in proof of work and it's easier to have a social recovery if something happened uh negative happens having uh a lot of power you must commit some type of capital foreign for you and so going to take about 25 cut of earnings from stickers uh your keys in your crypto so when you're speaking with other entities they ultimately have your private keys and so you ultimately do not have final access to your crypto which is not the case Hardware setups but you know you can uh you're not locked into one type of setup and reduce the risk of large events flashing so we're going to go over this a bit more but if you're joining a large pool that has um majority of the network and if something happens to that pool they go offline and have trouble um accessing the network you're going to get flashed as part of that but if you're a solo speaker you're not going to run into that risk is true protocol however there are some challenges with solo validating and so uh this morning this was the price of 32 East which is not acceptable to many who want to take it home even if we think about how large.com is right now it was not this large for the past and so we're having a lot of new participants joining our ecosystem and it's really hard to accumulate 32 each uh so there is still a cost of Hardware electricity ongoing maintenance of these notes it's not set it and forget it in your home you have to technical know-how to develop and operate an ethereum validator so there's lots of tutorials but if you're not very technical it will be difficult a secure Key Management so whenever you're managing your own Keys you have to have very good practices around keeping it secure if you lose your keys it's not a good situation for you and it maximizes rewards um it's locked up until this next upgrade from this not to you know say anything bad about water so then what is the validator landscape reality taking into account the requirements and challenges um what if they don't have the technical know-how what if they don't have the time uh inability to continue managing after setup uh so um via a service a pool or an exchange and these options are wonderful because we increase the participation of individuals staking in the ethereum at work uh but they aren't a deal for resilience robustness security and all those things we want uh for the ethereum protocol and so then knowing this knowing that there's more options what is the actual state of the validator landscape today so really quickly uh landscape has many players and so we have a smart contract platforms so there was like ethereum we have software infrastructure providers we have Hardware infrastructure providers as well uh they have solo stickers we have liquid staking protocols we have seeking service businesses liquid stickers and we have investors so there's actually many players that contribute to the uh staking landscape um so today uh for the rest of this presentation before we get into the no running options we're going to look at the decentralization of the different layers of the node landscape so hosting providers uh 65 of ethereum notes are hosted on centralized services so you know the different rules and how much dominance they have a lot of coinbase cracking binance Etc uh no client uh diversity so it's really important that we're not all running the same no clients so we're going to examine that and then Geographic no distribution right we don't want to all be running our nodes out of the U.S Virginia East the big amazon Data Center and then coin ownership distribution right so uh depending on how much uh you know power and staked Capital you have on the network especially these schools you're going to have more coins and more rewards and uh you know more potential political say so first we're going to look at the new distribution so this doesn't break down by hosting providers but you can see uh hosting is 63.9 um this is taken from ethernet.org you can go there right now and you can look up these charts in real time and so uh right now most people aren't solo speaking most people are speaking with some type of Provider that's sticking with a hosting provider itself [Music] and you know um that has many other implications oh I went back and so uh in September uh you know 13.5 million East uh we're staked so a lot of money and more than 60 of the youth was sitting with Lido coinbase Kraken and finance uh so all of these entities have a much higher likelihood of being assigned to produce blocks of transactions because they have more stake teeth and so some of the concerns that were brought up when this happened or when this was realized as um obviously they're getting more of the rewards they're earning most of the money coming from the network uh and there's a lot of discussion around censoring transactions around the network a lot of them use IBD boost of sanctions and tornado cash um these uh Network and so uh more importantly this is happening right now you can see what's going on between Lego and others is that they're defining the rules of law formation and what type of blocks get created once again so they can say like these type of transactions can be included in blocks of these types of transactions should not be included in blocks so they're gonna be able to set the rules of how things work in a theory improved stake and then others entities that they don't follow these rules could be penalized so it's really important that not you know one group of uh entities uh producing blocks uh are creating the rules for the entire network are producing all the blocks and so um another uh type of you know decentralization or in this case diversity that's really important diversity and so right now you can see death is 77 of the uh consensus clients so what people are writing and so once again Peter he's another good person to follow if you're more curious about what's happening um you know it is uh similar to all the nodes are being hosted in one place or all there's a lot in a pool if something happens to be running that same consensus client and so um you know I read an article that it's not great to have one because as a client it's better to have a majority in an ethereum uh purposely oh sorry A diversity I've had multiple clients running but it actually worked at multiple clients and wanted a super majority than it is to have one consensus client so it is something people are working on and there are other clients that you can run [Music] the network will start slashing that group so anybody that's in that group right now uh these nodes will all start getting flashed until the value is less than one-third and so you're going from 53 below to 32 before the slashing would end so anyone posted on Amazon would suffer as a part of that and so you as an individual don't have control because you're a part of this potential slashing group and also as I imagine you may have no idea uh where your nodes are be hosted if you're going through some other type of service provider is impacted so whether it's posting whether it's pool because the pool is hosting there or the pool in general or whether it's at the client consensus level um there's a lot of risk of essentialization and you being penalized as a validator um what degree does decentralization matter these networks there's like a big debate on that and like every blockchain protocol has their own version of how decentralized they want to be um and there was a talk uh he was mentioning that is not works and that there tends to be a bit of a tragedy of the commons when it comes to decentralization or it's like this uh creeping phenomenon where people don't actually care about it until it's too late so until this large group starts getting slashed so not something that matters because the performance of the network is running fine and most users probably especially when it's not at a technical developer conference are not that worried about decentralization they're worried about you know being able to successfully use their app and write the ethereum network goal is to be incredibly uh neutral resilient scalable and global settlement layer earn rewards and avoid penalties and so right as we've been um as I mentioned today the ethereum network actually encourages decentralization uh less penalties to run your own validator note for one of your own individual client uh for not hosting or going through a pool in general um the ethereum community is working uh across all these points of centralization uh two ways to decentralize these uh different aspects so the node infrastructure layer the pools the client diversity uh the geographic distribution and block construction so these are things and coin distribution uh this is not a presentation ecosystem is like for the first time hearing the very aware of all these things and working uh very hard to improve the resilience to sexualization and uh even the different safety providers are trying to you know distribute where they uh run their notes options right so having an understanding now of kind of the the the landscape uh within ethereum and the requirements for being a runner what options are there for actually running your own notes so actually let me get the clicker from you okay oh uh let's see here Administration you understand networking uh scripting Docker these are all skills that you have and so because of that uh you have numerous resources for learning about uh which nodes you want to run which clients you want to run and how you want to run them there's a lot of documentation with every single client about uh becoming an ethereum validator with them uh there's no limitation on the location of where you want to host your notes and there's no limitation on the client choice because you can take anything and run with it because you have the skills to be able to do that things of that nature so if you're an advanced user there's a lot of options for you out there now the entry level users uh so these are the folks that don't have all of the uh all skills uh mentioned above well good news is there are three different uh GUI based uh software options so this significantly streamlines the the level of skill that you need in order to run a validator um you might be limited on the location of where you can uh host that validator uh we'll we'll get into some of that but uh with with an entry node uh with an entry level user you're much more likely to probably want to run it at home uh you all might be limited on the client Choice uh because if you're using a software platform you're limited to whatever software or whatever clients that software has available to you so Windows Mac Linux you install it on your uh on your computer and then you can connect it to a remote server and they have a very simple tutorial on like setting up a remote server with different Cloud providers uh but really what happens is after you just sign up for a server you can actually Point their application to that server and then the application takes care of everything uh and it actually does it through a really cool technology called Ansel so basically send uh send commands to the server to set it up perfectly for you uh the good and so with this kind of setup entry or uh skill-wise you could be an artist uh they have great tutorials very simple time wise you're looking at maybe about an hour uh or less if if you're following their tutorials it can be done very efficiently notable features uh uh controller you can host your note really anywhere on any kind of Provider uh and so you really have a lot of location Freedom uh you have extensive client options they do a great job of giving you tons of different client options so you could actually take a look at uh those charts okay which ones are over at 33 uh and you most likely don't want to be in that group because if something happens so say you're with prism and something happens to uh there's a mistake uh in an update what have you what happens is if there are over one third that whole group is going to start getting slashed so you want to be a smaller client group and that's actually what's brilliant designed is a one-client diversity so that you don't have the whole network hinging on one client another platform uh this is a really cool platform uh it's different than the other one because this is a hardware platform so this is something where you have to actually buy their Hardware in order to uh use their software so it's kind of like that complete package which is great for some users where they just want to buy it and have a real easy kind of uh point-and-click setup but you know you do need to buy their Hardware uh you can't just use it on your own hardware and you also don't have Hardware Choice uh but skill level wise novice very easy to use uh we're talking an hour maybe a little bit more of a setup it's a little bit uh there's a few more steps in it but it's still a great user experience some notable features is there's no OS configuration because you're buying the uh Hardware you don't have to set up the OS it's a full package in that way they also have a really impressive app store where you can uh deploy notes from other blockchains or uh other clients and it's really cool foreign [Music] skill level wise I give this a moderate and the reason I give it a moderate is because there's a lot of options so for some users having that that amount of options could actually be something that is very uh intimidating and so uh but there are some great tutorials that you know can take people through you know setting setting everything up for a DOT node uh it takes a little bit more time because there are more options there's a few more things you need to set up um but their approach is really cool uh it's a notable future wise they they have this modular approach so you can choose you know different monitoring tools that you want to use with your uh with your node and they have a really cool way of just being able to kind of create this uh this way of just deploying different uh packages as they call them deploying different packages that are kind of part of your valuator Suite if you will so there's a lot of customization there um uh they have a very simplified OS installer so you can actually install it from a Ubuntu image that they provide and it just streamlines the whole process so there's less that people have to do uh they have a very impressive App Store as well uh far beyond actually nodes they also allow you to uh host your own dapps and things of that nature so there's a lot of options especially or individ Theory ecosystem there's a lot of options that you can do with that it's a very impressive platform and it's Advanced user friendly so Advanced users can actually do a lot of modifying uh there's a lot of kind of uh um there's kind of this like uh uh tweaking Community inside of that note where people are able to set things up in a certain way uh you know achieve certain goals and so that's a really cool advantage to being kind of uh this platform is there's places you can go far beyond whatever yourself so uh no software is the best way to decentralized and that is my argument uh and the reason I'm saying that is because no software can encourage anyone to run validators from home you don't have to use a cloud platform if you can easily and simply run validate your notes at home uh it ensures that updates and best practices are being applied so if it says someone wants to run a uh [Music] into you know terminal in order to try to get it all working but they don't know exactly if everything's working properly they don't really understand how everything's working that's actually where no software can come in because it can standardize how things operate uh and ensure that best practices are being deployed when you deployed a node uh when you deploy a validator uh it also simplifies uh client adoption you know ultimately if you have options inside this uh software platforms you can choose you know which clients you want to use uh ultimately that's where software can go and software can make it just really easy for people to uh pick their clients and pick the small ones and the unused ones so uh so what are some challenges to developing no software if that's kind of one of the key ways that we can really encourage people to run at home what are some of the challenges well it requires full stack development skills so we're talking back in the front so you have to be really familiar with the whole backing you have to be able to deploy notes uh understand Docker or uh if you're if you're disappointed directly onto the OS there's a lot that you have to figure out on that side plus you have to worry about the front end so you really it the software has to be uh really a full sack software uh in order to really be able to meet all the requirements to be a good running those software we're also talking about you have to have a deep understanding of no running itself you have to understand the best practices you have to understand what your software needs to look for XYZ uh while also you know right brain you also have to think about the user the creative side of figuring out user experience what will engage users what will make them want to use your software so you really have to have a deep understanding uh but uh I didn't really give an introduction to decentralized Authority what we're doing is we're developing software uh and specifically no software and so uh I wanted to uh talk a little bit about how we can see the no landscape changing with the software with tools like node launcher which is a typescript uh no deployment engine so no launcher is an open source no deployment engine written in typescript that enables the easy creation of no development applications so if someone wants to create a application uh that is for running those what no launcher does is it allows them to start developing an application without needing to understand the back end because it's a full deployment engine it will deploy the nodes in the proper way uh using apis the features those can be deployed and controlled through standard apis you don't have to know how to uh deploy something Docker all the proper Docker configs all this stuff you just simply need to be able to understand a typescript API which typescript is you know amazing for uh application development and you can be Off to the Races to develop your own software uh you are able to programmatically deploy those and upgrade them to validators so one of the and what does programmatically mean here in this case uh like with the other platforms that we showed there's there's there's manual steps that you have to take in the uh in the process you either have to copy a file over here you have to uh you have to say this you have to do you know so there's uh in the process of deploying a node with those other software platforms there's certain processes that require human intervention programmatically means you're able to do this entirely through programs so you can actually have all the elements that would require you know a human to copy this over here to do this over here you can have that all done in a programmatic way so it creates a much more seamless uh user experience and you have way more control over the nodes and how they're configured because it's all programmatically designed you have seamless client updates uh with no launcher if there's a new client we uh uh and it's actually ties in with this point down here we have a client test Suite so I'll kind of tackle these in a scenario that's happened recently where we have a client test Suite where when a new client comes out we're able to test it uh against this library to make sure that nothing breaks inside of this Library uh which no applications can use well uh earlier this year uh the gaffe uh death notes came out with uh a new version that actually Sunset a uh a configuration uh and it wasn't like widely used but it was a configuration in there but it wasn't in the recent so we actually put it through our testing or our test suite and we realized we were getting all these flags we reached out to them like oh yeah they uh uh we're you know sunsetting this you know but it wasn't in the release though so there's there's elements to where you know even on the client side they can just make an update to something not realizing that other people might be using different configurations that would affect that this is where no launcher comes in by uh this can actually eliminate so uh eliminate that attack vector or not necessarily tactic but that slash event where where if there's a problem with death and there's a uh a feature that people are requiring and that's suddenly taken away and it's not realized how widely it's used uh no one should catch that before the upgrade happens so that's the advantage of uh some of thinking thinking uh holistically about the back end of running notes so this is an example of what a simple API could look like so for for application developers this is what you need to allow your application to deploy a ethereum evaluator for the developers out there this is simple this is super simple you're not having to touch Docker you're not having to touch anything on the system the library itself is doing everything for you in the back end with best practices and this is all you have to add to your application so no launcher is it in use yes it is no launcher's been in uh well battle tested through node pilot no pilot is a uh consumer-facing node management software that uh we've been developing we're currently in beta we're hoping to come out with version one uh q1 the next year uh and make it fully open source uh so far thousands of notes and validators have been actually launched through node pilot so it's been heavily used um uh it started off primarily in another network uh pocket network uh which actually serves uh RPC calls to ethereum application so it's really cool uh it's really cool Synergy there but uh so we're talking about like a web application but again it's able to run and then deploy nodes and create a user interface and a user experience that allows more people to have access to note running and it's just a simple application ultimately with node launcher any developer can start creating no deployment applications like node pilot we want to open up this space so that there's Innovation happening on the user side of node uh software because we want more and more users to be attracted to the space and more users can be attracted to the space when we have these kind of uh uh when we have these kind of software that meet different users with where they're at or the features that they're looking for we can see that Innovation start to grow with tools like no launcher using entirely uh only node launcher so we're very excited about that um we were in the middle of refactoring I was talking to the dev yesterday uh he's like well yeah well the first right now uh has some bugs because of refactoring and broken so right now what we currently have on our GitHub is broken but that's the beauty of what we're doing is we're we're building it out uh and we're uh and then once we're ready to make a production ready it's in a uh right now it's in its own dedicated Branch um but once you push the master then anyone could actually use node launcher to create a validators for ethereum uh where you want to add multiple clients uh by the end of the year uh development progress can be followed on our GitHub which is no launcher uh decentralized and we hope to see developers use this tool or use tools like node launcher to create next generation of software where it's super user focused super uh uh super feature Rich so that it can attract more people that wanna you know if they're considering hey should I put my uh should I put my stake in a staking service which I run on my own it's just so simple to run on your own and there's so many options for writing on your own that you don't even need to consider giving your keys and uh putting your trust in someone else foreign conclusion then with everything that uh Maggie uh talked about and then what I'm kind of closing here with uh in conclusion ethereum is designed for optimal decentralization it's really designed to push folks to decentralization by having those large slashing events where if you're part of too large of a group you know using a certain client or on a certain cloud provider you'll start getting slashed there's an issue there it really incentivizes the run at home decentralized kind of ecosystem uh evaluators can protect themselves by potentially uh from potentially large losses by avoiding uh oversaturated Cloud providers AWS 53 it's starting to get to a point where it's at risk if you Deploy on AWS simply because if something happens there even if it just goes offline they have a DNS error you know and something goes offline which happened last year they had entire data centers going down because uh an admin accidentally pushed a patch to their DNS that broke everything um that you know those kind of those kind of simple things could actually affect the entire network so it's becoming a risk to be on these large platforms uh and then use clients with less utilization in the network itself right now if you're using prison or Lighthouse you're in that 40 range uh so if something were to happen to either of those clients you could potentially see uh large losses uh but the good news is there are great options for entry-level users to participate in the ethereum validation I definitely encourage you to go look at those options that are listed on ethereum.org uh when it says uh uh say ethereum and they talk about different options all these options are there because they were open source all three that I mentioned they're really great options there's no reason to not run your own theory note today uh but then kind of looking to the future we are very excited we're very bullish on where no software can go uh and the kind of user experience that could become standard for node software uh and you know we're excited to be working on our side on the uh tooling side whether Cloud's working on the uh infrastructure and Hardware side so really the future is super bright with ethereum validation we want to encourage everyone to run their own ethereum nodes uh on their own so that's uh thanks for joining us I think uh are we doing like a q a uh because we have like 12 minutes do we have 12 minutes amazing okay yeah if folks have any questions about any of this let us know yes yep yeah so uh so specifically so I'm not a developer so how exactly no launchers uh or yeah no launcher is dealing with Secrets uh yes what we what we do have is the uh RPC password for those nodes are actually being stored in memory so there are elements that are being stored in memory uh with node launcher so they're not in playing text uh now we're still developing ethereum and figuring out how are we going to handle all the you know handle everything handle all the secrets but we're building into node launcher ways to protect uh from having um uh from having you know plain text uh anything on your server because we feel like that that's where no software should go to where uh there's a lot of security around how your uh what's being stored on your server and how it's being stored um and so usually utilizing something like memory is one way that you can put the uh password inside thank you very much this was really useful uh so two questions one uh the only thing stopping me from running a note at home I mean like locally is that I don't have a good connection I live in a very remote area so uh perhaps I don't know update on the best like uh set up for that and the second question is if I don't have 32 years and I want to own something at home is there an option so uh so first one if you have bad internet so how penalties work in ethereal for being lazy right this is either you're offline or you're not keeping up or something of that nature the uh that's considered a penalty so what a penalty can be is it can either be a reduced in rewards that you receive or it could actually be uh where what you would have gotten if you were uh operating optimally is deducted so you're slashed very small amounts so say you're uh so in a day you know maybe your internet goes out for 30 minutes or something like that you're deducted what profit you would have made in that 30 minutes so you lose out on that those 30 minutes of reward but then it essentially is almost like you lost an hour right other words because it's you know it's deducted right so so that's where you can kind of gauge you know you might not be as profitable even if you're in a a an area where your internet kind of cuts in and out or something like that you just need to kind of gauge what that might look like and maybe it's worth running a validator on uh one of the test networks to kind of see what the performance is like to see okay would this be profitable would this be worth going um but then uh there are you know Solutions and uh I'll mentioned through Cloud that are putting uh putting a lot of work into getting servers and getting Hardware into different parts of the world into different regions uh that are kind of outside of the you know Cloud gigs so that if you really do have bad internet there there will be options where you can deploy you know to uh to Hardware providers that aren't tied to that same like Cloud cluster that we were talking about earlier your questions oh and if you don't have 32 weeks so if you don't have your 32 8 that's uh you are you can still run notes you can still run notes you won't get any rewards for them um but uh uh you you can you know there are other staking uh cooling options like rocket pool is a good one also if you have friends that trust you then maybe you can aggregate some people do aggregate amongst uh groups of friends who may not have uh enough eth and then you know add a little point of trust but it's a it's an option uh yes sir that would be the case I would say if if no software was maintained seriously so with no software people could minimize a lot of uh cost uh and and also minimize certain risks by just running it at home so while yes you know you could have you know large providers like AWS you know it really comes down to you know six providers as you mentioned right six providers um sure you can go that way and send money each month or you can have an old laptop running uh where you're keeping all the rewards and you don't have that that overhead and it's that simple to run uh that so I think you're right in terms of just what tends to happen in these kind of ecosystems but uh but I think because of the way that that theory is approach's sake where they intentionally put in mechanisms to incentivize more and more decentralization I think the market will um uh will will match that right and I believe there are going to be a lot of options for node software in the future uh there's already three great ones out there uh we're building one ourselves and we're building tools that allow more people to build them so I think the future is really bright with that um so that's my thought um may I ask if uh no uh launcher is capable to integrate the DVD no deployment DVD foreign [Music] so it's very adaptable it can apply to any parts of the node any parts of any container one of the things we're building right now is the ability to deploy multiple containers so there's some like polygon that uh require multiple containers right in order to run their node it's actually multiple notes uh so we're building in that ability to have all those nodes all orchestrated and working together uh without needing to do it manually because it's all handled through the engine itself thank you so uh there are uh so on ethereum.org there's all that information so I definitely check it out there uh from what I remember from looking at it last night is uh they recommend uh kind of on the low side or on the recommended side was a uh i7 4470 which is like a 15 year old processor so so yeah and I said it for like 15 years ago or something so anyways yeah ethereum is very well equipped for uh minimal uh Hardware requirements unlike a lot of other networks out there no you're just on the server itself needs to have those requirements um which are very minimal uh and then their application I believe you can just run on any computer that's running either Windows Linux or uh uh uh apple or Mac so got two minutes yeah [Music] increase your profit on YouTube by earning like the big clients [Music] absolutely like so we don't have to integrate right now I was actually just talking about yesterday about it um we don't have it integrated now but it's literally service that you run alongside your ethereum validation so it's a container yes we can absolutely and then that's what no launcher does makes running containers super easy and able to do it in a programmatic way to where it all automatically connects so yes absolutely possible um [Laughter] [Applause] um I've been uh running with my own Hardware um I wanted to get like a recommendation on like uh pretty complicated like uh you mentioned like the resources from the ethereum foundation then they they point to our random guys uh medium post and another random guys medium post which is uh not updated or how do I know if it's update or not um and good luck if you want to run any that are not like gas and like a typical condition of prisoners right like the recommendation for anything that's not like the main ones are existent so um first question is there a source of Truth in documentation which I can follow like uh to set up my own Hardware we do Bluetooth server and like go through it I mean I'm no not no machine or anything but like I can yeah is uh it is the best place to uh official ethereum documentation from the ethereum foundation is the probably the best uh but also it also depends on the client that you're using so different clients do have different Hardware requirements from my understanding each client uh in their documentations specifically State what their Hardware requirements are so I would actually look at the documentation for the client and see what the requirements are for that uh for that now the one thing you do need to be aware of is Maggie mentioned you have to run a execution client you have to run a beacon client uh and you have to run a validator which is really just a consensus client that's only job is to be a validator so you have to run three different clients uh so even though maybe the um the the one client has certain Hardware requirements you have to also look at what other clients are going to be using and then you have to you know bring it all together so I would say go to the client's documentation figure out which each one is after you decide what you want your makeup to be and you know use the information that Maggie gave you in terms of uh the usage on where uh how how utilized certain clients are to make your decision cool and uh just one I don't want to put you in an adult spot right but um for the sake of decentralization easy um I'm better off like uh going into well I don't think I could go to Dominos because I'm running my own Hardware but like uh using something like ethereum or uh ethereum.org they actually do give uh in talking about these different options they do list out uh different features or different elements to them where like some of them have been audited right some haven't right so you could actually potentially use that as a way to gauge but um you know most of the time with something like uh yeah you know with stuff like uh both that node and uh cerium you know their your those aren't things that are exposed to the public right so the application is just sitting on your computer so if your computer would be hacked this is how serious so there's going to be risk no matter what options you use but uh yeah there is some information on the ethereum network uh thank you so much um thank you everyone for being here so early in the morning as I mentioned on lastded.com you can follow us to stay up to date on what's going on with no launcher and if you're a protocol uh looking for uh no software or even Hardware infrastructure want to decentralize you should contact us because that's what we care about what we like to do so thank you so much [Applause]
