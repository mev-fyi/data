[Music] hey happy Halloween everybody and welcome to Def Con 2018 Prague Edition is everybody good y'all get some little little you get some breakfast get some little sandwiches with the crusts cut off like mom used to do we are really excited that you're here this is super insane this stage is very large and we have a really fun morning planned for you and I'm your host my name is Jonathan Mann and I'm a songwriter and I write a song a day and one of the things I do in that capacity as the song a day guy as I'm sometimes called as I make songs for conferences like this one very often these songs that I do these conferences are in industries that I kind of don't really know anything about or frankly no offense to them but like care about like you know speech-language pathology and home health care and carpet salesman and things of this nature but that's not the case today and I'm really excited to tell you about that and why that is but first I'm gonna introduce myself a little bit like I said my name is Jonathan Mann I'm a songwriter my favorite food is pizza yeah pizza let's hear it for pizza my favorite color is purple as is evidenced by this song that I wrote one time called all my shirts are purple [Music] you get the idea goes out like this in a while so my parents are both psychologists which is maybe not surprising but um this is them exactly four years ago and Halloween four years ago they were Freud my dad was Freud and my mom had a little sign on her that said slip come on my parents they're done but I love them this is my family I live with my family my wife and my two kids in Jersey City writes out of New York a little bit of history about me in the mid-2000s I was writing and performing a rock opera based on the Super Mario Brothers around Los Angeles indeed thank you and a little while after that I was making early YouTube videos as game Jew and games you went around and sang songs about video games and interviewed people about video games and games use two biggest achievements were waiting 36 hours in line to be the first person to get a Wii on the west coast yeah I did that rather he did that and I tracked him down some might say stocked which I think is a little strong but I tracked down Shigeru Miyamoto creator of Mario Donkey Kong and Zelda and every game that you love you guys know who Shigeru Miyamoto is I wrote him a song I tracked him down some might say stocked and I sang it to him in a hallway and he was very gracious so that was my biggest achievement as as games you by far thank you so in late 2008 almost exactly 10 years ago you know I just looked it up today is actually the tenth anniversary today of the Bitcoin white paper October 31st how could how auspicious is that so right around that time I was living this is around that time I was living in Berkeley California and I was unemployed it was the height of the financial crash I was sort of done with game jus once you seem to be a Moto it's like where else you gonna go frankly and so I was looking for a new project and I decided that starting in January I was gonna write a song a day 31 songs 31 days January post in the YouTube that was gonna be my next project so I did that I did 31 days and it was going pretty well so I decided to try for a year and all of 2009 came and went and I decided to just keep going and going and going and that is how I stand before you now having written three thousand five hundred and ninety one songs in as many days thank you very much I'm in the Guinness Book of World Records this is true they made a new category for me called most consecutive days writing a song didn't exist before I did it and as long as I keep going and no one's no one yeah as long as I keep going I think I'm gonna hold it for a while because someone would have had to start younger what ya longest chain exactly longest chain unbroken chain it's exactly right one of the animating theories behind song 'days called 70-20-10 and this applies to any creative endeavor including the things that you all do in this room which is 70% of everything you make is going to be mediocre 20% is going to be bad shitty throw it out and 10% is gonna be great so the more songs I write the more songs end up in that 10% category that's my theory anyway about a year ago I was at a conference in the backwoods of Canada Northern Ontario was very cold I was singing in front of a lake and one of the tracks at this conference was cryptocurrency you all remember what was happening this time last year things were going a little little crazy little nuts my impression of the whole situation was bit you know gave me the heebie-jeebies the finance bros frankly and the you know Lambos and the speculation so i was like yeah whatever out of the woods came walking this etherion magician he was not called that at the time but that's what he was and he took me under his wing and this is a true story he showed me crypto Punk's and blew my mind I got really excited by this thing that someone had built on the blockchain that was fun and interesting and unique and weird and I loved it this etherion magician gave me $40 in ether and said go play with this and I spent many long hours on telegram with him saying things like okay like what so what's gas and what am I being asked to accept / reject here and did it work did that go through I'm really confused by all these things that are popping up at many screen and yelling at me in meta mask sorry madam asked but that was my experience but I bought my first crypto Punk his name is lucky dan and I fell completely down the rabbit hole I became obsessed with the idea of digital scarcity I became obsessed with the idea of like what gives things value I have my I've been working for the last year on my own NFT project based on crypto Punk's where I'm tokenizing every single song from song a day and releasing them as a one of one collectible I started a podcast yes a podcast big surprise called digitally rare about digital scarcity and two weeks ago I was at the NFT summit in San Francisco where I met aya me Iguchi who you hear from in just a minute and she invited me to come here and make a song for you all and so that's uh that's what I've done thank you go clap yet you haven't heard the song alright okay so this is the song this is the official Def Con 2018 prog edition theme song this is the chorus we're gonna learn the chorus we're all gonna sing it together I'll sing it first to teach you and then you guys are all gonna sing it with me and then and then I'm gonna bring aya up on stage and she's gonna talk and Vitalik sing and talk there should be a bunch of talks and then I'll be back at the end of this morning session to recap everything that we just heard in the talks along with this chorus so the chorus goes like this so that's it that's the chorus thank you thank you so now let's just sing in a couple times let's just get it into our brains let's let's let's get that in there I didn't put the bu IDL part the word part where I repeat that because it's just spelling it out which I figured you guys can handle so let's work on it so here we go why the B
