okay we have a very rough agenda that i've posted in the community called channel feel free to follow along and with that we'll start with the recording here hi everyone welcome to the january epidium dark community call and we can start with a quick round of introductions then we'll highlight some of our community contributions we'll discuss what's on our q1 roadmap after that there might be apple app so stick around for that and local spend a bit of time talking about our translation program and we'll answer questions from the community so as far as intros go i can start i'm joshua from glasgow in scotland i'm the community leader for ethereum.org feel free to ping me with any ideas or feedback you have for the community or if you're interested in finding ways to contribute to feeding dark and i'll pass it to paul hey everyone this is paul um wackerow i am a front-end dev here on the aetherium.org team located on the west coast in oregon i will pass along to corwin hey everyone i'm corwin or corwin teens um i'm a web developer on this year.org team as well and i live in calgary canada um and yeah if you have any questions about contributing to the code base feel free to reach out i'll pass it to lucca i am working on the translation program for ethereum.org handling the translation stuff um yeah based in slovenia central europe i guess with that i'll pass it on to sam hey guys good morning good afternoon good evening uh yeah my name is sam or samajamman on discord or github um thank you all for joining excited to excited to be here for another community call um so yeah i'm a i'm a developer as well as the team lead here at ethereum.org and i'm based in in lake tahoe california i'll pass it over to pablo hello guys hello everyone my name is pablo petinari i'm from buenos aires argentina and yeah as well i'm working for the ethereum.org team and i'm a front-end developer i pass it back to josh awesome yeah i think that's everyone um yeah and once again please if you aren't speaking make sure you're mixed meetings um one thing before we start this call we always like to clarify is this is the community call for ephedium.org the website and obviously not a community call that represents the ethereum network or the protocol directly we have set up a slider for this call which allows anyone to ask any questions they may have for the team if someone from the team could help me out and just post that again in the community called chat if you've got any questions you can be completely anonymous so please do drop them in and as much as possible we try to keep the conversation around the feedium.org itself um just different ways and helping to push the ecosystem forward if you've got any other questions feel free to ask them and we'll do our best to answer okay moving on to community contribution highlights um yes so as i'm sure you're all aware ephedian.org is an open source project if there's anything on our roadmap or even if it's not on a roadmap that you'd like to contribute you can get in touch a lot of the really high value work on ethereum.org involves community members taking the initiative on something that they feel really passionate about um so i am sharing my screen uh the first thing we'd like to highlight was the work done by joseph i think i've seen him here on this call on our energy consumption page and so yeah the page itself is just a markdown file so it's all text we're looking to create a new template for that with our impending design higher on the road map digress a little um but the content itself is just awesome it explains the um the overall goals of the theorem in terms of energy consumption the sort of why if em's energy consumption is currently so high and why burning energy for the feeding was necessary it also prevents the the current solutions to this problem backs up with hard numbers and highlights like the timeline of the marriage and things like that for solving this um and ends on a nice i guess optimistic note about our hopefully solar punk future uh the thing i really like about this and if you haven't seen it already you should check it out um as there assumes very little knowledge about aetherium itself as a protocol so if someone who doesn't know what they're talking about says you shouldn't use ethereum because it's really harmful to the planet then you can just drop them this link and i guess set the ground work for a meaningful conversation on the problem itself one thing we did want to highlight is that we did drop the ball in this a little bit with the timeline it just took us to actually get in it was originally proposed in august it took us until december to actually get it live um one thing we did was reflect on this and as a result outside of the work that we're doing with our our road map and our goals that we've set we've also committed to allowing no prs are made by the community and to be open for more than one month so hopefully we can do a bit better in the future and i guess that's all i've got to say on that and i think luca wanted to chat a little bit about the work done on our translation certificate so i'll pass it over to him real quick one one fun fact i wanted to add on the energy consumption page just to give some some data behind it that yeah like i mean we launched the page just over a month ago it's already received 10 000 page views and gets you know a couple hundred page views every day so really good to see like the kind of impact that a community member can make um just by contributing content and i think it shows you know the reach ethereum.org has obviously in terms of just like trying to provide a credible source of information for the community um so excited to see it um you know continue to be referenced elsewhere as well as as something to point to um yeah so moving on another major contribution that we want to highlight is the translator certificate that we introduced at the start of this year i've just posted a link link in the community called chat this was designed by scott an amazing developer who has been very active on ethereum.org he previously designed a lot of our po-apps uh suggested the designs for our community hub revamp you can find them on our discord as scot1up so if you're looking to get some design work done he might be exactly who you're looking for thanks for the great work on this scott we really do appreciate it um a couple of words on the translator certificate itself this is our latest effort to acknowledge our translators and support them in any way possible the requirements for the certificate are a bit more strict than other acknowledgements we have since this is somewhat more professional and we want to ensure we're issuing it to active translators providing high quality translations the translators can use this as a reference if they are professional translators or want to start translating professionally it can also serve as a basis to add another field of expertise to their translator portfolio something like that for contributors who aren't professional translators they can use this to show their active involvement in this space and showcase their dedication to ethereum um anyone else can just print this out and put it on their wall or whatever they want to do with it but yeah we are happy we are able to acknowledge our translators in more positive ways that can help impact their currencies this is the coin the community this is one of their people everyone please make sure you are muted once again um yeah and just to add to what luca was saying um i'm shooting my screen just now if you want to check it out definitely caused a lot of jealousy in the team for the people who aren't bilingual and can't actually get this um so yeah if you're interested in that please do check it out so once again thanks to yeah once again thanks to joseph uh thanks to scott further contributions and just helping to make ethereum dark just a little bit better yeah so moving on to our q1 roadmap so it's the start of the year which means we've decided what we want to be working on for the next three months and we'd like to just spend a few minutes chatting about specific roadmap items so first up we've got paul who's going to speak a lot about our about our run a node epic sure we're doing one second if i can share my screen is that okay um so i know one of the previous community call we had had a chat about one of the upcoming endeavors was to form a more user-friendly page to discuss running a note trying to bring it down to the level where you're potentially getting people have never considered it have no idea what is involved in it or may have previously thought that the only way to do this was through a command line or required expensive machinery so this is still in a preview mode right now and there's still going to be some changes to it but i can just quickly walk you through the idea here um this page is like i said it's it's more geared towards a little bit of what it actually means to run a node um and then kind of scroll through and give some emphasis to who which is really anyone um and that's kind of the point of this page is to emphasize that anybody who's part of this network can and should consider running a node i mean it is actually relatively easy nowadays um for why run a node we got some different cards here and some different things that people can go through and read a little bit more on um right now um this will change a little bit in the order when it finally goes live but the idea here is that we're gonna have two different paths for people to pick from you can either go down the build your own path or you can buy this thing fully loaded there's a couple different services that exist right now dapnode and novato that are both supply hardware that comes pre-loaded with with software that'll essentially make it an app like experience a you know kind of a point click and can literally control it from your mobile phone um and you can manage your apps that's not staking and using smaller you know lighter weight computers in here as well in some some context as far as kind of how far we've come we used to be pretty much all command line based if you wanted to run a run a client and now we have some better options so hopefully some people will be able to check this out and and maybe reconsider the idea of running a node in the future obviously there's still a lot of nodes out there but the more the better um i would encourage everyone to check it out once it's live awesome thank you paul um yeah and i'll remind everyone as we're going through this that we do have the slido so if you have any specific questions about anything we cover please do pop them in there and try and get to them at the end [Music] sorry about that yeah so next up i think um corwin wants to speak a little bit about the work he's been doing on the the youth 2.0 rebounds so i should have made myself um sorry about that i'm yeah i'd like to talk about the e2 rebrand that we're doing on ethereum.org this has been a pretty um high priority work item for the start of this quarter it's used um or rather it's touched every aspect of our website from the translation program to what our developers are working on just content to um trying to rebrand away from the eth2 eth1 references for ethereum part of the reason we want to do this and the main reason is because eth2 has been kind of deprecated as a as a term for ethereum originally this was referring to the proof of stake chain um in an old road map for that transition and has since changed with the merge to be uh referred to as the consensus client and then eth1 um formerly eth1 is now referred to as execution client um and with this change we've gone through the website ethereum.org to to reflect these changes in the naming so if you go today and you look at the website you'll still see ethereum 2.0 we have a release coming out that was just put up for version 3.7 on the website um so today we'll be putting this release out and this changes from ethereum 2.0 to ethereum upgrades and within this um change you won't see any references to eth one or e2 without them being like what happened to e2 type of thing and we'll go in and explain eth1 is now the execution client on the handles yeah the transactions the data whereas e2 is now the consensus client um so we're trying to move away as a community from referring to these two clients as eth1 and eth2 mostly um to have an accuracy accurate representation of what's going on with the actual roadmap but also to try and move away from kind of an attack vector for scams so if you ever see someone come in to a discord channel or someplace where you might find scammers being prominent if you ever see someone being like oh you need to switch your ether for e2 to work on the proof of stake chain or on the e2 chain um there is no e2 you want to make clear there's no eth2 and if you see any um malicious activity like that try and call it out and um make sure that people aren't getting hurt in this kind of like attack vector of confusion with the term of these two but with that all being said we have a change with this roadmap to the upgrades um so every page now you'll find um whether it's the beacon chain the merge shard chains the vision um all pages that used to be under eth2 will now be just housed under upgrades this also will allow us to as the road map um develops we can just throw it under the upgrades bucket of the website instead of trying to have to find a new section for this um so it helps us avoid scope creep in our drop downs as well which is is going to be great um yeah pass it back to josh here nice thank you corwin and i'll just reiterate that yes although the the naming of ethereum 2.0 or ef2 or whatever you want to call it is being phased out this doesn't change the actual ephedium roadmap at all so don't freak out in that sense everything's still staying the same apart from we're just using a different name to hopefully be a little bit more accurate right i'll reiterate that as well just make sure it's very clear that this doesn't change the road map overall it is more just the naming change and the goal is more for clarity um i think there's a lot of confusion over the eth one and two names being sequential like one is after the other and replaces the other which isn't quite accurate over time each one has been used to refer to more the main that we're used to and eth2 has been used to refer to this other currently you know proof of stake beacon chain and in the end these are going to be merged together to replace the current consensus model for our current main net um so they're not it's not one leads to the next and when eth2 there is no one upgrade that leads to quote-unquote too it's a whole series of upgrades that are being rolled out over over time obviously to handle the scaling problems and other issues that we have with the network so hopefully this helps clear things up where we have two different layers execution consensus and they will soon be merged into one network all right thanks paul um yeah so i'm going to share my screen again if you'd like to follow along um the last item that i'd like to chat about is creating a web free explainer page on ethereum.org and so this is a little bit earlier than the other two items we've just shown so we don't have anything nice and pretty to show you just yet uh one interesting thing to look at on our roadmap is this chart pretty steady for the last two years then october of last year the search volume for web3 just absolutely skyrocket so people are clearly motivated to learn about this and the problem that we've noticed is that when you search for what is web free you largely get uh you'll actually get a bunch of articles uh some of them are well written most of them aren't well written a few of them are just completely wrong um so maybe a controversial opinion but i don't really think so i don't really believe that we want journalists who aren't really involved in web3 and probably don't know what it is explaining web free to people who are clearly interested in maybe taking a bit further we've just had the holiday season i'm sure many of you were saturn tables with family members who might have known about your interest in crypto if they did i'm sure you got hammered with different questions about what is web free what is this decentralization and magic internet money the whole idea of this page is to answer that question for people a sort of gentle introduction for non-technical individuals without all the buzzwords that you'd normally find in this sort of thing um yeah and as always um because all of the items on our roadmap are on the site they're all open source so if you have comments feedbacks or are interested in helping out in any way please do ping us and discord or leave a comment on the issue itself anything else anyone wants to add on the roadmap before we move on cool next up perhaps yeah so i'm sharing my screen um on it and on the agenda itself there are some instructions for how to actually claim your so i just put the passcode onto the screen share if you're interested in grabbing it it's all lowercase all one word january community to claim it you need to go to our discord server and in the top right you'll find the pull up bot just send a message to the poet bot with the passcode once again that's january community all lowercase all one word um and if you click on the link that the bot sends you then you should be able to claim it to your wall address and we'll just wait a minute or so just to let everyone do that before we jump onto something else just what we've got this moment i just like to ask to make sure that you are muted if you aren't speaking otherwise when we get to the questions you'll be muted at the server level and you won't be able to speak up okay so let's give it another minute or so just after this our um translation lead luca is just going to speak a little bit about the different translation efforts across the project just now so i'll stop sharing my screen and pass over to you so i guess we might as well just get into it um as people are claiming their co-apps so the translation program as many of you probably know is an effort to get the website translated into as many languages as possible and make this content accessible to people who might not speak english at all or not speak english well enough to be able to learn in english especially about a complicated topic such as ethereum um one thing that i wanted to highlight today is the recent update to source content in crowding and the new pages that we've uploaded to crowding so i've just pasted the link to the content versions page on the website where you can find more information about how we divide our content into different content buckets and what that what what each content bucket contains let me just share my screen and show you in practice what that looks like so we've recently updated a lot of source content in crowdin we do this occasionally in order to make sure we're actually translating the latest version of the website moving forward we plan on updating source content every month we have also uploaded new pages to crowdin these are the pages that have been recently added to the website and aren't being translated yet examples of this contain the community hub the energy consumption page the ethereum support page security and scan prevention page basically just the recent pages that have been added to the website similarly we have added all the recently added developer tutorials to crowdin that weren't being translated yet this includes some of the most popular developer tutorials on the website like the nfp tutorial series similarly to the updates we will also be uploading new pages to crowdin every month to make sure we're translating all the new content on the website and finally we have created some new content buckets which will allow us to get translated content reviewed and added to the website even faster so this includes a specific content bucket for ethereum upgrades that you can see here a specific content bucket for the community pages and also have divided the developer tutorials into different buckets based on their popularity based on the number of page views that these tutorials get so this will also allow us to add translated developer tutorials that are high impact that have a high volume of traffic to the website faster now as corwin presented earlier we are also currently working on the e3 brand and moving away from using e2 terminology once this is done we will need to get the updated content translated as well in order to remove mentions of e2 from the translations this means that the ethereum upgrades bucket so this is content bucket number four for anyone watching my stream or activating crowding um this upgrades bucket will be updated again in crowding next week with the new content not containing mentions of eth2 and we would definitely appreciate some assistance in getting this bucket translated as soon as possible so there also be um other notifications and we will highlight this and point it out to the community and for the time being this content bucket will probably be highest priority to get translated so that we can also move away from the e2 terminology in the translations as well so yeah that's pretty much what i wanted to highlight about the translation program great thanks luca and thanks to all the translators involved in that work as well and i'm going to share my screen again cool so for the remainder of the call we'll spend that on cuny and we have a list here ready to go courtesy of our slidell but feel free to add more as we go or if you want to you can unmute speak up i guess we can just start with the most upvoted so yeah if you go through the list and you see something that you really want answered the likelihood is we won't get to absolutely everything so make sure you upload the questions that you want to see answered the most um top voted comment is from anonymous asking that saying hi i want to contribute but i am not a coder anything else i can do and contribute to um yes if you're bilingual please get in touch with us on discord and join the translation program if you understand ethereum well then find areas that we don't have content for on our site and make suggestions or write the content yourself or if you're just learning about ethereum i guess you can highlight any simple mistakes you might find on the site that's really helpful or perhaps you see something that's too complex call it out or maybe try rephrasing it yourself to make it simpler for the next person you can do that too um anything i missed anyone yeah i would broadly just say i mean from a content perspective like it's hard to understate how valuable that is um even if you don't code to help keep the website up to date as you folks are all probably aware like ethereum as an ecosystem just moves incredibly fast right so like as ethereum.org continues to add new content for instance you know we highlighted this energy consumption page we now have hundreds of pages of content in english on the website which then gets translated into tens of languages to create thousands of pages on the website right like just making sure that resources are up to date that we're linking to accurate information that we're removing stale information it may not sound sexy but can be a very helpful way for you to kind of i mean keep tabs on the ecosystem and keep yourself up to date but also be able to you know help out the millions of people who are reading this content um and helping ensure stuff stays up to date is like just a huge way to do that so in the community chat i i link to our main contributing page from there there's a lot of detailed information whether it's adding products or community articles or you know new exchanges that might provide additional features adding glossary terms i i feel like glossary terms are a nice easy one and in the sense that with the translation program luca talked about one thing we're really trying to do with ethereum.org is like become a canonical resource for web3 related translations all the content on ethereum.org is licensed under creative commons we want other projects to be able to use the translations that our community has put together to just make the entire ecosystem more accessible to more people from more languages overall right so like even if you only speak english there's open issues on github to add additional glossary terms um and add additional content that i think can have a huge impact across the ecosystem and it's a great way to you know build your resume and get noticed in the space as someone who's contributing to open source yeah thanks um i would disagree on one thing i think fixing tables is definitely sexy and if you find any please do open an issue or a pr for it um next up we've got jay cook i think joseph i've seen you on the call um hey joseph so just grow up in the dubai yeah sorry about that yeah so joseph says roadmap's great um l2s to encourage adoption it's critical to explain why l2 over alternative layer ones a nuance over which l2 and why ideas to do this most effectively this is on our roadmap i guess and we're building a layer two page i am very conscious that i'm talking a lot here if anyone wants to jump in and speak to this maybe in on this one sure um yeah no thanks jay cook for posting this i definitely agree um there is a big difference obviously between layer twos and alternative layer ones um and we do look forward to highlighting that soon we've talked about the e2 rebrand a couple times now part of that change is going to be the slash eth2 page on our website is now going to be slash upgrades which is going to broaden what it would actually make sense to go in that section um for example potential eips and potentially layer 2 scaling solutions because there's more to the upgrades than just the protocol upgrades that were focused on scaling which was kind of the original bucket of eth2 so as that broad ends out i think that would be a nice home for that we've discussed this a little bit internally i'd like to bring some content about twos to that page but also discuss potentially having a dedicated layer to page and and have this be something that's more beginner-friendly and user-friendly something you know that's not buried in the development dot many people are you know lay users are likely to miss i want to use that as an opportunity to help educate and and explain kind of what you're talking about here jay cook for differences won't necessarily go into all those differences now but but you know briefly uh they rely on ethereum security essentially you can do a lot of things with l2s uh that keep the trust model of ethereum at its core and you don't need to rely on a whole different distributed network or hopefully distributed network uh for the security of your funds and activities so definitely on on the list i do agree that bringing more education around this stuff is pretty important and we're going to try to do that through the expansion of the upgrades page yeah and i think some things to note that we would be adding is like we'll obviously be talking about l2s what they are um kind of like you were asking here but we'll also be talking about um bridging um so when you want to bring your assets over from mainnet or exchange we'll highlight some bridges that you would use we'll go into kind of like what bridge bridges are so we can clarify that because that's definitely an important piece to l2s at least to like understand how to get on to them at the very least um so we'll highlight some information around that um we'll also add some information around like uh resources for finding like token lists for let's say you're using a decentralized exchange looking at a little bit of a like list on that page to make um make it easier for users to use l2 as well and we'll probably link up to some pages like arbitrary portal which highlights applications that are on their l2s already so try and make it as accessible for someone new to see what's going on in l2 how to get on l2 and quickly understand what it is versus kind of what's in our developer docs which is more of like a technical description of what l2s are thanks corwin thanks paul um joseph if you're still with us um i know you're very into this stuff and you've probably put some thought into before the question so if you've got any thoughts or ideas feel free to share them now or yeah okay thank you um hello yeah um yeah well i mean that's great to hear everything you just said that really the question just came to my mind when i was looking through the road map because it looked like what was there under l2 was mostly practical instructions for how to how to onboard and i just think even now uh even fairly technical minded people that are already well into ethereum it's easy to get confused about the firstly why you would use layer two um if it's just cheap transactions why you would use l2 over just going onto another chain where the transactions are as cheap or possibly cheaper and also which l2 to use and you know you might spend a bunch of gas moving some funds over from layer 1 onto layer two and then normally you know what to do once you've got there you know so it just seems like um ethereum.org is is kind of a lot of people's gateway onto the whole ethereum ecosystem and if we can you know optimize for explaining some of those things and why it's important to inherit security down from ethereum layer 1 and you know even going into the multi-chain versus cross-chain arguments from vitalik's post about why you might want to keep your keep your funds on an ethereum uh you know inside the ethereum ecosystem rather than going to another chain might just be really useful for encouraging more adoption but i i mean i guess that's just a background to the question you've kind of already answered it in your arm system i appreciate that thank you that's great yeah i appreciate that and definitely you know vitalik's discussion on this recently is definitely worth noting and we'll definitely go into you know how we frame the page in the future appreciate it yeah i definitely appreciate the feedback there and completely agree you know i think similar to what paul just demonstrated with like the run a node page that we'll be releasing soon right like it's critical to explain the why in addition to the what and the how and i think that's exactly what you're getting at of like what are the specific benefits outside of just transaction fees that layer two provides um and yeah if you folks do have ideas like we're happy to collaborate and we'll definitely continue to seek feedback as we as we iterate on that page um but clearly that's a key component of it right like if there is an outage on this network can you recover your funds or are you completely reliant on whoever is operating that network important considerations when when bridging your funds to to anywhere else than layer one ethereum okay thanks very much joseph um i guess we'll move on to the next question sean um what are you all most excited about in 2022 i like this question um sean are you with us on the call maybe no uh maybe we could do a quick round-robin with the team um it's not very clear if you're talking about aetherium or just generally so i guess i'll answer both um really excited for the mayor's this year the adoption of l2s real world really excited to go on vacation overseas um for the first time in a while with my son um pass it to paul let's see yeah i'll try to keep it brief too uh i'll second the events irl and real life events all year long um and i'm just putting that out there in general i'll drop our events page in the community culture check them out because there's a lot of them this year that are already planned there's more beyond just this which we you know are continuously trying to update this page to keep it accurate but a lot of events all over the world this year i plan to go to to a handful of them obviously not all but i'd encourage everyone to check these because this is one of the especially if you're interested in getting involved in the community this question has already been floated these events can be excellent ways to go get your face out there go see other people in person who are working in space you're going to just people exude enthusiasm at these events so if you haven't been to one yet i would definitely consider checking one of them out um if there's one nearby and you can't get tickets really really fun events and i would definitely encourage everyone to check it out that means that also the merge definitely said about that through adoption and watching the ever continuing expansion of dao's in this space that's what i'm excited about pass it on let's go corwin what you got um i think for myself most specifically what i'm excited about this year is um l2 and bridging i think we are just starting to see player twos come online um and more specifically like generalized l2 is kind of like arbitrarium where you can deploy your smart contracts on there but i'm also curious to see what happens with more application specific l2s as well i think we'll see some cool stuff like the reddit um i think reddit's partnered with arbitrum i believe but kind of seeing what some larger applications are going to be doing with layer 2 technology on ethereum um appears to see where some mainstream adoption of ethereum goes this year we just saw that twitter this week put out twitter blue or their nft support in twitter blue the very least um and so i'm kind of curious to see where this goes with mainstream uh companies this year um especially as we've seen ethereum settle more um more value than like the visa network for example in 2021 what type of things are other companies can experiment with on ethereum so that's kind of what i'm excited just to see what type of adoption gets used this year with layer twos coming online and and making it a little more accessible for people um pass it on to pablo i guess okay um yeah for this year i would say of course the demarch and yeah i agree with corwin i i would like to see more adoption on layer twos i want to see how the applications evolve in in arbitrary or optimism i yeah i'm looking forward to that and yeah talking more about the site the ethereum network site i would say i would like to see if we could make more web 3 features on the site and yeah make that transition i don't know if if that is going to be possible this year but yeah i i would like to to do that and okay i pass it to lucca so excited about a couple of things first of all the merge it's been in the works for a while looks like this is gonna be the year that is gonna be super exciting and i'm also like the guys have already mentioned very excited about layer twos specifically the improvements that they are making and will continue to make the year has started off incredible um optimism just on boarded curve avi governance has voted to deploy ave on optimism they've had two 30 percent fee reductions in the last two weeks alone um the arbitrary ecosystem is already large and keeps on expanding uh darknet just came out with a massive upgrade this week that and they basically contain all the functionality you would expect from a production ready blockchain dk sync is making improvements and is ready to onboard more people so yeah the the zk roll ups in particular are looking like they're making progress and i feel like this year so many more people are gonna get onboarded to their twos and experience what it is to use ethereum with instant confirmations and super low fees and i feel like most people will be surprised by how amazing layer twos can be and will stay there forever basically that's what i'm excited about and with that i guess pass it along to stem yeah thanks guys um i mean all i guess just echo what everyone mentioned i think a lot of great points um i'd second paul's point in particular i think if folks on the call have never been able to attend like a real life ethereum event i know it is like a fortunate privilege to be able to do so but i would highly recommend it just like the friendly community the the contagious energy the atmosphere um it's a lot of what pulled me into the space and keeps me around um so i know i'll be at yeah eat denver in less than a month um if anyone's gonna be there yeah feel free to reach out would love to connect um and i'll post a link specifically devcon which you know we haven't had an event since uh devcon osaka in japan in 2019 that's essentially the annual primary conference that the ethereum foundation puts on every year and i would say is seen as somewhat of the main event in the ethereum world each year and that'll be in bogota colombia later this year so pretty stoked for that hope folks can make it i know a lot of moving pieces with with events this year um otherwise you know plenty of virtual virtual based metaverse conferences to to potentially try out but yeah highly encourage people um to get involved with those and can be a great way to you know connect with people find new jobs find interesting opportunities um so i think worthwhile if you can make it happen yeah i'll plus one that um i just want to make maybe a second just to make some space in case anyone on the call wants to unmute and ask a question and feel free to do so if not we can just move on to other questions but again you don't have to feel shy cool we'll move on um we've got another question from anonymous asking how do we stop the scammers from ruining crypto as education that only answer i think so uh education and time i guess we already have the page on a security page on ethereum.org um is there more we could do to help with this problem probably i also think that over time as more people start to understand the pitfalls of crypto and things will get better as well this happens with every evolution of money if you're interested in diving into that rabbit hole a little bit i'd really recommend everything that robert breedlove has written on his blog um i'll post a link in the chat to that anyone else have any thoughts on this yeah i agree i think uh i think education is gonna be a big part of it however i don't think it'll ever just fully go away i mean there's there's scams that are littered throughout our world in different forms where there's the opportunity to take advantage of people for economic gain people are going to try i mean it's going to be a combination of education as things scored captures and blockers things that you know fortunately have to put people through to try to clean up these these social spaces online to try to limit you know who gets in unfortunately you have to go through on a regular basis and and ban people from the server because they're they're obviously trying to take advantage of people in different ways uh and it's not always clear for us you know who is who is not it's a challenge for sure i'm going to open the suggestions i do think it's going to get better with time we'll learn a bit more but sadly i don't go away fully to be honest yeah agree uh next question from amar what are you doing to make ethereum more accessible um i guess that depends on what you mean by accessible so we do have our q1 epic around accessibility um i'd be curious if pablo maybe wants to wear on that and that's about the uh yeah go ahead yeah sure so yeah as josh mentioned this is a a goal for us for this quarter it was a goal too in our previous quarter but for this different reasons we couldn't make it um so to give a little bit of context we are trying here to to make our website more accessible for everyone basically and we have users that navigate our site only using the keyboard for example or using a screen reader so we want to make the site accessible and that is have a good experience navigating with those devices so answering the questions uh i would say that at first we are planning to basically make uh an audit in our code and trying to to follow a well-known uh guidelines or standards from the web3 for example and then we we want to to improve the the navigation experience using screen readers and or navigating the site with only the keyboard so we were we are going to to audit first and and then of course we are open to hear suggestions from from you guys uh we are we don't have any accessibility expert in the team so we are uh open to to suggestions um yeah and finally i just want to mention that this goal is uh it's difficult to to establish a scope right is a never-ending goal to increase the accessibility so for sure we will have in the future more more goals on improving the accessibility of the site so yeah happy if you have any suggestions or if you want to discuss this on the chat or you can message me yeah i also have a couple of very quick points i'd like to add so if you're speaking talking about making ethereum.org more accessible you have the translation program the goal of which is to make the content this content related to ethereum more accessible to everyone who might not speak english at all or maybe they don't feel comfortable reading in english learning about highly technical topics in english if you are talking about making ethereum more accessible in regards to fees use layer twos you inherit the security of ethereum and the fees are minimal that's it let's um yeah i guess go back to yeah very broad topic uh and also in terms of content i think most of the content on our roadmap is also aimed at making a video more accessible certainly the um the webfree explainer player two page a wallets revamp run a node all of that so yeah we're trying to tackle that problem from quite a few different angles and very conscious of the time i guess we can try and quickly fire through a couple more what sort of plans are there to highlight more of the public good space from rory um it's a really good question that one i immediately have an answer for maybe someone else on the team wants to speak a little bit about the other work i've been doing with the clr yeah i can touch some on that i think that's roy a great question we encourage input on that i mean it's a pretty broad area um but obviously the ethereum community and the crypto community more broadly are realizing like hey this technology gives us some incredible coordination power um whether it's you know focused on climate change or open source software or public goods generally like this global movement does have the capability to um influence a lot of change and a lot of capital formation that like you know even nation states can't necessarily tackle on their own so the whole design space and the opportunity space you know is pretty boundless so we definitely want to do what we can to highlight that um you know we do call out certain public goods on our our grants page which basically just shows like different grant opportunities that people can find who are trying to for instance build open source software or public education goods so there are there are there are paths to receive funding through that um you know on our dapps page for instance we we we mentioned bitcoin bitcoin grants as a well-known crowdfunding platform for public goods and our team over the past almost year part time has been contributing to a project uh clearfund clr.fund and i guess i just touch on that you know the ethereum foundation is thinking about this more holistically and more broadly um in the sense that you know the ethereum foundation is a non-profit and our primary activity is giving money to public goods in the space to just like benefit the ethereum ecosystem more broadly um and you can find allocation updates on blog.ethereum.org around how the ethereum foundation thinks and about how they distribute those funds um encourage you to check out recent posts on like the client incentive program for instance um and it's not something our team focuses on specifically but i can tell you the ethereum foundation is looking to experiment with more ways of funding public goods um and distributing and decentralizing the power of deciding which projects receive those goods so if you have ideas maybe it's you know creating an additional use case on ethereum.org to specifically talk about crowdfunding potential and like ability to coordinate and fund public goods um just to help grow awareness of like what public goods actually are how much our world relies on them in general i think it's a much broader movement that's bigger than just ethereum.org but i think there's definitely stuff we can do and again would encourage input on it because yeah i think it's a huge opportunity and a very important space for us to potentially help solve yeah great answer thanks sam um so we've seems we've not managed our time very well um i'm aware we've got quite a lot of questions left but i think we're gonna have to call it that um what i'll do after the call as we'll go through and just spend some time answering all of these questions in the community called chat so even now if you've got another question like answered feel free to pop it in there and i'll spend a little bit of time later on today just going through those and answering them for you um and with that yes one sorry go ahead i was going to say real quick uh the slido in the future if we do use this method again just encourage people take a look at the questions that are there and upvote ones that may be similar to a question if possible because that way we don't kind of fragment the same question over multiple things and then lower down on the list that's one little hack to try to get your question answered yeah great point thanks paul and so yeah i think we'll we'll call it that thank you so much everyone for attending um sorry if we never got to your question but we'll answer that later hopefully and we'll see you all again next month hopefully hey thanks everyone take care thank you thanks everyone bye everyone thanks everyone
