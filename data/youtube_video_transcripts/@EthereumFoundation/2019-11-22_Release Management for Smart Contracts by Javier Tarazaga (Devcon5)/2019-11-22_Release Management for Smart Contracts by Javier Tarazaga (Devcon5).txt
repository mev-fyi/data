[Applause] so yeah my name is Celia the wonder of a homebody school superfast we have a abuse integration and release management floor or a book on vacation to know before the smart contracts paid for the collection on vacation is whole and one of the things I wanted to talk about segregated or you can also babies how company introduced really society what is going to make so it gets management for smart contracts and I'm not talking on the tuning that wasn't ok to this table to them some of the risk of hormones like obviously ultimate up wake up so one of the most people in fund supports when you want to reduce very exciting on our steep their women to focus demands include anything like mobility and strength elevated as much as possible the reason to do so it's great importance Monica for your own sake because it's like you can proceed in many times and it's always the journey in a state but also because for example like when you're dealing with what in personnel that they can actually also hold it their deployment strategy as well so is it quite important to be able to alternate your entire life actually not only your contracts entire actually development isn't it also everything too many things done so of course funny thing is I feel I mean to a few people and put on this and especially when you look at companies nowadays I don't know if many of you guys like and ridiculous like where it's usually the flow nowadays what happens is like okay you might do some form of CR provide of circles give Travis enemies and then it does great to be able to reach the distant so usually what happens is people actually have their own high mindset their own not so form of like confused at the report isn't it and then when maybe perhaps they're going to mean it they actually disagreements or they'll actually use locally deployments I say what the can you play you should actually cut immutability either deployment so you should actually get one set and it will do promote your your reveals between different apartments I stay 101 doubles but it's not happening so and why it's not happening and it's because one of the main reasons that CIC just have like right now people don't use them is because you need to expose your privates so one of the things that our seats superblocks so we actually created this for the seei service and then release management course my contract so as you can see for example this is a normal CI you would actually have with you know it's some demos that you put into a repository and then you have different scripts that you can execute a specific order that is covering over so I can actually build anything but one of the interesting parts in here it's like okay you can actually tired your toker builds first of all when you are doing your CIA work with this for example a teacher give a great speech and they like like a commit so you can only stress it straight from your commits all the way to very different networks that you're going to be able to make sure you have full traceability of your deployments and only as you can see also for example once we actually can use the image that we actually created from the CIA process you can also use that image which is immutable and you can have motive dependence is already isolated so we not need to do MP install for example and to be able to perform migrations in this case if there is in trouble so one of the things that it gives everything together and it's like how the hell is that possible to be able to not squash their private keys so one of the things that we actually created and right now we are working towards like having this for trouble as well it's that you can actually provide a super provider in your travel configuration and then what we do with this is to be able to set up a town all the way from our runners to your browser so we would actually do have Thank You state you need to design and then they would actually pop up in the - birthday with this guy and then you'll be able to actually sign those transactions to see minimus for later point it is so we would actually never have to look at your private keys to be able to send describe your instructions and only that we actually will also extract all the artifacts that are creating all the ABI where they contrast I mean deploy and be able to trace what your your deployments to make sure they're succeeded so you were able to see a sustaining your bills from CI all the way to through the mainland and then finally is something looking like this in this case so as you say will probably come up and then of course if you when I contact us learn about more about the most simple business leaders report is specifically for poaching is they contact me at our goal its products and pricing [Applause] you
