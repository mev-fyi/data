foreign [Music] thanks for being here I'm skander from BC at the swimming Foundation I'd like to make a presentation today about Kurt keeper one of our projects it's still in progress not published yet but we're working on this okay it's not working uh yeah good keeper what's the Crypt Keeper uh so Crypt Keeper is a browser extension plugin that enables users to have a management for their zero knowledge identity and an ability to have like a generation proofs for uh semaphore and rln and for those who know it doesn't know like what semaphore and Ireland are like there are separate uh presentations for them and uh like simply ximaphore is um is like a layer and in ethereum that allows users to join like anonymously in a in a groups for both for like having votes and Ireland is like limiting is a protocol zero knowledge protocol for limiting like uh these spammers in a group um cool so what are the components uh built in this uh like those are four projects from our team uh ZK get library and interrupt I'm gonna go into interrupt like later and rln and sema4 um so we only now supporting chromium-based browsers um like yeah these browsers um cool we're working still in like and for future releases working on having like a mobile version later um yeah so now it's time to see this in action live live demo uh so the first use case I'm gonna have today is showing Crypt Keeper in an anonymous social network which is uh Z killer and Z Keller is anonymous social network there is a presentation maybe the next one after this about Z Color in details so um yeah and the Second Use case is uh using uh cryptkiver to prove or generate proofs from SEMA 4 and rln lastly just going through the agile project management for all this open source for those who are like interested in contributions or participating they can start from there um culture ah let me jump into the videos the internet is so bad so um okay so first off like um it's gonna start uh with like the the first setup is just creating a password for your extension it's not a wallet yet so just an identity extension um so I'll create a password then in order to create an identity I need first to have like a public address connection to my wallet in order to make like signing in order to have like signatures way um so I'm gonna First Connect with my meta mask um then it will be connected like um this is like the signing signature um so okay I think the video is skipping some parts yeah okay um the videos uh yeah uh after connecting to uh the meter mask it's connected and got the public address in future releases we're planning to have like more support to other uh wallets um it reads the balance and then I was able to create um like zero knowledge identity by connecting to interrupt but this is not a completed process yet in order to make it complete um we're working on like making all completed in the same extension but for now we're going to connect to Z killer for make this process completed and then I can I can use my identity and uh Anonymous Network um so as you can see now I'm connected I'm in Z killer um and I added a a user like coming back a user by connecting to a Cryptkeeper so it reads the identity commitment and it's going to connect to internet for generating a proof of reputation this is what interrupt does um and the proof representation is by going back to Twitter account um and it will like generate some credentials about your identity and then generate like a approved for your identity a kind of reputation for you so until the next one okay uh all right yeah okay so here um I have already stopped please so here I have already connected to my Twitter and it generates my reputation my username and my rotation is like server a silver reputation so now I can join the group uh and I can anonymously um let me jump to the third video so now like I'm ready to like use my new identity uh using connected to Cryptkeeper uh which like connected to my reputation proof and then um I'm gonna be able to like participate in this uh Network Anonymous Network to write my tweet uh hola Defcon and as you can see like I'm a user with 2K plus uh followers which like can't approving I'm a person I'm not a spammer I have reputation so you can have a trusting for reading by tweets um yeah so that was like the first use case I want to show um the Second Use case is we have like a small dummy uh testing website that just connects to semaphore and RN and for like make this showcase for proof generation um so I'm gonna go connect uh to it so I'm gonna first like showcase how to generate Sima for proof um so yeah the output is presenting here but the video is kinda yeah so now I'm gonna create like the proof from semaphore uh using my wallet uh yeah so for those who like know the details here that's familiar to them like the public signatures those are like the proof generated from semo4 and the same goes for R Ln and should be presented down here I think yeah uh cool and at the down here is the identity commitment this is like the new representation of the users in Anonymous Network uh so yeah I think that covers it um so um maybe I will show now the uh this is like our working repository now um and uh this is the Management Port where like any contributor anyone interested in swimming ideas we can start from here on from there from here or like there are discussions supported here we don't have like a Discord yet but we can like if you have questions or throwing ideas you can start from there um and there are like a lot of bunch draft ideas you can start uh if you would like contributes uh so uh back to my slides uh we have like uh two other contributors there with me here and uh the sunoku and yeah that's it thank you
