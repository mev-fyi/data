hello thank you very much for coming I'm very very pleasantly surprised to see such a great turnout on the last day in one of the last talks I have used the last of my voice I'm gonna try to eke out a little bit more and talk to you a little bit about steak and about protocols consensus protocols and so forth so let's get started where are we at today where I'm 10 years into about exactly 10 years into since the Bitcoin white paper multiple years into this revolution and in this sort of time to sort of take stock the word blockchain has become one of these words that doesn't even take an article we don't talk about a blockchain we don't talk about the blockchain we talk about blockchain the only other word I know that I can easily remember that has this treatment is the word god ok so this thing is really big you cannot walk around lower Manhattan without seeing two people in suits turn to each other and say what's your strategy for blockchain so every company is trying to devise a strategy and about eight billion of VC money bla bla bla lots and lots of money has gone into stuff and if one of the interesting things is I've found myself at tables where there is a very solid gentleman from the Bank of England and there is another dark net dark net market operator right then and there it's a fantastic crowd this this is what it means to be in the middle of a disruption so and then one thing one additional thing I do on occasion was a professor to try to see like do I really have the pulse of the the whatever through the folks in my hand is to check sort of extraneous things and one of the metrics I look at is this is the metric I looked at is the number of songs on YouTube written about different different cryptocurrencies and it's far exceeds the number of songs about Google Facebook etc etc right so even free software so that's an amazing thing but where exactly are we so this is a really positive thing so I'm going to be a little bit negative now and and I think you know one of the core distinguishing things about me is is I'm a scientist at heart and science begins by being able to observe reality and being able to admit reality so bear with me the dream we've solved a very compelling dream to the masses it's a decentralized disintermediated future future it's free from the tyranny of middlemen is free from regulatory capture it's free from trusted but unaccountable parties that is the dream that has gathered all of us into this packed room so that's fantastic but and the bar to succeed is actually very low okay I know this community is working on a gazillion different very exciting projects we heard about a lot of them over the course of the last four days three days so uh and we will have succeeded if we fail at every single one of them except say I don't know one of the easiest ones a better infrastructure for custodial assets if stocks were slightly better managed if we knew that the doll company actually has X shares when it says it has X shares then we would actually be in a better place or if we could build better decentralized exchanges and I know we know that we have the capability to do so we can build better exchanges then the sec keeps demanding of us we can build better technology untrusted technology then then then what the Wall Street guys have so if we could only do a tiny bit we will have succeeded so the bar is low but the technology we have to get to that bar is just not sufficient and it fails on a multiple on a multitude of fronts first one is scale you've heard this multiple times because the Bitcoin folks have been fighting over this issue second one is security the state of every exchange is empty that's their default low energy state that's what they seek people lose money all the time sfy l sorry for your loss is an acronym you don't even have to spell it down performance is a big issue you cannot wait fifteen seconds on the web that is unheard of you talk to a UX person and say this is what you have to do it's a big big problem governance how do we actually change anything at all with a big fight that turns out and a lot of sock puppets that's what I learned and it's absolutely horrible so that's not that's no way to build systems the user experience overall is you know you get excited I get excited I tell somebody new and then they say well you know that I tried to like read the paper or all that I had to buy this and that change it to you know convert it to this other see then I had to like install this I had to sink oh it's just a crazy crazy user experience is it possible to do better well okay before I get there let me also mention some some harsh facts that just came out so this is the number of top 500 ecommerce merchants accepting Bitcoin it was five five five three three three three four four four four okay it's not going up okay we're not winning the war to replace Fiat it's not happening and the goal posts are moving I want to share this slide with you so you know to detect for this if four years from now we've changed the etherium narrative then you will know that we are failing so here's Bitcoin when I first sort of heard about it it was digital cash untraceable nah that kinda gave way to a whole series of other narratives it was a store of value for a while Adam back kept telling me so and and then you know disruption this and that and now you know there's yet another narrative that's that's pushing these currencies at any one time but it seems as if they are realizing that the dream they sold and what they've got are not really a good match so what do we do so here this report says why is this not becoming part of the global financial system fabric says why it's failing the high cost of operating a fully trust list system is pushing early players to balkanize systems into trusted blog chains and distributed ledgers also they forgot to add also exchanges but these are becoming speculative assets people keep their coins you never actually touch the system right you do its fanfare online now you buy and sell on an exchange without actually using it that is not what what gets me excited that is not what many of you are here for so okay so what's the situation with these centralization well we did a big long study that came out a year and a half ago I want to share some of the results with you the curve the main result is current crop of systems are not sufficiently decentralized they're better than a bank okay a bank you're at the mercy of a single entity but not much better than a cartel of banks okay so they are kind of comparable and so the days of one CPU one in the white paper are gone though those that's like a dream it's just gone you all remember the days when you could use this to mine things right and then that got replaced by the days when we all had to hunt online I'm not sure what's happening with my pictures when we had had to hunt online for these things okay whatever GPUs and then they became really expensive and people tried FPGAs then people tried these things one of my colleagues has an interesting story they were redoing the data center at CMU and underneath the floorboards of the data center they found another data center that was mining Bitcoin and so but this gave way to as you read in the famous New York Times article of the fly-by-night operations in China that were doing mining at you know in like makeshift locations and they got suddenly more professionalized there's nothing China there's another installation but but then ultimately turned into this this is the state of mining right so this is I think a bit theory water-cooled set up and these are professional transaction processing machines type things but they're not really processing transactions they never touch a transaction I'm sure everybody here realizes this the public at large does not they think that these things are actually touching or validating transactions they are not they're all they're doing is trying to win the lottery so they can say I am the one who determines what's happened in the last 10 minutes so why are we doing this because okay we need this Hardware because of the way the Nakamoto consensus protocol operates it ensures that a single participant cannot masquerade as an others if I were to sort of pester you with a gazillion crossword puzzles you'd only be able to solve them at a particular rate and therefore you would not be able to claim that you're a million other people million other people that's that's the civil control problem it is not there to try to establish consensus it is solely there to make sure you don't pretend to be who you're not okay simple control is what it really provides the consensus part of Nakamoto consensus is the longest chain rule that's what allows people to snap onto the same reality the longest hardest chain rule it is not the proof-of-work side of things so in addition the investment ensures that the miners will seek to maximize the long and short term value of the coin they're there to try to sort of ensure that you know that their incentives are aligned with everyone else I would like to note that hardware is simply a specialized kind of state at stake okay it's just like it's one way of assuring that you have skin in the game but it's a very specialized way of ensuring the chip stays skin in the game its its production is monopolized by a few manufacturers nobody in this room I suspect knows except maybe a couple of people know how to actually build these things at scale and then make them fast and and most importantly being able to procure hardware and run it effectively has absolutely nothing to do with ordering transactions one of them is a capex effects management problem the other is a serialization problem so so that is one of the main issues that's going to be this has been in the back of my mind for a bunch of time now that that decoupling leads to a very strange scenario so we looked at in our study we looked at over I think a span of two and a half years what happened to hash power in Bitcoin and aetherium this is a paper that came out a while ago and so this shows each each cluster of bars is the is the hash rate of a single single miner you can see it change over time and you can see what has happened in both the theorem and Bitcoin and I think the most important thing to take away from this graph is the fact that I only have 20 okay I don't have more than 20 miners that I need to show to you so the entirety of the management of the blockchain is essentially in the hands of these people here is the same data shown differently you can see that about a hundred percent of the of the almost 99 point something percent of the hash power is in the hands of 20 or fewer entities and for let's see I think I have some numbers here eleven mining pools in Bitcoin seven mining pools and aetherium control 90% of the of the hash power if you look at the 50% value it's 4 for Bitcoin 3 for aetherium of that time this has gotten worse this is like a year and a half ago stated stuff so I posit to you that the Byzantine quorum system with 20 nodes would have been much more decentralized yes which a lot of people make fun of for various different things is 21 block producers okay so so this is kind of interesting all of this expenditure and for what could we not have had this better now I know some of you are going to go wow he doesn't know what he's talking about bla bla bla you know the whatever the Twitter trolls will come out because they always do they're going to say oh but we have invisible decentralization these mining pools are made up of many miners and and if the mining mining operator were to misbehave then they would actually rise up and blah blah blah there's a whole lot of arguments over that I'm not going to repeat them this is the invisible decentralization argument as with any sort of invisible arguments it doesn't hold water if you it's just false okay so a pool is a common enterprise okay so these are people who have purchased the stake for a singular purpose they have a profit sharing arrangement they are essentially a corporation in every aspect except they don't they haven't filed corporation papers okay so why to a series of libertarians this is actually a big deal that oh but they didn't file papers and therefore I mean that doesn't make sense to me I don't understand so in every in every material way they are operating together and much more importantly they actually the misbehaviour that they would have to detect is not readily identifiable okay and as a btg got attacked as a result nice hash was used and people who participated in those attacks had no idea that their hash power was being used to attack is they're just not geared up to actually detect any of this stuff and there is recent realization going on cryptocurrencies are experiencing this this because ASIC manufacture is hard cheap electricity finding it is hard you need proximity to other miners you need to have a spy mining network typically you have to be a part of a mining cartel so you hear of other people's blocks before before so you don't get orphaned yourself you of course didn't know how the mining game also in the long term favors the miner with the lowest capex effects cost okay so this is a game where if the miners are reinvesting there their income back in mining the one who has the best the highest profit margin typically comes out ahead with much more hash power and ends up out competing others so if I were to look at half of my okay here we go follow the entire slide the left side of this slide is from two years three years ago and the other one is from this year right now and there's almost nothing in common in terms of mining pools except two I think one of them is slush and the other one is I think and pool so there's been complete churn in the mining space because this is really not a stable industry and what's happened here okay and the energy usage is immense as of 2018 it's about one Austria one Czech Republic you look around is the big industrial nation oh the equivalent of its energy is going into mining - Denmark's 3 Ireland's you know that's a lot of energy and maybe like some people actually don't care right as long as you make money we're all good fine I mean I care I would like to see polar Polar Bears still live but if you don't care about the polar bears or the ice caps or the Floridians and so forth then you should care I mean those people care deeply about their pockets about the leakage out of the store of value we've got you're losing money out of out of this thing that's supposed to hold you know the your wealth so a question can we do better so I want to talk to you a little bit about about why I think I'm generally very very hopeful that we can actually reach the dream so from the same study we looked at what resources are available and this is an interesting graph it shows the amount of bandwidth available to both Bitcoin and aetherium nodes so if you look at the I think the important lines are the red dashed line that's aetherium and the comparable line is the let's see the blue solid line bitcoin so Bitcoin nodes actually have more bandwidth available than aetherium aetherium is running its network at a higher pace and and and and so yeah it's running at a higher pace maybe a different slide that's interesting is ah but the point here is the protocol is unable to take advantage of improvements on this graph so over time over the course of a year we observed all of the bandwidth go up by a factor of 1.7 but the protocol cannot take advantage of it it requires a hard fork for Bitcoin which isn't going to happen requires a whole lot of changes for any pal set up any Nakamoto Center but here is a different one so look at this aetherium graph this is the peer-to-peer latency in aetherium there is a lot of aetherium knows more than 20,000 at the time we did the study and you can see that they're far away from each other there's a lot of people who are sort of distributed around the world there's a grassroots network you guys connect you guys sync stuff happens on this network except you're not really participating in the mining okay if we could somehow harness your input then we could actually go and propel ourselves towards a much better future so this gives me hope but the protocol is unable to take advantage of it so the next question then is is is what's missing well a better consensus protocol is what misses what's missing so I want to summarize for you the last 40 plus years of consensus protocols and it's actually fairly straightforward there have only been two consensus protocol families in that whole timeframe okay there been more but two main ones one of them is Nakamoto consensus you know exactly how it works I'm not going to rehash it it's very robust okay anybody could join at any time that's nice there is no need for precise membership okay nobody there's no gatekeeper but it has high latency low throughput does not scale wastes energy not green not sustainable and it completely breaks down if you go over the Byzantine threshold if you have more than say big actually if you have more than 33% people could start mining selfishly if you have more than 50% then they could actually start doing even more malicious things to your blockchain so in contrast to this even before Nakamoto was what we call the classical family this was developed by Barbara Liskov at MIT who has retired and Leslie Lamport both of them have touring Awards Nakamoto of course is six billion dollars and classical consensus classical is the classical protocols are very very nice because they give you quick finality but they don't scale okay so they typically require quad message complexity everybody has to talk to every one of them you know there are some optimizations that you know any other you trade off latency for for message complexity they typically require precise membership or close to precise membership in essence what you're doing is you're building something like a Senate here is the hundred of us when I do a write I write 267 of you when he does a read he reads from 67 of you and then he does that guarantees that there are 34 people in common and if 33 of them are Byzantine there is at least still one good guy to carry my message over to him that's really the core of all of these complicated proofs okay so that's the classical world Kasper inter ledger fabric you know whatever hyper ledger fabric nothing through ledger Korda etcetera all of these protocols are based on classical classical consensus Al Gore and Josh graph and so forth and they of course completely break down if the Byzantine threshold is exceeded right if you have 34 people the Byzantine or you and I disagree and too much of the of the membership of the room then suddenly the whole thing breaks down I want to tell you about a new approach to consensus that that actually combines the best of these two worlds and works entirely differently it involves a different mechanism and I'll try to explain to you how it works in about three minutes or so this is the Avalanche consensus protocol it was drafted on ipfs in May of this year and it gives us quick finality okay so it works it's achieves finality in one to two seconds it gives us high throughput about a thousand to ten thousand transactions per second it scales and this is I think the most important part it can accommodate tens of thousands to millions of nodes you too can participate you could be the Jihan whoo of an avalanche protocol okay and jihong you know he's wonderful at building machinery is wonderful at running it but when it comes to serializing transactions he is no different than you or me okay and you can do the job that he does so let's see its robust there is no need for precise membership dadada let me tell you how it works okay it's inspired by gossip networks it's fairly straightforward and and here's how it works here's this design to be deliberately metastable it's a network that will fall one way or the other and make a decision how does it work well let's assume that we're making a decision between red and blue okay and we're making that in the room this big and I don't know how many people are here let's say a few hundred and you know you all know some of them I know some of them but we don't all know everyone precisely okay there's overlap but not the precise knowledge what you do is you pick five people at random it's the you you you you you okay and you say hey what color card do you like is it red or blue and so you ask them five of them no not much more than that maybe ten depending on how you want to parameterize your protocol but you're not gonna ask everybody else okay in fact we could do this in a crowded stadium of fifty thousand or a hundred thousand people let's do it in this room I pick five of you and I say which color would you like to go for and they say red or blue I get back red red red what let's see let's color this yeah red red blue red blue okay at the end of this I go okay it looks like the at least based on my sampling people are going towards right I'm gonna go towards red okay you do the same thing she does the same thing and so forth and and that happens at the you know simultaneously in the first round and at the end of this process what what will happen well when we started the worst thing that could have happened is we were split 50-50 intermixed you know those Blues and red and blues and reds intermixed in the room after one round of everybody asking five people we will have over sampled the Reds or the Blues it's incredibly unlikely that we will remain at 5050 it's possible if we remain that 50/50 there will be another round in fact there will always be another round subsequent rounds we will fall to one side but more than likely we will end up over sampling one of the colors and the color distribution will now be oh no fifty one forty nine second round we do the exact same process but you can see now that we have this we have started to descend down a hill and and now the second round is much more likely to go in the direction that got favored in the first round so if it was fifty one forty nine red in the first round it's going to be probably fifty three forty seven at the end of the second round of of poling here beat this up for a third time you repeat this for a fourth time and so on and so forth and the math shows that for really large networks of 50,000 or so somewhere between 13 to 17 rounds is sufficient for the entire network to topple over so you do this process and after the seventeenth round this incredibly dumb sounding protocol you do this and you hold your card on your forehead and you flip it every time you hear something you don't even keep track of history you don't try to attribute malice to anybody you just go what I just said and at the end of the 17th round you'll look around and the entire room will be looking around with the same colored card saying hey you've got red I've got red too and that is consensus you have made a decision and the the likelihood of somebody choosing red somebody else choosing blue at the same time are minuscule that's what the proofs show that's what the simulations have all shown so it's naturally sharded it creates a graph and and oh and one of the most important things it's an egalitarian ecosystem there are no minors there are no special notes you can participate in this even with a cell phone if you were to try to use a traditional protocol a classical protocol all you know if we're in a stadium all 50000 people would have to talk to all 58,000 other people if you use this further call you end up doing five poles of snow in 17 rounds so 85 messages instead of 85 messages per node instead of 50,000 messages so it's an enormous enormous improvement it's green when there is nothing to do you do nothing okay so that's what we call the quiescent for the comb I'll very quickly talk about this product this coin that we're building on top of it we're building a coin called our Vantaa it will have multiple virtual machines there's going to be a token called Alva and it's going to use steak and people will stake and will they will get a mining reward there is no such thing as slashing conditions okay so we could identify them and try to punish them and so forth classical algorithms typically have to do this we don't have to do it and we will not be doing it okay so if you if you steak with Alva well then you know there is no no risk of losing your funds should your machine misbehave sure and so forth one of the most interesting things is that we can use this system the protocol to actually pull the audience and figure out and determine parameters of the system itself okay so that leads us to two techniques that sort of play into this one individual one one vote let me talk a little bit about this governance so there are in any system there are critical system parameters like the minting rate Satoshi had to fix the minting rate you all know about the 21 million you all know about the heavens and so forth in Alva we don't have to do this there will be an initial default minting rate that you you know the award reward rate that you make for steak but but over time you can actually say something like hey guys we're currently minting at a rate of let's say 1% to compensate for it coins lost but it looks like we're minting too fast okay ask Z cash folks about minting too fast right there there are coins out there that are minting a little too fast so can do you think that we should go back down to say zero percent or vice versa we would like to get more nodes into the system let's improve the reward rate to you know four percent and so you can propose this transaction and if enough if it's acceptable to enough people if there is social consensus to be found then the protocol itself will actually achieve consensus on this meta transaction and change the system parameters so of course you know every economic system has to be subject to hysteresis and you shouldn't be able to change the system from you know one number to another huge number you know from one 1% to 10,000 percent or whatever overnight so there's all sorts of hysteresis that's going to be built in and we also are thinking about or have been developing techniques for equitable representation so people with more resources will always get more resources I don't know how to fix that if I were to fix that then this would be a completely different kind of talk and I would be the next you know marks plus plus but instead what we will do is is come up with techniques to to do this that is people with more resources will make more rewards yes but when it comes to these kinds of decisions over the the fate of the system they still have one vote like every other so we're going to build a token platform on top of this we're thinking about how to layer it on top of proof-of-work systems and there has been some interest from existing coins on how to do that I won't say too much about this but there is a lot of movement afoot about how to build side chains built on top of public up block chains and and so alva can actually be a good protocol for these side chains and so just couple sentences we plan to support multiple virtual machines I don't know why but everybody else is in this mode where they just think if one one token one scripting language I think we were the first ones to say hey that's kind of silly we can support multiple and many and if you want to create a new token and you or do you want your token to have ring signatures and zero knowledge proof and also something else you should be able to do that and we will support exactly that it supports asynchrony just one word for Vlad if he's in the audience as an academic it's kind of odd to say there's all my colleagues love asynchrony they demand it because academics love sundae puzzles that are hard and we all try to hold each other to difficult difficult questions infatuation with asynchrony is kind of silly I find it to be like academic really asynchrony helps if your network partitions itself into non-trivial partitions if you expect the u.s. to be decoupled from Europe then you should by all means support a synchrony and and we haven't seen that in my lifetime so and to give up from your best case because you want to handle this worst case is actually a bad bad idea but nevertheless um because we got questions about this we decided to add a synchrony to to the avalanche protocol so to summarize there is a new tool in our Arsenal for building the dream that we all share avalanche gives us a new kind of a protocol and there's been a lot of false narratives out there about Bitcoin it achieves this and that it finds social consensus it does this and it doesn't do those things right and in Bitcoin the only voice you have is as a miner otherwise you don't you know the only thing you can do is exit right and that's what we've been seeing from the Bitcoin ecosystem and and so in this system you actually get to have a voice you get to participate directly in the decision the serialization of transactions and the decisions over the financial future of the network and overall the area will rise or sink together I would love to see I think we're going into a phase where you know all the crappy coins already kind of got introduced and we're going into the phase where we're going to see more and more sort of worthy interesting projects introduced and I would like to see the top ten be a competition among those kinds of projects and and I believe the area will either rise together or sink together and I'm looking forward to working with all of you to build an exciting new platform thank you you
