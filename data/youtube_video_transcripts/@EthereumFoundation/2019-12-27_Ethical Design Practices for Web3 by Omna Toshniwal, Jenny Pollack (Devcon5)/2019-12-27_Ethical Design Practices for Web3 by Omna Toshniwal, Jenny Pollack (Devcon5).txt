[Applause] ohno-san designer and researcher and today we're going to be talking to you about ethical design practices from f3 we're gonna start with the map of the territory with some terms and examples from the parent landscape and move to some things that we've been observing and the attention of this talk is to act as a conversation starter on how we can work with all of you towards designing a better future for the web so the practices of product design are well established we know that functionality reliability usability and the life are the components of the UX importantly this these components build upon each other so we're counting usability of a non-functional product will not lead to the desired outcomes it kind of seems to me like there's a piece missing from this hierarchy and its ethics specifically user control without it we believe there's a fundamental flaw in the process of creating fluent centered products the area of surveillance capitalism so basically if time feels like we're very being recorded every moment all over what theory share could we share it with a house needs to our personal data page address phone number or browsing the street credit card info are all in custody the company is then sometimes use this data for their own bottom lines so how you can get here dark patterns are tricks use and websites and applications that encourage you to do things you just didn't necessarily mean to Gary you've likely been frustrated by an experience that you got into because of these patterns they're knowingly Ron that really so the first pattern I'll mention is called privacy suckering in this case the user has a no choice but to accept these terms in order to use this service which includes posting tweets under behalf and control over you need the block settings now basically giving them full of act as user permissions so you may have chosen to trust this random application with the ability to post tweets on your behalf possibly because you think that they would never do it but why have they ever even asked for this in the first place right another dark pattern example is called confirm shaming so like since when does not want me to say to serve you ads make you a bad person you probably see these dialogues before and possibly may have been influenced by this emotional coercion or they just accidentally clicked up so roach hotel is when you get into a situation and it becomes difficult to get out of so have any of you ever tried to delete your Amazon account okay so you like know if it's notoriously difficult it is 12 steps and then basically disability write a letter to customer service but the business interest in this case not letting you leave your couch because you paid and recurring yearly membership fee its prioritized over your ability to remove yourself from this contract so applications are developing the description was on wording but like super difficult off board anymore so this is a quote from Jessie we were we want empowerment we want to be better people we want technology to enhance our capabilities and increase our sense of agency without dictating the rhythm of our lives today our world is enriched with incredible useful services and the technology has enabled but it's not enough and we're not done and we deserve better the good news is that at the goal design practices are merging we're super happy to see that we're not the only ones thinking about this as we build a more user centric ethical individual so just like for you all these are some resources you make by design and design ethically calm if you want to dig deeper into some of these patterns and icons to fight against them in your own application one practice that were specifically seeing like pro privacy movement is signing with Apple which allows you to office Kate here you know just away from that location using it's like not all the big guys are necessarily soon great I don't know the other is proactive support surfacing features that help you use a product the way that you want to use it here we see an example of a notification that is often dismissed and now you have the ability and the menu to stop these notifications altogether [Music] another part of ethical design is mindful data collection and that mask specifically we use a service service called Mutombo which is an open source alternative to Google Analytics using data of course is a great way to improve user experience but it's important to think carefully about the things that you do with the data ideally not easily to trick people into using their services or more than they eat tuna so I've touched on some web 2 things that are bleeding into web 3 and I'm going to talk more about some of them which are the foundations that we've opened that have been part of this transition to Africa so user accounts being room think is powerful but it also means being your own risk manager which admittedly can be super scary having an user and control those in principle here earlier today in this room Johnny and Kate both give talks addressing this topic addressing this topic so you should check them out like after the conference site another principle we're building with is transparency so we're creating on top of urban infrastructure rate so it's great for innovation and also for accountability within applications and meta masks another principle we've adopted is explicit requests so user control is one of our highest priorities and the idea here is that we try to show you everything which is maybe not always what we needed to do because sometimes when you use my mask your face might look like this it's you slowly this is how I get your users sometimes and to backpedal oh these are some direct quotes for my use of research what is this I don't understand why I like being asked for this I just want to use them out if there's either I'll pause but all the inputs I just mindlessly click through them so of course like these are real-life things that users have said some of you in this room may have sent these things before so like obviously be like heard this feedback and we're thinking about it the main question I think like specific liver asks me how is how it might be designed such that people can trade off control for finding this as I see fit and uma is going to tell you more about how we're actually doing that MMMs today [Music] [Music] informed consent so we want to ensure that you can understand what they're signing up for dragging their control we want to provide people with the right amount of control to manage whatever incentive and then the third one is feeding trust in the spectrum of them explaining informants and consent is grant of personal information respond after understanding carefully and properly on what they're signing up for what's the consequences of what is the challenge here is how to be society something without by making sure that we communicate in the entire Navy permission but without overly information this is an and this is clean which people see today when a specific condition which is very often used in that to ask people for consent to get gain access to the funds now there are several problems with this strength today and if this is the only source of funds and to go with them I don't want to be the next idiot to be accepting that right the problem with this is one this is not very human readable so the ambiguity of this whole thing must be wrong the other thing is it's a fundamentally risky Commission you are asking people if you get the funds to even access all their funds and that is not acceptable so to improve this woman this is the design that we are working on and this will introduction soon Christian here is silence for an answer one of the ways that we have managed this is because this and this pollution in one Atlanta's people in a few seconds what this permission is what they given it to us consequences of violence and why it's Mia we added one more layer of control limits which is information so you can set the allowance that you are comfortable with giving giving a system granular control we want people to be able to manage the permissions are Jeff and giving to different sites where they are using different battery applications so how many of you to show of hands know what taps you're connected with with Americans because we really don't know why that as an option today you cannot view what do you manage it with there are actually management to meet this commission so removable provisions I have many things that we are adding and we want to make sure that they make it really easy for people to manage these permissions and we do this by actually providing this setting in the right place and it the third one is feeding dressed as a spectrum so Trust is a really integral part of human experience ever how interpersonal relationships work when we start a relationship with another person we often don't trust them but as the relationship grows they trust intruders you can trust them more and you can this is how people and machine interaction works as well in two world it's a super rustic and the interaction experience that we have you just have to trust the completed weekend machine that whatever you're giving function to do in were three we have tried traits of trust em experienced but we we want to treat this as a spectrum we want to give thee the door to be room to be able to decide where they want to be able particular application so if they start dressing at a prom they can choose to delegate control they can choose to reduce the amount of effort you might put em in using a photograph sherry is pleased our economy so when you sign up for an application you might not know it so you don't have to upfront share everything right away so that up you should be able to pick and choose on what you allowed that application today actually soon and this is just one of them you want to do this extend this to other kinds of actions as well another thing that I do want to mention Carrie so these self permissions that applications will even to us from people minimums who needs a silly thing to face we expect just to be an interface to show that universe now the challenges that we face in creating this framework of relational system where gaps will be able to asses permissions we want to enable and empower our vendors to ask the right kinds of permissions at the right moments to be in the right way so that's it for consent and you ask only things at that point so when a user starts to trust an application more they should be able to to opt in to convenience options they should be able to automate certain steps they should be they should need to have the complete level of control and they haven't been notified so we think he must assembly area a mask and make this like work for five days so that the user can have in inter authorizations for certain period of time and has a contextual experience they've all become small organisms now when we provide these kind of options we are naturally an idea to open up for a certain amount of this so it's important for us to also provide those required safety nets for them and one of the ways we're the thing is with spending it so you can have spend effects or application and strengthen it's a decent experiments and perturbations variables they might be no idea this is just the beginning and we applying for now these are exact actresses that we are like and comment so comprehensive operations in summary easy to manage and emotive new Commission's share a recipe automates text with serviettes and implements this is just the first steps and we hope to control where they allow people to be in the driver seat but you provide them with all these smart phone controls that they need to have a safe as a juvenile and we are doing this one part into this we are just a small touch point so you really have to be able to work with a lot of applications to make them so looking back to what Jenny said earlier on ethics is missing products - student um you want to say to everyone you consider ethics by default in their 20 different process if they're as a fundamental part the compliment and hopefully some of the principles that we share today would be as fulfilling any of our design so please vote with us and this is just the beginning we won't even grant applications 0x obviously and this feeling but it would be really useful for us to talk to you and understand how we can simplify your experiences when you can serve the needs of your users while making sure that these security and little Sanders or people are high you can have anywhere there's an ID for us this is happening so the next application of extreme violence is a workshop feeling I will be an announcement our self is from the learning hands-on learning Daniel Eric to party level governments for new shop llama for the presentation to have realistic we are supporting not eat we collectible event is being tried out to earn a smoker and you can also find us at the Texas table tennis was routine rather nothing that one simply talk to us when I learn more from him and build a better and the future of internment [Music] even my favorite senior application available for us to provide so your idea of this mysterious lighter oh yeah that is true results Oh India prophet of ways that all these chemicals it's all for sure so a lot of them is actually just best practice and fitness and we realized quickly morning [Music] we know why this thing has to be that's that's a gap for people and - in fact it is food an arrangement of a great solution and so we are trying to think through brain with these Commission's are actual prices in case honey so it's very often race to get that or people acting along it's like retracting and like like maybe testing for like how people are actually like something that you know me are so even so it's been a month since everybody's and I use they just want to be respected [Applause]
