[Applause] five minutes to represent projects well turbulent quick talk about daily while you feel familiar with me as well as where I'm from a huge problem inflation that's so big that it's better to use the bills to make home decoration that's actually isn't to pay for things so a potential tool to help people to navigate how they interact with money is to give them access to visual dollars or to the US dollar right so everyone minutes whether wants a US dollar it's increasingly necessary for life if you've studied how countries dollar eyes 17 Zimbabwe this happens often in places where this highly efficient Nick over and it was formalized the US dollar and it trickles down it becomes that medium of exchange that's being used and it's often the the way this happens is by using cash and so today there are three ways that people can use dollars in Venezuela and none of them are quite ideal one is permission systems like cell is a system that if you have a company in the US you can transfer money from that account to other accounts in the US so if you have that privilege and you can access that and it's not distorting that is actually take sale as pants even though it's not payments that it's not supposed to be used for that but and people also also falls into this category they used to have more lenient rules to orient students to access they both increasingly with toughening of sanctions this may not be a potential future where we would be able to have a definite access to these platforms there are others where you can access US dollar and that they're difficult to use aft and uphold and then there's so they don't safe way to do it which is cash and then in Venezuela people have phones within her foreign land so very old phones and they're already used to using digital Oliver so one of the things that I try to build this for I think it makes sense for Venezuela because it it's already very easy and I'm very very familiar to people to transact using problems in over like at least using digital transactions so what we build is an open-source framework to accelerate digital dollar products looks like this it's you know Rico and it has react native open-source wallet that wrong some very old phones and is actually very very hard to do so old printer the developers was only just coordinating the project and they there is a way to spend and receive and these bees are dying by using the x9 chain because it's faster so the way I'm gonna quickly show Argos tonight - well it's written here so we have a pin for security for the physical security things get some wrote your phone it's not so easy to get money out so you want to send two dollars and takes a while you are in part because the phone is old and in part because the connection is not so good workers these things could be in street food so you have cure codes you can paste into it or where you can send to a contact and we would use the channels that people already use so you want to send money to a friend that you already have what's up you can do it very easily and then just do it through a payment link so you're gonna get link then I feel it again when you click on the link the app opens but this is something that doesn't work on every Android version and something that we need more help with to like to make to make sure that is it works out of box right here we need $2 today that was the idea is to use the term dollar tell that die so that people know what it is the holidays and then I'm going to talk about the application that I see for this because this is again it's an open source product that I approach you to build upon but it's not a fully fledged solution that's going to revolutionize where that not on its own but I think what we should do on forward is to build on this so when I just quickly say build by is like you know awesome that's the first Christmas with build a behavior and by bridge these guys and then a sporadic sponsored by make here at minus-6 if you want help this gesture getting you a five-dollar Lincoln it's in exciting so just reach out to me outside the ground and then what I really want you to get out of this is that you can build on top of this framework and for example reserve has a an app that lets means to us by itself dollars and if they could also allow to transact using this network for example they could integrate that into this into their app and also value is another company that's a lot of people send money to each other and if they allowed to send money into digital dollars that would be also a great tool a okay nobody's like these that have products that are targeted to inspect they could use these open source were to improve their products [Applause] you
