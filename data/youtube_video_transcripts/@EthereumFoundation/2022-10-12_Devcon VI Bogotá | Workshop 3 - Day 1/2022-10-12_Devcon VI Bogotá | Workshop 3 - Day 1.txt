definitely yeah [Music] thank you [Music] foreign thank you hello good afternoon everyone just just find your seats and we'll start in a few seconds foreign generative and interactive comments and um a lot of this will be informed by a group that uh that I am part of called kernel and I guess just for just to start can we have a show of hands for people here who know about kernel cool yeah it's good to see a lot of the colonel fellows here as well and for those of you who don't know what Colonel is Colonel is a webp fellowship uh it started out around uh June July 2020 I started by Vivek and Andy and uh the initial uh format of Kernel was it was 100 builders in the webpage space discussing um discussing what we need to build in web3 a lot of web 2 we feel has been has been largely influenced by the technology and not the I guess not the Arts not not the sciences and the philosophy so Colonel tries to get a lot of people to discuss what it is we really need to build and um and today we're the hope is we we get together and discuss what does it mean to build a more regenerative and interactive Commons and a lot of how we do it in kernel is through discussion through workshops like this one that we hope you guys will be able to uh to take fully part of it's a it's gonna be a format that we call ajunto wherein we get groups of people to discuss uh sub subjects that are relevant to crypto but uh at pretty deep I would say and not focused on a lot of what we're mostly used to talking about in a very very crypto focused conference so maybe I can start with uh what was listed down there in the workshop agenda the concept of comments is not that of a resource a comments comes from a different way of being in the world where it is not production which counts but bodily use established by Customs so the hope today is we kind of explore those ideas and we'll be using some guide questions that uh that will hopefully guide the discussions and yeah looking forward to having a fruitful discussion with you all but before we start uh some of the kernel fellows are here and we need to be able to I guess form a good group among each of the tables so maybe I can request uh you guys to form groups of of three to four for each table so the hope is the Hope also maybe for the next Slide the hope more so than discussing this is also Colonel is really all about making relationships and learning more with friends here in here in web3 so let's form groups of three and four some of the guides will help facilitate and um and if you can try and form groups I guess with people that that you don't know yet because uh the hope is we we get to get introduced to more people so so yeah so maybe we can take a few minutes to to organize ourselves try to convince someone to join you or get up and join another and if anyone needs help cool all right it's taking some a few seconds to look around cool all right looks good maybe take a few seconds to just get to know the folks that are in your table and for those that are just joining we're we're forming groups of three and four so do find the table which seems like there's like there's more space for discussions all right looks good so hope you are getting comfortable with the folks on your table try to introduce yourselves to each other because we're gonna be talking about some get some pretty deep topics in the context of F3 and again I want to remind everyone that in these 15 minutes we hope the hope is we have fun make a friend one of the core principles of Colonel is to has to be subversive to subvert the status quo and have fun so so yeah just and and and just to go back it's a playful art together and you'll find in kernel a lot of the discussions are around what do words mean and and playing around with with words and changing the format of how we look at the words we commonly see in our day-to-day lives all right so the hope for today is we're gonna have um perhaps two juntos a junto is as I mentioned a group discussion where we try to discuss a topic in web 3 or a topic that is kind of similar or I guess a topic that is adjacent to a tree and in our case the first juneto that we'll be holding is about trust so in kernel this is kind of how we introduce Colonel fellows trust is something that we hear about a lot in blockchain it's about trustless systems it's about building transactions and building trust around these transactions but one thing we can kind of try and explore is what does trust mean in the context outside of crypto so what is trust what what would a world without trust be would it be richer or poorer and so this leads to I guess our first junto and the hope is we get all of you guys to to think about trust and in groups of three and four tell a story not related to crypto about a moment where trust grew in your world so um a lot of us spend a lot of time talking about trust in the concept of blockchain transaction so let's try to flip that a little bit um who do you trust and why and then tell a story about a moment where trust grew in your world so some of the colonel fellows are part of your group so they'll be facilitating some of these discussions and so yeah so let's get started I love the laughter foreign thank you foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign check everyone we will probably end in about three minutes but please keep the conversations going foreign foreign last one minute foreign thank you everyone so let's keep the discussions moving what I hope like that that this exploration of trust for for everyone is kind of given you uh like some other threats to pull around trust when we talk about trust in web3 a lot of it as I mentioned is informed about the blockchain about trustless protocols um but if we're going to be building an interactive and regenerative Commons I think there's going to be more to that than just the just the technology it's not it's going to be about conversations it's going to be about the communities that we're building these for and I want to spend a little bit of time around this game by Nikki case um if just do a search for the game of trust by Nicki case and this is one I would say one very very wonderful internet artifact to kind of get you to understand more about trust and what happens in that game is you play the game and you you realize that trust is it has many facets like sometimes the story there is that uh during the world during World War One there is an event where where a ceasefire happened and that was mostly because because people were already in close proximity with each with each other even though they were like on different sides of the war and and that kind of gives you a different look into how distrust less or trustful systems are built um so and within Nikki cases uh video or a game essay he says that what what or she says that what builds trust is repeat interactions possible win wins and low miscommunication so uh so when we think of trust in the context of web3 is there any space for what we're building to do this as well uh are there are other communities that were building these systems for and kind of making sure that we're making pro-social systems to be able to build better trust around the commas in the communities that we're building all right so let's continue on I think uh now that we got a hang of how to do these juntos let's do one more um and the next one is more around Customs around community and Commons I know when we talk about comments it's a term that has I guess a lot of different meanings as well aside from trust and in kernel one thing that we also think of is we feel that web3 and the technology that is given to us by ethereum and all these other protocols is we're able to build new communities or a rather old communities in future form so a lot of communities have Customs a lot of comments have rituals that we do and that kind of defines how these uh comments and how these communities form and how we design the systems that that we do unintended outcome for so the discussion for the next for the next junto is what are your favorite Customs or rituals and what customers might have noticed here in Bogota for that last few days you've been here or if you're a local tell tell all of us what Customs are are nice in Bogota so this may be religious secular cultural or otherwise a custom it's just something that we do we take for granted might be something very simple right but something that that all of us do as part of a community and yeah please please start the discussion anyways thank you together foreign foreign thank you experience excuse me foreign thank you because foreign thank you so it would be nice realizing yourself pictures thank you just under time check everyone we'll we'll move on to the next section in three minutes but please keep the conversations going foreign foreign foreign to show you move in one minute [Music] thank you you know like all right I'm sorry I have to stop the conversations but we we need to move on and I hope you were able to know more about some customs that you don't know about um some different perspectives on how to build communities and how communities are built around these customs and I want to take a few seconds to talk about this as well so I mentioned Colonel a lot of the thinking in kernel is not just on the technological side we we also look in with at a lot of I guess the Arts and the social sciences some of the some of the people we I guess the some of the the good writers and people that we learn from are people like Ivan Ilitch where he says in tools for conviviality institutions are functional when they promote a delicate balance between what people can do for themselves and what tools at the service of anonymous institutions can do for them so a lot of these comments sometimes we feel like we're just building them right now but a lot of the great sociologists a lot of the people like James cars who talks about infinite games we hear about some other things also like ecosystems by EO Wilson so there's so much knowledge that we can take from from what people have been building there's a lot of knowledge in the Indigenous systems as well for example that that we frankly don't take the time to take a look at the complementary opposite of scarcity for example is abundance it's not abundance ladder it is reciprocity when we and scarcity is is something that a lot of us really focus around in web 3 like virtual scarcity artificial scarcity so think of that term think of what that means in the context of not just crypto but in the things that we're building then we might get a more complete I guess understanding of the the Commerce that we aspire to build um so a Commerce is a space which is established by custom we must consider the reciprocity based custom we might create in our new web tree contexts so we have around 10 to 13 minutes and I want I guess I want us to spend a little bit of time and try to do this last junto we have just a quick amount of time but maybe we can rush through it and this is also one of the topics that we discuss very deeply in kernel is it's about gifts and gifting a lot of the indigenous economies I mentioned earlier a lot of them have gift economies where it's not about scarcity but about abundance so maybe it's worth exploring what that term means to all of us what is a gift so so in our groups discuss what is the best gift you've ever given or one that you've ever received and yeah so this is our last June 2 and I have a few more slides after this but please discuss we have around 10 minutes to do so so yeah laughs [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] next episode [Music] foreign [Music] so ethereum is all of these things you don't have a grand theory of blockchains yet but everyone understands it's like the piece of our understanding together so what does that mean to the appearance Community each of these perspectives and depending which perspective you aligning with the most you'll have different intuitions about what our community should be really about the financial system then you probably imagine you know financial institutions Traders like friendly providers and maybe even Regulators just decentralized for modeling time check again everyone last three minutes thank you foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] for cutting the conversations but we're almost at time but I I hope that you guys have been able to connect with the folks in your group and maybe maybe just take a little bit of time also to thank everyone to who participated in the conversations and I'll spend a few more slides just to close everything out but we mentioned earlier about reciprocity and gifting I think that's something that's not covered at all in a lot of the a lot of the conversations that you'll probably hear in crypto conferences giving and receiving well are features of a healthy human and Upstream a healthy ecosystem so we can kind of think about the comments that we're building and kind of look at it from that lens right it's gifting a part of the ecosystems that you are building or that you are part of and what would it mean to kind of give really and the one one story I remember from vitalik was the the reason that he got into ethereum was he he wrote something on bitcoin and someone gifted him uh Bitcoin and that was kind of what spurred ethereum and that's why we're all here so gifting might be the spark that leads to something really really wonderful and and yeah and just to recap we talked about trust about comments and gifting giving and receiving will and um it was all just a long-winded way I guess to to hope that you guys make friends uh in the last 50 minutes maybe someone to go around Bogota while you're here and um and yeah and I guess I just also want to end with a quote that I just recently knew of because of the people talking in Colonel and this was by um by EO Wilson EO Wilson just recently passed this December and um before then he was I guess one of the Giants in Social biology and someone asked him like how in in just a few sentence how would you describe what sociobiology is and he says is selfishness beats altruism within groups altruistic groups beat selfish groups everything else is commentary and he kind of got that from Rabbi hildel's interpretation when he was asked what the meaning of the Torah which was uh what is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor neighbor everything else is commentary so I guess it's worth thinking of that at the Golden Rule right um for some first principles are sometimes things that we forgot forget in our fast moving life so the hope is this slow down this conversation with other people has given you a glimpse into what it would be what would it look like we had an inter more interactive and more regenerative comments and yeah and I want to take all of the Cardinal guides as well thank you for helping facilitate and if you want to know more about Colonel just reach out to me so thank you everyone thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] there is [Music] foreign thank you foreign yeah don't mean to rush you I was just like to be set up [Music] I don't think I I will yeah that would be great [Music] if you're in Mississippi [Music] foreign [Music] um maybe ask the AV guy to so actually I don't know if I told you this but I'm making a cabinet how's it going what's up [Music] what's up Kevin nice to meet you [Music] just one leg we're gonna hand off we're gonna hand off okay there we go um foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] go ahead test test all right the microphone is working you're ending your conversations you're ready to learn about civil resistance the doors are closing it's my first time trying to Jedi mind trick an audience and I don't know if it worked but hopefully I've got your attention now so hey I'm Kevin owaki I'm one of the co-founders of Bitcoin and I am joined here by my comrade Kevin Olsen and we're going to talk about the infinite game of civil resistance in this Workshop this Workshop will be about 25 minutes of me talking about the infinite game of civil resistance and then we're going to actually get into some code and take a look at Bitcoin passport which is a money Lego for building more civil resistance from there so find a seat and we will uh we'll get going so again I'm playing the role of Storyteller in this room Uh Kevin Olson is our engineering lead at coindao and is going to be talking about the passport money Lego and how you can use it to create civil resistance and we also have an appearance by Kevin McAllister who is another Kevin a very Kevin heavy lineup in the tie-in with Kevin McAllister is that he's actually also in an infinite game between adversaries uh robbers that are trying to rob his house and he is trying to prevent it so we're going to talk about civil resistance through the allegory of Home Alone in home alone 2. so the agenda for this talk is why civil resistance is an important problem to resent to to address we're going to characterize the Civil resistance problem and then we're going to talk about a civil resistance money Lego so just very briefly civil resistance is just basically how do you prevent sock puppet accounts in your web3 based system how do you create more one human one vote based systems in the web three in this room we are are all physical humans and it's pretty clear that there's one human per chair unless we're getting weird if the session gets packed but online it's actually really hard to tell that you've got a one human one boat system and that is what civil resistance is about so maybe I'll start with a quick crowd engagement how many people have used Bitcoin grants all right just a pulse check but I'm really proud that get going grants has supported so much public goods funding in the ethereum ecosystem and is the magic of quadratic funding that is how Bitcoin grants works and the why it's the reason why it's so magical we're going to do a quick quadratic funding calculation but before I do that I just want to say that vitalik buterin Glenn Weil and Zoe hitzig are the ones that actually came up with quadratic funding and I view it as this like perfect alien Crystal intelligence that I just like inherited and we're the ones who are kind of bringing it to the world of course along with CLR fund and some other great projects that are doing qf so anyway the way qf works is that every quarter on git coin there's three million dollars worth of matching and we distributed contemporaneously which is just a fancy word for at the same time as a crowdfunding campaign and with quadratic funding if more people contribute to your Grant then you will get more funding from the matching pool so in this example both grants get ten dollars but Grant get one gets way more of the matching pool because it has more identities associated with it and what what's really cool is this this gets you off your bum in order to contribute to public goods because now a dollar worth of impact can have a hundred dollar a dollar donation can be worth a hundred dollars worth of impact or a ten dollar donation can be worth a thousand dollars worth of impact there was a threat during kick going grandparent 13 where a one dollar donation to coin Center which is a grant that which is a project that does uh lobbying in DC a one dollar donation to a coin Center would give a thousand dollars worth of impact and people thought it was a scam because the matching multiple was so high that's how powerful quadratic funding is and if you look at it at a systemic level we hit the meme number 69 million dollars worth of funding of uh for public goods on bitcoin if you look at a systemic level the uh contribution graph at Bitcoin grants is what I'm most proud of so this is every Edge in the network is a transaction and every node is a user or a grant and if you map this out you're kind of coming up with a mesh network of the preferences of the ethereum community in which public goods that they want to fund so from up and coming projects like uniswap and urine that are that are uh that are up and coming projects in the ecosystem or just pure public goods like Prismatic and Lighthouse those are the kind of things that have been funded on bitcoin grants and it is the goal of Bitcoin grants to build a channel for greater combinations of strength and intelligence to come together using quadratic funding to measure the preferences of its Community but there is a problem not everything is great in Bitcoin land and it's the Civil attackers so Grant number two when they realize they're getting jipped by the funding can just make up more identities and then all of a sudden they get all the magic Bull and that is the Civil resistance problem if you're me and you're the founder of get coin then you start to realize that Bitcoin kind of looks like a Castle in the Sky Bitcoin depends on bitcoin grants which depends on quadratic funding which depends on civil resistance and there is no good money Lego for civil resistance so I did not choose this problem this this problem chose me but here we are public goods are good and important and we are trying to solve the Civil resistance problem at Bitcoin but the vision is larger than Bitcoin what if we could build a money Lego for civil resistance we could go from plutocratic systems dominated by tokens and capital to one human one vote systems that are dominated by people and I just want to camp on this point for a little bit because if we want web3 to go mainstream it can't just be targeted at rich people forever it needs to be targeted at everyday people whose Financial lives are their jobs in their community and not just the Investments that they're making in the s p 500. there you go so one human one vote is good um and so we've used civil resistance as this uh this sort of prism that if we can solve for civil resistance then not only can we build quadratic funding we can build quadratic voting we can build Genie coefficient measurements there's basically measurements of inequality in these systems we can build Ubi based systems we can do one person one vote Dallas or better better air drops in general we can build data collectives and uh and build more human-centric dials from there so that's the importance of civil resistance why it's an important problem to address and um I'm going to spend the next part of The Talk characterizing The Civil resistance game as I've seen during the last 15 rounds at Bitcoin and then we're going to talk a little bit about a civil resistance money Lego preview it's called Bitcoin passport and it's how we're trying to at least Advance civil resistance in the ecosystem so let's start by meeting our adversaries this is my fun this is like where I just get to have fun during the talk script kitties I know this guy because I used to be one of them when I was 14 and I would just download script off the internet and hack into stuff and it's just the script kidney Persona is just kind of like someone who's copying the scripts in the hacks that other people are putting out there they don't have any real skill or ambition they're just kind of looking for the cheapest way to to make a buck online one level above the script Kitty in the level of sophistication in planning is you got your petty criminals maybe these people are able to run a little bit more of a sophisticated operation they have a little bit more Capital to dedicate to civil attacking your system but they're still not really producing their own software or or ecosystem in order to do it and I don't want to only have this talk about civil attacks on a moral Vector because I think there's a rational economic reason to attack the get-going grants matching pool and I don't think it's wise for us as people who are building civil resistance to moralize this too much it could just be a rational economic person who's kind of struggling that wants to make a quick buck and I think that uh that's an actor that we have to plan for too all right this one's just this one's just a cheap shot so the story behind this slide is that there was a salon on D5 Dev that made his protocol look more active by just making up personas and uh these are some of the memes that came off of Twitter from that organized crime so basically you got your mafias you got your state sponsors hacking groups these are the kind of people who can develop zero days and can attack not only Bitcoin grants but can attack the entire ethereum ecosystem when I talked to Danny Ryan and I about the merge uh we talked a little bit about like the software supply chain that underpins the merge like Linux and all the software libraries that are underneath that the firmware uh supply chain and organized crime is sophisticated scary because they're sophisticated enough to develop hacks in zero days for your entire software supply chain and then above that you've got your nation states you've got your North Korea's you've got your adversarial cyber security sort of attackers and these people you know like basically if you think that all Warfare is going online in the future then Bitcoin grants and ethereum can just be collateral Warfare in or collateral damage in the nation state uh Warfare game so those are our adversaries or at least a good swath of those adversaries and now that we have identified those adversaries both in theory and on bitcoin grants we can characterize the Civil resistance game and the first criteria or I guess the zeroth criteria since we're developers here and we're zero offsetting our our nature is an adversarial nature there's a zero-sum game between the Civil attackers on bitcoin and the Civil Defenders who want to defend the matching pool kind of like Harrison Ford and Indiana Jones I may be dating myself in ethereum ecosystem it's all gen Z but for us Millennials Harrison Ford trying to capture this golden trophy I think was pretty cool or I'd like to invite another Kevin to the stage and that's Kevin McAllister who's trying to defend his home from an adversary that wants to get in and I think steal his presence I'm not actually really sure what the the criminals in in the Home Alone were after but uh there's some hilarious results from that so there's an adversary nature adversarial nature to the Civil resistance game on bitcoin and I want to note that not all adversaries are motivated by the exact same thing you've got basically varying levels of sophistication in your adversaries and resourcefulness of your adversaries from script kitties up to nation states but a various amount of a diversity of motivations some people just want to make want to do it for the walls they're in it for the thrill of up Bitcoin and like the posts that they're going to put on Twitter after it and so it's not just an economic reason why people want to get civil resistance some people are in it for the thrill some people are in it for the walls and some people just like hard problems and because of the diversity of sophistication and resources into intelligences and motivations you get a lot of diversity and methods of civil attackers in your system and I've seen this live on bitcoin grants in the past and in the Civil rings that we've discovered and so you have to plan for plurality at the base layer of how you solve civil resistance um and I think this kind of informs where where I think that we need to go with civil resistance because there's there's basically four ways to create civil resistance you can do it with biometric pre-oriented off-chain data like your disco data backpack or your ceramic uh your ceramic profile you can turn that into a verifiable credential which Bitcoin passport stores on ceramic only non-personally identifiable information and so all of this data is is stored off chain and then you can build an aggregator or an aggregate or if you're a meme Lord like I am these days and that can be created used to create a personhood score that is is basically like you can think of a personhood score as being ten dollars worth of cost of forgery in your Bitcoin passport so someone who has a 10 personhood score is ten dollars to forge their Identity or someone with a ten thousand personhood score is ten thousand dollars worth of simple resistance and you as adapt developer integrating Bitcoin passport can give that much amount of rational economic rewards to them because the cost of forgery is x amount and Bitcoin can give x amount of that matching pool to them so I think that we do not want to create a panopticon we are not web 2 and privacy and sovereignty has to be a criteria for how we solve civil resistance the need to avoid plutocracy is another thing that we've learned from web 2 as being being very important here so basically in web 2 Facebook and Zuck owns your data and how do we create a system in web3 that is diverse and pluralistic and has the network effects of creating digital identity but doesn't become captured by a a rational economic actor so basically I like to go back to this idea from political theory about the consent of the governed which is basically the idea that the government's legitimacy in using State force or state action is only is only valid when it's Justified and consented to by the people that it governs so basically what you don't want to have is is basically like a company that owns all of your identity data that's governed by shareholders and the management of that company has a fiduciary duty to maximize value for the shareholders because you know what's going to happen to your data in that situation it's just going to be used to sell more ads against you so with Git coin one of the reasons why we launched the Dow and there are many is that we wanted to be be governed by the community that we served and this is a distribution of the Bitcoin voting power as of the launch in Q2 of 2021. so basically uh community members like Trent Van Epps Austin Griffith Linda Z left Harris Griffin are the ones that are delegating your voting power to with GTC and they're the ones who are making decisions on behalf of the system and on the long Arc of things even I will have no power in Bitcoin as I eventually disaffiliate as I disaffiliate leadership and these people are actually in charge of governing the data in the protocol that we have in the future so plutocracy is a big thing that I think that we need to solve for another thing we need to solve for is called collusion and it's basically one layer above the stack of the Civil resistance problem it goes like this Hey Kevin Olson I see that you've got a person's herd score of a hundred dollars I'll give you 50 bucks if I can borrow your ID yeah there you go and so basically what happens is as people realize that they can get around the Civil resistance in the system by colluding with each other then more of the people who are neutral to the system begin to turn red because the rational economic incentive is to attack the system and and not defend the system conclusion is this whole other category of problems but once you have a solid basis of what the identities are in the system then you can start to solve conclusion and this kind of gets me to my next point which is we need to build systemic defensibility into this and that's hard because it's an infinite game between attackers and Defenders there's not a point in which the Civil attackers are going to stop defending the system so all we can do is take advantage of the fact that we own the battle arena in which they're attacking the system and over time turn the dials so that the blue team is more empowered than the red team in this iterative evolutionary infinite game between the Civil attackers and the Defenders so if you Empower a Sentry a blue person a blue team person to prevent that red team person from colluding then basically instead of infinitely growing into into occlusion attack you basically stop at it at its source so basically you get to a point where the blue team can say oh this again this pattern matches against something that I've seen and you can prevent the Civil attack from going there is a plurality of types of attacks that will happen in these systems and so because of that there's going to be a plurality of defenses that are going to be need to be built into this system and the idea is to make it so that it is not worth an attacker's time to attack the system you hear vitalik talk about this this property of systemic defensibility when he talks about proof of stake and how much more expensive it is to attack the proof of stake consensus protocol than it is to defend the the protocol so basically we want to have that same property inside of our civil resistance Battleground which by the way has grown a lot since Bitcoin grants round one when it was just a bunch of end users some of them were red team and they're only after a 25k matching pool over the last 15 rounds we've iterated a lot and this is what it looks like now so the red team is the attackers The Blue Team are people that use get coin uh data and protocols in order to solve it so you've got the end users who are now going after three million dollars worth of matching but in order to get to it they have to go through passport which is this sovereignty aware privacy is preserving uh data store for figuring out who's a civil attacker or not has to go through pairwise which is a really elegant way of solving conclusion that I'm not going to get into now but I can send you a reference on it and then they can get to the grants and only by going through the all these different blue team exercises are they able to get to the three million dollars in matching proactively they have to go through them and then there's a reactive data sort of analysis team in which you've got people who are looking at the open data coming out of passport nothing privacy like pii or anything like that but they're basically looking for new attacks in the system and this is how we build systemic defensibility into the system mm-hmm um one of the cool things about Bitcoin passport and what I'm doing now is its modularity and forkability and this is the part of the presentation where I get to raise my hand and I say I'm sorry that I built Bitcoin grants to be centralized and monolithic back in the day but I will never do it again because I believe in modularity and super modularity and the ability to Fork this protocol so anyone here if you disagree with how Bitcoin is doing passport you can Fork it away and I'm going to tell you how um in just a second and I think this is one of the benefits of decentralization is basically the fact that anyone can go in and can uh Fork get coin and the fact that it is governed by its community so basically what this looks like is in that three-state state machine anyone can go in and add their own stamp adding more data the passport should be consuming that contributes to civil resistance and I think that that's really cool because if we can add more data to the system then we can catch more simple attackers as they come down the pike in this Looney Tunes adversarial game um the cool thing about Bitcoin passport is it's kind of like Kirby it can swallow all of the different data that exists on chain and off chain in the web3 ecosystem is stored in a privacy preserving and Sovereign way and when we have a plurality of attackers a plurality of stamps is what's going to help us uh build a stronger Foundation to get those attackers say that you don't agree with get coins personhood scoring algorithm say you think bright ID is worth a hundred and ten dollars as a stamp or not fifty dollars or you can go in and you can add your own scoring algorithm so basically this is a way to create an economy of marketplaces that have opinionated values about how we reduce different data attributes into different scores and this is plurality at the base layer that we're sort of building in it's not git coin saying this is what the Civil score is of your of your thing it's it's basically the plurality of people who are involved in passport debating these in the open economy of ideas and by the way if you want to use the passport infrastructure the state machine that we've built not for civil resistance so you want to build like a regen score that talks about how worthy of an under cloudized loan you are you can use this pipeline for that too it doesn't even have to be about civil resistance and then the final layer is that you can add personhood score to your d-app it's basically a couple lines of code to add it to your sign in with ethereum and instead of just getting back your web3. youth.accounts from the system them in the balance you can also get the personhood score back from Bitcoin passport so adding personhood score to your dap is kind of how we think about proliferating a simple resistant ecosystem to the rest of the world all right we're in the home stretch now I got two more criteria for you and then we're going to get into actually building stuff with Kevin so the need to build Network effects I like to uh introduce this one with a riddle and that riddle is if I build the most perfectly academic civil resistance algorithm and no one ever uses it doesn't make a sound the cool thing about Bitcoin grants is that we've got 700 000 data points that are already happening about civil resistance and um so basically the more users use Bitcoin passport the more stamps are loaded into the system the more reason there is for d-apps to consume the Civil resistance in the system which means that more users will get their Bitcoin passport and that will create more stamps and I could go on in this infinite Loop for the rest of our time but out of respect for you we will move on to the evolutionary nature of this game which is the part of the game that I've become fascinated with and the reason why we called this talk the infinite game of civil resistance is because of the of the infinite evolutionary nature of this game I'd like to invite my friend Kevin McAllister back in order to illustrate this Kevin McAllister is fighting in an adversarial game some organized criminals who are trying to get into his house and he does it by icing but um and you know what's funny is like over time it like increasingly approaches like a YouTube cover video of like the shot the shocked face here but uh I'm not here to judge home alone all right so anyway basically iterative evolutionary game is where we were uh basically you recognize on the left that this is the battle arena that get coin bitcoin's fundamental advantage in this is that it owns the battle arena we can set up micro machines in the front or like the paint can to the face to the Civil attackers and there's an instant feedback that happens with the mechanisms and then there's daily feedback as people wake up and they check their computer every day and then there's a quarterly feedback as we want as we run a uh around every every quarter so this is an iterative evolutionary infinite game between the good guys and the bad guys and the goal of this whole system is to increase the total personhood score in the get coin Grant system over time to be hundreds of millions of dollars worth of civil resistance and that will allow us to bootstrap this ecosystem of democratic Dallas by increasing the total personhood score of the system building in systemic defensibility into the system from there so that is the characterization of the Civil resistance game and basically I want to talk about how that is informed how we've built get coin grants uh and Bitcoin passport so basically the tldr of this last section is the Bitcoin grants around 69 which is another meme number uh I think that's it will be in 2027 at this point will be privacy and sovereignty where it will avoid plutocracy it will avoid collusion it will be systemically defensible it will have Network effects it already does it will be modular and forkable it'll have decentralization and it'll Embrace an evolutionary nature of this game you can tell that because I have this Castle in the Sky of Bitcoin grants and we've fallen into having the Civil resistance problem the bitcoin's taking this problem pretty seriously and because of that we want to be a shelling point for creating more civil resistance along with the plurality of Partners I see many of you in this room right now around solving civil resistance and so it's basically a plural approach to this problem and I think that like where we've kind of landed is that we've built this thing Through Blood Sweat and Tears called Bitcoin passport which you can get at passport.getcoin.com and basically we want this to be the part of your journey that enables more civil resistance for you and your community so you can integrate it into your D app with one line of code it might be overselling this before Olson's talk okay I'm embellishing it's 10 lines of code but you don't have to deal with like the seven criteria and like all the Home Alone references of rolling your own and the whole idea again is to bootstrap an ecosystem not only of civil resistant grants on bitcoin but civil resistance and more democracy for web 3 at large and like I said I want to make web free more useful for Everyday People by making it so that there are the apps that are more democratic and provide utility to the median member of humanity instead of just well moneyed and that is what we're here for at get coin and get coin grants so thank you for listening to my rant I'm going to hand it over to Kevin Olson and we're actually going to do some code from here thank you [Applause] hello that's a lot that's a lot to follow um I think we're gonna slow down a little bit hope y'all yeah yeah yeah yeah eventually uh okay cool conference Wi-Fi yes okay um cool um so I I had the pleasure of stepping in for a wakia tapcon in Berlin so uh I I left giving that talk feeling like I wanted to give this talk which is uh like what did we actually build right which is uh hopefully just as exciting I don't know it is more than one line of code though and what I'm really going to do is try to orient you all as like future builders on top of passport how do you use it how do you use it for your your apps or your communities and really just kind of point you at a lot of resources so this is going to be kind of a big overview of what we've built and why we've built it the way we've built it I think that's kind of an important thing um and and then how to take that forward um I got a slido pole I'm gonna pull up on my phone so I can follow along if you all want to scan that you should ask questions there and hopefully you have enough time at the end to answer them I'm doing it on my side so you know how long it takes cool I'm starting to see phones go down so I'm gonna say we're good all right cool so um here's the agenda we're gonna do the Y passport like what problem does it solve and I think Kevin did a great job of the big meta y um what is passport who's currently using it um and then how to do it yourself right so why pass for it right um Kevin's talk write the infinite game um you you have these systems that are vulnerable to civil attacks right um some of the things we're seeing right now anything is doing kind of voting quadratic funding quadratic voting it's particularly susceptible to this you also have communities that are providing benefits right if you have like some sort of uh paying you're paying gas fees on behalf of something or you have some poets or or things like this you're giving away people Farm these things right so passport is a great way to uniquely uh sort of identify the humans in your system uh and only provide those benefits to the people who are really going to be using it and aren't just you know rational actors exploiting your system right like there might be an economic gaming there's an airdrop in the future you get why they're doing it but ultimately it's a destructive uh like element in you know the governance of your your system or the benefits not getting to the right people right they're they're they're distorting the effect of that so the high level requirements so this is so Kevin stock kind of give us gives us the sort of parameters for the design space that we went into we want to do privacy preservation so like as a first goal we're not going to dox anybody with passport this has been a huge concern of ours right so from day one our goal was to make sure there was no opportunity for us to like leak pii or anything like that so personally identifiable information outside to anyone right so we don't store any pii in the get coin passport this for sure you can go check it out it's not there else we want to make sure that we're decentralized right we don't want to be a point of of capture for the audience we don't want to be making you know we don't want to go evil get coin and make bad decisions um we also want to make sure that we're adaptive right so that we can in this evolutionary game continue making improvements and lastly when we pluralistic we want to invite a lot of people into solving this problem with us and making sure that we're actually getting you know the best ideas put forward you know forking our protocol or just like adapting it for your group right we don't necessarily make our decisions the ones that everyone has to use so we tried to make this as a real like as a toolbox that you can take forward into your group I already did this um maybe some of the the details on here one of the interesting things about uh capture is we want to make sure that the data was fully public we ended up using the ceramic Network for that uh and sticking to the Open Standards of dids and VCS um keeping going here this is the part where I was going to demo it but I don't trust the uh the Wi-Fi so I'm gonna spare everyone watching me wait for this thing to load um who's actually built a Bitcoin passport for donating to get coin grants okay so these are the folks who participated in rounds 14 and 15. if you wanted your matching bonus you went here and did this maybe I'll just like use your imagination and work with me here you connect your wallet we instantly provision an empty passport for you you go through these different uh identity attestations uh connecting your Twitter that's an oauth flow uh GTC staking was a project that got built on the side where you could stake uh GTC on each other uh to prove kind of humanness or kind of web of trust uh that's an online uh that's a very that's a web three um endpoint we're just hitting a Json RPC proving that your wallet address is on that contract and pulling that back and verifying it what's behind the scene on all of these things is just a little Json object right that's what all the various Bible credential is and we're just proving that we observed that fact at that point of time VC gives you the ability to have like an expiration date things like this so for a period of time we're saying that we we've validated that they had an account at this point in time it's somewhat static data that's the interesting thing about VCS it goes with you you can actually download your passport there's an ability if you have it on your phones you want to play with this you can actually just pull down the whole passport yourself it's just Json object you can actually upload it you can kind of skip the whole ceramic thing if you want but we've chosen to use ceramic as the sort of data layer to back this um oh gosh man I'm just front running my own slides here I'm so sorry everybody uh one cool thing you can do this is interesting with ceramic and just to kind of prove the open data thing go check out this uh Sarah scan right on Sarah scan it's like an indexer of the ceramic Network you can pull up every uh instance of the passport uh schema that's been filled right that people have written to um there's 60 000 passports that have been built right people have made many many more stamps uh so behind that what's interesting is in our last round grants around 15 we actually had 38 000 that were submitted To Us by our users so there's a whole bunch of passports that are getting built and used externally I'm going to get into that a little bit there's already some communities are starting to adopt this um this is a little preview of what you get to see when you go to search scan um you can click through you can actually see the raw data it's it's super interesting so okay some background Concepts so I've kind of said these things but I want to make sure you all have the references I'll make these slides available there's a lot of links in here and I hope people kind of use this as a reference you know as they get started so decentralized identifiers uh who's heard of that oh okay great I'll have to talk about this okay cool um what about did pkh cool so this is a deterministic way of generating dids from your private key your public key uh you you have this ability to deterministically make sure that every wallet has the ability to generate a did um it's it's a bit of a subset I think it's even like a what's the word for it uh preliminary non-ratified non-conformant spec it's like proposed thank you um I'm looking at Evan up here for um and then we have VCS behind that verified credentials um VC is a really interesting spec um because they're so Broad and this is actually some of the criticisms of these specs is that there's a lot of interpretation and room to kind of do whatever you want with it um VCS as we've used them are really just an attestation that we observed some things it's like the slimmest subset of that um there's people who are using them for more interesting or more data Rich environments ceramic who's used ceramic or heard of it okay okay um I like to say that it's kind of a convenience layer on top of ipfs I don't know if that's they would all agree with me um but it's a really nice way to have mutable streams of data that users control right so you are the only person with your did that you control that can write into your stream and through some of their libraries you can grant access to an app to write into your stream it's individually writable self-sovereign but it's totally open data right so it's kind of an interesting it's a really good fit for these use cases why we chose it but it's pretty unique we don't have a database we're not storing any you know VCS of everybody it's all happening here and you control your stream as a user of the ceramic Network so we really are relying on this as the data layer for passport um we host a production node ourself which is kind of uh interesting we also host a test net node so if you're developing this is all in the docs we'll get to that later um but yeah okay Spruce did kit everyone uses Spruce same with ethereum yeah did kit is amazing and this Bruce team is super nice so is the ceramic team the ceramic team is really really nice too they joined us uh for like daily calls like during the round right like they were really committed to making sure that everything went well and continuing to be really uh tight with us so Joel he's in the audience thank you you're awesome um and then Rocco from Spruce has been awesome in helping us uh manage did there's some interesting stuff later on that I'm gonna get into here too uh so high level concept so this is the whole of of what passport really is right so there's the there's the app right there's there's passport which was that screenshot that was going to demo but I'm not going to now you have ceramic which is where all the data actually sits you're using these open data standards which is interesting thing with ceramic is you have the ability to Define uh schemas so the data that's going into ceramic is kind of being enforced at that data layer that it's conformant to the did in the VC spec or the VC spec really right so the if you want to write a stamp which is a VC uh you can just use the same model the same schema that we've published to the ceramic Network and it'll be conformant right so you can't get the sort of like drift of of data schema when you're relying on the get coin passport stamp or the VC spec that we've published um there's a passport Authority so this is something we had to build we had to build a back end uh where we issue the VCS from so VCS are not uh necessarily like a first-class citizen yet so when we're observing these attestations we're Min we're issuing these VCS back up to go into your passport um this is kind of a current point centralization I'll get into this a little bit later um you'll see it in the code base too there's this IM server trust bonus this is how if you've used passport to build a trust bonus um we this is the part where you actually submit it to get coin this is the scoring piece this is all available inside the the coin uh web repo you can read how we did it's all kind of in Python and stuff the SDK has some easier ways of doing scoring but this is kind of like the full life cycle right um and then there's this get coin scoring service that we'll get into cool um I'm not going to show this this is a pretty detailed uh like swim Lane of like exactly all the calls but if you really wanted to get into it and see exactly where like all of the sort of sequence of like calls between front and the back you'll see it here um that line that link is live and open feel free to check it out uh the passport SDK itself so this is up on bitcoin this is actually how you can build on top of passport the most easily so um I'm gonna get a little bit more into the how a little bit later current points essentially I hinted at this so the IM server is where we're actually observing we're like issuing these VCS from so you if you want to use a score that uses VCS from git coin you have to kind of white list RVC server but this allows anybody else to also issue VCS and the scoring part of the SDK allows you to decide which uh VC issuers you trust right so you give that control kind of Downstream anybody can write into your passport if you give them access to it right so if you're a did holder and you go to a forked version of Bitcoin uh it was a passport you can give access to your stream to that front end they could write into it but if they're not hitting our DC issue in service the they can't issue their own so where do where do you decide who to trust which VCS are worth trusting it's at that scoring layer right when you come back around and you actually see like what what's in a passport you can see uh through the the VC which server issued that uh that particular credential um and then lastly our score is currently our point of trust right you have to if you're handing your passport to us you're working within the get coin ecosystem fine you can trust us in the future as people start using other scores you kind of start making scores as a service things like this they're going to become a point of trust right you're going to have to rely on that scoring service to uh you know to to hand like to uh be doing the right thing with the passports that you hand to it right so if you don't want to go through the hassle of scoring a passport yourself reading the dids doing the scoring you have to actually uh rely on somebody else this is kind of just a maybe worth calling out okay so what can we do in the future people can build their own IM servers and start issuing their own VCS that's pretty straightforward uh you can host your own ceramic node you could help us especially when ceramic moves into this compose DB in the future I'm hinting it that uh again I don't think anyone from ceramic is here thinking correct if I'm wrong but I heard q1 of next year um this is a great way to start synchronizing data between nodes and pinning it and making sure that the data is available in more locations and then lastly scoring help us build more scores faster and note let us be a point of centralization I said I was gonna go slower but then I started going fast yeah okay so who's already doing this so we actually have a community of people who are kind of picking this up and starting to build on top of it um each Staker just popped into our Discord and told us that they built this which is super cool so thanks Remy um what they're using passport for actually is giving roles inside their Discord so you can go into this Discord Channel um they pop you out to do a little signing and then you come back around and the bot runs through your passport reads all the data in and gives you a score and it automatically assigns you a role in the Discord so they were having an issue apparently with people getting uh you know multiple roles or bad roles and they want to make sure they're real people and not Bots super use case and it's all available there check out their uh their GitHub repo bankless Academy um I didn't link this uh but it's actually there so if you go to the bankless academy uh GitHub it's you can even just like search the code for passport and you can see their implementation there I might after the fact drop a link in this um DDA uh similarly just like kind of tweeted this out and then jumped in our Discord and told us that they built this um they did some cool stuff too where so this is Vanquis Academy is kind of a rabbit hole-esque right you go through you complete some sort of challenges and you get like a like a mint po app mint Kudos at the end people were farming this um and they needed some civil protection what's really cool actually the way they do this is because they're able to read the data in the background you sign in like with ethereum you have like they know your wallet address that you're completing this challenge where you're going to get that that mint Kudos back to you they just in the background just go read your passport you already have one like they just see what stamps and they say okay cool good enough like we'll let you in we minted this happened to me I was like I thought this was live like I thought you know like I didn't see the passport submission thing um so you don't actually have to do this right you can just in the background go look up a passport and see what stamps are on it without any kind of clumsy flow if you don't have the stamps in your passport you don't have a passport it'll just prompt you to go create one and it'll let you in and get you through into the uh the the service um other cool thing too is they're they're doing the like the caching and this uh storing of duplicate stamps which is a thing we we can get into a little bit here too so how to actually get started so the obvious place to get started go to our docs docs.passport.getcoin.com there's a lot of like the high level stuff all the way through into the SDK and really hike how to get like through it um I think one of the most important things though is actually decide like when you're getting into like how to use the sdks like what you're really doing with it right and a lot of this comes down to like gating of a benefit or a community we're also seeing some people who have like interesting identity signals right we've had some people who have you know like uh like a kyc service or they have um uh like gitpo app just reached out and just built their own right they're like this is a cool thing it should be a stamp it should be in your passport um you can build uh interesting uh scoring mechanisms maybe you have some thoughts on what is a really good you know cost of forgery or scoring or personhood um build it right like all of these things are there and the raw materials are there in the toolbox in the SDK um I think I've kind of beat this up a little bit but the basic thing this is the trust bonus page I think you'll you'll see this is how we uh gate our community in service um adding a stamp gitpo app this is a pull request that they submitted uh right here for how to build a stamp this um again as it's a moving Target we're going to continuing improving the code base but right now this is a great way to get uh started to see exactly how to like add a stamp um you can take that PR move it forward we actually have a library of other PRS in our docs of like where we've added other different kinds of stamps so you can look to see you know how your uh you're kind of flow might map Best um Discord I think we've seen this but this is actually the Discord as the stamps this is another example I wanted to highlight this one's not like an like a this this one's an on-chain verification uh this one is not right so you have kind of these uh different flows I wanted to kind of highlight um this was a video that got submitted to our hackathon which is just great I hope it doesn't play okay um it's a great walkthrough if you really just you need to like the walkthrough and you want to watch someone like actually code through a full implementation of the SDK um uh Rask is the username uh did a great job and I think actually won our hackathon with this video so it's it's top-notch then lastly if you do build something tell us about it uh we got the showcase.passport where you'll see we've got eatstaker up there we've got our identity staking and we got like a lookup tool that the community submitted um we haven't gotten the uh the bankless one up here yet we're I think we're still waiting for them to apply into this but there's a form of call to action at the bottom just tells you've built it we want other people to find it um we'll link you to your uh you know your project into your uh your GitHub and then Alpha alert Kevin do you know we had an API this is super cool so when when I mentioned that we have this kind of like centralized you submit your passport to to get coin and we do all this stuff and we give you back this magical trust bonus we've busted this out as an API now so you actually can hit um this is the Swagger UI link but the the API is the same path there score.dpop um the the what's neat about this is you can you can actually post like a full uh passport to this and then uh you can read off different kinds of scores so we actually have like a weighted score which is what ships with the SDK so you can set up kind of a set of Weights this kind of alludes to Kevin's uh cost of forgery uh we also have this thing called Apu which is like this fingerprinting service we actually use for gr15 which takes like a cohort of passports have been submitted to us and we find the median value of uniqueness and you can kind of treat that as like you know below that threshold might be maybe not so trustworthy above that threshold is trustworthy assuming you have kind of a gaussian distribution of of users so the Apu score is kind of an interesting one different kind of scores available we're going to make this more fully featured but this is like literally shipped last week very like there's no docs on this this is the dock for y'all um but we're going to keep improving that and making sure that this becomes like a real like an easy way to start interacting with passport without having to go through necessarily hitting ceramic and reading it if you don't want to right you just have this as a way but we are storing off these these hashes and things like that for it and then in the future this is like the the thing we uh recently just uh spent some time on in the last couple weeks the team's looking at how to actually bring scoring on chains so one of the things you're going to run into if you're really trying to like uh enforce a certain score to interact with a contract is you're going to need to bring this on chain somehow uh the teams looked at a couple different routes and the ones looking most promising is using eip712s as an actual way to like create a recoverable um signed message on chain that you can then verify yourself as part of your like actual smart contract interactions so we're trying to bridge uh passport scores and and onto chain so you can actually start using them there so we're going to need this for Grants protocol as we go live your votes and things like that and your passport will need to be actually interacting with voting contracts so we needed ourselves and I think other people will too all right and that's it so maybe we look at that slido for some questions [Applause] cool okay the top question oh they're not really voted up but oh yeah okay they are okay how do we identify collusion how do we differentiate collusion from a situation where many people just like the same project assume sybils are solved um this is a great question I mean I think the real answer here is well okay two two answers um you can use Macy right like minimal anti-collusion infrastructure and you can make it impossible to verify who voted for what in a particular you know context this is what CLR fund's done and we've been looking at this ourselves actually for some of our Partnerships with with optimism um it's it's at the root level making it impossible so so Kevin gave me 50 bucks for my identity I could take the 50 bucks and then devote however I want there's no way for him to prove it this is the kind of concept behind Macy so you can have the secret ballot as the way to protect people from being able to you know the economic reward is impossible to validate right for the the people who are trying to bribe um I think more legitimate forms of collusion would be um me and Kevin you know we have a lot of similar ideas we share a name uh we might just vote really similarly on things right we actually belong to a community right this is really what like the dsoc paper that came out from Glenn vitalik and Puja is really talking about how do you identify communities um and how do you reward cross community uh you know like um pluralistic uh consent or not consent sorry what's a agreement or sort of like signals between communities I think in this environment you've got um some really interesting opportunities to sort of like sidestep collusion and just talk about homogeneous communities and how they're voting and rewarding cross-community so they think that's a nice sort of reframing of the problem yeah yeah I was just going to add that Bitcoin uses something called pairwise bonding which is uh I guess we're all built on vitalik ideas but uh it's an idea from vitalik to basically Bond people who vote similar to each other um algorithmically and and basically the way the algorithm Works net net is that if two people that have like a high social distance across them contribute to the same Grant then those contributions are worth more than if you've got a gag of people who are only contributing to the same Grant so it's a way of kind of algorithmically waiting things that uh that are attractive across social distance higher so it's actually an early implementation of the dsoc idea but um yeah I mean I'd say that like passports even still in its early Alpha days and we're really focused on civil resistance and then I think collusion resistance is is kind of another Horizon on top of that and hopefully we'll get there cool so the next question here is the scoring and GTC passport is it arbitrary and how was it defined so I mentioned for gr15 scoring was this Apu score which came out of like some of the data science work that was done from our fraud and defense team so that's very like specific to the community of Bitcoin right it may not work for your environment and we encourage you to build your own weighted score if you look at the scoring SDK what you basically can do is Define all the stamps you care about you can Define which VC issuers you care about and then you can Define weights based on those that's the sort of like dead simple way of doing this like I think Twitter's worth one point I think uh bright ID is worth 20 points and you can create an aggregate score and a threshold and that's why a lot of communities I think think about doing this kind of thing um you could go beyond that obviously and start storing these things and doing machine learning against them and do some really interesting stuff there but uh at the basic thing the scoring is like I mentioned for our community has been this kind of initial weighted scoring we've moved into this more like ml sort of data science approach and then in the future you know we're going to keep iterating on that but you have no limits to how you want to build your score cool uh can you give insights on how to make passport compatible with other chains evm and non-avm looking to Technic to Architectural Components so right now there's not a way to bridge it on chain that's like work in progress that's that was the thing I was mentioning at the very end there so what you really are looking at is your interactions from the from the D app like do you trust this interface that people are interacting with and then you would use that as sort of your gating mechanism right so if somebody has the ability to access that that doesn't mean you can protect things at the Smart contract interaction level this is why we need to bring it there but if you have a back end uh you can certainly like protect yourself that way right you can you can you can validate that the front end is not being sort of man in the middle and you're getting a valid passport score back you can use your back end like uh Bank list did where in the background they just Reach Out grab the passport read it in you have your point of trust right and then you can do your your uh Jason PC calls from your back end that might be the safest way to handle this right now if you have an actual smart contract interaction oh this thing's like alarms to tell us we're out of time oh okay uh sorry I guess that's it for questions hopefully that was sufficient thanks for listening um this room is booked in I think 10 minutes so uh just to be respectful to the next presenter Olson and I are gonna go outside and happy to take more questions on the lobby but go to passport.getcoin.com if you want to check out the code and thank you for helping us build a more democratic web free peace yeah thanks man that was a lot more than I expected I thought I had more time hey [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign all right let's actually get this started all right hi folks I'm Josh I'm a mathematician at Oxford Stanford and a the executive director of medigov one of the organizations you see up there and this is going to be a workshop on open problems in Dao science the hell does that mean uh oh okay it works all right so this is actually a series of workshops that have been hosted at uh events over the past year beginning with Amsterdam uh following up with the researching web3 workshop and most recently at the Stanford dial Workshop part of the science of blockchains conference uh obviously at Stanford and this is kind of like an exploration or a long-term project to build up this field this new field of research of Dow science and maybe a good framing for this to understand where we're coming from and how this is down science or down research might be distinguished from you know typical things going on in the industry is that the framing for this for the questions that we want to ask are not you know three months or six months or even a year down the line it's really asking a question what will Dallas look like 10 years from now will they still exist uh how could they possibly disrupt the existing infrastructure for let's say corporate governance or other modes of governments like non-profit governance uh and there's a bet that we've released that maybe you could help sharpen this and the bet is uh Imagine by 2032 imagine if daos or other digitally constituted organizations controlled and managed over 50 percent of the assets of the U.S economy or just the global economy just imagine if 50 of the entire company was managed by Dallas what would that look like could you imagine today's Dallas doing anything like that uh personally I can't but you know that's exactly what we're trying to change through research now uh I want to share today we're going to do a little exercise uh and it's going to spend most of today uh speaking amongst ourselves in these small groups uh so just you don't have to be comfortable hanging out with each other for the next 30 minutes hope you're okay with that uh the idea here is we're going to do a little funding exercise so over the past several workshops of open problems and downscience we've you know come up with lists of open problems uh lists of problem sourced not only from practitioners but also from researchers in academics now what we want to do we've also sourced a more concrete research proposals that are derived and synthesized from setting some of these open problems and now we like to present a selection of these proposals to you and over the next 30 minutes we're going to talk about well what you want would you actually fund them you know as practitioners or sometimes as giving newbies to this space like do these things like make sense to you do they reflect or answer or respond to any of the problems that you care about and you'll have a chance to sort of allocate rank some of these proposals allocate them and to give us a sense of what are the priorities of the ecosystem you know what kind of research should we be doing and this is really just an access of course there are like infinite uh proposals that you can consider but we thought this would be a really nice way to kind of interface with some proposals have been developed by academics and leaders Within These ecosystems and then trying to understand you know trying to engage how would you might be do this better or if you're interested in engaging with some of this research I can also connect you to the um to some of the academics and the researchers who wrote These proposals okay uh so with that said I'm gonna put down a QR code and everybody can uh go to that you can also if you don't have a phone just enter that short link down there just bit dot Lee slash Devcon Dash Dao and that should take you to a spreadsheet uh and a series of worksheets now uh I was completely underestimated the amount of people that will be in this room right now um I honestly thought uh there would be like at most five tables of around like 30 people I think we actually have capacity here around 120. okay which is going to be great because we're gonna get lots of data and had lots of great conversations uh but I'm gonna count down so just note your table because you're going to be each table is going to be assigned to a worksheet and that's first off uh do people have people found the spreadsheet you can see what's in there okay great um so I'm going to count down the tables from here so this is going to be table one table two three four in the back five six seven you're seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen I'm glad I can count because uh that is exactly the number of uh sheets in that spreadsheet and I want you to go through that spreadsheet and you'll find links to these proposals and descriptions and you'll you'll be able to go through the entire thing so what I would like you to do uh well I think this thing doesn't work oh no never mind okay so for the first five minutes and I'm gonna break shortly and I'll just walk around and sort of answer questions but in the first uh five minutes I really encourage you to just take a short time to introduce yourselves to the table see what kind of backgrounds are you like peop is it mostly developers technical people non-technical social scientists or some I know there are definitely some researchers interest person here uh briefly introduce yourselves and then just chat you know go through these proposals try to understand them talk about like what's what's missing what's good what's bad come up with a ranking and then you can allocate uh 10 million dollars Associated there uh across these proposals at the end uh the last 10 minutes or so we're going to synthesize some of those uh conclusions and we'll talk about and we'll have come an open question to answer a session where we can talk about what are the priorities for Dow science and how can we learn uh what kind of new things do we need to learn all right with that I'll break and we'll start these breakouts time I understand foreign as soon as the intros are done let's go into it thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign

[Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] we'll give it back foreign thank you hold on one second one minute one minute put in your rankings and your allocations oh my God you're really giving that much money to that put in your number see the numbers change um that should not be the case I'm refreshing only you the lucky number is the same it's the same fridge let's just like uh put in your numbers over there yeah just like yeah what's up problem is that many people are using those documents so oh my God oh my God [Music] oh my gosh all right the people who have uh already put in their things oh come on people there's no need to sabotage Dallas for non-profits building public goods uh all right uh I know yes there's a problem too many people are editing at the same time so it's actually not allowing you to edit uh maybe this is uh telling you you should have gotten your rankings early in earlier on okay uh so why don't we see what we have right now and uh okay could you actually uh what do we have okay granular Primacy primitive seems like can you scroll up and down just go up down let's just see like what the rankings are actually I'm gonna okay let's see we have what's what's highest right now uh one is good one is good 12 is bad uh okay okay you know what this is uh if you could like uh slice it like if you go to rankings in that little Dash bar if you could order it the ranking by that that'd be helpful oh my God granular Primacy Primitives all right okay so that's that's interesting feedback people really like privacy uh or maybe they just like something like a really solid computer science thing allocation 900 almost a million dollars okay I think Tampa Bay would be very happy with that so he has a lot of money he'll be fine um let's see what's what's next we have a lot of people in the middle of the pack but it seems when the Dows win is fairly high up there you guys all want Dows to win or at least avoid the places where they're losing right that seems like a good plan uh but it's interesting that they are only getting half of as much as granular privacy Primitives so people seem to be putting uh a premium on these maybe like CS research I'm just inferring here uh challenges of digital public infrastructure decently high ranking but not much allocation I don't know why all right uh in this expense that's left I'll let people explore this uh on their own it's kind of like an interesting data set if you I would really encourage you to uh if you're already on these groups that kind of just refine the data a bit because I'll tell you why uh so this data is going to be uh refined and clean up a little bit and then we're so right now this is uh 10 million dollars in fake money or fake fake money right uh so we will be giving some of this data to uh a bunch of different vendors ethereum Foundation uniswap the World Bank National Science Foundation and trying to actually uh building together that 10 million dollar Grant to fund the future of Dow science and this will be directly from the community saying these are our priorities this is what we care about at least you know with this this sampling of research proposals that are currently out there and hopefully this will help guide uh if not the next 10 years at the very least the next two to three years of funding decisions so I really really encourage you to go back uh and you know at least fix that rough mistake come on who did that who did that I'm gonna find you I will find you I like non-profits uh I'll also just get a little bit background of This research project uh so this is um as I mentioned this is part of a longer uh project to build up the infrastructure for Dao research and for Dow science so for those of you who aren't researchers even for those of you who are you know there's a different set of incentives in institutions that you need in order to build an effective research ecosystem right to be able to produce uh results that have implications not just you know three months or six months but ten years down the line and what we're trying to do is working together uh I won't pull up the sort of the data set again but the um or the slides rather but actually could you go back to the slides and go to the uh the the slides Devcon 22 that that tab tab at the top um anyways go to dowscience.org you'll see all this sort of previewed there and it has an explainer for what we're trying to do basically a collection of some of the main research organizations in the Dow space including metagov the dial research Collective and the smart contract Research Forum basically a bunch of nonprofits are teaming up in order to organize uh this field of Dow science and trying to figure out how we can sort of synthesize and bring together practitioners many of which are represent in this room with scientists and how do we onboard practitioners more into science and of course attract more scientists more academics people from really a large variety of different backgrounds into this space to make it stronger to make it more vibrant and to ultimately solve some of the problems that we care about uh so yeah all that will explain at dowscience.org I can't direct them to point it edit but just go to dowscience.org you'll see what's next and I think with that we have around three minutes left are there any questions [Music] yeah so the question uh uh was about Dolly and the fact that the dolly proposal and the fact that it didn't really make sense or it didn't communicate a sense of like this is the ultimate end right this is the broader impact uh and the reason we put that in here as part of the sample is because uh it turns out there's well it turns out funding goes everywhere but also uh there's actually a lot of very playful proposals coming out of places like art schools or collaborations between art schools and engineering schools that are much more exploratory that don't have a sense of like oh this is the ultimate benefit to Dallas right and this is actually one of the uh the reasons I think it's important to think about Dow research and DOW science apart from standard like VC investment tracks is that you can fund uh these kinds of more speculative proposals that don't have any specific impact in mind they're just play right it's a little book like art like dolly any other questions in the back how can we use these will also think through these questions yeah yeah um so these proposals uh will eventually all be synthesized into a big survey paper called open problems and DOW science and it'll be much easier to consume and shorter and have also citations and you can see It'll be like a kind of like a nice uh concise way to sort of share that with your Dao where the practitioners here down um the other side of this is that obviously like uh and how do I say it uh and there's different ways uh being built by different organizations including as I mentioned medical of DRC and scurf uh to figure out ways to how do I say it shorten the pipeline from production of research to application of that research um in science we call this like translational research right and there's efforts to do that it just takes time and it takes building institutions this is why it's important to build a research ecosystem because you can't just researchers like doing random or academics you know spounding Theory you need to have this whole other piece of infrastructure that like pays attention to this stuff and then figures out this is the part that's useful these are the experiments we're actually going to you know put money into running yeah yeah I think one question I had was more like on like like 10 million is a good example because probably most of those like don't need much money at all but like below a certain threshold they also couldn't do anything so I wonder if there could be like something like uh with more skin in the game like a git coin run on like purely dial signs where you for example like as an active down member get higher matching so actually the people that I actually have an idea of dials like uh have like high metric but I think yeah like signaling also like what's the minimum money needed and the maximum so you're actually almost more like I'm not sure if you know the as process of funding um that uh so I think there's like ways to improve the allocation over this yes yes I'm going to answer that very shortly and out of respect for the next speakers we're going to end this but the um yeah very shortly the first time we actually ran this exercise was at Stanford with a panel including uh guy from accz Aya from the ethereum foundation and Scott from getcoin um and very much into this idea of yeah doing something some sort of quadratic funding infrastructure and we actually been talking with Bitcoin because they uh recently are trying to make their funding package a little bit more like a protocol yeah doing like a test run of that or maybe just doing a like a like a funding around that specific data towards science very much exploring that all right amazing thank you all for coming and sharing your thoughts appreciate it foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign

crazy we were not expecting this many people in the room so that's uh that's really cool but that's also going to be a challenge because we're going to do a workshop and workshopping is pretty difficult with more than 100 people but we're gonna pull it off thanks for being here um my name is Dennis this is my colleague Thiago we are with maker Dao and I'm not going to talk much about what we do because we don't have time for that um we are here today to solve some Dow governance challenges that are real so like we selected four challenges from friends from the web 3 space that are dealing with some problems and we're going to try and find some some inspiration for that and another goal is to get some of you more familiar with design thinking methodologies because it's a really powerful way of innovating we actually did a workshop at devconnect earlier this year in Amsterdam and that was like a different Workshop it was like a fully fledged design Sprint with a small group um that's what we had in mind for today but we actually uh yeah we decided to switch it up a little bit um a little bit of context a design Sprint is usually like a workshop quite an intense Workshop multiple days small team where you basically um you innovate and you you validate ideas so you create a concept and validate it without actually building anything like without writing a single line of code and I think that's uh something that um yeah the notion of innovating without building is something that we should embrace as a space so for those who haven't heard about design thinking design Sprint this might be a good first experience for you um what we're going to do today we have one hour and 40 minutes and we're going to guide you through a very intense process that the time is our biggest enemy today we're going to do Divergent and convergent thinking so basically initially we're going to do a brain dump um where we try and get as much feedback and no ideas and inspiration um on the table as possible and then we're going to do a voting exercise to create some kind of abstraction and then we're going to do that again but then for creating a solution um the agenda is um we have four challenge owners from various doubts in a room they're going to take five minutes to present their um their Challenge and give some context and then we're basically going to break up some of the tables in this room are going to be focusing on those challenges um so we're going to do some kind of the information if you don't feel like actively participating that's completely fine I mean that's actually welcome because we have way too many people so if you just want to listen in no hard feelings if you just want to listen in and just walk around please feel free to do so if you want to commit to participating please participate and be here for the full two hours um yeah this is what I just mentioned let's just uh have a look at the challenges and then we're going to do uh yeah then we're going to switch to the ideation process and I'd like to welcome uh Shelby and Abby from the radical team hi guys my name is Abby nice to meet you um I'm the head of community and governance at radical and I said on the board of the radical foundation for those who don't know radical radical is basically a protocol ecosystem that's based building decentralized collaboration tools for developers building decentralized Technologies um and so like the tldr is decentralized GitHub but it's a lot more things than that as well and so radical has been on a journey for the last year or two and we've been slowly progressively decentralizing um uh in our efforts to become like a truly open source uh free and open source self-sustaining Community owned and operated free and open source project free and open source I said twice but you get the picture um and so over the last year two years we made a successful transition from a startup to a foundation and we launched our governance token rad and we became a Dao but if everybody here is has experience with Dows you know that becoming a dow it doesn't just happen when you technically decentralize there's a lot of social and political decentralization that comes along with that so now we're on our next chapter the first of many which is furthering our transition to the Dao by dissolving our foundation Council which currently manages all of our project development our core teams that are contributing to maintaining the radical stack and replacing that with decentralized entities that our contributors run and operate themselves and restructuring our governance process along the way there's a lot more of this on discourse if you want to learn more at radical.community but basically our goal is to create a decentralized organization that can manage all of our project development within the Dow without relying on the intermediary of a foundation Council and in that process Stuart the emergence of other organizations within the radical dial ecosystem by Distributing ownership influence and supporting you know the generation of more decentralized governed entities that all are Steward and funded by our radical treasury wow okay so that's the transition so our challenge um which is something that we've been thinking about in this transition we have four work streams right one is the actual org design so how do you actually build an organization for our contributors to participate in the second is Dow tooling what are the best tools that we can be using to actually you know Steward this decentralization process and then the last two are what we're going to be talking about today which is a distribution of ownership and the distribution of influence so I think everybody knows that token voting governance govern Dows are pretty plutocratic right now if not entirely plutocratic including radical and we're trying to change that so first we're trying to distribute ownership in a way that better supports the transition of our project to something more member-based more um with highly diverse stakeholder governance um that's not plutocratic has more fair and Equitable qualities and can better support the long-term sustainability of the project but we think that that's not possible without actually introducing a non-financialized governance layer which we call influence so our challenge is about how do we effectively distribute influence and ownership as separate financialized governing power which is tokens and non-financialist power which is who knows what um and how do we distribute that amongst active contributors of the Dow to better support the transition of our governed instructor to something static and plutocratic to something Dynamic and member-based and more fair and Equitable so cool thanks so Shelby is right here so we'll be walking around with our Challenge and you can ask us any questions along the way thanks see that's over three minutes that's really impressive you can tell that she's done this before thanks a lot Abby um it's important that you take note of the challenges because the idea is that every table picks a challenge to focus on and then some of you that might be interested in actively participating that you really focus on that challenge so keep that in mind next up we have uh Peyton from maker Dao um yeah let's see let's see we have a lot of problems at maker Dao a lot of challenges that can be solved so let's hand it over to Peyton hi uh my name is Peyton I go by Pros 11 online and I am one of makers governance facilitators uh yeah you might have heard a maker you've probably heard of die I bet in this room we're probably batting better than average uh but I guess our problem with with governance right uh you'll you'll hear about it in tweets you'll see about it in news articles uh but it has to happen all the time right whether someone's watching or I guess whether Everyone's Watching or just a few people are watching uh governance is there governance is a risk that kind of transitions into the workforce which is this whole separate thing that intertwines with governance sin is a part of it yet uh is entirely separate as well so you might have read the articles I make or you might have seen some bits of runes grand plan or seen banteg tweet about how dye's gonna lose its Peg or what have you but uh basically uh fundamentally I would like to argue that the problem that roon is pitching to try to solve is how might we reallocate the workforce to be more efficient and I don't think this is a problem that you have to be at the size of make it out to encounter I think it's fundamentally a problem of scaling every Dao starts out with this really awesome problem which is we have a very cool solution and not enough people know about it so what do you do you start ramping up you start bringing people into the workforce and giving them jobs making them contributors having them uh you know one way or another uh be a part of your ecosystem and before too long you realize okay well maybe our problem isn't that we don't have enough people who know about our system now maybe our problem is that the way we have organized in in an alternative structure right that uh typically bucks hierarchy and and doesn't have a lot of direct reporting how do we take that and actually make sure that we are getting the value of all the talented individuals that have joined uh organization so when I like to approach this problem I think it's important to think about two sides because it's really obvious from the Dow side why you might want a more efficient Workforce right just like every corporation wants to squeeze out the most profit your doubt is going to want to take a look at your Workforce and say all right how can we get these people uh to to reach their potential and to give that value to us but you also have to think about it from the worker side workers endows are incredibly autonomous right the if they don't want to be there they'll find something else to do there's plenty of money in the web through ecosystem and uh yeah if you're not thinking about them when you're trying to solve this problem you're you're going to fall short so I want to put in a little plug about burnout because I think that's a problem with with tech with uh Dows with our industry at Large uh but Studies have shown that like the key thing you can do to prevent burnout with an organization is to make sure people feel valued to make sure that their work is being appreciated and the only way that people are going to appreciate their work is if they feel like they are making an impact so the challenge is as you grow as you scale how do you make sure that the talent you have is being properly utilized because whether it's a treasury or intellectual property if you have a resource and you're not constantly checking in making sure that you're getting the most out of it you're going to lose efficiency you're going to lose the battle to entropy and uh you know a dow can die many Taos have died I would not like to be one of them and I would certainly not like to be the governor's facilitator if the Dao were to die so maybe you can help me today and we can think about how can we make our Workforce reallocation uh be the most efficient way keeping in mind that there are two distinct sides we need to think about the worker and the Dow itself thanks thank you very much Peyton that was really good if there's anyone at maker who is in in sync in tune with what's happening at the Tao it's Peyton so if you can if any of you can somehow give some kind of inspiration or New Perspective on this problem that could be really actually really impactful because there's actually a lot of maker people in the room so I hope you can contribute to this challenge that we're facing moving on to the third challenge which is uh brought forward by zaku from gordonape hi everybody so I am indeed Zach from coordinate and for those that don't know chord nape it's actually a tool to help employees feel or employees to uh yeah exactly uh good thing I didn't say that to help contributors to a doubt feel more appreciated and also compensated so quickly the way that coordinate works is um in a circle of contributors they all have a hundred give tokens and you can give to other people according to the value that you've seen them add over some period of time and then whatever percentage of the total amount of give tokens you get you get that percentage of the budget right so instead of saying here's our budget for coordinators it's a hundred thousand and I'm the the people Ops person I choose you get this much and this much you put the whole pile in the middle of a table and people basically allocate it to each other in a decentralized way um and so the idea is to get closer to Value n equals value out right those contributors that are just like really crushing it and everyone's really appreciating here's your chance to appreciate them with payment and also write notes to them and tell them about why you appreciate what they're doing and then it creates the social graph so everyone can see who's adding value and what they're doing so it also helps a lot with sense making in the Dow that said um so my previous company this is the way that we paid each other for like all seven years and we always said that the conversation is actually more valuable than the allocation itself because as we were paying each other we were like here's what you did it was awesome here's what you could do better at coordinate one of the challenges that we have is that you have this distribution and so everyone's and it's all transparent and you can see like oh wow Sally got this much and wait why did she get that much more than me and why did Steve get this much to Camille and wait what's what's going on right um and and so the sense making part and really understanding especially like as a dialect what do we value is this person getting more because they're more public in their role or is it because what they're doing is super valuable like are we allocating according to what we really think is in line with the mission that we're trying to achieve and so the question really is like how do we asynchronously do sense making because it's just not practical to say we're going to have our coordinate retro and all 40 people are going to meet and on zoom we're all going to talk about what happened we are doing lots of MVPs with like small groups and pulse surveys and things like this but there's a lot of issues in Dallas when they get sensitive and you know if you just start writing on Discord like that encourages a very certain kind of conversation it's obviously like we are not evolved to be text-based communicators all most of our communication is non-verbal and now we're trying to do this through screens around really sensitive topics especially in coordinates case around like compensation which gets into how people feel valued and you know these are like really hot topics and there's a lot more I'm sure in in all the Dows you're a part of and so how can we address these really sensitive and nuanced topics and do sense making in an asynchronous decentralized way um you know obviously like coming together as a team is the best way but that's not usually possible um so yeah this is the sticky problem that that we're going to be talking about thanks Zach interesting stuff and I think for some of us we can relate so yeah let's move on to the fourth challenge uh posed by Patricia from Euler Finance I always said Euler Finance but it's actually Euler so I've heard so yeah let's give her a hand and let's hear what she has to say [Applause] hey guys so yeah I'm from Euler Finance it's pronounced as Euler this is not called Yola it's it's wrong so our protocol that nobody even knows how to pronounce the name and that kind of reflects the the governor's problems we're currently facing which is like low Community engagement because the product itself is less well known and at the same time it's highly technical so oil of Finance is a learning empowering protocol so you can think of us as a similar to Ave but way more complex with a way more functionality building and the code is just like extremely difficult to understand for average technical person um so the problem we're currently facing is basically uh like we launched around around like uh November last year so right before like everything crashed basically and we did the Token Lounge about uh in in May um that was like when the market was like pretty bad and we didn't do uh public Token Lounge with like the token sales with services so from that side it's like there's very little people to be fair that I have vested interest within the protocol and a lot of the technical people were trying to onboard right now they do not have a vested interest within the protocol they do not have the token at the same time uh the thing we have with the governance is like we're trying to have the governance to decide on the parameters of the protocols such as like learning and borrowing factors we thought that would be the best way to decentralize the protocol to make it really permissionless learning and boring and listening for us as to be clusters however what we realized is that not everyone have that knowledge to be calculating classical factors a lot of people within our community that are most active have very little tokens at the same time do not have the knowledge to be calculating those risk parameters I do not have the knowledge to be participating within the in the discussion so that's like the main problem we're facing is that where we were trying to lead the governance to be like and what the governance is currently at um so the problem that was like I'm presenting today are the problem that I'm trying to ask you all to contribute and help you to solve is how can we solve uh the community engagement problem within a highly technical protocol Community uh think about Euler as a protocol a baby protocol has a baby governance everything is very primitive the very little uh people have vested interests and people like outside of the community or even within the community cannot even pronounce the name of the protocol so that's a problem we're currently facing and I think it's a problem that exists across a lot of like other technical protocols identify protocols and I think it's something that in general how do we encourage people that currently do not have the knowledge to be participating at the same time encourage those who have the knowledge to be participating in the governance and be contributing so awesome thank you Patricia cool so as I said we have four really uh we have real governance challenges that we're gonna that we're gonna focus on today um what we had in mind is that every table can pick their own uh challenge but maybe we need to do it a bit smarter because we only have a bunch of facilitators and we can't really have them walk around the whole room so I'm just going to MacGyver this if I have the Mandate I would say I'm just going to point out a few tables and a number and if you really want to join a particular Challenge and you can just move to the table with otherwise I would suggest you just stay where you are and try to share your input the whole goal is to cross-pollinate right I think you all have different perspectives different uh uh work experience and I'm really curious what's going to come out of that so what I'm going to do is I'm going to assign these four tables so this row to the radical challenge because we have two radical facilitators I think they can handle this this row of four tables then we have um these three I would say I would assign them to Patricia so this this and this so that is Challenge number four and that is Challenge number uh uh one sorry yeah okay and then we have one two three four that's maker one two three four so you're going to be talking about uh the Second Challenge and then we have one two three that's going to be coordinate does it make sense do you all know which challenge you you uh you're assigned with your table and again if you really want to join a particular challenge feel free to move around and try and organize I'm going to give you a few minutes for it in the meantime I'm just going to continue talking just to explain what we have in mind um once again we have an ideation um process that we're going to guide you through we have a bunch of uh materials on your table and you're going to need that to do the ideation let's take two minutes to organize yourselves and then we're gonna just continue [Music] I'll go around to see if uh [Music] hello [Music] she probably writes a number [Music] that one [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] these two tables [Music] one two three [Music] hours all right everyone we're at time and I just want to make sure that the we're not uh mixing up stuff so I'm gonna have everyone's attention please time is at the essence thank you very much I'm going to walk past each of the table and I want you to shout which Challenge number you are working on just to make sure we're on the same page three two one three two one three two one okay this is all radical three two one four so you are uh oil of finance and that one also okay so we actually have two tables Euler Finance right because these what are you working on two that's maker right and you maker maker and maker and over there three and three okay so we actually have two tables for Zach two tables for Patricia we have three tables for Payton for maker and we have four tables for a reticle that's correct right awesome then I think we're ready to go we're going to have the inner facilitators right the challenge owners they're going to be at your tables and they're going to be available for uh helping with ideation because we actually briefed them a little bit but also to give more Challenge on the on the yeah more context about the challenge um I'm going to hand the mic over to my colleague Thiago and we're going to talk about the ideation uh practices please uh please pay attention because yeah we're gonna have to do this asynchronously now so let's get it Thiago all right so this is the fun part brainstorming uh just a bit of recap so you're gonna follow this process of Divergent and conversion ticking so first we come you come up with as many ideas as possible literally open your brain then you're gonna have one one voting process called democracy so you need to select the most likable ideas uh then you so this this will be around the opportunity area and then we're gonna do this loop again diverging but hopefully come up already with more craft solution and we're gonna convert again using the Democracy hopefully find a solution that we are all happy with in within your table um so we a lot of people we move around so maybe just take five minutes to introduce yourself you don't need to tell the story of our life just your name where you work and why you join this Workshop just take five minutes to within your group introduce yourself give a little round one minute per each just real quick yeah now now so now just within your group just give a round of introductions that's it then then we'll then we'll move on just make sure we know each other we get along [Music] as well [Music] sometimes [Music] is [Music] it [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] sausages [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you we're almost at the last minute [Music] last 30 seconds [Music] warm up your brains you are almost starting [Music] foreign [Music] hope everyone know each other now a bit a bit better within your group uh we're gonna start the first exercise uh yeah so so this is just a quick way to download your brains to brain them uh it's a conversation starter so the first exercise uh there are buying sheets on your table uh please just use one or two divide into three columns and then write I like I wish and I wonder uh and there we will everyone will be putting posters on each column uh so in the I like colon so this will be uh something that inspires you something that is you already know these are resistance existing Solutions uh yeah so just some references on the I wish uh yeah so based on this existing Solutions maybe there's something that could be improved uh maybe there are new features that you thought out so that will be on the I wish colon and then finally we have the I wonder colon so this will be solutions that don't exist just yet so be more your future Vision you can free your brain a bit more uh maybe you wonder if this is feasible this be possible maybe you'll do a bit of reflection about any unintended consequences um yeah so it's more the future scenarios um again so three columns I like I wish I wonder one or two buying sheets per foreign do it introspectively in silence unless you want to explain what you mean or someone don't understand explain to your table um yeah so let's uh let's get started eight minutes good luck [Music] [Music] okay to clarify this is in silence and it's focused on this on the challenge that's assigned to your table of course and we're a bit short on pens and posted so I hope you can organize yourselves especially say that okay go one way or something in general with I still hear a lot of talking I really suggest doing it in silence respect the process my friends stick to the process the purpose is to just get a download of everyone's brain based on their perspective and their experience stop talking start writing make sure to add them to the sheets immediately so you prevent people from writing down duplicates [Music] [Music] [Music] the goal is to get as many Post-its on that sheet per table so write them down put them on the sheet and we're going to do a voting exercise per table afterwards [Music] foreign we're doing all three columns at the same time by the way just to be clear [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] maybe there's anything in particular like something that you know of some experience that is quite unique to you that might be a source of inspiration for the others on your table [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Laughter] [Music] foreign [Music] we have two more minutes foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] all right I see many Post-its on the table too many too much information to download in those brains I can see [Music] huh all right all right so don't worry it's not a we don't need Perfection we just need some uh we just just needed some information to get the conversation started now of course I'm sure there are different solutions on the table so you need to align our brains within your own groups so at this system it's called dot mockery C uh so do democracy is just a way to help you votes on the most likable items that you have on the table just just find some alignment within your home group so you'll have five minutes and now you are short on Sharpies but uh yeah share share your pens around user pens to to place three dots uh three dots per person and per colon on your on your most likable items um and there are maybe there are similar items try to Cluster them a little bit um and uh yeah see what's the the spirit in your table see what uh what your what your group like the most so let's um yeah let's take five minutes to vote again three three dots per person per per colon [Music] all right social dude was it was it clear um okay everyone please make sure that you just look at what's on the table and place those dots we're gonna do discussion afterwards we have five minutes foreign [Music] [Music] thank you very much [Music] remember no cheating three dots per person per column you can put multiple dots on one item if you'd like foreign things anyway yeah at the end what I sometimes just yeah yeah that'll be nice foreign we have about two minutes remaining make sure you use your votes I want to have a nice heat map of where the most interesting opportunity areas are foreign thank you let's last 20 seconds so for now the goal is just to make sure you have an alignment within your table in terms of opportunity area you'll have time to to this for the discussion uh wait no the white then all right all right I know I know you're ready ahead of the game into the discussion part so that's good uh so just make sure you look again to the postage you have on the table make sure you look at the you find the heat map you you find the ones that the ones with the most dots and again this is not to come up with the solution just yet try to focus on the opportunity areas for the time being so let's uh let's give us eight minutes just to find the right opportunity area for uh it's just find the opportunity opportunity area and then the next step will be actually the the solution if you are ahead of the game you're already like a solution it's also fine but it makes sure we align yeah now we should you should focus the ones with the most votes that's that's the ones you should be discussing about it and keep it away for so just to clarify you don't need to look at all the postage just look at the Post-its with the most dots those those are the ones we are converging at the moment so to look at the possibly the most dots those those are the ones where your brain should be focused on and for now it's just opportunity areas we'll have another session based on Solutions and again try to Cluster as long as you bring good results Free Flow Free flow foreign Conway why not [Music] [Music] [Music] little streets people are free the only thing is the only things that make sure that they are not launched can I say something all right folks we have about five minutes left and the aim is that after five minutes within your table you have a good sense of where the opportunity is so just have a bunch of Post-its that are your favorites that's super important [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] to find the right opportunity area tried to converge in one just one single opportunity area again rely on your facilitators they are the glove they are governance experts they know the challenge more more than anyone foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you give me the discussions like I would stretch all right so less is a site I know most of you are freestyling going with your home methods and that's totally fine but uh I mean this is also a good one so it's called uh Crazy Eights so basically yeah you'll uh So based on the opportunity area that your table selected uh we're gonna come up with we call it crazy eight Solutions so you can either draw or or write whatever is easy for you to to to depict the solution so this is more a concept creation um you can go a bit uh wildly nonsense but uh we are trying to diverge as much as possible but again focus on the challenge focus on the opportunity area try to stick to one meet one minute uh per post it one idea per post it and since we are many groups maybe try to have a two plan two sheets on the table uh try to have two crazy eight sheets on the table and again we're gonna have uh eight minutes for each for for this exercise um yeah let's get started yeah maybe just to clarify because everyone can we have attention he plays Crazy Eights hey hello thank you very much Crazy Eights is a bit of an abstract one so you need to understand it well it's also the most fun one and the idea is that you make a sketch of your idea it can be like a drawing it can be a diagram it has to fit on a Post-It so it has to be really succinct and you're actually going to make eight very rapid iterations so we're going to do very strict time keeping after one minute you you leave that posted alone you move on to the next one so each table only has about two or three of those sheets so we actually need two or three people on the table to step forward maybe someone who's good at drawing because this requires some drawing skills and when everyone's ready probably in like two minutes or so make sure you make some room on your table get the drawers prepared and then we're going to do eight short cycles of one minute where you just draw and you iterate on one idea and of course the idea is that you use all of the previous stuff as inspiration for this single solution that you're going to draw let's take two minutes to get organized and then we're actually going to start with the one minute cycle so let's get ready I'm very curious how this works uh yes so we're going to create one solution we're starting okay yeah so um wondering if we could just should we just pick one and go with it we should just pick one and go with it because the whole goal of this thing I'll say it here another good thing to know the nice thing about Crazy Eights is it excavates your subconscious to to participate in the in the creative process so really trust that just pick something if you're not sure yet just pick something and just go for it let's just create a solution sorry one one idea so we have a challenge maybe there's one one solution or one process or one product that could and we need you to to draw it out like to try and explain for example it can be like a UI [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] let's take three more minutes and then every group is going to pick one solution [Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] last minute come on get your drawings ready [Music] the good thing is [Music] so do you know [Music] foreign [Music] all right everyone Let's uh let's do a quick pause here so we are uh nearing the end of the workshop and the idea is that you still have some time you have eight minutes in total to prepare Your solution and and your explanation to other tables so in short in eight minutes I'm going to ask each of the tables to share your biggest takeaway or like the tldr or maybe anything that you're struggling with just try and give some kind of abstract of the value that you've been creating and try to share it with another table I'll give you eight minutes to prepare that and now we still have some time to cross-pollinate between the tables good luck foreign [Music] so you're going to foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] where is he from he's from a village okay in Ankara we are close by yeah foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign don't read the second presentation so to clarify you're going to share what you have it can be anything it can be an idea or maybe some main takeaways foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so we discovered uh Amsterdam's way it was like it was great we had no idea that our one of our designers and this is no it was like that sorry foreign get ready to pitch to one more table [Music] foreign everyone Let's uh take a moment here let's take a moment here Please assign one person on your table that's going to uh to do the talking and the idea is if it's correct each table has been assigned another table that they're going to talk to and you're just going to explain what you came up with it can be a tldr of your ID it can be the main takeaway it could also be if you've been struggling just share like the main challenges that you run into assign one person and then we're going to take time to explain it to the other table let's go okay let's get started cross-pollinate let's go to the other table thank you guys [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] same thing [Music] sorry guys [Music] no no more people peace if you haven't switched yet it's time to switch let's take uh the final minutes for the last group [Music] foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign foreign so someone from this team then it's then it's all good then it's all good at this table will have to pitch will they have to pitch well no it's fine if one foreign so let's say five more minutes we have five more minutes and then uh we're at the end of the workshop [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] with each other [Music] lovely people we're going to be kicked out in one minute so I'd like to ask you to wrap up make sure you hand your final drawing to the challenge owner so they can make a picture of it and most importantly don't forget to Mint your follow-up by scanning the QR code [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] dear friends we're gonna be kicked out thank you very much for your energy for your participation Round of Applause you've been fantastic I hope we're gonna find some gems in the output we'll figure it out over the next few hours thanks a lot don't forget your bow app and have a great conference can we get the slides back up for the QR code sorry just a few more seconds yeah that's it get your coat before it's gone
