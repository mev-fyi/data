I'm the UX designer at ENS and we are trying to make everything easier for the user and so I'm a bit like doing the older social sorry apology for the social media stuff I open at the ENS hackathon and then you know and also I do actually do a bit of dev work especially for the DNS integration work Nick might have in an explained next place yeah so so yeah again as I mentioned it's two parts like how to get you this cool ENS thing so that you can have the ultimate bragging right like it only happened this year next year we assume everybody has it so it's not no longer than you know nobility but this year you are the cool bunch congratulations then once yeah so - Harvey okay so get actor who has no clear awareness okay so I don't have to bring Nick to the stage to go through the state of ENS again right so cool so ENS stands for okay guys focus unis stands for yes stands for service that is their name service okay so so it's like it like ENS like you know in case of like the compression we make is at the NS right so lucky you have a DNS domain we have also have a DNS domain and also we have a notion of domain and sub domain it's kind of maps into the you know the naming scheme of the US as well for example this domain motto condo is this is my East so if you wanna you know like you know ease but at the same time yeah I will explain how to get this domain because that's probably people very keen to you but hotel there is a fast you can't get it today and I'll explain why so your focus to of today will be going to get something like a subdomain which is something like for example get coined or eise who does not have a github account does not have a github account okay so everybody could should be able to get that that kind of stuff yeah next please so that domain for the door if address is i think nick already mentioned the state of is like a we go through the how many days seven days seven seven days of auction process which so the auction is very complicated and make said luckily that we're going to get rid but today to register you it's a commit and revealed pattern who doesn't know what commit and reveal is okay so it it's one of those patterns where you are bidding on a domain but hidden so your bid is hidden until you reveal it three days later later and so during the first three days okay the bidding period 72 hours anybody could bid on that name okay your name is hidden if it's a complicated name nobody will ever know but if it's a it's a name that also has a.com or a famous Tod it can be guessed and so somebody else could be bidding on your domain you are bidding different amounts and in the after three days you have this reveal period in which you are you should reveal your bid okay and the winner will be the one with the highest bid but he will only pay the second highest bid so he will not pay the highest price he tried to bid and this mechanism was made so that there are no squatters who collect all the names while we are still coming out with with ens and an important limitation today you can buy only domains that are longer than seven characters okay and after the reveal period so there is time for 48 hours in which you should you actually you must submit your reveal otherwise you lose the money someone of the bidders wins and after that the winner should finalize the auction thank you very much now minimum is 0.01 so and also it's a deport yeah you keep it locked so when you release it you get either back so it's not consumed but we'll try to go this one quick really quickly because again Nick already mentioned that we are going to get rid of the auction at some point but like this is just for the you know brave people who don't mind going for the this process and yep so again auction process is something we couldn't we she haven't put into the new unis manager so currently there's a couple option wines go to the Registrar UNESCO domains to go through it there's a huge duplication warning comes out and that there might be bit of bugs so like again for the Braveheart and also some sort party like my crypto my ether-wall there and then there might be couple more they do have some similar way of our auction process so if you want to go that route you can next please and yeah so is this like thing you already can't explain that yeah during bidding process he says like how many hours you left and all that stuff yeah this has been interface of the new manager or part of it we're still working on it and this process shows for example that this domain Visa debit card is inside of the bidding period and so anybody even you you could bid for for this domain this is a very complicated process everybody or almost everybody has had problems with this lost money forgot to reveal forgot to bid maybe they open the auction they didn't it so it's a complicated new concept that a lot of people have made mistakes so if you have problems either come talk to us or follow through the instructions very well if you want to buy now but Mikoto is going to show us simpler version today this is the reveal period again it moved from bidding to reveal and there's another way of getting so that DNS integration that like people kind of already associate yen SS da e th address but that's not necessarily the case that like a that's something in like I've also worked with Nick for the last six months like basically if you own domains like for example I have a motto control XYZ and if you can prove you can you put a sub-domain record like underscore UNESCO my token dot X Y Z and DNS you can put not just IP but you can put text record so if you put the same address and there's ways to kind of prove that that's correct like anyone can do it and by doing that you can say send east team at Oakland XYZ common mistake I had a for last couple week is that like people ask question like something like also if I have my token though X Y Z so and then my talking dog come who owns matter kundo is but that's completely Arab and so that is domain acquisition mechanism and this DNS creative stuff is completely different ones so they they have different ownership is that part clear I guess okay and yeah so once so this is example how you add in the text then once you have the text so currently again this is temporary pad eventually it's going to be in a NS manager but for the time being there's a two way harder way in the easier way the harder ways you I know assuming you have a skill to manage your DNS record you go to like in a google cloud dns manager or something and you basically add your own that record into the DNS record and once you come to the NS a key and installed domains we'll do a couple there's a wizard to go through whether you have done any sell upon by yourself because these are things we can't automate ourselves and then like it once it's done there's a button to say submit the proof which everybody anyone can press and once it's pressed it looking up the DNS record chain relationship construct a proof and put the hash of the proof to something called DNS SEC Oracle the insect or call verify that that's like not tampered and if it's correct one there's a registrar which register the same address as a DNS domain order and yep if that's a bit too much data another solution something like ez DNS they should be able to automate you know the second bits from their website so that you that that's something you went through right easy DNS makes it very simple to register at XYZ domain and they have an interface in which you simply put an address and you decide in which network robson or maynot you want to claim this domain and they do all the process for you it takes some time but at the end you have your own domain claimed on ENS the resolver is set and even the address is pointed to with automatically yeah this is in the manager after that you have bought the domain you see domain DNS names for example dot XYZ who the owner is and the resolver and the address that points it to in this case is the same address and they do this automatically for you so so far I explained the things you didn't be doing today because it takes too long but there are going to talk about some other way you could do right now as long as if you have a Wi-Fi connection and if you have a mobile well meta mask or mobile wallet or and you have a nice okay and the one doesn't there's actually quite a lot of weight but who today we're gonna talk about our own now Dorian's domains and get coin is kind of sad party integration and their status I forgot to take out the bracket but like that's another sub party integration for the mobile solution and so this is now a NS domains which again we are going to incorporate into the ENS manager but from here what you can do is like a basically if you type your my fancy name it's this is the list of domain is which allows you to get there sub domain as so like in this case my fancy name Leroy doe is and this top and this is me though is there for them they give you you for free but like you still have to pay for the gas so like if you want to go for the cheaper one this could be the way and then I think there are certain domain name I shouldn't be pronouncing that's okay that's okay okay so like it once some give me stuff so some people actually trying to charge so the give me is actually charges 0.005 vs that calm stuff next next is like a so you guys mentioned I get pretty much everybody has a geek coin sorry github and who do you not know geek point oh great one person so two people okay a three you know Billy okay and so coin is a bounty system tied into the key hub that if they have issues and if you want someone to work on there you can put the bounty on it and once you solve the problem you get worried about the bounties sometimes like east sometimes like die and the one thing they released I think several months ago I think is that it creation with ENS basically I think the assignee is tied in with the github so like you you would have the same login as your github address account so in my case Mikoto is my github account so you would have like Mikoto and what they do is like if you do the single sign-on bhaiyyaji hub and they give you Mikoto geek coined or ease and I think in their case they may pay for the gas yeah so you could get away getting the DNS name even if you have no gas give a try but you can't do all the exercise afterward because that requires a gas right next yeah this is a couple screenshot and yeah so he is proud of the yeah so this is also to suggest that if you have dubs you can give subdomains of your dab to your users there's the ENS hands on for dabs on the workshop for that developers that will teach you how to do how many of you are interested including this kind of process into you adapt okay so you guys kind of came to the wrong like there's another sense but like it's good that you said the foundation now yeah levered up then you go to the next session we see on a Thursday yeah and that time me and Jeff la will be presenting how to do that and sorry Thursday at 10 a.m. and it's called ENS hands on integration workshop for developers okay so yeah the salt case status is I just yeah so they did integrate a very new like last week or something like so that if you create a account there's a section called ENS name so if you press that he asked you whether which like so they have a state of us I think status was too short or it's got squatted I don't know but the state of us sounds good to eat so like you can basically start whether that name is a variable and if it's good yeah you he asked you to get to the profile then if you press and of sorry yeah then it takes you to create I think if I we as long as I remember you you have to stake 10 s and T for one year yeah yeah sorry yeah two E's yeah so like if you does anyone have a city okay o SN T for everybody is that what you're saying okay yeah yeah so but I don't know how to sit through that dress but like during the so after I go explain all these obvious I will stop for like 5-10 minutes to do so that everybody have that ENS address stage if you want to if you have nothing and if you want to download a status now now is the time to go to the Google Play or somewhere and they start downloading but yeah so if you're gonna go for this mobile yeah route there's a sin T for you okay okay yeah so there's a yeah support SNT I'm sorry stitches okay so yeah so once you went through you want to make sure that you actually got it right so wait else can you see is fast place easier one is a easy scan so users can usually how many who hasn't accessed either scan before two people three people okay so you scan is a place where it has all the information about like you know poaching activities where you can find a transaction who sent to you and usually probably copy and paste same address but now you can search with this so if you put my token dog is and it goes to if you look at the URL point yeah it's now doing yes look up came a token dog is and next sorry go like yeah and this one says a unit name address for this one is under this one so that you can see that information who on the next piece and this is in the case of meta mask instead of again copy and paste the same address you can look up my token here and they basically replaced with a serum address this is one of the very first basic users to give convenience to send to a name instead of an address and some wallets already resolved transform then the name into the hash of the address that it points to and yeah same thing for my crypto okay next yes so you have no clue how to get subdomain raise your hand who doesn't know how to get a subdomain okay so for these people all the people around you knows how to get it so they can help you so shall we just spend five ten minutes good okay do it so the three to remind people the three or the two versions that you can try now three versions that you can try now to get a sub-domain is either with status you go down and download status or with get coin if you have a github account and you want to get your subdomain with git coin or you can go on now dot e NS domains and you look for for a domain there if you have meta mask or a wallet that has that has ether so we doing it everybody has a domain already question-there just go okay yeah a question there yes sorry-sorry speak i speak up 12 days ago if i didn't registered you know or i didn't claim it is it's gone you got a domain but you didn't register it you didn't claim it so yeah there's a lot of you probably didn't get you probably won't want it did you reveal your bid okay if you bid but you didn't reveal then you've lost your bid I'm afraid if the if you revealed but you haven't finalized the option then that's fine you can wait as long as you want and you'll still have it so the thing to do would be to check the name and ethos can see what it says about the name whether there was a reveal and then you'll know what state you're in okay it's confusing for people any other questions anybody troubleshooting yeah yeah sure we are here for helping you and that by the way yeah help it and there by the way who already have ENS names and I can give you the sticker and then you can write down names and yes where do we start a common question either one of these three things there is a probably get coin dot cos slash ENS try that one there should be you have a yes okay so it's get coin dot coal slash ENS we can probably put that up there a particular how-to for following the meta mask instructions to register the domain we are currently on the process of redesigning the whole manager and hopefully you don't need instructions which is good design and but the final manager is not out we are releasing in little bits bits so if I if I want to eat a da teef domain tonight I can't get it until the yeah you you can go tonight to get a Dottie's domain the suggested versions right now are either through my ether wallet it has a process that works my crypto had it too it's very similar or on mobile I am token is a good process as well there are also other services who help you or help users by a subdomain they are a centralized solution so that you simple put and pay with a credit card and they take care of everything if you want that's ENS listing comm I think Mikoto you want them they have a question there no okay any other people here yes yes to continue do you have a network connection ok please connect to the theorem to continue but this is on a website or is this status app they state it up any guys from status here the can you help him on board G on board them go down there there's a status group people trying to on board on status there's a group of status people down there any other questions doubts yes sir let me come over here on madam asked okay how did you get to that point was erased by previous status so if you makoto makoto if you don't have either on your meta mask or on your wallet whatever please either go on get coin dot call slash e NS or on status the the app and the group down there will help you either give you the tennyson tees that they ask for for registration they are giving it for free and also get coin today is giving it for free okay they are paying all your gas so that you get a sub-domain your user gets a sub-domain you're on boarded onto their platform but you're paying the gas with the S&T okay just the essenti okay so that's one step as you see there are different ways of doing it some apps or if you use the universal logins or the metal transactions there is going to be patterns where as companies pay for the gas and for everything to simplify there is another wallet that you can try is a jean dot m okay argent if you go on the on the i've tried it this morning it worked very well so right now the you can reserve your subdomain on this wallet that doesn't ask you for any gas or anything yeah okay that's a question for Nick how are we going to set up the price for the for the new domains so our goal is to see it as a price that makes broad-based spanning and and so forth ineffective but still makes it cheap and we think that a reasonable level for that is similar to existing DNS domain so ten dollars a year and that's the sort of target price we're aiming for the questions yes the presentation that longer names will be owned by instantly what will be the auction process for a smaller name if I want a five letter name in May what do I do so before May will have a one-off option for shorter names and it will be similar to the existing process with a bid in a reveal but it will be over a much longer period so you'll have a perhaps a full month to do the bid and reveal and after that went off then everything moves to the rent based registrar and any unregistered name shorter than six characters or longer you can buy instantly just using that yes even short ones as long as they're not already owned of course we know why when when when we first launched the Registrar has always been a limitation of no more than no fewer than seven characters the the goal was just to give us time to grow in popularity and awareness before people just you know swept up and she squatted all those short names so we do have one other way to get an e NS domain today although if you do so it may take it'll be a couple of days before you can use it at least mu makes the people behind lux have offered up five hundred free deluxe domains to the first 500 people to email them at address with the subject Devcon and the name that you'd like to register once this is launched on November 5th that will be fully E&S integrations you'll be able to just type in your in T or e a theory madri's in the registrar field and it will instantly associate it with your address so I still suggest using status or get coin or eNOS now today but if you want a permanent one then there's your option so now it's only next ten minutes left so we'll just go through I assume you already got the [Music] domain so how many people got domain today one two three four five people congratulations so now whether you have it or not we'll quickly go through how you use a new manager to manage a couple of things you need to manage okay I was Belgian was going to go 3-bike yes yeah yeah we can go we show that also there's someone who managed to get the good coin domain and was wondering how do you then what do you do with that domain right now you can first see it and verify it in either scan in our manager and you can send to it or you can give it out to send pay outs or whatever etc so right now what you can do with a manager you can search for names okay and subdomains you can display all the data about or most of the data about the domain who the owner is what a resolver is what the address it's pointing to and there was a question about what is a resolver do you understand does everybody understand what a resolver is or who doesn't understand what a resolver is okay so this is an important piece ENS has three parts one is the registry like the database where we have names points to this other thing which is a resolver a resolver is another smart contract that has the list of things to which it points to okay so this name points to this address this wallet this contract and another use cases you can store and an IP FS hash you can point to an IP FS hash so in a future day hopefully browser or madam ask can resolve or translate like my name dot eath or whatever into a website that is stored on ipfs so decentralized and this piece is done by the resolver is the translator you can help yourself to understand alike that you can in the manager lists subdomains that you own and you can manage your own domain like transfer it to somebody else added etc etc and this is the current manager better as you can see there is not finished you have a universal search and here you can search either for the name and in the future you can also search for the address so if you know your address and you want to see the domains you will put just put there the address and it will do the reverse resolving okay resolution and the manager looks very simple at the beginning so you have your name for example and it tells you the owner the address that owns this domain until what date or the opposite this is the day in which it was registered the resolver this others mark contract that contains what we call the pointers okay like you call them here in DNS context you call these records you know like the MX record the a record etc will you point to a hosting service etc in DNS you have a pointer so this name points to this address if I put in fireflies or teeth in meta mask it will resolve it will translate into this okay and next please thank you and you can see if you switch the button on subdomains you can see the list of subdomains this domain has okay so Firefly teeth has created these and many more subdomains some of these subdomains will not appear might not appear when you search for them because they are complicated names that our system cannot find or translate for you so you need to input it or search it by hand in which case we will be able to list it for you there's a longer explanation of why why that is but I can explain it later if you want and please go next one and this one you want to say something so very quickly the important steps you need to set when you go back to details you have the same thing you have the resolver and the address and these are the two things that after you have a domain you need to set okay get coin does this for you status does this for you and so try the next one you I probably click on the tiny button next please yes I click on the edit an a for example can point it to a different address so I now have my token Doty's I can point it to a different address instead of of this one so my name stays the same I still give this out but I pointed to whichever thing I want address or wallet next one please I can this is how you send the transaction with madam asked if when you confirm thank you next one you can this is you add a sub-domain okay this is a way to for you to sub to other subdomain you pick a name next one thank you and you execute the transaction and when it's executed thank you next one you see the sub domain okay it goes back to the details of this sub domain each of these are called nodes or is a domain okay and you can set their resolver so this other's smart contract that helps translate and you if you're developers you can develop custom resolvers you will learn a bit of this probably in the in the hands on integration workshop but everybody can use the default public resolver which simply gives you a set of pre translatable pointers if you want you can point it to an address or which is a wallet or a contract you can point it to an IP FS hash you can have a text file a text field and another things please next one you send a transaction save again next and finally the resolver has been set you need to point it to someone to something otherwise it's not usable yet so this resolver can point it to an address and and content is the IP FS hash okay you can point it to an IP FS or swarm hash as well right and in this case we point it to an address go next one we're sending a transaction empty but go ahead and that's it so this is the basic things that you have to do with the I&S you get a name or a subdomain you set the resolver inside when the resolver is set you set the pointer or record if it's easier for you to understand with DNS language that points to a wallet for example these three steps after you own a domain okay and while we talked about this already but any questions in the meantime lux like luxury luxury yes let you exchange easy the lux is repurposed let you exchange easily and the objective for us is to bring that standard DNS naming convention into the blockchain community so we've worked with Nick to integrate this and so our registrar's you can actually just paste the wallet address in with your domain name and it'll actually propagate on to the blockchain and work anywhere that ENS works today and so I'll just remind you guys the first 500 people that email marketing at MMX Co will get a free dot lux domain name yay thank you any other questions and this this gives us way to reminding you that Dottie's is the current namespace but already you can buy the blocks and that XYZ domain and in the future hopefully the whole community and all the TL DS will be integrated into the system and so if you own a.com domain you can have the same subdomain in system for that domain and and also the main domain can point to whatever decentralized address or IP FS ash that you want will want in the future questions who managed to get a subdomain here one two three four five six seven eight nine yeah come on ten one more give me ten okay good can we make a sub domain of a subdomain yes ad infinitum you can make sub of sub of sub of subs you can imagine your own things the only thing is that for each node or each subdomain you need to set and maybe set a pointer so it's two transactions for that unless you create a custom resolver that maybe does everything for you already I don't know yeah very good one afterward of the domain what will happen to the sub domain very good question so there are what happens to the subdomains and the owner of the subdomain if you transfer the main domain the parent domain so you still own your still appear as the owner of the subdomain but the owner of the parent has the power to take it away from you to change the owner unless there is a special registrar right so as Beltran sees the owner of a domain can always change the ownership of any of the subdomains so you should really only register a subdomain of a domain if you trust run running it and one way to trust the one running it is that the one running it is actually a contract so you can have domains that are owned by contracts and they can enforce rules about how two main subdomains are creators and redistributions and so on and that's basically what now that any stock domains is doing its what get coin are doing if you look at the source of that you can see that they have no mechanism to take your name off you basically so it's trustless and they will not be able so you need to trust or so for the transition to the new registrar then in a year a year after the transition that domain will go away and anyone can grab it and that's why we're making it a you know an extended period and and making people very aware of this however once we've moved to the permanent registrar the goal is that to prevent this sort of tragedy of the commoners issue anyone can read it can extend the registration on a domain even if it doesn't belong to you so time is up final question No okay so this is it thank you very much for coming and yeah great so now it's your time to put on the sticker and they're like chill ENS like crazy yes what are the requirements for the workshop for the hands on integration workshop daddy Papa that you're a developer that's it that's it thank you okay thank you guys thank you for coming thank you very much you
