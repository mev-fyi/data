everyone my name is Tom Marston check from Nezha Moines I started this project one year ago peel trick is with me here it's our developer to join a few weeks back so we've never mind we build a delta implementation of full aetherium protocol which means deaf p2p in situ on virtual machine all the blog verification synchronization private's changed mainly drops and and so on yeah so we already say we have the first version to to download from our downloads page and we encourage you to go there and see our packages for Windows Linux Mac OS let's say cross-platform release we continue to add all the missing functionalities we keep building on top of what we already have we add functionalities that will be needed for any open source development on top of it so obviously you have gas you have parity and and this is this is as much as we as we go so we have the full implementation and if for any reason valid or not you or your clients want to go with dotnet core solutions ever this is data technology that you did you feel more confident with them definitely would like to to go and try to experiment with another mind so when we when we were applying for for a grant that was offering later late June we were still working with Rob stand estimates now we have multiple rounds when we did the full sync a full archive note on the main net and this goes very well we have good performance stability and obviously this is all open source for you we also build the tools that we'll be targeting in the financial industry mainly but also a cyber security company so they fraud detection for extracting the data from the node in real time so we analyzed appending transactions I analyzed the transactions before they even they're fully executed on the blog so we we streamed the data while the contracts are changing we stream the data about whatever our customers are interested in these are exception storage changes whether these are some specifics of the network parameters so they kidnap paged it to encourage you to visit way slowly build a community around the project we see more and more contributors people add more test networks support so which really last last few days we had contributions for the covin connectivity sorry rinkeby that kovin is coming next i think and then then we should have the upcoming something like Gurley is coming in the future it cerium 2.0 so we we following the research in this one and we believe strongly that will have the firepower to deliver also the beacon change they'll be there with all the other implementation in March with the same confidence and we're confident it will deliver a domain that sense now we can go forward and go forward 2d at the edge of the progress of what's happening in each area maker system so that's that's what I was mentioning the real-time data streaming but also since we have this client full implementation and the ability to to meddle with the internals of eight of the protocols we plan to to build all the integrated tools on top of it for for trading for pricing for better modeling and we hope that will lead to two improvements of the markets maturity of the ability of people to find the intrinsic value of aetherium basin gas based on the network characteristics and so and so on I want to deliver that to our customers thank you so much I'll show you in a moment they the running note however as you will see this is as a as we can go with the with the UI in our world and even here you can complain that the color of the logs is maybe not the perfect said so this is the live demo in a way that on the right side you'll see the public maintenance synchronizing it started as synchronization just a few hours ago I think and as probably know the fastest possible because of the network parameters here on the left side not a perfect split screen but what we have here is a a our private network that we just a spawn for Sam a gaming solution on the private network so this is something that we share that can run with truffle only just run truffle test obviously it is something that we would normally ran against ganache or or something else but but obviously will support all the JSON RPC calls in the latest releases this is not what you can download yet but soon in our next release you should have all the JSON RPC support more test nets better performance over time and more and more functionality and this is mainly what I wanted to say even as I have some time remaining five minutes was more than enough to show you what we have now and thank you so much and we invite you to talk to us more about the solution tested experiment of it download Kevin Jonas and guitar on github and say thank you so much you
