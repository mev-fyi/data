[Applause] then it's flawed some principles for human centered design and if straight of discussion with one of our deaths the club sports I hope you're joining online parts are not an alternative to the justice system they are the justice system the dangers more cases of the self go like the mock life this prediction made by this visual subscribe envision the changes to start leading in the coming age of centralized courts but watch challenges this ship to bring how West contribute to the change blockchain technology there's an important book in the conference formations in the power should approximate people at the secretion Omega processes how centralized justice works crypto Kamali's incentivize jurors to decide honestly where blockchain where it is a centralized procedure its Mac contracts automatically enforce the ruling legal process is traditionally bureaucratic centralized and also transparent what abusers start being a mention to the eyes of the legal design the important research has been aimed to find how to innovate and bring more human centered approach to legal processes this is legal design web it is a disciplinary team based at Stanford Law School a school that makes important research trying to bring innovation to the world of law it's led by Margaret Hagan and has been making important research contribution to bring innovation in a more engaging contribution to the world of law legal design works on intersection of design to make these people came to use death technology to increase the effectiveness of people's actions in what promotes a fair a just society and to empower people a few core principles the worst from the resulting made by legal design wave number one maker uses impart and strategy your project needs to make help uses soap and problem they're facing presence information he has a journey through a process with discrete steps start points and end points give your user the overview of the new terrain then that assuming for today the simple principles or mindset applied to legal steps can be very helpful to contribute to our new center engage solutions but the develop UX designers in this process is true that hope case for the end user approximating people and making them the solutions were engaging in human centered history look at this process is empathy and as you can see on the image the morning you know about your user the mark the more you understand and engage with your users higher their ability to really impact the positive affect their lives for example Bitsey I'm sorry for you secrets have fuel for you but empathy I feel with you has the mindset how to practice empathy us explore quantitative research methods to the introducer behaviors motivations and concerns explore open-ended questions like what comes to your mind when thinking about of them what to be improved incentivize users feedback and track key metrics make use of energy helps as a user I'm not going to say what I mean of USA Ableton Fe helps the engine what what use assess things does it feels a good approach to combine quantitative constitute user research to dive into uses behaviors attitudes motivations imagine for example I use assess something like I want to past interface as hiding behind that maybe thinking for example this is really annoying respect the impression to pay several times he is impatient it takes too much fabric complete the transaction ever know something wrong did I lost my focus this generates kind of anxiety it can be very bad for him using experience before moving show presents a clever suitcase I just want to show you one more thing this is no one's definitely understand to experiment at the base of the pyramid reliance the test related attributes these are their functional it works properly doesn't have any boots is it reliable it is useful and at the top at the top we find the experienced Africans these are their convenience for the users this is a beautiful thing they most importantly is it meaningful to them and also explains that this process and seeing as a basic maturity continuum projects normally start as a functional solution to a problem and then evolve - hi Lea to reach the top right where it can have a more meaningful and more impactful way to touch it - Therese the users sorry so I would point to started thinking about legal legal solutions to be a friend of team so how do we create a legal solution that's open transparent and decentralized empowering people that normally don't have access to legal services to solve any kind of disputes over five billion people lack access to justice three to five percent of all my transactions and in the dispute leave my money back no what did my job and as ago despite the technological evolution traditional courts that have changed much in the last centuries what if you had a place where everyone could work as a juror a software engineer who helped to solve in distance relate to software engineering again his expert who helped me solve it justice relates to games and if they receive additional instances for that this is glam squad transport of jurors to join a court they won't as a world choose a court they have the competency to arbitrate and receive incentives for that gurus can join apart by stepping into tokens to the court a select they can see the cases that student in voting that cases in progress enclosed and also can track their voting performance which is the percentage of times the service bones coherently votes with the majority of jurors but how does work imagine enzymes work for marketing services not satisfied with the results she raises a dispute they send the case to Clara's plans they receive the decision Bay both points of the disputes and simple need to pay a tuition fees in hitter to open the dispute I'll explain why how the arbitration fees are you soon on the other side at Claire's quartz users need to step in a giant works after staking their claim they are eligible to be randomly selected were case Jews can see other cases on myface page but baseless have an overview of the information for the doors before let me zoom in for details Cyprus polygons the code samples between the individuals can see information of the case for example the court name and sky sky assurance the transcription of the of the disputes actually do not pay for the repair the coherent rewards which are the rewards disorders we win by ultimately by cutting with the majority of the jurors devoting deadlines and also a sit days bottom this isn't a splitting of Cynthia's bottom juris alleged show the case details page which contains of information they need to properly evaluate the case in Casa bones in this case Jones can see the title of the dispute a short description and evidence module and a policies page it is important to note that if the shoe were drawn for a case on our feeling round they may also be able to see artistic twist module without justifications in folks from previous rounds at the bottom Germans can justify the votes and choose between one of the options it is example it is at the bottom there are two options this case had so Alice or Bob but the way they also wanted a few painting of the structure of the case with multiple choice and also embody two options so depending of the case dispute eccentric layers we have different modules joe amodei this kind of disputes what's a charge we face when the designer death was how to display at this at the initial version we used to display evidence like document I chose that proved not to be the best approach as we hope the death and get more complex cases so we needed that simple way to display evidence something like a formal conversation something that anyone could understand the solution we found was to display events like for messages they are ordered simple and sequential this way they have been subsequent dialogue with each other each piece of evidence can also have a context instead of only being just individuals are separated part of fitness so chosen more how the mechanism assistive mechanism works or explain how is the Tommy hit distribution on the same example as you say else involves principal getting into a dispute on clamsquatch we have these rules you can see the rice five workers four of them at the top voted for her Ellie's malignancy has voted for what they consider the winner else receives her Patricia is Anita back being the loser Bob bobs arbitration fees a distributed among the coherent jurors the students who have hoped with the majority additional site Agena in a sea also loses his focus they are distributed to the coherence jurors so the combination of Peter and Dean Cain I sure we by voting covalently voting with the majority is quantitative coherence fee Awards this is a way we found your gamification to track some gamification to the system and make sure the user gets motivated to continue voting or to the arbitration cases and seems to be working quite well the incentive mechanism space of the Sham points and wisdom of the crowd and it helps you to get the users with the correct incentives to properly consider voting honestly try to to make a fair arbitration to to the strings a bit more about this are showing you a real user case this is mark one of her more active jurors as you can see has voted arbitrated in 29 cases to that agency Claire sport they have been making someone in both the internet DNA I have to so be disputes in several parts especially one of our courts the PLAs report as you can see in this example how the elicited mechanism worked show incentivize users identify jurors 2:23 voltage to to make a fantasy to the system and all of these contributes were more just dispute resolution system another challenge we faced was how to reach non critical users how to dialogue with them as a legal debt will be mostly talking to legal professionals and life specialists and also have our own fellowship program which brings aside strong law professionals and with we think that was important to have a way to dialogue with them to to display how how the product works without having to to prep to best to draw the depression at the beginning so we decided to have her reverted approach to how to reach to dialogue with the crypto users instead of having them to pass throughout the whole party process of opening wallets save the private key is so on we decided to avert that they create something that they who can sleep or Voyles tourneys shirts and also researchers so they can test the product they can see how he walks through the the way and to the the the generated interest in our solution this is our usual get into Brito by some little endian already tested so before finishing I wanted to bring to share some insights for orientation solutions there are very simple insights quite obvious but for the reason they tend to be ignored when designing adaptable brilliant products so it is a state that so basically be visual explore visual metaphors to communicate ideas invest in flexibility modularity in simplicity assume a beginner's mind set when building a Democrat communicate with end users language evaluations technical terms make them accessible to anyone but it we need to to make sure that anyone who use of a problem not only produces the whole in experts also be transparent and enhance user awareness beyond States of the treasure transactions as I was as well as its costs and risks this is quite important points with design adept to make sure the user knows exactly where the transaction leading how how much will costs and all the the risk involved to compute as like to invite everyone to test their sports is on maintenance and portal there's a table and if you just want to take a look how it works and the option port is also on Clemson table is less port - boo thank you [Applause] you
