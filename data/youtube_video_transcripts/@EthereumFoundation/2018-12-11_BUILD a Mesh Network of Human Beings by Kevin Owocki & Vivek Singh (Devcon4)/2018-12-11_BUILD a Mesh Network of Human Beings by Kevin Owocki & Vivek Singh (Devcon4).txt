hi everybody my name is Vivek Singh how's everyone doing today good awesome welcome to Def Con we're really excited to be here I work on a project called get coin alongside Kevin here Alisa Scott are in the back hanging out we're all here and are very excited to talk to you so as I mentioned I'm Vivek one of the cofounders of the project Kevin here started get coin in his basement about 18 months ago now and get coin has been on main net for for about 12 months and we're excited to share a little bit more about how we think about get coin and a new product that we have launched just just today so for anyone who doesn't know what get coin is it is a place to get coins there's no get coin token but you can receive bounties in eath die or any other ERC 20 token for contributing code to open-source projects our mission is to grow up in source and there's no better place than the etherium ecosystem to do that so we're really excited to be here and continue that mission so growing open source has been has been the kind of rallying cry of get coin and and we have a couple of other products that are coming into that that space as time passes alongside the bounties product that we're most known for so to kind of preface that get coin is really a p2p network as you can see on left here you have what a traditional corporation might look like and really this room is something kind of like this mesh over here which is a bunch of people working on different things that are kind of related to aetherium but also have their own specifications and interests and the geek coin mesh network that you're looking at is developers who are working on projects like meta masks and get coin and aetherium and and many others enter and are contributing to many different things and and we really think that that this is the future of how we're will happen and we're excited to be building out a suite of tools that's that's associated with this mesh network so this is what we think it can look like which is a little crazier than our mesh network more edges more companies more open source projects and contributors working all across them and finding ways to to deliver value so the other important thing to note is that the network is you know although we can show it in one way on the last slide we can also show it as as everyone in this room we're all humans we all have a lot to to give and personalities and and we value more than just getting paid for working on open source projects which is something that get coin is is well-known for for bringing into the ecosystem so we want to make sure to remember that along the way this is just one last slide the other thing that we think the network must do is provide value so get coin is has been doing hopefully some of that along the way we've done $375,000 but the bounties last month we had 27,000 active users if you post a bounty you'll get somebody working on it within six hours usually and within seven or eight days the bounty will be turned around and we've seen 16 of those those 3d humans hired into full-time roles in the usually the etherium ecosystem so we're excited to have played a small part there and with that we'll talk a little bit about an experiment we're launching and I'll let Kevin talk a little more about that thanks thanks for Vake the one other thing I want to note on this slide over here is that we just added this new metric of of about 30,000 monthly active users to our results page and it is is my my dream to help Joe Lubin win his bet with Jimmy song by being one of those five projects that has more than 100k monthly users within I forget how many years so let's all help him do that all right so we are launching an experiment get coin is playing in a space open-source software that has traditionally been sort of intrinsically motivated developers contribute to open source software for a number of reasons because they're a software that they want to see in the world because they want to meet other people who are like-minded because they want to increase their skill set and they want to work on stuff that's aligned with their values get coin is very extrinsic ly motivating right now because it's it's bounties and so one of the things that we realized was that there's sort of a mismatch between our target community and why they do why they do work and and sort of and in the get coins products so we are launching today a new product that's meant to be focused a little bit more on intrinsic motivation and hopefully over the next year get coin will be known as less as bounties for open source software and more of a suite of tools that are for blockchain based developers so is with great pleasure that I will show you kudos which is a non fungible token backed by the ethereum blockchain that has beautiful art which represents a sincere compliment that you got from a member of your team I've been in software and entrepreneurship for the last ten years I've built some really great stuff but the thing that I really accruing over time is great relationships with badass developers and product managers and creators of all types and so representing that use case in that relationship with the people who are building web 3 and the community the mesh network of three-dimensional humans that we're building at get coin is the endgame here and hopefully we'll have a little bit of fun while we bootstrapped reputation and web 3 with these non fungible tokens so if you know someone whose contributions are magical and you want to celebrate that or you just like pretty colors then you can send this magical unicorn kudos if you know someone who is a Linux wizard it was really good on the command line I was able to solve all of your problems on Linux then you can send them a Linux wizard kudos if you know someone who is a genius then you can send them this genius kudos I don't know why you would send this kudos but I heard developers like memes so we're gonna see if meme meme kudos are a thing and let's see this is by and large the weirdest kudos that we've made I think the Metallica Feeny if you're in here I'm sorry that I'm so creepy but you gave us you gave the world blockchain so that's that's without artwork is every kudos is created by an artist who has a crypto economic incentive to deliver more art to the ecosystem right now we're launching with 140 kudos in the marketplace that have all been bootstrapped by us but because when you purchase a kudos and send it to your coworker you're directly supporting the artist our hope is that the universe of kudos will be expanded to more accurately rossette resemble the universe of compliments that humanity can send to each other and that the liquidity on kudos will will increase over time and we also hope to integrate kudos into other platforms we think that compliments in non fungible tokens are possibly cooperative of bootstrapping reputation and stickiness on on web 3 platforms so really excited to launch this experiment at get coin cove / kudos today and i would like to say thank you to the etherium foundation the ECF in the community for all of these support Cheers see around you you
