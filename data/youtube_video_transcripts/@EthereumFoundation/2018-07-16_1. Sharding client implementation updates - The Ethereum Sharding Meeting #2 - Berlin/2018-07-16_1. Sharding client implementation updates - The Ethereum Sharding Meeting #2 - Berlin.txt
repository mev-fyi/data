at the beginning we start from the Pineville traveling from central update which is like me and Kevin Nicholas yes Jonnie and also have the Trinity team all together okay so let's go through it okay it's okay next so cuz I will there are some different parts of the our current shopping fermentation so right now follow the latest things we will have like four layers with four different components in the whole pictures and stop on dimension and the P contraction and the some mysterious executing and drink be introduced in other places please so right now we are walking on the big concern and traction concurrently and for the last two months we are walking on the minimal shopping protocol channel keynote which is a Python implantation and we figure out the storage we have some because in the chakra we use collation instead of block which will add might be not happy with it and now we the networking is based on the staff p2p and we do some worries cinco lized the logic of the shop here because it's the minimum shouting protocol we have some step like proposing the nose can add some new collection to the SNC which is the shot major country on dementia and the single eye stuff can't broadcast some new proposal and we forget through the network and the thinking process is also quite simple it can the note can request for closure and respond to what specific collection it needs and there are some other - - list we are missing and we will finish sighs how to do now is only single shot in the single new world and how do we implement to two weeks ago and also the collection content these things will be modified practice the collation hater structure maybe change the other pastor the collection contains the now it's only just written laws and should we try to use some translation English and here is the instance e chatting and ER culture history oh honey that couple months for couple ounces and now my but now we can say hello to the beacon chain and now the cast party the Casper team and Shannon King we all together to finish the beacon chain POC and this is our short-term plan we will finish the because you are PLC the become shown repository and also we will build the clan logic and the Trinity note there's some profile Cassity fake which trusting we are introduced this afternoon and also the not very active service and we will try to experiment with the gossip stop the lady to be cut subside network tests Trinity and also because the first one is just a guilty so we will try to build the beacon chain run the book you can check on the channel and also we have so [Music] so if we did to me it should be highly flexible to mainly to support research to at least one of the cargoes to give the research of something that they can [Music] [Music] it's not obviously twenty few will probably never play a really big role competition to be the fastest but this may turn out totally different when we have proof of state where you are like assigned slots to produce a block and then may well become the wrong bag for series known actually and we don't know what intentions to provide them and know what that can say I mean that and actually we I think the wrong chain and some deviant lettuces so that's a bad man so so where are we we just released a public offer but again it is a public alpha so we sent the run chain we missed some hedge attack so it's an alpha we we are fasting progressing to to have missing features like right now we're writing a transaction pool so far we're not doing anything with transactions the sharding and the caspere research this right now happening on top of Trinity and as I mentioned there was this no I think it ended yesterday the solidity gas parking contest for instance there was blood already on IBM so it's one of the use cases that we obviously want to support yeah so that's from my side amalia cooling source code documentation actually access feel free to talk for us [Applause] [Music] video hi this is James I've been working on drops of diamond as sharding implementation with rust and the plan is to integrate it into parity so I won't be able to take any questions during the talk this is just a recording but there'll be a link afterwards to post any questions so this is our repo on github and as you can see there's quite a bit of work on the CLI and environment and nodes so the node is where most of the work is for running is a collator and as a proposal Oh initially it was a circulator but now it's as a notary and a proposal the CLI is just a command-line interface wrapper around the main core functionality and the environment is just for the running or testing with cargo a package manager of the rust so the name rust is because it was chosen through the Russ programming language because it's designed to run at close to the middle as close to the metal as possible so it can be fast low level memory safe concurrent and have zero cost abstractions plus other features so you can write it like you can have features like a high-level language but it can compile down to bond out a very fast speed lately what I've been doing is reading up on a lot of stuff in order to develop gossip sub which is a peer-to-peer messaging protocol that would be part of Lib p2p it's already Davitt been developed in go so I was reading it go and the gossip sub implementation and go as well as the limpet specs and reading the code of Rosslyn Peter P and also reading through the Tokyo crate which is used for asynchronous Nick networking so I'll be starting development of gossip table pretty soon what's been done so far is the command-line interface and the node functionality or the interface the handle panelists for the sharding manager contract and blog serialization has been done a lot of however some work still needs to be done on the venturi and to be able to store existing blobs in collations and existing collections in the tree and then be able to fetch existing collections to put blocks in them until it's full so we can put blogs into new collections at the moment but not into once that they've already been created could be existing plots in there I've also been reading through a lot of posts on earth research with the shardene category so that's taking up a bit of time there's a lot of work that still needs to be done so finishing up on blob serialization and gossip sub and continuing work on the core protocol implementing the research that comes out for phase one and beyond so a lot like some key things in the roadmap that would require a lot of work it was them which see what seemeth team has been working on and cast Bertha's G is also being worked on in rusts and but not so much Kasper CBC correct by construction I don't know if anyone's worked on that all I did hear that another blockchain project was using Casper CBC and also cross side synchronous and asynchronous transactions as well as other stuff like storage rant and bandwidth fees and so on and you can find more in the road map link as well as other stuff in the issues and project in our repo I did apply for a grant back in January but I'm yeah feedback has been given from the etherium foundation it was that they wanted to see more progress before they can give a grant other grant programs have been applied for but it's I think it's difficult to receive funding from other grant programs when they see that no funding has been received from the etherion foundation or the e theorem Community Fund so I think for funding and donations to come from other parties then it will probably be necessary to get traction from by getting funding from the a fair hearing Foundation and som Community Fund I'm definitely looking forward to scaling iam and will continue working on it and yeah there's many potential uses of etherium you could potentially use it for any kind of governance or economic activity given that you have the right programming in make it secure so there's a long list of uses current and potential in that link unfortunately a void call is not able to fit in the to the schedule today however I'll be happy to take any questions on the get a link stay tuned for more progress on shouting follow us on Twitter and check out our github repo and feel free to contribute [Applause] my name is Mikael and we don't want to spend much time on networking so we are about to have something like the sixty-two radical adopted or we can change structures and all these simplifications aims ago to deliver that first or working in predictable amount of time the next version is introduced sharks and cross wings not really maybe a group of custody and here we will try to implement a complex cryptography like Els the next stage is customer actually these two stage sharks and Casper can be done in parallel so that's it detailed what matters here we are also going to post some major updates on this on the page so stay tuned thank you very much [Applause] [Music] [Music] language to bridge the gap between the research is going on in Python right now which has the performance characteristics of C++ and rust every single metric the end result we see more but when programming in Python before I go to the few examples to tell you a little bit about our progress so far basically since we are starting from scratch our initial goal was obviously to gain compatibility with the existing VM and the existing ecosystem so our first goal is to so that to have a fully compatible even implementation the disabled to passed all the tests existing test and that is can sing the Bach chain and execute the entire history so far and hopefully the same result [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] a lot of in the development so the main thing that I did before was the shining magnitude contract now I suppose [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is really important [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
