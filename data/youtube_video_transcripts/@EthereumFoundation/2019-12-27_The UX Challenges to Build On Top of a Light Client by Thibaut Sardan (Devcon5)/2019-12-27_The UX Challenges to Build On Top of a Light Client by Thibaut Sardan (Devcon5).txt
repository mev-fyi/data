[Applause] strategies to build a novel for a client so why you want to use my clients basically when you have the top and connected club change your most probably not connected with you all know you're just connect to interrupt for instance and this is like a trusted note and that's problematic because you want to utilize this space right the problem is if you go to this trusted no then the trusted Norma goes you know starts  you or start censoring you that's probably right but to happen if you want a centralized event so what you can do is actually don't only those who notes these all the notes from lutheran network but also light notes or light clients that see I just use this exchange area what you can do is actually have a light client inside to that that will connect to the very good clients the very few notes and this light client can be trust less so it can just verify everything gets from the blockchain it's no surprise because will not be censored or will not use centralized water failure so by using the light plant inside I'll adapt and not connecting to third-party trusted node portrayed is a tiny bit of speed on privacy and decentralization so when you build decentralized app on top of what I think you have to make sure that you deal with some problems that will happen because of this because you're using the lifetime things on it's slower in spice you think once something that your users well some problem type view user would have eventually because you're using the right client and things of be stored so for instance because of p2p connection you know to have problems to find PS for instance or could take a bit of time to show a transformations of course it happens also Akbari but if the internet connection are not good things like token images you can will stop it's slow to load and eventually the whole singing time might also take a bit of time anyway or four seconds so you have to let you use this you know do something why why these things happen so what we want to do is you want to make sure the transparent you don't want to you know wait freeze the whole thing if you know he's not responding so tell users responding and just renounce it if you have no fears maybe the users but activities should show that and why are you thinking because the you know the lifeline will sink you will have to you know show off what you are if images are long to fetch not videos just make sure you're not rock you can uses I'm just going quickly over there just want to show you verbally out we implemented this in feather so whether is a an application built on top of a light client so when you launch it it's actually sinking here in the background and it will sink in a couple seconds maybe a minute but you know what like you can do stuff as a user so for instance here you know creating an account generating you know moon cat and then of course you you like this is the own body go so you have to do the things like show them the money custom to get food that they put that paper and create the password confirm and this is sinking you know the background you show them like okay with 39 percent them and what you can do is you know let's say people just add another comment whatever this is taking over of time but I'm selecting a five year for mine for my PC yeah I mean you get thing one minute's death so I want to talk about just this application that is built on the right client has been audited by trade of bits will be version I think next week with all the things fixed and will now let it run by the community if you interested who had shameless plug hi that talk to me if you interested [Applause]
