[Applause] I heard about that it's lost on that phone for Mike and I we're just going around we didn't actually have official talk but it was super funny because everybody was talking about Anthony was around the same time that he do without me to adopt and so on so those are the bombing bus and we ended up realizing that you know people actually want to read about it with you people want to you know up their their skills and understand what this thing is all about so we have inferred even I think nothing like a subversive workshop on velocity very very impromptu relegated over to the ground a very small organized we haven't turned out of my habit of 40 to 50 people in a tiny room and we had to we had to like move all the furniture out to and sit on the ground so it felt like the other started something very special in this variance between a theory of enemies would be and we actually have official sessions this time so it's great we have this is one of two sessions that we are running in telephone what I'm going to talk about is what what has been up and they be to be project over the last few months and what's coming next a lot of super exciting stuff coming up next so I'm going to go super super quickly I don't even go be done for this in time but if I don't come feel come come find me I'm going to be I'm going to be around the second talk how we go to be having as I thought is about so a lot of people gossip service is a great protocol that's being about to be a need to project and a lot of information so we decided to do have like a deep dive in cause it's up but sometimes that's happening on Wednesday Ruby 10 and your college itself in the science practice gonna to finger subset now so I see a lot of video business here so it was actually user biomass is actually user obviously right now okay that's pretty cool that's good who contributes shouldn't be to be nice oK we've got the most amazing activities you must appease me that's also cool so that's got started as I said we have a lot of ground to cover very little time and what I want to go through today so who was actually what was actually pretty familiar with living to be we just say like who's the fire than they need to be - okay 500 us so I think the one-on-one the 101 is going to be it's going to be important to go through today then I'm going to I'm going to talk about what we've shed in the last few months and what we actually building and what's going to be shipping over the next few months so so yeah so that's a little insurance with a b2b so basically it's a modular peer-to-peer networking stack it is I think I'm going to call the mayor of decentralized bathrooms because it basically is so if you realize every we will take everything that's going to built in this conference my team's telling this confidence and so on rests on top of unstoppable networks if we don't have your good be able to be a rock-solid networking foundations we have nothing right because the very nature of everything that we building is decentralized and decentralized means that different nodes around the world without knowing each other can operate Acosta's have protocols across the same person search so limited means a modular view we are networking stack which is essentially a composable it's a multiple set of building blocks to assemble a future-proof peer-to-peer networking server runs on many runtimes server browser then experiments in mobile environments as well and soon as the team that's working on making it into the about nicely on embedded devices it originated in the idea this project and it's right now implemented across 70 it's a different day at different levels of maturity this is busting across transporter community initially it was created by ideological us and it's doing it backwards perhaps but by no means does protocol laughs born the community whether at this point in time it's become a public rather is being exalted all across the PN system it's nice and currently nice and sufficient under the a light side but soon we're going to be transition of the Vieira's lessons so we're going to be transitioning this to the permissive license tag which gives you even more parent ease in terms of us being not related to or any rights at all over a B to B so but that's certainly to be really hinges on this concept of decentralized process address what is the centralized courses in principle the grand vision of the bridge would be is to is to provide the ability to locate connect authenticate negotiate and interact efficiently with processes around the world no matter where they are no matter what transfers are using normal run times they're using as long as their identity is cryptographically derived from through their identities cryptographic a to derive from the public key and let me to be really strives to make this happen in a seamless manner by taking care of a traversal really switching a few other things that I wanted to make different processes that are running anywhere that once can find other processes in this girl and does global hunger that is the internet and interact with each other even as those processes relocating Rome evolve mutate over time it's it's this is the concept of persistent Nursing is completely juxtaposed to and quite interesting which relies on having a on targeting a process by where they are in the water by an IP address right so as a single second book is a is a sack of the possible building blocks and these building about some transference multiplexer circular channel in Discovery pops up traversal and several other things that I'm not even mentioned here so then go directly to be has toolbox to the sample the networking layer of a decent across platform from compostable means it's kind of a drug network on right these are that's snug into each other by abstractions and each of these settlements can have multiple backing implementation so for example we have multiple transforming CCP quick there's groups of transferring excellent company that we're working on UDP so it's a as a number of backing and commutations regions pieces so that's another like what I have I have very little time so this is what I have for it intro and now we're going to talk about what we said in the last few months and this is super exciting so we have so addictive II has seven native implementations which are not ships this shipping distance right nothing is that the job of this world right but what small about this is that each community implementation really is backed and supported by a different provider different community a different team in the ankle system and these things are actually working hey we've got some yogurt so we're going  crazy max same as other pairs of relativity we've got the Sigma Prime team over there that simplemente trusted me to be that's working with the Wagner foundation for us to be to be we have up there something we have a Java team around well we've got go into a cemetery this is pretty cool this is that all of these improvisation actually spoil the latency specifications so they're interoperable with one another they are at different levels of maturity so the three most mature works that we consider are Jas go and Russ and I they need to be JVM and nib are mostly driven by the theory to project and CBD that to me is driven by the opponent operand so that's a prequel and most great about this is that each of them takes a bigger weight also targets specialized environments right so in the case of movie they are making a strong effort to target at better than constraint devices right in the case of Jamie I'm the neutropenia right now in the current version is that it's a Java presentation but in the next version that would be very geared towards I'm during the spell all right so this is this is you know this is brief hungry hungry miles okay so in terms of adoption the adoption of the b2b over the last few months so let's type in kinda like in February Network effects it's been a reason so what's cool about so here you come I feel you're not doing something worth mentioning of course poking out the theory and find when I'd be a fan as that they're kind of like the top ones over there and that there is t-rex that's during the bottom pulls himself hoping desire that I've created another point from India and that's what's cool about both distraction and having a basically having a bunch of communities that when you look at how they wouldn't build their networking neighbors from scratch they would have been looks a lot like one event right you give this like no insurance interest rates right so connectivity addressing video discovery at rehearsal these are things that call that caused a across the right so there's no point reading I take the wheel and each of these projects what's cool is that well these projects are not you're not raising the degree to be able to community to triple their brains and the hands to build a rock-solid networking foundation and what's great is that most of these projects are actually contributing back to me too so not just using the technology that actually contributes a few weeks ago we also saw the 7-way Interop laid off of the Eve 2.0 projects so a bunch of teams actually not themselves up in a few pallets in Canada and I came up with a network of living to be based network of all seven of seven - built in different languages interacting with one another and this is impressive this is a tree that was super popular not cool so a few weeks ago we also launched deference and we made so that grass is a place where we're going to be publishing and you get where we're going to be publishing work that we would we would like to get done but it's also economics have space for different projects across the ecosystem to publish items that would like to and they need to be and go find those sites and some more funds together to make sure that those happen and at one point we're speaking as well with a few teams that are gonna help us fund much of this work iodized and a few other things we also awarded a bunch of a bunch of bounties that you burn it that was here to be huge hugely successful we've also submitted tops and snacks this has been a long-standing issue for the PCT project thanks to everybody who stuck by us during the dark times while we then have good conceptual thoughts we now have an amazing your website we're engaged in a full specs we tried to make sure that the sex actually matched and they're accurate review presentations we've created a sex paternity cycle we're defining an RC Pro system we're maturing and a lot of insurance of your other things I've got just enough cool right CSIS well thanks we've knowledge that the discussion forums as well so you've got discuss them that you could be done I know so even have any useless questions if you want to try the discussion and about things that I'm not necessarily need box or change requests and so on and code this is no place to go not where you get health and we've said to punch PJ system up alright so this is just the best of the ones that came to mind we've got what time I want to read a we created a automating experiment so we don't general to read a experiment IVFs carried a bunch of remnants from that th one point we spent a petition going it because we prick transported with drop 20 degrees support where Isis is very transport which is which was actually promoted and created by the vortex at 0 X Athena here brought the problem piece wasn't deployment so probably schools and departments are trusted to be included we see as well with a lot of support from the 0x guys was he in the room as well we've got some support that was created by the guys at Sigma brain a rest so obtaining the reference ing tram ability to be a ported over to Russ as well as the guys from ginseng who did the work for AJ esta before jsap to be and they are the bike amazing we also showed no the b2b team we have three facts with me in some things this is going to be 2 p.m. at deltek going on there is a up-and-coming muchos transport that has been created by a team of French gene that's 140 a decentralized spirit appear off tonight first message application and they've got that running on Google it be to be shipped in in iOS and of course we've done like we've done any stability and performance fixes across the board so that is what we should so far in the last few months the things that actually came to mind a lot more things that come to mind so sorry if I didn't mention some that you think are about ready means and I talked about what we working on and what's on the roadmap for the few but for the next few months so number one I would say number one priority not just for us but for a lot of projects a lot of teams across the board is testing that scale and this is a recurring topic whenever I speak to a team we like pretty confused so they don't like they've always asked about hey uncommon testing might be if that's how you testing them easily it's here what other what dozen techniques and so on so we're actually this has become a bottleneck for us we want to make sure that every single release of maybe to be and I BFS and other projects that we put out there it's well so that the the improvements or the deterioration of each release and each commit digit well constantly and for that we need a platform which we're calling names of an integrity test run to be able to create distribution of record usable test but it's magnitudes of 100,000 votes right what's imitated memory conditions so this is going to be a platform that is Trinity in development we have architect on this platform it is racing towards it and what we want to make sure it is that it's time time being integrated with the engineering side so basically and having another where you have to where you have to do things manually every single time right so we want for every single commit of living to be and IVFs to be subjected to a battery of tests of difference right so comparison testing how does this really tells us this in it you compare it to a previous commit or to a previous brown chocolate cause it's this vr deteriorate work through the status pool in terms of how my goat behaves what about runtime characteristics and also in terms of emergent network behavior as a result of deploying that PR in the neck rank of 10,000 loads $100,000 right we want to be able to do incite chaos testing interpretability testing so being able to take for example a particular proportion of nodes that are running IBFX whether it be to the duration whatever 50% of I'm running this version 20% that I'm running this version and 10% without running another person and understand how that combination actually plays out in terms of the in terms of performance this is what what the architecture is looking tonight if you want to float on a separate if you want to track what we're doing make sure that you watch this right IBM assessment it is right now on the under the IDF has spread that it's probably going to be moved so that it be to be in grete at one point because it's a bit it's way lowering the cyclin IVFs or even a separate talk that won't rush it I love that I'm super excited about public we're doing activity on is instrumentation so a lot of teams of us to us for observer ability and essentially the capabilities of X rating to one living to be suck this precisely do a minimal size so we apparently named the ROM work by taking a data first approach right so yeah when we also have to create at how Christmas is about things that are happening let me to be her really the scalable way to build this is to tap into the innards of the b2b and expose a firehose of instrumentation data by a standard protocol such that any implementation of the b2b by adopting portable would render itself to be visualized and being inspected by a column trailer right so the next set so we're focusing on building about five impose by an introspection approach people that we drafted and the next time is to create a binding frame that considers that data in a browser creates us essentially a reactive State repository on the browser that react to be different driven visualizations can subscribe to and visualize data whether it's a recording of the slice of time and where we want to get people the ability to move backwards towards satellite you can if you want to debug a particular situation you can start up a recording take it down and then go with it into the browser and through device and move through time as well as will change the activity of a node in real time so say I'm a Germany is a browser library for developers to to propose reusable visualization said return home this will kick-start a counselor of reusable visualizations for category that are compatible with fallen in b2b implementations and by the way this project is codenamed phantom direct so if you see if you hear those terms now you know what it's about so today so if you are the things that we hear that we're going to be working on that we're actually working on our message orientation so this is saying a long-standing missing teacher need to be so this so we're in time for it you need to become an entry point so for the newbies every point to become a factory of stats from which you'll be able to create different kinds of hosts we're working on not hole punching and our connection upgrade so we already have you and not be important support or its opening support but and we have people to every day and those are not subsystems that I capable of sensing if you're running behind you have they automatically starting up a connection with every day and advertising those addresses so the rest of the world so that you could receive any mob connections but that is super inefficient and what we need to do is move to a place where we means that we need connection as an embryonic connection to do signaling between the between the two between various peers to start to initiate a whole punching procedure and hopefully be able to pull match right we're gonna be working on robust permissive supports as well but together 23 and this is important because this combination of working pulse is what's used in HTTP 3 as well and if we made Libby to be Rabbani port 443 this means that would basically have a high chance of being a lot more sensitive resistance that the system that we are please if you don't think something working on negotiation but if I make rotation along with you've been to this library it looks like so unless he's active or not if you hear this this a bunch of features that are necessary for you to point them as well so they're super high priority for us we are creating music your channels do that's 1.3 invoice time jinks aside shakes is going to be using those pipelines which uses a combination of optimistic scenarios for a bracelet for box when the key is not one that you have projected on the other end we're going to be working on TNS one we read on languages we already have support for go away there are some roadblocks Jason rust so we're going to be switching to those and more and basically yeah so a few more things here to mention like with specific improvements of maturity pops up ecolution so make sure that you come to the Gulf's obsession on Muncey which is a to 255 room be beaten because we're going to be we're going to be talking about some of the things that are coming down the pike in terms of where this is heading we're going to be talking about and which is the future generation of muscle tone or illusion so hardening the DHD which is principal thing right now for us and this is dependent on the test round we are aiming to to get even better sex so we're aiming for 100 percent accurate respect and this a contributor and this this disappear that's working actively doing this on the topic CTA CTA on your browsing reputation London from these updates that are ideas that we're developing on headset we hope to not shout over the next few months also wanted to showcase was what I talked about that year the group of transport it going a p2p which was developed by over France improve team burnsy unfortunately it is so little stories when we caught that boy we kind you this relaxes public access to the code but that will change hopefully shortly and that's pretty much what happened today so that was super rushed about a content to share and if you have any questions make sure to to hit me - Vinny I'm going to be roaming around make sure we come to the next session we have a goal set up which is tomorrow at 2:55 and room b10 and make sure if you are excited about the competing like we are and a lot of people in this room are make sure to get involved either by shaping the future contributing to the specs but hacking won't meet simple meaty things looking at the Democrats and and and taking on some of that work and if you just when I contributed you know one particular pin instead make sure to watch the project records after those have a contact details if you don't find you around you want to talk maybe to be make sure to pick me on those networks [Applause]
