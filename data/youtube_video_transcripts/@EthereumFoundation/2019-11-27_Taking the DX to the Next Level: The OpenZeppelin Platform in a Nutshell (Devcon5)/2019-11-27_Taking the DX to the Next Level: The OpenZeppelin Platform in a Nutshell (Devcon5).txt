[Applause] my name is Connie I have a party over offensively you may know because of the security lights we perform we added the silicone primarily I did the Ciroc retreats for home base we either broke serpent by these days most recently we are using compound and in style you also may know us because of the open selling contracts aka open sibling solidity report which you may know about and one of the most uses libraries in the system with more than 2k down those but today I'm not going to give us security I'm not talking about the contracts repo I'm going to give up to tools we got being developing with our team which are the opens Elena as decay and the organs of the strata kids so first of all why well we really think that development tools right now in the system are still green compared to other you know ecosystems to other industries and we love to build things for you guys that's why we basically build these two tools and we're gonna start with the open seven cking do opens up instigate a success or development keys or - which has a CLI that will let you develop your contracts compile them using any Soviet version you want deploy Emily's upgrade them interact with them again using the CLI and startups in only five minutes but now right well this is an empire so just run in npm install at open 7 / CLI we will do the trick well so how you can start your project super easy after installing it just when open sampling it will start everything you need to start coding your contracts you then probably will want to go your contract which for example could be a my contract with a function that is called to something that will subside something parameter i'm just 40 point you just have to run opens that we create specifying the contract name which never you want to deploy to we're just not really necessary because all these comments are interactive and if you don't specify the parameters nor the flags you won't have any problem and you know will deploy only with duck command the and now that we have our contract deployed we probably want to tell with it which is against Parisi the open cell in CLA has two super handy demands which are called inference actually call basically for calling purely functions and center section for calling any other public function and will actually made a transaction to the blockchain under super super easy to use and as we don't know development software yeah software development and again the cycle of software development has its problems we are humans developers about human sin we commit mistakes we know that by just seeing the history of contraband and all the money that was lost in security so maybe you want to update a break our broken content which is again super easy with this tool you just have to you know modify your broken function a new awesome cool and just run open simply upgrade specify your project and the salt DCL I will upgrade your contract and as you can see it is deployed in exactly the same address as people screen the first time I'm not gonna go over it even this topic but if you want to ignore on how we are implementing this please go to the airplane slash upgrades but anything else that's DCL is anything else yet apart from the commands in the Left we have our super handy commands compact for compiling your contracts with any version of so later you won't verify for verifying to either side or either speaker chain opens up here a specific network transfer for transferring ether or your FC Twente tokens to any account balance to query the balance on any on situations for ease of hanging hands and I wanted this last permanently unpopular because this is the link we have with open sampling strategies which are basically test components for you to start your douse your centralized applications just running a couple of minutes so the components of the surrogates are the open something contracts which you all probably know oneself in a security that we have been talking about if you are for connecting to a network a one-liner killer one-liner web 3 adapter that you can use to avoid the cumbersome process of you know developing the first part of free reaction rules for managing your front-end web components and the open supplement load which is the super cool - we developed that will let you modify your contracts on the go and after saving them you will be able to see in your website those changes I mean if you have something Brigantine lying to save your contract with a different API we will be able to see that same information the information within your website use each piece against super easy with the CLI running open something on my starter or opens up in combat tutorial will do the trick being starter the starter kit which will let you start a project from scratch and toriel a simple demo how to use the CLI 'when two super useful examples of our counter on AVM packages you can regard going to sell things / storing it slip assembling / sdk and the salt thank you very much [Applause] you
