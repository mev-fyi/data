[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] hello good morning everyone uh welcome to the east acre Community uh hosted call for the kilm testnet merge uh today is Tuesday March 15th and we are really just a few minutes away from the merge we're going to spend a few minutes talking about it right about now some GPU miners are going to kick in and our total terminal difficulty is going to be achieved and so really we just want to talk about what this means and um yeah kind of celebrate together so uh welcome everyone Hey so uh let me pick a random face uh Perry you have spent a lot of time uh setting up these these merged test Nets uh do you want to give us your idea of the big picture where we're at today sure um so right now it looks like we're able to get almost every client up and running or every client combination which we weren't able to do in time for Kentucky um so we're we're doing way better than before and we even have the killing configs already on Master for a lot of the clients with official releases um I think we're doing a lot better than we ever had um I actually was even able to downsize all of the machines that I'm using for the current test net so for the previous one just to be a bit safe I had like over provisioned all the instances and now that we've like gone through this many times I was confident enough to like be a bit more cheap about it um things are things are looking more production I have to say and you're running on a Raspberry Pi Farm is that is that a fair assessment that would be really cool but not this not to mention we had a fire drill right oh yes that was um really really interesting we didn't expect the GPU miners to kick in with that much force so we we sort of had an idea um how how much of a TTD we need to set uh we use basically a multiple of the previous couple of test Nets um but it looks like people really loved it and wanted to hit TTD even before the proof of State network was live um and just to clarify such a thing can't happen on me net it's a typical problem that we're going to have just with these sort of test Nets um so we had a fire gel where we spoke to all the clients and everyone had the capability to delay or override the TTD that was in the conflict and we had never tested it and we just sort of yoloaded on Friday and it seems to work so far I guess once so much actually happens we know if it worked perfectly or not um but yeah really looking forward to that yeah and so to give context to the big picture um I'll have to confess uh I woke up this morning and I was like okay gotta get ready for the merge call tomorrow um and uh discovered that overnight uh some I guess as I would describe it some community members still really excited about the merge and they're doing everything they can to bring the merch closer to us uh and so uh they they launched their gpus last night to accelerate the merge and I appreciate that like it's it's good it's working out well for us um but that means that I woke up at 6am and I'm like oh we have to plan a merge call in two hours uh and so uh we're quickly rushing around and we we get everyone here we've got the merge call what is happening is uh so hi I'm super Fizz um I'm here I'm joined by um Danny from the ethereum foundation Marius from Geth uh Perry who does devops uh Nolan brimmy Colfax Sam from eat Staker um Mentor from well a bunch of poapp also people uh Pusha from the cat herders um Mamie from Nimbus like a big community of um of ethereum supporters and developers Alex Hello Alex from uh our our wonderful edges of the internet um and so what's happening here today is for the past week uh a a test net called Kiln has been maturing it has been maturing on two different chains it has been maturing as a proof of work chain and a proof of stake chain and the big event today is that we're going to see the first public example of those coming together at a at a at a certain block uh and at that point the GPU miners the proof of work chain consensus model will shut off and the consensus managed by proof of stake will kick in Danny did you have something I was just waving goodbye to the miners oh yeah and so um I I'll tell you ethereum wouldn't be where it is today if it if it hadn't been for six years of GPU Mining and I I participated as a GPU Miner from the beginning I still obsess and dream about it I'm still nodding on the sapolia test net um but uh we know something better now we know that proof of stake is a better path forward we know that it's more I'm going to get the three s's uh more scalable more secure and more Essie um sustainable and for sustainable yeah sustainable so uh we're we're able to shut off all of those GPU Miners and sort of uh turn to things like Raspberry Pi's and nooks and you know regular consumer grade Hardware to secure the network today's event is the first public demonstration of of that merge and it will be if it's successful it'll be followed by um rinka B robstein and Gurley and then mainnet did I get that right yeah the order is probably Up For Debate but that that's the uh that's the plan although sepolia Robson Gourley rinkaby might be left behind I heard about that so sepolia replaces rinkaby is that the the big that's right here okay cool it's funny like um as many people don't know me I'm not a developer I'm really just some dude who hangs out in his office all day and makes up um but I like I keep hearing about sepolia and I'm like I'm looking for any trace of it because I don't really know what it is but I'm mining it uh and I'm like I don't know what I'm gonna do with this but it's very valuable to me foreign excellent you're gonna you're gonna uh you can turn your Miner off right before and make the merge delayed because you're probably like one of three miners I'll do that I know that's why I can't quit I I'm contributing to the network um my TTD is not updating uh can what what is our current uh total terminal difficulty what are you monitoring uh it's it's just a script that I wrote on the chat says 189. I'm showing 180. mine stuff oh oh my uh okay I'm updated now I was using a watch script and my watch wasn't updating um I want 1892 right now so uh yeah I don't want to talk the whole time uh who wants to show you want to tell us about uh ethereum cat herders how uh what contributions you all have made to help us kind of get the community to where we are today thank you so much super buffets and um yes uh for much especially we have recorded few episodes with the Marius and paridos and brought also about the test Nets of merge recently about the kill if you give go watch that thing uh they keep and eat there you will find a lot of information about how to join what people are looking for and what supports we are looking for it's really nice to hear from developers directly like what are the area where they invite Community participation and it really encourages Community to be a part of something that is going to be for them in the future so that's one thing that we are very happy that we are supporting merge with and other than that we are also having a channel merge channel on ATM cathode is Discord where people come and ask questions recently there was this one question like how can we uh track the block and box for the March I don't know if there is any API available for that or not but there are people who are looking to create provide some infrastructure to support all these test Nets so any information regarding this would be helpful and I would encourage some more developers to show up on ethereum cat headers discard so they can also answer these questions I know yeah each sticker there is also a special channel to discuss all testing of the mud we do recommend people to join over there but in a distributed way we are trying to play our part thank you so much and I I love your community uh if you look at e-stakers versus beef cat herders the cat herders are very much more technical uh and the East takers are very much more like just getting the community uh informed and so we really work well together and we're glad to have them um I have a big question who who can give me an idea like I'm on YouTube and I I don't really know what the difficulty is at where can I monitor uh the status of of the merge and how close we are so you can if you run your own node you can always monitor it using uh if dot get blocked the latest and if you're not a developer we wanted to set up a website to check this kind of stuff but we had too much other stuff to do you can still you uh I think the total difficulty shows up in the block Explorer if you click on the latest Block in the the open source Explorer we have random you can see it there so if you if you go to this link and then you click the latest block um you should see total difficulty one eight nine three four you're gonna hear us talking about numbers that are like one eight one nine uh really what we're looking for is is 200 and so whether we phrase that as uh 1900 or 190 uh really we're just looking for that first step too yeah yeah that that is the total terminal difficulty two followed by a whole gaggle of zeros and when that happens uh there's going to be kind of an interesting event what are we going to see what do we hope to see not red text yeah yeah that's that's when the the proof of stake validators are watching the proof of work chain and they're waiting for some total difficulty threshold called the terminal total difficulty at which point they say okay we're in charge let's take over and they continue the execution layer which is all the the transactions in the state they pretty much take that the execution layer from that terminal total difficulty and they build upon it but in the beacon chain and the proof of stake environment so that's really that's when they take over and um that that's when all the magic happens you should see very quickly a coalition um onto a single fork in the in the beacon chain and then over the next six minutes justification and then 12 minutes uh finalization and if we finalize the transition that's kind of the ultimate signal that we that things have gone well I have a question for the developers if something goes wrong what's it likely to be what are you most worried about going into this event I think what's what's most likely to happen is that the the GPU Miner will keep on mining so that's um that's what happened on when we when we did the the previous uh when we reached the previous TTD uh on Kiln and I wrote some code to shut down the GPU Miner um when the TTD is reached but I'm not sure if it works so it's it's not it's not really important uh because we will not uh once we created a Blog we will like once once the answer this layer saw the first block they will start the merge um but uh it's wasting uh energy and wasting electricity uh so it would be best if we can just stop the GPU minus um yeah I think that's that might break otherwise we did the transitioning so often during the last couple of weeks and months I don't suspect anything to happen maybe once I sent the first transaction with the random op code we might kick off uh some some of the Aragon notes I don't know they they I'm not sure if they can sync the the post message yeah but we'll see we shall see I I'm a little curious about this because I do really think of ethereum as as one large community and part of that Community is made up of people who have been GPU mining for quite some time um and obviously it is a real transition for them to shut those miners down and switch over to proof of stake um if if they continued on the proof of work chain they would they would just experience the um difficulty bomb and eventually grind to a halt is that is that a correct understanding on mainnet yes um you know and miners can do whatever they want so they can attempt to run some sort of Mind chain um I think the value proposition is near nil um and and so I don't think there's much of a future there but I'm sure it's not unlikely that something's attempted yeah and I I don't view it really as uh nefarious I I just I know uh you know there are a lot of people who just they benefit from GPU Mining and they're thinking well what's next for me um and we really welcome you to the proof of stake chain um hopefully you've been stashing away your ether for a couple weeks months or years and you're ready to um be a part of the new future with us so um I I feel like it's really exciting for all of us uh sorry just looking at the chat to see what um what's interesting so let's our total terminal total difficulty is now at uh 1900 190. so we are at 95 of uh I'm like did I do that math in my head uh of the required TTD for the merge and this will accelerate over the next few minutes um as as block difficulty is higher this number increments more quickly so um should be very exciting to see do we turn on all the miners yeah I think Mario is even tweeted and posted a few places to ask people do it now uh yeah so so we're getting blocks every five to six seconds now uh it's not that fast but should we should we should be okay we should reach it in the next a couple of hours stay tuned well and it's a lot of time to kill obviously that's we cannot predict the moment this will happen uh and I you know our Target really is to get it within this hour um but that requires a lot of coordination uh and so where we've previously encouraged people hey please choose not to GPU mine on Kiln because we want to make it a community event now is the community event so if you have a free GPU um then go ahead and throw it at Kiln for a while and uh we we can all view this together so one of the great questions I keep hearing is uh everyone a lot of people are aware that uh this is the pub big public merge test net prior to mainnet merge does anyone and this is this is a complicated and loaded question and I know uh actually I'm going to ask Trent if you don't mind um you're you're so good at this stuff um Trent what does this really mean for mainnet Merch how how does today's event fit into the big picture of mainnet merge well I appreciate your confidence but hopefully it's not misplaced uh this is kind of us checking off boxes but not in a perfunctory way this is making sure we really understand what's What mechanisms are needed so total terminal difficulty clients switching over to proof of stake we want to make sure these things work flawlessly before committing to them uh even on test Nets because if we start to uh do these transitions on existing test Nets that's going to start influencing developers you know if we mess something up uh we want to make sure this transition is as battle tested as it can be and this is kind of the last step before we start moving to test Nets and I think you you went through the list earlier but yeah after this I think that's the next step so this is a pretty uh major transition itself um you know it's it's fractal transitions all the way down but this is you know us moving from uh short-lived ephemeral test Nets to the larger um stable test Nets which we are the developers of ethereum use today um so yeah it's a really um significant uh moment that we're witnessing yeah it's it's difficult for uh a lot of commenters to um put a timeline on this it's it's not it's not great because timelines generally lead to uh frustration but uh from the community side really the question that people ask 24 7 is w-en um and uh I because I only represent Fizz I can say uh This Is On Target we're we're right on target for the June timeline right on target for when it happens thank you sir that's what I should say yeah this that doesn't mean it's going to happen in June yeah it means that that we are on target for June and things will change along the way that I'm not sure that means they're going to be faster or slower but all of the developers all of the all of the work is where it needs to be right now um and things are going great so yeah I think that that right if you had the other day was pretty spot on um again the caveat being things can always change there are unknown unknowns which might pop up but you know this long process of testing people have been working on the merge since last May um with that uh the hackathon that was ran back then like this this has been a work in progress for quite a while um obviously proof of stake has been a much longer research Journey but the merge itself of bringing together the proof of work and proof of stake change this is uh you know it's not been a quick process and we're finally getting closer and uh the more that these important like uh important events like like what we're witnessing now come to fruition the closer we can actually forecast when the the actual mainnet transition will happen um yeah like I said I think your post summarized a lot of um really good indicators so if if people haven't read that I think it's on eth finance or e-staker where is it where can people find that list uh East Staker I think it's it's yeah I believe it's not eat sticker reddit.com go check that out it should be it should be pinned really pin it to the top so everybody can see it but yeah and then the other thing which you can look at is there's a uh there's a merge checklist of you know tasks that the developers have set that they want to or they need to complete you know there's there's the need to complete and then a couple nice to have tasks that's a another really good way to track progress um and then if you're around for uh the London upgrade last year you can go back and look at the Cadence of how test Nets were forked I think it's usually about every two weeks um maybe a little bit faster or slower I'm not sure uh but yeah that that's also another good indicator you can um sort of work backwards you see okay we've got this many tests that need to be forked uh when are the client releases out and then sort of set your own timelines for when when you expect to um the merge date to actually be hit cool yeah that's very exciting uh I'm seeing it Trent you should quickly shill protocol Guild yeah uh sure yeah I'm more than happy to do that um yeah I've been working on this project for a few months now with a lot of the people on this call uh core developers researchers people who contribute to clients uh to build this thing called protocol Guild um it's very simply it's a split contract that vest uh donated or sponsoring assets so you know you could have a layer two or a D5 protocol that decides they want to support core developers and the people that are heads down making things like uh kill and happen um so what we're doing is over the past four months we've built this mechanism which is self-curated so all the developers deciding okay we want to make this thing uh we're going to put our an address into this curated split contract and then anybody including you know regular community members or like I said applications can donate uh tokens they can donate uh ease you know whatever whatever they feel inspired to donate and this is a way to um we look at it as a way for people to give back to you know the everybody who's making this possible uh because I think sometimes it's it's easy to gloss over the excitement of trying out the new D5 protocols there's like you know there's an entire core protocol base layer and the people that are contributing to it that are making really this this entire thing happen so um it's a mechanism to allow that uh people to give back and so like I said we've been working on it since November we've got a really incredible turnout um I think we're over 90 to almost 100 people who have signed up and uh that's honestly incredible to me you don't really realize the full scope of like how many people are actually involved in all this and it it really takes it's not you know the creation of vitalik this is actually vitalik isn't even part of the protocol Guild which is funny uh it's tons of other people contributing to clients doing research you know it takes a village to to do work like this in an ecosystem like ethereum so um we have a git coin Grant uh if you go to git coin and search protocol Guild that'll come up uh if you're interested in donating we're more than happy to um take your donations and it'll go like I said it'll go directly to um the list of client contributors and researchers who have have self-selected to be a part of this and we're looking to launch a one-year pilot pretty soon so appreciate then thanks for giving me time to show that yeah thank you Nolan and so I know there's this hesitation uh by a lot of contributors they're like you know well I have five die I have one die like it's not or one dollar in eth or whatever currency and like it's not enough to really matter um but what I like to think of this as is as signaling you want to Signal your support to protocol Guild and you can signal that support with whatever you have it doesn't have to be a big donation it's just a signal that says hey I like what you're doing please do this um those signals in many ways end up being more valuable than the money behind them so please do find protocol Guild on get coin grants follow Trent and his Saga um it's I I'm I'm always always Blown Away by uh Trent's description of these things I'm like I don't I don't think I get this but maybe I do I don't know you do I do maybe I don't know in your in your heart deep in my heart um hey Micah I want to get you to um you're talking some about the test net order will you will you describe that publicly so everyone on YouTube has has a a big picture and and kind of reduce that confusion oh he doesn't have a mic um yeah so uh I can talk about it yeah I think I I think I said that right maybe if maybe I maybe I misremembered I did drop it in the chat the uh yeah I just this is a this test net you know is a is a public test net um it was spun up specifically for this and you know we'll run for some amount of time this is the the signal that we're looking for to then move to Fork the existing public test Nets like gorley like sepolia um then if that is successful we've already made that so this is not the last test net I know there's some conversation in the in the chat there that is the last session this is the the last like developer-led testnet for this purpose before we Fork the existing public test Nets it's really hard to keep that in scope there are so many different milestones and so many different accomplishments um it's hard to acknowledge the significance of this uh without sort of making it more than it is um it it is a huge deal as the the first public merge test net um and it looks like we've hit 191 out of 200 um we've got a long ways to go we do um so once again I asked for your support sorry I I tried to time shall we talk a bit about um why we did the emergency uh pushing the TTD I think that's that's probably kind of interesting so for those who are not aware uh we had we first had the TTD at uh one trillion I think I'm not sure one with a bunch of zeros and then we we realized that this is way too quick because people started uh started GPU Mining and it was actually I think it was actually five times what we did the previous uh Network right but yeah it's five times what we had last week and I think still something like 100 times what we had for kinsuki yeah so for kitsuki no one actually render when the GPU Miner but for this personal Network they did and so we we actually had to push the TTD a bit and this is not going to happen on on Mainland so the only way that we were we are ever going to do something like this on mainnet is if we already push the releases if everyone has has updated their software and we then realized that something is completely broken and then this is like the last teach effort yeah to postpone the merch well and I would say on mainnet it's less likely that it is postponed it's more like I I feel like if this flag or override is used on mainnet it's because of some sort of um drop off in the mining power and so say we thought the merge was going to happen in two weeks but then the mining power is dropping off and we we're like oh it's gonna happen in eight weeks then we might do you know that's that's where I think we're kind of like the call useful is if we have to override in that direction whereas this one we kind of we delayed whereas the other one we might uh make it sooner I I love Chris hopcroft's question from or statement on on the Twitter chat uh Fizz is going to be able to fill the time if the merge doesn't happen soon so please yes launch your gpus now um Colfax had what I thought was a great question about um what Miners and home stakers and what everyone needs to do to prepare so uh Colfax is uh this is Colfax Selby he uh is running a startup called the gitpo app um and it's it's really relevant to what we're doing here uh this is all open source software and it's difficult to get recognition for open source software developers it's it's very much a thankless job and so gitpo app is a um a program that will reward open source code contributors uh with with really uh hard to obtain poapps that demonstrate their actual contributions to the community and so I'm glad to have you Colfax thanks yeah I'm super excited to be here um yeah so I had a question oh nice shirt yeah I didn't notice that yeah the whole point of get pull up is like we want to allow people to sort of get proper records allow communities to recognize their contributors and allow people to sort of build this on-chain track record of contributing to different projects and stuff um but that is orthogonal to my actual question as a Solace taker yeah I'm curious like one if I'm just like stumbled upon this video or stream and I didn't really know what was well of course as a post taker hopefully you knew the mergers coming but uh what should I be doing to prepare and what can I how can I sort of like test out the merge beforehand like what should I be thinking about right now I don't know who wants to answer that the question is a solar Saker how can you how can you help the effort yeah and how what do I need to do to prepare yeah so that I'm ready for midnight yeah yeah so I mean you run uh if you're solo sticker you run a beacon note in a validator client likely um almost certainly and you potentially run like a proof of work node um the some some stakers do Outsource this functionality um and so at the merge this this is no longer outsourceable uh because you actually want to be able to build blocks you want to have a mempool you want to do the verifications locally um so if you do not currently run a proof of work node you do need to sync a proof of work node and kind of get it configured and ready to go because that proof of work node at the transition will become your execution engine essentially it will become you know what is a proof of work node today minus the proof of work plus the beacon chain driving it as the brain so that that's a that's a potential big change and so you know if you are not running a proof of work node in your setup now I would consider doing that soon syncing a proof of Maintenance proof work node getting it configured making sure the two talk to each other and you're not and not Outsourcing that Duty anymore um beyond that we're going to be forking um Gorly subsuming gorley into pratter and so if you don't have a pradder node and you want to test everything out before uh mainnet I would consider in the next few weeks getting a pratter Gorly combo running in a test net setup so that you can get prepared and make sure that you can get your software running and some test net validators going for that um and and otherwise there's a hashtag testing the merge effort if you want to go above and beyond you can join us in The Ether D Discord and the merge uh testing Channel and get some ideas for how you can do things Beyond just running your own nodes you know maybe running deploying some contracts uh spinning up some transactions or if you want to go deeper uh you know trying to make some other sort of chaos on those Networks one of the small things that might be useful to keep in mind is while we can Outsource the execution part right now in the future we can't right so in case you are low on disk it makes more sense to get your new SSD whatever it is update your system have everything prepared now while you can still Outsource this Duty so that once the merge happens sort of you're ready have some hydrogen so you don't have to worry about your systems anymore so um I I'd like to uh bring up Joseph cook um I I recognize Joseph cook best as um a I guess I I call him a researcher I'm not sure if his I think he's he's a technical writer now for the ethereum foundation um but when I was working diligently to kind of uh promote client diversity I'm still promoting client diversity but we're we're giving it a chance to to settle right now um Joseph stepped up with an extremely well written article about um potential outcomes of failed client diversity um and uh Joseph has a question today I I just thank you so much for your contributions what do you what do you have Joseph I am yeah thank you a very kind introduction um I was wondering if there's anything uh special about the public test Nets that make them more difficult to merge than Kiln or kinsuki um I also thought that some of the public assets are proof of authority rather than proof of work change and whether that actually makes any difference to how they would merge so go ahead I was gonna say uh Clique the proof of authority algorithm used on some of our test Nets uh it kind of hacks the total difficulty um Fork Choice rule that's used as improve of work so essentially uh there are update rules you know when there's a new block it essentially in Marius would know maybe it updates by two and an uncle if it's not the correct sign or it updates by one so you actually get to use some a lot of the similar logic you know you can you can pick the terminals hold difficulty being ten thousand and that's like five thousand blocks or something and so they're actually kind of easier to predict and easier to Fork than uh these these crazy Rogue proof of work testnets um and so that's that that that's kind of a happy accident it allows us to to have some more sane testing when we're using the proof Authority Networks foreign that's really interesting thank you yeah and those public tests aren't necessarily harder to Fork it's just a matter of we want to really be near we want to have specs Frozen we want to have software being featured complete before we Fork the the existing test Nets you know whereas um you know these prior kingsugi amphora you know the specs weren't quite Frozen uh some of the some of the features especially on the ux side might have been rough on the edges so this is kind of in preparation before that and also for these tests uh we have to think about who actually wants the validators um so right now everyone can can mine on Rigby and uh sorry Robson and uh afterwards we have to have some kind of governance of uh who who will run the validators because we don't want anyone to just like start a bunch of validators and then drop off and then the network is not finalizing for longer periods of time so Hotel hey um Joseph I I want to go back to you for a minute one of the the big things that that we have really put a lot of attention to in the past few months has been client diversity um and uh even though we are taking a little bit of a lull right now and waiting for some data to come in to see what our progress is um can you tell us where we're at with client diversity why it's so important and and how it really applies to what we're doing today um yeah sure I can certainly try um I think where we are at the moment with the quite diverse side of things is a massive over-reliance on prism on the consensus layer um but the work that you've done and where the where the East stake has done is already starting to address that um certainly um some of the liquid staking pools like rocketball has a much more even client diversity I think individual stakers are starting to use different clients rather than prism as well um certainly I think things like the Kiln uh walkthrough guides for spinning out validators with different clients have been really really useful for that because you know we can actually try just spinning up say get Lighthouse or gecko or something like that and see how it works giving you a little bit more confidence for doing it with real ether um and I think the reason why it's so important is that if there was say a bug in one of the consensus clients or uh maybe a vulnerability in one of the consensus clients that could be exploited by someone um having multiple clients with a relatively even distribution means that that attack or that bug would only affect just the portion of the network with that for that for that vulnerable client and the rest of the network is still secure and and running perfectly well um there's unlikely to be a threat to the beacon chain finalizing whereas if you've got one client that's that's completely dominant especially if it has two-thirds super majority of the total State Defense and that has a consensus related bug or a vulnerability in it then it could be that someone could cause uh you know hope finality uh reverse finality do some really kind of troubling things on on ethereum mainnet so basically it's just a a really good strength of ethereum that we have multiple clients available and we're not making best use of it if everyone's using one option and I can attest to the fact that all of these clients are actually very good you know um there's there's a lot of stickiness in in user choices and I think that's that's primarily one of the things going on here a prism has been an excellent client up the gate prisoners engaged deeply with users um and really focused on on ux but at this point in time all of these clients are are fantastic and they all have their own strengths too you know some are more performed than others some have different ux features and different things like that a test that released a paper uh just a couple days ago talk uh comparing the clients and they didn't name them by name and there were differences in different categories but in final analysis uh they were all relatively equally performant um which is good to see you know you can still kind of pick one and say well this one does this task better this one proposes better blocks or this one hits more stations but if you look at the very the very end of that um where a test that suggests obviously use vouch that is the uh the multi-validator proposer multi implementation proposer the other clients all have relatively similar similar performance uh so um yeah when we're talking about like better attestation performance we're often talking about like 99.9 versus 99.85 you know it's it's like extreme on the margins picture we we 've everyone here kind of understands the need for uh consensus layer diversity we know about this super majority issue and and we are chipping away at that we we're really looking forward to seeing some progress soon um but I also want to acknowledge just for a minute the execution layer diversity something that we have not that I have not put as much attention into that is equally important um Tim Bako is here he is uh kind of the uh the execution layer herder I wonder if you might talk to us a little bit about diversity on the execution layer right yeah um can you guys hear me yes okay awesome um yeah so I I think on the yeah on the execution layer um today we're in this this uh world where I think all blocks are actually produced by the same clients right I all minors I believe use Geth there used to be some running parody um and and uh I I'm pretty sure they've dropped out or there are a tiny minority of the hash rates um and and what that means is um we you know we can't produce conflicting blocks you know kind of by definition based on that on the bug and guess uh and you know depending if there was a bug and guess uh as part of block prediction um and it was it didn't have like a major impact on the network like something like I don't know printing a trillion ether um you know you can you can argue that like oh well maybe we should just make the bug part of the spec and that's actually what causes the least damage to the network right um if there was a bug which did something like created a trillion ether that would be a much harder conversation to have um but yeah at a high level um because we only have a single client producing blocks um it it makes it a bit simpler even though it's not great um that said once movement sorry your bug is it back I I have to contradict that sure sure yeah sure sure but I mean there are cases the yellow paper has like canonized some bugs right um so I'm not saying this is like the right way or my preferred way but it's like historically it has happened Bitcoin uh has has done things like that as well so like it you know it sucks but I think like the only like consistent thing you can do in these cases is like what's what minimizes the harm on the network and um the only like framework I think you can have is like what minimizes the harm on the network and like I think in the case where there's a single client producing blocks you can argue that like making the bug canonical is actually the least Source it depends on the bug exactly absolutely and I think this is I think this is where people kind of sometimes they put all bugs together but like an example is something that prints you know even one extra ether it would become much much more contentious than if it's just you know some hash calculation or whatever that doesn't affect the outcome of any any transaction um anyways that said that stops being true once we move the proof of stage because we literally already have different clients producing blocks um and I think in that case it becomes much more important to have El kind diversity because again on the L side as well we have a ton of great clients you know there's death obviously everybody knows it never mind Basu Aragon um have all done like incredible work in the past couple of years and are all basically ready for the merge um and if you assume that like the odds of a bad bug are kind of evenly distributed across clients um you you want to make sure that you know you are there is diversity on the network because if there is a bug um it's it's just incredibly unlikely that we end up making it part of the canonical chain because there are other type there are other consensus layer clients that will validate things directly there are other uh execution layer clients and so I I don't it feels like almost like I'm on on ethereum today in the proof of work world people can just kind of assume that if they run Geth and there's an issue uh you know there's a higher chance that like they'll get bailed out in a way and I think that stops being true after it emerge just because we have way more clients on both sides um and and and yeah I I think there's a lot of bugs for which even today we probably wouldn't think about part of this deck um and I think there's also something where like today the people creating blocks on the network like minors are very distinct part of the ethereum community than like stakers are um and and I think that that kind of kind of impacts governance also in in subtle ways yeah so yeah there's also you know there's on the order of like dozens of miners like of nodes you know exactly yeah and now there's only order of thousands of of staking consensus forming nodes and so I think there's actually like a really big opportunity here um for stakers to be making more independent decisions you know running and testing different software other than Geth uh to try to also get some of the robustness that we have from the multi-client consensus layer and the multi-client execution layer um obviously you know run the software do the analysis and pick the client that works for you um but I do think that there's a really nice client diversity um inflection point that we could see on the execution layer here yeah absolutely I think the key to all of this none of this diversity is going to happen by accident it's not something that chain can do for itself um client diversity is something that users that providers have to consciously choose they have to push against that desire that says do what everyone else is doing and it it's that that need to do something just a little bit different than everyone else to choose a minority client uh to kind of go against what seems natural and do something a little unusual we have this right I'll push back to say like it doesn't feel unnatural to run nethermind or basically right like it's like instead of you know and it's like base you dash dash kill it's not yeah yeah it's not that weird guys you know not not that it's weird or unnatural but people have these incarnations uh so right and I'll I'll bring up myself I've been using Gat since 2015 and it is uh it is hard hardwired in my brain and I'm absolutely forcing myself like I've got to try basically it's not the only thing you know Geth is run by almost 100 of consensus for me knows in the proof of work network but um infrastructure providers have increasingly been running betsu and now they're mine another environments so it's not like these are not production clients that are used in different contexts it's just they're not using that consensus forming context today but you do have a great fight about 2015 like I think it is worth noting like you know Geth has been around the longest by far and other execution clients um started much later like I think we had like and we had this like wave of them show up in like 2018 or so um and and like yeah I do think it took a couple years to catch up I worked on base view for like two and a half years and like yeah it's just like it takes a lot of time I think getting your clients to think on mainnet at least on the execution their side was like the easy part and it was hard but then the hard part is like getting all this other stuff like Fast sync and pruning and like full tracing support and I think you know I I saw us do it on on base two but uh Nestor Ryan and Aragon have been like doing all the same thing and I think now we're like basically four years later and not only do all these clients like work on mainnet but they do have like this kind of I don't know uh polishing or like extra features that like people expect when they're when they're running a client yeah yeah that's that's the thing that I really want to highlight the Polish is now there what used to be kind of a rougher experience is now in fact between execution and consensus layer clients uh the experience is equally smooth or similar between all of those it's really just a a a choice to support the chain that that determines what you run um I noticed so I want to bring a couple programming notes up our TTD is increasing um quick faster and faster it looks like probably in the next nine hours we should uh hit TTD that was a joke uh it's really the next eight hours um but so we're at 1947 now um it is accelerating I do I would encourage anyone who can add fuel onto that there's no harm now in GPU mining the Kiln chain um the other thing I wanted to mention is we had a discussion a little while ago about the merge and what home miners needed to do um and Trent brought up an interesting question um if if there's no alternative for inferior by the time the merge happens what should um what should home validators do if if for whatever reason they cannot run uh an eth1 client locally why can't they run an Ethan client so yeah no and that's that's fair a lot of it um we have some homesteakers who are minimally specked uh and that that being like they uh for right for whatever reason have have said I don't have a terabyte of drive space uh or um maybe they they used a microwave from 1976 to steak with so so I I will say you can run this on a Raspberry Pi uh space on that that um SSD that's connected to it is going to be you know the bottleneck and whether you can run the execution layer in in tandem with it uh we do we are seeing Raspberry Pi's run on these merged test Nets um and expect them to be able to work on mainnet that said you know 32 Heath is maybe worth a a nuke or something like that um but if you the thing is you just cannot do the execution layer validation which is part of the full validation um and thus your software will probably not function properly um you will not be slashed for not being able to do the execution layer validation today but that is a roadmap item because Outsourcing that is quite frankly uh dangerous tragedy of the commons and some issues emerge there with security of the network um so what I have to say is uh you got to figure out how to run the execution layer I'll push that even further uh by saying that you actually get paid for this as a validator so uh I don't know if you all covered this before I I jumped on the call but uh validators after the merge received transaction fees which are not burnt um directly on any ethereum address that they want so it's not like sent to the beacon chain it's sent to whatever you know each one address you specify um so you literally get paid for it right if you get to produce a block uh you get all the transaction fees uh if you don't have any fun clients or an executioner client that's running uh beside your validator you're not able to have a transaction course which sorts by fee and gets you all those juicy fee that mvv providers have uh put for you um yeah so I would I would yeah encourage people to do it I think it's kind of part of the duty of validating but you also get compensated uh for it and I think the trend action fees are probably larger than you actually get for Block production on preferred stake in the vast majority of blocks yeah and you do produce a block on the order of every like 30 to 40 days right now so this isn't like some occurrence that that almost never happens right I I did the math yesterday it's 44 days coincidentally I just looked it up how many validators we have right now um three hundred twelve thousand eight hundred or something I think you have like a neuralink implant that beams this stuff up to your head yeah and I think we estimate about 37 percent of those are home validators which um to people who don't know that that might not seem like a lot but that for this kind of network is is really incredible like having that strong of of uh you know people who say yes I'll buy Hardware yes I'll I'll download the software yes I'll run it and maintain it um obviously we'd like more than 37 but that is that's a fairly decent chunk of the network something I'm very proud of can I jump in real quick uh just in the chat there were some people asking for a visualization so I guess maybe we were already planning to do this but when we get like I don't know 198 199. we'll probably switch to that I I'm estimating about six uh it has been six minutes per uh so from 194 to 195 was was six minutes if we have five more that's 30 minutes but it's accelerating so we should expect to hit this in less than 30 minutes um I know that I joked about eight or nine hours and I that's probably not fair to people who don't have the big picture uh but we're I'm guessing less than 30 minutes we'll hit this especially uh if people continue to pour some heat on it there was there was a question from the chat that I thought was pretty interesting to answer um from 10 15 minutes ago but it was why not use a block height here uh where is yeah that's what I was going to bring up yeah we do that on all the other Forks so normally when the proof work chain upgrades um a block height is chosen and the new rules call it adding 1559 transactions or the fee Market or or adding a new OP code that happens at that block height uh similarly in proof of stake world we have these things called slots um and epochs and we would use you know a slot or an Epoch which is essentially at a given time uh such rules would change and the fork would happen this you have the canonical chain where the rules change we also have all the other chains really a blockchain the whole thing is a black tree and so at any height on any of those trees the rules change so you know if I have these branching side chains that once I hit block 10 million 1559 enables when I have the canonical chain when 1559 hits on the the 10 millionth block it enables so it happens simultaneously on any branch and that's good that's good because you know when you want forking you you want the rules to change on any of these branches but in in this this change we don't want the transition to happen on every Branch I want the transition to happen precisely on one chain uh precisely on you know the canonical chain and for the transition to not occur on the other things for those to become dead ends and so you can't really use safely the block height anymore because I could um I could cheaply Shadow mine you know a much longer chain with a much lower difficulty and expose that to the network you know and that at block 10 million be it block 10 million and then the if we were basing this on height then the the beacon chain would because the beacon chain does this once would pick that Minority chain that was long enough and do the fork whereas instead we want the heaviest the most worthwhile we want the tip we want the actual canonical chain and that's why we use this terminal total difficulty because you can't really synthesize that in like a private environment does that make sense oh the person who asked it I don't know where that came from but it sounded like it did I I'm focused on this TTD um it's accelerating quickly uh so there's there's a a real chance that we could get caught uh as as ready as we are for it that it could catch us by surprise um yeah let's switch to a screen foreign no that's me I'm sorry uh let me figure out how do you zoom I thought that I had to use a coast early on there we go sorry there we go um perfect can you guys see my screen now yes affirmative yes awesome so I'm just gonna start with um with this dashboard it's an El tocl comparison so every client combination I'm running they just averaged out and in compare like there's a total of 100 nodes and all the techu basal nodes all of their RAM usage for example have been taken and averaged out so you can actually try and get some idea of how it is to run a client um so as you can see in the four core 8 gig machine with actually looking quite good no one's using more than like 30 percent and you can also see most of them are using a similar amount of CPU with them and on such a network we see like half a megabits download it's actually not so bad [Music] um I did run some last minute updates so that's why a lot of them are getting peers again um so forgive me for that but we're looking at something like 98.7 participation really healthy amount um there's no weird network issues there's no realgs happening um this looks okay yeah we're having some issues with our monitoring stacks of random UC values going to zero and back up but in general everything looks healthy and good uh the beacon chain however um the Explorer that we're running seems to be a bit resource constraint so it's a bit slower than expected so so I think it's best if we rely on logs for the day uh to figure out that the might has happened or not um on the left side I've got all the get instances on the right I have another mind and there's another page with peso instances so from top to bottom you can see prism um teku Lighthouse nimbus lodestar so we should have 10 plus another five different combinations so there's a total of like 15 combinations I haven't been able to get Eragon running myself um due to a lack of time not due to airgun but I know that community members have been able to get air gone up and running so we do have more than 15 client combinations up and running um this one's going to be really spammy so we're just gonna focus on one specific node and you can see the TTD over here so we're like 98.5 percent um does anyone have something specific they want to see and I can pull that up what happens when the transition happens what do we see in the logs so we're gonna see a green so that's also why I chose tiku they have colors in their logs which is super nice you'll see a green log line with terminal block um terminal pow hash found or something like that uh so the sort of like this so it's going to be green like this um and another thing we can see is if we switch to get get is going to start getting focus updated messages that essentially means the CL is now in control and pow has stopped so get is gonna rely on the cl to tell it where to sync to what to do and so on so those are the two things we're going to look out for and the third thing we're going to look out for is back to this dashboard and looking at the participation rate just to make sure that no one's dropping off but this updates about a couple slots later so there's going to be some built-in delay here and we know that the merge was successful once this number finalizes a post post the transition block and then we know that everything's been everything everything's good I I think we're really close to the merge and uh I'm gonna kind of feel like anyone who has made it with us to this point um is someone who has probably earned the poapp for the merge call um I I know some some people came just for this I like to say that a poet makes you more of who you are like you wanted to watch the merge but you really just came for the poet that's good enough for me um so to do you want to do it Nolan do you want me to do it no I can do it uh the secret word is kill it it's a fun pun so capital k i l n i t all one word killnit because we are killing it and to claim this you'll actually need to use the poapp app on your phone it is a uh a security measure to prevent rampant farming so you'll have to have the poapp app installed on your phone there's a option for um for secret word down there and you'll just enter uh like Nolan said Capital k-i-l-n-i-t um and so uh we do have a limited number of codes and so you'll want to claim that quickly the claim will end oh dear Sam left but remember that that claim was only a good four minutes ago one hour uh if anyone from poapp is on the call uh just stand by we'll get it worked out we still have a few minutes uh so don't go anywhere uh we'll get it yesterday we'll fix it Sam just message me it's it's uh updated for another hour thank you Sam so yeah um capital k-i-l-n-i-t in the um in this in the co-app app so 77 now okay sorry 1977. oh 98.8 so I like that view better I like how we're just speed running the the 20th century yeah that's a great way to look at it like you know I'm really focused on the last probably since 2017 since uh I recall Danny posted in eth Trader some what's the each Trader were you there that was maybe it was our ethereum he was like Hey guys there's a change in plans um we're not going to do the 1500 if deposit contract anymore don't know where we're headed now but uh stand by that that the time since then is my most prescient memory but this has been you know you go back to 2008 with uh satoshi's white paper um back to The Cypher Punk movement this is a quite a pinnacle I specifically was referencing the the difficulty of 1977. people keep calling it out or nights but that's also a good I was I was trying to go deeper yeah no that's way too weak that's that's more interesting at 1980 now have you guys been reading the cryptopians I have not done my bookshelf no is it good and it's a beautiful telling of the story from the inside out I'm in it I'm hooked it is amazing awesome I have like this three ethereum books on my on my nightstand and like I haven't opened any of them like the infinite machine cryptopians and then there's the other one um I forget what the other one was from the guy who was at Bloomberg Matt all right it's great to hear you say that though because my attention span is totally shot like I I have difficulty reading paper now if unless Anthony sassel is reading it to me like I'm just it's it's probably not gonna happen maybe he'll read it to us you call them Anthony sassel Anthony sassano sorry username and his last name whatever you know who I'm talking about that one guy um so we're at 1982. if we are we're like gonna speed run past everybody's birthday here it's history coming to fruition oh Ben Ben Edgington could read that yeah his voice it would be perfect I listened to better read the yellow paper yep I play that stuff times while we're driving and my family is like please please don't make us listen to that stuff anymore no like but it's interesting 1984. I guess we'll seem fine that's who's the youngest person on this call so what will we be watching what will we be looking for like I I've I know in the uh in the picture the famous picture that I posted on Twitter recently uh that Trent actually shared from Ben sorry um of all of you standing around looking at the um the screen what words will we see here do we know do we have a techu developer or I guess guessing either side what's the log can we just look for red text and know that if we don't see error red text that everything went perfectly isn't that fair yep on on gets you're gonna see enter entering POS mode now um and on teku you should see terminal block hash found I just realized I'm not even uh staring at my own terminal laughs it must be working well because we're seeing like 98 participation the average block time is 4.2 seconds now it's minors reverse difficulty bomb so we're imminent um just a few minutes away from uh the merge and uh just a reminder if you haven't claimed the poet you can open up the poapp app and use the secret word capital k-i-l-n -it killing it is the uh the pun there uh after this call you won't be able to claim the poet um it's just a neat way to remember having been here uh so it's like a calm before the storm sort of thing I'm just enjoying the closeness like there's a lot of anxiety before you get there but now it's like let's just sit back and enjoy it like let it become real 1990. 91. hey it's my birthday watch wasn't fast enough for me so I have to do up and enter again I guess a watch has you can do micro seconds on watch all right 1992. this is actually great timing we've said everything that can be said and now it's just like let it happen uh Perry do you have a note on the on the proof of work chain uh yes let me just get one up no no I mean uh one that's that keeps on mining post much we're continuing to accelerate we're at 1994 now So within the next two or three minutes uh we will see the merge of the Kiln test net and then we'll need to wait Danny likes to wait for finalization and I'm like come on I mean we'll know within a couple of blocks if things are looking good but now Daddy just runs an exchange on the slide so he gets very stressed out about this stuff 95 96. yeah it's gonna be here oh I lost my uh this is my YouTube chat hey uh YouTube are you still getting secret word not found um yeah it is capital k i l n i t um like uh Chris degilio said um like worst skyder um Trent capital k-i-l-n-i-t no you cannot claim this is on Capital case like I'm gonna hush because it's about to happen 1998. yeah it needs to be claimed through the app not the website I think 1999. we're here and merge awesome it's there terminal block detected let's go all right so for everyone watching uh I have to do oh yeah and you can see it over here yeah and then there's a block in the next slot so so far everything uh looks great we did execute the merge at the terminal total difficulty and we have blocks after the merge execution can we know that the blocks are full yeah are there transactions merch yeah ah um yeah let me just cut it off uh does anyone remember off the top of the head beacon block finalized something like that Beacon finalize block it's definitely not going to be finalized yet yeah that's true it would just be had beacon block probably um and it wouldn't be slime but we want to we want to probably look at the just go look at the Block Explorer for the execution oh oh yeah we can just look it down that's easier yeah it's at 100 transactions right yeah contract Creations real nice currency transactions as well nice awesome and the logs look good and we can look we can see on the the um execution engine on the bottom um some of these engine API endpoints so engine new payload engine engine Fork Choice updated those are the communications going on between the consensus layer the beacon node and the execution engine the execution layer and so that's also a signal here that we're no longer getting proof work blocks but instead we're getting these proof of stake blocks and feeding the execution layer components to the execution layer that's definitely stuff on there you got some JQ yeah let me just get that okay so I want to congratulate real quick everyone who made this possible all the developers implementers researchers um this is a huge effort and especially uh Perry and Marius who uh kind of helped us time this so well that we could actually be together to watch it so many times these things just happen in the middle of the night and no one knows um but this is great I I love that we all got to see it together so Perry's looking at a recent the head block on the beacon chain looking at the execution payload which is really those execution layer contents those user contents and we can see loads of transactions uh and fun stuff in there there's definitely no lack of transactions yeah what's the base fee yeah sending lots and lots of transactions by the way my code did fail so the the um the minor uh was still working oh no it shut down shut down now okay your your custom code right not yeah no no it's no it's it's a code that will end up in some form and guess so that after the merge after 180 seconds the the GPU minus will shut down right hopefully so that we don't waste any more energy right yeah what's our participation rate looking like that looks good correctly we're still looking at 98.5 but if there's an issue it should update in like a minute or two like this right what Epoch did we enter the merge in I think it was 893 okay um but let's just confirmed that it wasn't that far up ahead Marius is that going to be a flag that people can disable or is uh what does that actually look like I think the way you disabled is you don't update your software to the the merge software because then it's just gonna run forever Marius you're muted or something oh yeah sorry so if you if you have to if you have a if you don't have the terminal total difficulty or if you set some different terminal total difficulty then of course your node doesn't know when to stop and so you will keep on mining um and but it in this way if you reach terminal total difficulty um and get a block from the from the consensus layer then you should shut down your gpus I I love that feature it is it it kind of uh reinforces our desire to minimize energy loss and just sort of like be the people who we say we are like let's shut down the miners when we're done let's not uh leave someone running in obscurity yeah you gotta clean up after yourself have we Justified this transition yeah so the terminal block was one slot before oh yeah participation on this epochs too supporting like a four percent drop in participation I know three percent meaning its validators dropped or it's seeing a drop I think it's seeing a drop lots of empty blocks have been we're getting a message saying the stream has stopped on YouTube oh um YouTube let us know if it comes back transactions yes I can I can stop I mean it's probably good to continue if it's oh no there's no okay sorry yeah there are blocks with zero gas views on the execution side as well yeah but that's only because maybe fast enough okay got it got it there we go hmm I particularly sure why they're diverging might be a fork oh come on let's look at this uh it could be a fork the you would still be able to get your like Source Target correct at least at the beginning of a potential Fork removing unknown parent block route yeah just checking if my comments complaining about something we did have an issue where we had to restart the network if there was some problem but it seems to be okay okay quiet means people looking into things foreign Justified 911 so that's the one with the terminal block whatever are we in we are in so it could be that a percentage of block proposals are just not being created um but in 912 so as expected we've Justified of 9 11. so that means two-thirds are in this merge chain which is good yeah um can you pull the head again and see if there's what the contents look like in the beacon chain yeah foreign there's still transactions yeah uh so my current estimation is Jesus sorry yeah um the uh I I would assume if we're seeing some Miss slots that somebody is not um able to produce blocks but it looks like the majority is still producing attestations um I don't know what our our skip slot it looks like though could this just be somebody just running a client and not running their El or their plan yeah but that's way too many blocks for that I think how many blocks what's our Miss rate it's an easy way to check that so I on my local node I see like 50 percent of of blocks missing but it might just be some sometimes they arrive later and they don't show up in the lock correctly and I also get I I get this but I could I get this did not advance head State reason um had missing from snapshot cache um on lighthouse okay yeah I mean we're looking at those logs it looked like we're getting a block uh we got like four out of the five last blocks slots Danny it looks like the stream is still lagging I don't know if you just want to kill it I mean I'm happy to kill it uh stream let's end it with a summary first yeah yeah well I mean it's not going to make it to these people okay to the people of the internet if you can hear us uh transition happened we're still finalizing I mean we have finalized the transition it looks like uh some amount of block proposals are offline uh we got to diagnose the problem um and you can't hear us so it doesn't matter [Laughter] and post the recording though I think I did the text yeah so uh oh that's yeah yeah I guess we could replace dream lag finalized transition some block proposals are offline the merge is a success yeah it's probably uh some sort of client configuration is is having trouble producing blocks did we finalize at least we must have finalized at least yeah got it thanks which means more than two-thirds of validators are online and agreeing about something foreign oh wait I just refreshed maybe the stream is doing better now unclear oh I have a limit dream looks alright on my end okay um and so yeah we're gonna keep uh debugging okay people of the internet I'm closing the stream yeah yeah um I just finished the comments [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music]
