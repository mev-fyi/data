[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] good morning everybody my name is Joseph I'll be your MC this morning uh how are you enjoying Defcon so far I guess I guess this is the this is the group of people that didn't party or did party hard and just didn't go to sleep and just continued uh with the drill so um I appreciate you for being here in the morning I know it's tough uh um but um without further Ado because we are getting to our time uh we are going to start with some habit topics uh right in the morning uh Matt's Dibble the research and product lead at Otis is going to present his talk about uh an overview of automated Market making mechanisms so please put your hands together for Matt [Applause] all right hey everyone um so odos is a DEX aggregator um and so while building it I've had the unique opportunity to really um do a deep dive into the different automated Market maker mechanisms that control billions in D5 tvl every day so the aim of this talk is going to be to try to cover as many of these as possible uh primarily the ones that currently control a large amount of tvl so it's not going to be completely exhaustive but hopefully it's close as close as possible in 25 minutes um and then we're going to tie that back into Dex aggregation why it's needed and what it's for so to start off I want to briefly cover um some of the basic principles that we can think about well we're going over these many different mechanisms so first I think it's useful to clearly Define what we're actually trying to do with these Market making mechanisms so we can start off by clearly defining what a market maker is so a market maker has a portfolio of assets and they're trying to earn yield on that portfolio um and they do that by allowing people to trade through it and so essentially what happens is uh they offer to sell an asset at a slightly higher value then they will buy it back and that creates this spread um that serves as Revenue that they earn on um the volume that goes through their platform now the catch is that this revenue is not risk-free right uh people are when trading is happening we're actually changing the composition of the portfolio um and this also leads to a change in value in the portfolio and so what can happen is if the change in value in the portfolio as a result of the trading uh outweighs the revenue then you're now losing money and you're not actually earning any yield and so uh we really need to do a good job designing the uh the strategy and how we're actually pricing and allowing people to trade so with that objective in mind we can now think about what tools we can use to actually um decide on the pricing right so there's many different types and strategies of course but we can sort of simplify it down to two basic paradigms so the first of which is uh price Discovery so this is essentially reacting to um what's happening in the market so if we think of a simple example if at the current price lots of people are buying that means the price is probably a bit too low and you should raise it up and so by reacting to how people are interacting with the prices you set you can sort of follow around the market price and discover what the market thinks the price is um which is a very powerful mechanism but of course if you're following around what the actual market price is um you're not actually really providing the best price at any given time because you're always trailing behind and so ideally what we'd like to do is just be providing the price that people actually want to buy and sell at right we want the real market price and so we can try to approximate that by leveraging Price oracles so trying to leverage some external knowledge um to decide on the price without actually having to discover it ourselves and so this can be extremely powerful because you can really then concentrate your liquidity and uh general pricing strategy around what people actually value an asset at but it can also be very detrimental because if you're setting if your price Oracle is wrong well then you have the same problem with price Discovery except quite a bit worse potentially right so real quick to give some concrete examples uh one thing we can Leverage is the pegged value of the asset so if you have two stable coins usdc and usdt they're both worth a dollar and they should be exchanged one to one right and we can leverage that knowledge as sort of an Oracle and use that to inform our pricing and Market making decisions some other examples are chain link oracles and uh the pricing of other dexes as well so last thing before we get into the actual amms um I do want to concretely cover um what where how I'm actually going to be showing these amms right I'm going to avoid the math it's very interesting but it's not uh it's not fit for a 25 minute talk on nine different uh amms so instead I'm going to show this trading function which is hopefully a bit more intuitive and basically what this trading function shows is it shows uh the space of possible trades that this uh Market maker will actually allow right so on the x-axis we have um on the x-axis we have the input amount and on the y-axis we have the um output amount and this curve is the space of uh trades that you can make so this point for instance is one trade you can make if you have 100 of the input asset this Market maker will give you out 200 of the output asset and at any given point the slope uh sort of shows you the marginal price that you're getting if you keep on putting input into this Market maker so with all of that in mind we can we can Now cover our very first amm and this one is the constant product Market maker uh so this one's huge it's very important it's been uh it's probably well it is the most popular one uh it was introduced by bancor originally then uniswot V1 and uniswot V2 both used it and popularized it a lot um it's also important for the context of this talk because it essentially embodies uh full-on price Discovery right unit swap V2 has no notion of uh what a value or what an asset should be valued at it simply discovers that price and how it does that is it sets the price as the ratio of how much of each asset it owns and that allows um the price to essentially respond to uh demand so you can see in the trading curve as you put more and more in the slope of the curve continues to decrease and that's showing the price responding to uh the trading so it's discovering the price now on the other hand as we said if you can leverage an oracle that can lead to much better pricing and so a constant sum Market maker is uh sort of the full-on embodiment of this right so a constant sum Market maker will provide a fixed rate of exchange at whatever the Oracle is so you can see on the trading function on the right there is now a completely constant slope so a constant price all the way up until the market maker runs out of assets um at which point uh you can't trade anymore right because uh the market maker no longer owns any of this output asset and this turns out to be a very precarious position for the market maker to be in um for one they're not earning revenue from Trading anymore because they're a liquid and for two they now don't have a portfolio right they own all of one asset and there's a lot higher risk of portfolio value change there which generally they want to avoid um so there are some examples of this uh technically any wrapper contract is a constant some Market maker like Ave um maker has a peg stability module uh that allows one-to-one exchange of uh other stable coins for die which sort of keeps the stability of that Peg and synthetics has um a fixed rate of exchange using uh other external oracles for their synthetic assets which is also quite powerful um so those serve as uh both models that are used in practice but for the purposes of this talk they sort of serve more as boundaries right they both have some big weaknesses the constant sum is um if your Oracle is even slightly off you're gonna just lose all of one asset and you're not actually going to be Market making anymore while the constant product while extremely powerful is not very efficient with its money because it knows nothing about what the asset should be worth and so essentially what the rest of this talk is going to cover is different types of mechanisms they can cover that middle ground and these are these can be known as hybrid amms the first of which will be stable swap uh so stable swap was introduced by curve and essentially what stable swap is trying to do is it is moving from a constant sum uh Market maker so from a really a fixed rate of exchange to a constant product as the reserves get more and more out of balance because as the reserves get more and more out of balance you can imagine that your price is probably a bit off right and so you want to start adjusting that price while still taking advantage of that one-to-one exchange rate and so this equation also has this amplification parameter and that's what you're seeing in the animation on the right and you're seeing that as that amplification parameter increases uh the stable swap curve in purple moves from the constant product in blue to the constant sum very quickly closely approximating the constant sum because again we want to leverage this one-to-one exchange rate as much as possible um so other than stable swap there are some other stable Solutions stable swaps generally the industry standard um more recently though there's been solidly introduced an alternative equation for stable swap which is generally a bit more uh slightly simpler simpler to use as well because it doesn't have that amplification parameter um for the purposes of this talk we can compare it to stable Swap and that's what you're seeing on the in the trading functions on the right you're seeing solidly stable in purple compared to stable swap with an amplification of two and they're still different but they're about the same at that parameterization um now an amplification of two is actually quite low typically it's much higher than this so solidly stable essentially represents a uh a low risk sort of stable swap that's still a big improvement over the constant product when there is that one-to-one exchange rate to Leverage next up we have dodo's proactive Market maker so um dodo has a mechanism again leveraging some external Oracle this can be chain link this can be this one-to-one exchange rate um and they introduced this parameter K that allows you to continuously adjust from the constant sum to the constant product as K is increased and it does this in a bit of a smoother way than stable swap with which makes uh more Dynamic oracles possible to use in general uh you can sort of think of K as representing your confidence in the oracle right so if you have if you're extremely confident that the Oracle is correct you can set K to zero and you get a constant sum you just get that fixed exchange rate whereas uh if your Oracle is less reliable let's say it's a chain link Oracle that can't update super often you may set K somewhere in between these two and the Curve will leverage that Oracle to inform its pricing but it will also discover the price if that Oracle turns out to be incorrect or there's large trade volume uh Clipper is another one that actually has a k parameter that serves a very similar purpose the math behind it is is very different and very interesting but um the end result is again you get this curve and this parameter K that allows you to adjust the curve between the constant sum and the constant product Market maker now the interpretation of K as confidence in the Oracle sort of has some extra meaning here in that Clipper originally deployed their amm fully on chain leveraging and on chain link Oracle um now as I mentioned the limitation with a chain link Oracle is that it can't possibly update faster than the block time and so you can't have full confidence in the Oracle uh when its update time is limited so more recently what they've done is they've actually built a another version that can leverage a fully option Oracle and we're gonna come back to how that's possible later in the talk um but for now the the context of that is that this allowed them to set K much lower and so this is sort of a concrete example of K being the confidence you have in this Oracle price so last uh hybrid amm we're going to cover today is crypto swap um we covered stable swap as the first one and stable swaps fantastic for stable assets uh unfortunately it's not very good for more volatile pegs um because it's so closely matches that constant sum curve so what curve did is they took that stable swap curve and they essentially added another degree of freedom to it called the gamma parameter and this parameter allows the curve to more quickly adjust from the constant sum to the constant product as the reserves get more and more out of balance and so on the right in the trading curves what you're seeing is the stable swap curve for reference in green next to the crypto swap curve in purple and you can see for very small inputs the crypto swap curve is actually closer to the constant sum uh whereas for very large inputs it's much quicker to adjust away from the constant sum towards the constant product as it switches over to price discovery right so this allows it to be used for more volatile oracles non-one-to-one pegs which makes it um very powerful and allows curve to essentially expand to uh other options now there are quite a few other interesting things about crypto swap that sort of break the mold that we unfortunately don't have time to get into so I encourage anyone who's interested to look more into that um for now we're going to move into another sort of type of amm these amms still live in between the constant sum and constant product but uh the thinking and Concepts behind them are a bit different and so I think it's worth approaching them from another Direction and that is through virtual reserves so kyber DMM is one example of a mechanism that utilizes virtual reserves and what virtual reserves are are essentially just pretending to have more of the assets than you actually have right so we're still using the constant product equation but we are saying we have five times more of each asset than we actually have and so you plug these virtual reserves into the constant product equation and you get what we see on the right where we have that constant product curve that moves closer and closer to the constant sum as this amplification increases um with the trade-off obviously being that you are introducing this zone of illiquidity because you don't actually have as much money as you're pretending to have and so you have to be careful of course uh how much and where you're concentrating this liquidity and you really need to use uh pairs of assets that are going to trade within some price range because once you exit this price range you become illiquid and you can no longer Market make which as we discussed is is very bad um so what we really need is to be able to leverage this powerful virtual Reserve mechanism but to also uh have some freedom to move it around right and so that's exactly what uniswap V3 provides so uniswot V3 utilizes these virtual reserves but it basically says each individual liquidity provider can choose their own price range and implicitly amplification and concentration as well um and so this is super interesting to me because it's essentially Outsourcing this hard problem of deciding where to provide liquidity to the liquidity providers themselves so the mechanism no longer has to solve this problem specifically but instead it's simply General enough to let liquidity providers decide what risk and reward payoffs they want to take by deciding where to concentrate the liquidity um now the there is not a trading function for this one as you probably noticed uh it's hard to appreciate the complexity that uniswot V3 can provide with a trading function instead what you're seeing is a liquidity graph so um on the x-axis is essentially the price and on the y-axis is the liquidity at any given point which is essentially how flat the trading function is there and you can see for reference just for fun we have unit swap V2 which is just flat because it's uniform whereas uniswot V3 has this very complex shape because this is sort of the combination of all these different ranges uh that all these uniswap V3 liquidity providers are providing liquidity in and so um as everyone's probably aware this has become extremely popular and uh is responsible for a huge proportion of the D5 trading volume because of how powerful this this mechanism is so that concludes all the uh specific amm types I'm going to cover today um to close things out I'd like to briefly cover how we can build on top of these great on-chain mechanisms and leverage off-chain computation as well to improve upon them even more so the first thing I want to cover are requests for quote systems so I alluded to this earlier and essentially what this is um is it allows the market maker to do completely off-chain pricing right so you can either leverage a real-time Oracle or you can leverage actual traditional professional market makers that are constantly manipulating the order book um and you can then provide an API that anyone can hit and they can get a quote and a signature with that quote and you can then take that quote and signature on chain and you can then execute it and compose it with all these other amms as well um and so this becomes a powerful mechanism where we can leverage uh this these off-chain resources which often allow for more efficient pricing um while still maintaining a lot of these on-chain benefits that we get from amms and so we have a few examples there one is Clipper RFQ which I mentioned which leverages that off chain Oracle hash flow is another one that leverages these traditional essentially Market making tactics and provides that as a RFQ API that can then be leveraged on chain so with all of that in mind uh I'd like to close things out by asking the question now from the Trader's Point of View um how do we actually navigate this complex landscape and figure out where and how much to trade right and just to summarize um what we've covered here are many different types of amms which all have different purposes um each type of amm is actually implemented many many times on chain sometimes thousands of times in the case of uniswot V2 so you have many choices there as well uh it turns out since these trading functions are always adjusting their prices as you trade through them uh for any direct pair of assets the best place to trade is actually usually a combination of different uh liquidity pools instead of just picking one so your problem is not just picking uh one place it's actually picking some arbitrary combination right and if all that wasn't enough uh the best trading price is often actually routing through other tokens as well um and so the answer to all this uh as you may guess is of course Dex aggregators right we have a very hard optimization problem and we can essentially uh leverage off-chain computation um to solve this problem and provide again uh a transaction that still maintains a lot of the great qualities of on-chain amms by still allowing for Atomic execution self-custody uh still you still have protection from slippage um and so this is an incredibly powerful mechanism uh and I have an example of uh a particular trade you can execute with Odo specifically now with otos we visualize these uh aggregation paths with what's called a Sankey diagram and it's essentially showing the flow from the left hand side to the right hand side through all these other assets and all these other dexes this one in particular actually has about 40 different swaps so 40 different decks integration interactions that you can execute all atomically um this one is also showing multiple assets being traded at once so this is another benefit that we can get from uh sort of combining these amms like building blocks into a bigger transaction to execute a given trade um and so yeah Dex aggregators very powerful and sort of an example again of leveraging this off-chain execution um for uh even better experience over these amazing amm mechanisms and so that concludes things um a few final notes uh the parent company of otos semiotic Labs is actually giving a couple other talks today so uh I encourage you to check those out they're related to artificial intelligence and cryptography work related to um our work as core devs for the graph um and we are also hiring so you can feel free to reach out if any of that sounds interesting um so yeah that's time [Applause] thank you Matt so unfortunately there isn't time for questions but if you have questions for Matt please meet him outside of the room um where I'm sure he's going to be happy to talk to you uh so now uh we'll have tree talks on zero knowledge proofs and privacy uh the next one is going to be penumbra a building a private decks with zkbs and threshold cryptography uh and we'll start in five minutes [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] so looking forward to the next talk uh who is who is here for for zkps who thinks who thinks zkps are the greatest things that blockchains ever enabled into space in terms of getting it funded all right all right that's just my personal opinion though but I think zkps are actually the nice thing that nobody expected coming from cryptocurrencies but they still happened uh so next up uh we have Henry de valence uh the founder of penumbra and he's going to to be talking about um their experience of building uh a privacy oh this just disappeared in front of my eyes because the talk is starting now but uh Henry's building uh privacy preserving decks uh using zkp so please put chance together for Henry all right um so oh do I get a clicker thanks all right um yeah well uh great to see everyone um so I'm gonna be giving a talk about how to build a private decks however just as a kind of a pre-warning um if you're really interested in all of the sort of details of ZK proofs that actually won't be covered in the talk and the reason is that I think part of the problem with deploying zkps for uh privacy rather than just for scalability is that there's some interesting and fundamental challenges in the state model so that's actually sort of the whole summary of the talk so to get started um uh for context so I'm working on a project called penumbra what that is is a private proof of stake L1 inside of that L1 we have an interchange shielded pool so you can take any IBC compatible asset moving into this chain and that's the the Privacy boundary so as it moves in it's recorded in this shielded pool and the cool feature that we have is this private Dax that's integrated with that shielded pool on top of that privacy preserving base layer however um I'm not sort of here to just you know chill the project I'm here to talk about the kind of technical aspects and specifically what are the challenges to actually building this system so the first challenge is oh sorry uh so just as as a bit of motivation right like why do we actually care about having um a private decks in the first place um the the thought is that every Market is also a marketing information when we talk about price Discovery for instance you can think of that as being a kind of decentralized computational process that as a side effect produces some information about prices but that means that information leaks are value leaks when people talk about Mev and have these you know dashboards of here's how much value is extracted from people who are trying to do trading really that's just the sort of first order symptom of this problem it's not even if you fixed Mev in some way um you still have the problem that you're you're leaking information about what trades are doing what trades your account has done your entire history of your whole trading strategy all of that information is valuable too it's just harder to make a dashboard of it so the the thought here is that privacy is a really interesting thing for uh trading because trading is a context where having privacy allows you to unlock greater Capital efficiency and as somebody who's really interested in privacy you know for its own sake as a value as a human right Etc um this is a really interesting and exciting uh opportunity because it means that there's the potential to build a private product that can actually out compete the non-private ones because it's private so we we get out of this mode of like oh well we'll you know have people accept all these trade-offs to use the private thing no we're going to build something that's that's better because it's private so right I said I was going to talk about the challenges and the first challenge which is the most fundamental is actually the state model so if we consider a transparent chain like ethereum the the Paradigm of that state is global mutable State there's like one big ethereum state and every transaction is applied sequentially and it can do whatever mutation to that state and as it's doing that mutation effectively it's taking like a global lock over the whole state doing some changes then you do the next transaction and so on but in order to have a shielded chain where the user state is not public information we have to change the state model to a model of immutable composable State this is actually kind of like historically speaking this is sort of rewinding to a Bitcoin style sort of utxo model but uh I think utxo is a little bit of a loaded like baggage Laden term so I prefer just having this idea of a state fragment and instead of having one big Global State we're going to have a tree of State fragments which are immutable and each transaction is going to consume some State fragments produce some new ones and put those you know append those into this tree the reason that we want to do this is that that way we can make the state transitions private and the move to do that is you replace all of those State fragments with cryptographic commitments to States and then in your transaction rather than explicitly declaring the plaintext values of those State fragments you can just have a ZK proof that the state transition was valid and here are the commitments to the new states that I produced okay so this is all cool and that's why everybody's like using like private blockchains all the time no why is that because that diagram isn't quite right in fact what you're submitting to the chain is this ZK proof pi that represents the state transition but what we've actually done is we've moved all of the execution off chain along with moving all the user data off chain right but now we don't really have any way to access any shared State because when somebody's submitting their transaction effectively every transaction is is its own little micro Roll-Up and what I would claim is that the key problem here is is one of early versus late binding so what we have in this sort of ZK model is early binding every transaction has to have this fully sealed complete State transition but that's not actually what we generally want right if you make a trade on uniswap you're not going to sign over here's the exact State of the Union reserves of this contract here's the exact outputs that I'll get because the only way that you could do that is by sort of having the entire world stop while you you know submit your transaction right what we want is the ability to have a partially filled transaction where we can have some placeholder values where when the transaction is executed the the shared state is going to go in that that spot and then it'll determine some outputs um so in order to make this work with the sort of ZK model where we're keeping all of the user data off chain we need to have some better concurrency model for shared state right fundamentally the problem is that if you're doing this off chain execution you need to have some kind of like exclusive control over the the data that you're executing on and you can start with the kind of oh well we'll take a big Global lock and you can make the locks you know smaller but the the more interesting idea I think is what if we try to model concurrency with message passing rather than locking if you look outside of blockchains it just kind of like normal you know high performance High concurrency software systems um you can do better by having finer locking but a cleaner and more scalable approach is to have different parts of the system executing independently with their own State and passing messages back and forth to each other so what would that look like in the context of trying to build a privacy preserving chain well we could try to think of this kind of actor model for chains where a transaction rather than synchronously doing a contract call where it locks some state does some execution and then finishes and releases the lock we could say that the transaction is going to pass a message to a contract and now we're going to have each contract execute once per block but as it executes it's going to receive the set of all of the messages that any transaction passed to it and it can process those all in a batch and depending on you know the specifics of that contract logic in some cases you know you could combine all of those messages into one right like you could do a batch swap which I'll get to later on in the talk but also you could imagine say like an auction protocol that orders these messages by the the bid amount um and the key thing is that you're not doing any execution at a higher time resolution than is actually provided by the underlying consensus right when people talk about transaction ordering a lot of the problems arise from this mismatch between the economic mechanism and the contract which is trying to execute at this sort of faster than consensus speed and the actual you know consensus ordering guarantees that are provided by the blockchain which happen block by block right like if you're agreeing on transactions in in batches like maybe you should also be executing them in batches um and on the other hand our our per user State we can still have this sort of off-chain uh execution but now the execution is going to be asynchronous right when I consume my state and I pass a message to a contract I can't compute my outputs yet because I haven't got a message back so I need to somehow record this sort of intermediate future that represents the eventual result of the computation that I'm going to be doing but I can do all of the uh all of the computation that is only touching a particular user State can happen off chain uh privately in ZK so the really interesting thing about this model is that it actually simultaneously unlocks both scalability and privacy because all of the data that doesn't need to be having any shared execution is happening that execution is is happening on each individual user's client and the on-chain data is limited to the minimum uh shared computation and it's executing in a batch so you can potentially have a much more efficient implementation so to see kind of how this works in a diagram uh which I think it might be a little bit more clear we're going to start off with our first uh you know somebody's preparing a transaction they're going to perform a state transition and produce a ZK proof of it with their private inputs and that transaction is going to send a message out to this contract what it's going to record as the output of that initial transaction is actually a privately minted state nft which commits to the Future that this computation is supposed to be uh representing so now this user has this in this diagram this is the the Diamond is this nft that records the kind of intermediate state of their per user computation after they send that all out to the chain it's included in a block the chain is going to send a message back by publishing data to the the chain or the contract's going to send a message back by publishing the data to the chain and we take that message from the contract combine it with our intermediate execution state we're going to burn that state and inside of this ZK proof we can now prove that we've you know modeled the correct future with the correct uh you know same input values that we had committed to in the first transaction and now we can privately mint some outputs so this is this sort of big picture diagram of how this sort of async ZK execution can work um in principle um and we'll get to a concrete example of how that works out for the case of doing batch swaps but before that I just want to get into this second challenge which is um once you have an idea of okay we have maybe a workable State model but what is the Privacy model right and the the claim here is that basically every useful blockchain revolves around public shared State that's why you know for instance ethereum is valuable because it has everybody's state in it and it's all there um so the idea of like oh well we're gonna just like make everything private and like everything will be completely private doesn't actually work because in fact like the reason that we're we're using the coordination tool is so that we can coordinate nobody wants to use a market where they have no idea what the liquidity is uh or what prices they might get or you know what the volume is um and all of the the sort of big breakout successes uh of of useful contracts have the contract uh public shared State acting as this kind of universal counterparty so you don't need to go and find some some person to interact with you can just interact with the chain so we need to have public shared state but you know maybe we want it to be private so what what does that mean exactly right this question the question is like how do you allow private interaction with public shared State um we want to have uh some kind of notion where the individual users transactions have privacy but all of the aggregate state of the chain like you know all of the aggregate Market data is public but the individual users trades are not so here's two basic strategies of how you could have uh private interaction with public State one is splitting flows and the other is batching flows when I say flow the reason I use that word is that I think of um you know value being in in different sort of pieces of the chain State and as people do things you're going to have flows of value between different portions of the chain State and we want to have some kind of system where people can have privacy about what their contribution to that specific flow is but still have a sort of overall um a transparent aggregate so looking at these two in turn for splitting flows the idea is that we're going to start off with some users value that you know this maybe this is an amount that they want to trade they can split that into randomized sub amounts and then reveal each of those sub amounts in distinct transactions and then reunify them later so this method only works if you have a shielded base layer if you have a transparent base layer then this like is trivially broken because you just like look at what the account was and then you can see what it did but if everything else is private and you're only revealing like here is a specific amount that I'm sending to this part of the system like this is a a public delegation amount to some validator this is like an amount in in one sort of randomized sub trade this might be okay and it's a it's a fairly practical and simple thing however it's it's not really ideal so the other strategy which is more interesting and more cool is this idea of batching flows so if we know that we're already going to be processing uh uh the contract state in batches it would be nice to have a way to batch up flows um we do this using a construction that we we're calling flow encryption which is effectively additively homomorphic threshold encryption uh with sort of end-to-end verifiability once you've tacked on you know six different properties you might as well give it a distinct name but the idea is that each individual user with their you know distinct contribution to this flow can encrypt an integer amount uh include that in their transaction and then the validators can sum up those encryptions and decrypt only a batch total um so that there's the batch total and the idea is that now you can use that as the input to some public on-chain computation but still have long-term privacy for individual transactions you know as long as the the batch size is is big enough as an example if you're trying to have um you know a a delegated proof of stake system you could make it so that oh the validator weights will change you know in each Epoch and we'll just sum up all of the the delegations or undelegations in each Epoch and only reveal the net change um so these are sort of the the two pieces let's see how this kind of works out uh as a as a concrete worked example um which is doing sealed input batch swaps on penumbra um so looking first at the private State part right remember that we have this model where we explicitly segment away the per user private state from the shared public state we're going to start off with okay here's the the private input for this trade that a user wants to make they're going to encrypt that input include that in their transaction the rest of the transaction right is is totally shielded because we have this shielded base layer so there's no Public Accounts or any other metadata in the the transaction and what though meant in that swap transaction is a swap nft where the the asset ID of that uh nft is a snark friendly hash of their input trade amounts the trading pair their you know the address that they're going to Mint the funds to some prepaid fees uh and as this transaction that they submitted is included in a block it gets batched together with the others decrypted you send that into the Dex engine which resolves all of the trade intent and publishes the output data into the chain State and now that user can consume their swap nft which remember is modeling this sort of future that resolves eventually to their swap outputs and produce a proof that uses these uh public back swap data as a public input and their swap nft is a private input to privately mint their correct prorata share of the batch Swap and so that that means that dot individual user's output can be minted completely privately and as long as you have sufficient uh uh sufficient volume in in the batch um you can get long-term privacy for individual users trade amounts now if you're on say like a thinly traded uh pair maybe you end up in a batch size of one but in that case you can use this uh sort of randomized splitting technique that I mentioned earlier to make effectively a kind of like randomized t-wop of your trade so zooming out of the the private State part to how this works on the public State Side um we have all of these uh uh all of these uh swap transactions that have been included in the the block we have the Dex engine group all of those inputs by pair we do this batching and decryption but now at this point we we don't just have you know a single swap we don't just have a single Swap transaction on a single pair we have a complete picture of here's all the trading intent uh for the entire chain in this block and we also know that we only have to run the Dex engine once per block because we're in this batched computation model so that means that we can actually be you know considerably more sophisticated in how we resolve these trades we can load up the entire liquidity graph of all of the assets on the Chain sort of put the uh trade intent into the correct spots on that graph and then compute uh some optimal resolution of all of these trades simultaneously so you can do some kind of global resolution of the trading intent do optimal Arbitrage and this is computationally tractable to do just like in consensus because you know that you're only doing this once per block so you you end up in a model where rather than sort of having to call each contract you know potentially like thousands of times a block you just know that the chain is going to step in discrete time from one set of consistent prices to a new set of consistent prices you can handle all of the newly added or removed liquidity also in a batched way right so you first add all of the newly created liquidity then you resolve all of the trading tent then you are up all the prices to be consistent with each other then you close all the you know closed positions and this also lets you as a side effect have like single block uh jit liquidity uh with the kind of like batch semantics so there's a lot of really interesting pieces of Market design that get unlocked by this model um so that's basically the content of the talk if you want to play with this we have some weekly test Nets that you can you know play around with here's a bunch of links um so far uh the the big last sort of piece to build is the the actual Dex engine but we have a toy uh amm that you can do these shielded swaps against uh on our test net so that's a talk if anybody has any questions happy to get into it [Applause] uh just wait for the mic please I'll run to you with the mic thanks for the talk uh just curious so have you found a tight Bound for how much of a loss you have when you provide batching because if it's a constant function Market maker there's a loss in what sense uh so you're going to get an average you're smoothing it out in that sense of speaking so you can actually have a spike in a block you're just averaging so have you done an announcements I did some analysis so I'm curious if you have done that so I guess the the question that I have is like a loss relative to what right assuming no private so two volts same block private versus non-private uh uh I'm no okay do we have more questions yeah they're not sure who was first sorry just a quick one thanks very much for the talk this is fantastic to hear and to get uh this content and this all right quick question on reverts the whole batch reverts all right so I missed that on revert the whole batch reverts if a transaction reverts oh objection is not valid yeah so um it's possible for instance that someone could submit a transaction that say you know they submit a trade for a trading pair that doesn't have any um liquidity on it right so one of the outcomes of the the batch swap is that the the trade can fail and in that case rather than having people privately mint their Pro rata share of the outputs they privately meant their Pro rata share of the inputs they get their their funds back uh yeah so the whole batch goes goes at once so like technically I guess you could have some kind of griefing attack where someone is like continually locking up capital in trying to like dot prevent other people from Trading by submitting a giant whale trade but like they can't actually do that without running the risk that like someone will provide liquidity at a bad price so I think it's probably not a big deal right the time is off well one more round of applause for Henry please [Applause] thank you Henry uh so if he if you want to ask Henry any more questions please meet him outside of the room uh and we're going to continue with the Privacy topic and next up we'll have Oscar uh torrent talking about building privacy protecting infrastructure [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] everybody and here we are again so please welcome on stage Oscar tauren from wac research um he's going to be talking about building private privacy preserving infrastructure so please welcome in on stage [Applause] all right uh so today I'm going to talk about building privacy protecting infrastructure what it is uh why we need it and how we can build it and we look at vacu which is the communication layer for web free and also look at how we're using CK technology to incentivize and protect the vacuum Network we'll also look at circuit which is a library we've been building to make it easy to use signals proofs in different environments and at the end of this talk uh I hope you'll come away with a better understanding of the importance of privacy protecting infrastructure and how we can build it it's frustration about the vac and me I'm the director of research at vac and we build public good protocols for the distance as web with a focus on privacy and communication we do applied research based on which we build protocols libraries and Publications and we also the custodians of protocols that reflect a set of principles it has its origins in the status app and basically trying to improve on the underlying protocols and the infrastructure we build vacu among other things so privacy is the power to selectively reveal yourself its requirement for freedom and self-determination just like you need decentralization in order to get sensorship resistance you need privacy to enable freedom of expression to build applications that are decentralized and privacy predicting you need the base layer the infrastructure itself to have these properties we see this a lot it's easy to make trade-offs at the application layer than doing them at the base layer you can have custodial Solutions on top of a decent slicer non-costal Network where participants own their own keys but you can't really do it Opposite and if you think about it even something as basic as the buildings can can be seen as a form of privacy protecting infrastructure is completely normal and obvious in many ways but when it comes to your digital realm and mental models and we are speaking about it uh it hasn't sort of cut up from us yet for most people I'm not going to go into too much detail about the need for privacy or what happens we don't have it but suffice to say it's an important property for an open Society when we have conversations through peer-to-peer offline conversations we can talk privately and we if we use cash to buy things we can do Commerce privately on the internet great as it is a lot of forces that makes it the natural state of things not the default big take as you turn users into commodity a product and monetize users attention for advertising to optimize for your attention they need to surveill your habits and activities and hence Bridge your privacy as opposed to more traditional business models where you're buying a product and incentives are maybe more aligned and to sort of build these uh sensor persistent and price predicting and enable these types of apps that enable free frame expression and we need credibility basically infrastructure that have these properties so infectious what lies underneath there's many ways with many different ways of looking at it but keep it simple as per the original web free vision so you had a theorem for computing consensus Swan for storage and Whisper for messaging and vacuo has taken over the mantle from whisper and is a lot more usable today than with than Whisperer was for many reasons on the Privacy front we see how ethereum is struggling it's a big ux problem especially when you try to add privacy back on top it takes a lot of effort and it's a lot easier to sensor and we see this with recent actions around 200 cache compare this with something like c-cash or Monero where privacy is there by default there are also problems when it comes to the peer-to-peer networking side of things for example with efferent valid data privacy and hostile actors and jurisdictions if someone can easily find out where certain validator is physically located that's a problem in many parts of the world being able to have stronger privacy protection guarantees will be very useful for high value targets and this doesn't even begin to touch on so-called apps that make a lot of sacrifices in how they function from the way how domain Works to how websites are hosted and Reliance on centralized services for communication we see this time and time again where centralized single points of failure they work for a while but then eventually fail and in many cases an individual user they might not care enough and for platforms the Lord to take shortcuts is strong and this is why it's important to be principal but also pragmatic in terms of the trade-offs that you allow on top and we'll touch more on this when it comes to design goals and around the modularity that Rebecca has so synonyms proofs are a wonderful new tool and just like smart contracts enable programmable money synops proofs allows us to express fundamentally new things in line with the great tradition of trust minimization you can prove statements while revealing the absolute minimum information necessary and this fits the definition of privacy the power to selectively reveal yourself perfectly and I'm sorry I don't need to tell anyone in this room but this is truly revolutionary and technology is Advanced extremely fast and it's often our imagination is limit so what is vacuum it's a set of model protocols for P2P communication as a focus on privacy security and being able to run anywhere and it's a spiritual successor to whisper and by modeler we mean that you can pick and choose protocols and how you use them depending on constraints and trade-offs so for example bandwidth uses versus privacy it's designed to work in resources addicted environments such as mobile phones and web browsers and it's important that infrastructure meets users where they are and support their real world use cases just like you don't need your own Army and a castle to have a private bathroom you shouldn't need to have a powerful always on node to get reasonable privacy and sense of persistence we might call this self-sovereignty one way of looking at vacuo is as an open service network there are nodes with very degrees of capabilities and requirements for example when it comes to things like bandwidth usage storage uptime privacy requirements latest requirements and connectivity jurisdictions we have this concept of adaptive nodes that can run a variety of protocols and a node operator can choose which particles they want to run naturally be some nodes that do more consumption and other nodes to do more provisioning and this gives rise to radio for service network where servers are provided for and consumed so many different protocols that interact the vacuum relay protocol is based on lipid to be Gossel sub for p2bm messaging and we have things like filter for band restricted nodes total receiver subsider messages light push for nodes with short connection Windows to push message into the network store for those that want to retrieve historical masses and then on the payload layer we also have things like support for noise handshakes and key exchange and this means that as developers you can get end-to-end encryption and expected guarantees out of the box we have support for setting up secure channel from scratch and all of this paced away for providing things like singles double directed at a protocol level much easier we also have experimental support for Multi-Device usage it's not worth noting that similar features have existed in for example the status app for a while but with this we make it easier for any platform using vacuo to reduce this there are a lot of other protocols as well related to things like pay Discovery topic use and so on and you can check out our specs for more so when it comes to Tobacco Network there are a few sort of immediate problems um for example when it comes to network spam and in centralizing service nodes we want to address these while keeping the Privacy guarantees of the base layer I'm going to go into both these so the spam problem Rises on the gospel player when N1 can overm the network with Masters the server synthesization is a problem when nodes don't directly benefit from reversing of a certain service this can happen if they are for example not using the protocol directly themselves as part of normal operation or if they aren't social inclined to provide a certain service and this depends a lot on how an individual platform choose to use the network so since the peer-to-peer relay network is open to N1 there's a problem with Spam and if we look at some existing solutions for dealing with experiment traditional medicine system a lot of entities like Google Facebook Twitter telegram Discord they use phone number verification and while this is largely stable resistant it is centralized and not private at all historically uh whispy is proof of work which isn't good for heterogeneous networks and then things like peer scoring are open to civil attacks and doesn't directly address spam protection in an anonymous PHP Network and the key idea here is to use our land for private economic spam protection using CK Snorks I'm not going to go into too much detail of our land here with some bright apps on back.dev by snails who's been pushing a lot of this from outside and I believe this also another talk by Taylor at PC tomorrow afternoon who's going to go into all any more detail well briefly go over what it is and so the interfaces circuits and talk about how it's used in vacuum so Orlando stands for rate limiting nullifier it's an anonymous rate limiting mechanism based on CK snarks and by resuming we mean that you can only send end messages in a given period and by anonymity we mean that you can't link link message to a publisher we can figure it kind of as a voting booth we're only allowed to vote once every election it can be used for spam protection and pay to be messaging systems and also rate limiting in general success for a D7 plus capture there are basically three parts to it so your register somewhere then you can signal and then finding there's a verification and slicing phase you put some Capital at risk and this can either be economic or social and if you top a signal you get slashed so here's what the private and public input to the Circuit looks like the identity secret here is generated locally and we create an identity commitment that is inserted into Mercury and we use Marketplace to Pro membership reticent members can only single once for a given Epoch or externalifier for example every 10 seconds in Unix time and our online identifier is for a specific online app we also see what the circuit output looks like and this is calculated locally so y here is the share of a secret equation and the internal nullifier acts as a kind of unique fingerprint for a given app user EPO combination how do we calculate this Y and enter the nullifier this is done using Shamir secretary semi secretary is a based on idea of splitting a secret into shares and this is how we enable slashing of funds in this case we have two shares if a given identity is zero singles twice in an Epoch external fire A1 is the same and then for giving online app internal file also stays the same X is the single hash which is going to be different and Y is public output so we can reconstruct the identity secret with identity secret revealed this gives access to for example Financial stake so this is how all end is used with the relay gaussian protocol so node registers and locks up funds and after that they can send messages they published a message containing the Synology proof and some other details each relayer node listens to the membership contract for new members and also keeps track of relevant metadata and the Merkle tree a metadata is needed to be able to take double signaling and perform slashing before forwarding a message it does some verification checks to ensure that there are no duplicate messages that the Synology proof is valid and that no double signaling as occurred it's worth noting that this can be combined with traditional PS coding for example things like duplicate messages or invalid CK proofs in line of vacuum's goal of modularity uh all in really is is applied on specific subset of Pub sub and content topics so you can think of it as a kind of a extra secure Channel so where are we at with Orlando deployment uh We've recently launched our second test net and this is using all in really really with the smart contagion girly it's integrated with our example P2P chat app and it does so through three different clients that could go back to and jsrack for browsers it is our first peer-to-peer cross-client test net for online relay here's a screenshot of a short demo in the interest of time I'm not going to do a demo here I'll actually do tomorrow afternoon [Music] but basically this shows a user registering in a browser and a singling through jsbacco and it then gets relayed to in vacuum node that verifies the proof and when more than one message is sent in a given Epoch it detects the spam and discards it slashing hasn't been implemented full yet in the client and his work in progress if you're curious and want to participate uh you can join the effort on our vac Discord we also have tutorials set up for all the clients that you can play around with and that's the QR code right there as part of this and in order to make this work in multiple different environments we've also been developing a new library called circuit I'll talk about this a bit later so going back to the idea of sort of the service network let's talk about service credentials so idea behind service credentials and private settlement is to enable two actors to pay for and provide services without compromising their privacy we do not want the payment to create a direct public link between the service provider and requester recall that the sort of vacuous service network illustration with adaptive nodes uh where when nodes will choose which protocols to run and a lot of these aren't very heavy and they sort of enabled and work by default for example they're really protocol and other Protocols are much heavier to provide such as for example storing historical messages it's desirable to have additional incentives for this especially for platforms that aren't Community Based where some level of altruism can be assumed for example status communities or wallet connect Cloud infrastructure so you basically have a node Alice that's often offline and it wants to consume historical messes on some specific content topic and you have another note Bob that runs the server at home whether you want a storage historical message for the last several weeks uh Bob is happy to provide this service for free because he's excited about running private protecting infrastructure but he's using it and he's using it himself but his node is getting overwhelmed by freeloaders and it feels like he should pay something to continue to provide a service so Alice deposits some funds in a smart contract which registers you know it in a tree similar to certain other private settlement mechanisms a fee is taken or burnt in exchange he gets a set of subsequentials and once he wants to occur with some criteria he sends this to Bob Bob responds what size of response cost and receiver address and then Alice then sends a proof of Delegation of a service token with a payment as a payment Bob verifies the proof and resolves the query the end result is that Alice has consumed some service from Bob and Bob has received payment from this there's no direct transaction link between Alice and Bob and gas fees can be minimized by extending the period before settling on chain this can be complemented with altruistic service provisioning for example by splitting the pier pool into two slots or only providing a few cheap queries for free the service provisioning is General and can be generals for any kind of request response previously never want to keep private and this isn't the perfect solution by any means but it's an incremental Improvement on top of the sales quote and it can be augmented with more Advanced Techniques such as better non-reputable node repetition proof of correct service provisioning Etc and we are basically currently in a raw spec proof concept stage of this and we expect to launch a test later this year or early next so circuit is a set of cereal knowledge modules written in Rust and designed to be used in many different environments the initial goal is to get the best of both worlds with circum solidity and JavaScript on one hand and the rust sequence ecosystem on other and this enables people to leverage circum-based constructs from non-javascript environments for the online module it is using circum circuits via Arc circum and rust for scaffolding it exposes a cffi API that can be used for other system programming environments like name mango it also exposes an experimental awesome API that can be used through web browsers and vacuous peer-to-peer infrastructure running in many different environments such as nimjs go and rust and mobile phones and web browsers so this is a requirement for us Socom and jsrings is access to things like dab developers tooling generating Verification codes circuits and raw strengths is that it's a system based and easy to interface with other language runtimes like nimgo rust C it also gives access to other rusted seek ecosystems such as artworks which opens the door for using other constructs like Halo 2. this becomes especially relevant for contracts where you might not want to do a sort of a trust setup or with circus or more complex or custom and performance requirements are higher and so on in general with circuit we want to make it easy to build and use Synology proofs in a multitude of environments such as mobile phones and web browsers currently it's too complex to write privacy protecting infrastructure with Synology proofs considering all the languages and tools you have to learn all the way from JavaScript solidity and circum and how to write the circuits to rust was them ffi and that's not even touching on things like secure key storage or mobile Dev luckily more and more products are working on this including various D cells and it would also be exciting if you can sort of make a useful tool stack for JS list CK devs to sort of reduce cognitive overhead uh similar to what we have with something like Foundry I also want to mention a few other things we're doing um one thing is protocol specifications and we think this is very important for peer-to-peer infra and we sell a lot a lot of we see a lot of other products that claim to be doing peer-to-peer structure but they aren't very clear about guarantees or stable something is or the actual semantics of it this makes it hard to have multiple implementations to collaborate across products and analyze things objectively related to this is publishing papers we put out free so far related to vacuum and online relay and this makes it easier to interface with Academia and there's a lot of good reasons out there and we want to build build a better bridge between Academia and research and Industry another thing is Network privacy so vacuum is modeler with respect to private Securities and there's lots of knobs to turn here depending on specific deployments and requirements so for example if you're running the full relay protocol you currently have much stronger receive anonymity than if you're running filter protocol from a bandwidth or current or connectivity restricted node we have to make this pluggable depending on specific user needs so for example mixedness such as Nim they come with some trade-offs but are definitely a very useful tool in this Arsenal a good mental model to keep in mind here is the unlimited trilemma where you can only pick two out of three when it comes to low latency low bandwidth uses and strong anonymity we're currently exploring things like dandelion like additions to the relay gossip protocol which would provide for stronger synonymity especially in a multi-node botnet attacker model um and as part of this we're looking into things like different parameter choices and and more generally possibilities for low latency usage this could make it more amendable for latency sensitive environments Associated validated validated privacy especially under very specific threat models in general theme is do we want to be rigorous about the guarantees we provide under what conditions and for what precise threat models and we have a lot of specs around this and adversary models and so on another thing that I mentioned Earl is this noise payload encryption and specif specifically things like allowing for pairing different devices with QR codes and that's sort of it's very useful for developers because we live in a Multi-Device world and we want to use things from different devices There's a summary uh we're going over with privacy protecting infrastructure is why we want it and how we can build it we're seeing our CK is a fundamental building block for this we looked at vacuo the communication label web free and how it uses serial knowledge proofs to stay private and function better we also looked at circuit and how we can make it easy to do signal proofs in different environments finally we also looked at some other reasons we've been doing and all of the things mentioned in this talk and a lot more is available as write-ups specifications or discussions on on our Forum or GitHub uh here's some links uh if you find any of this excitement to work on feel free to come up to talk to me and we're also hiring and I've started expanding into other privacy infrastructure technology such as uh private improvable computation with CK awesome and the QR code is a link to our Discord thanks any questions [Applause] uh hello one of the main challenge I perceive uh in a crypto messaging is uh the fact that producers has instant advised to pay to have a massage broadcasted but there is no incentive and for layers to distribute it to Consumers that much and this makes centralized solution usually would come as you want to have something like I don't know metamask to be able to relay things to users with infra and everything which make it in return a sensorship sensitive where then nation state can pressure decentralized actors into not Distributing the message and if you rely only on peer-to-peer you might still need then some very old-fashioned index or layer which can also be centralized to this message is here so how do you specifically in your protocol solve this making sure that there is instances of a distributor to receive a message so okay repeat the question so if you're in a decentralized messaging protocol you have consumers that want to receive sage and as you put it yourself sometimes they don't really have a lot of resource they don't necessarily want to verify their identity and everything but there is no direct incentive for broadcasters to have of the product message that these consumers want send this message to the consumers we're not getting paid for it yes so I think we're I guess we're splitting this this problem up a bit it's definitely a general problem if you have sort of some multi-hop module if you want to keep that private and incentivize that in general that leases are very heavy models the way we are basically simplifying the problem and cutting it up is looking empirically at the problems we see today and a lot of those problems as you kind of mentioned with methods and things like that come exactly when you are in a restricted environment and you have to use some kind of service some request response kind of thing there and this is exactly what we're trying to do with the with the things like the subsequentials and these things and there's also a lot of things going on here when it comes to Discovery and like finding and and ranking these types of nodes but when we look at the real Network just like if you look at gossip sub usually the participants in the network are incentivized to sort of relay mess this and furthermore because of for animated reasons we are encouraging the use of a single pop sub topic which means that sort of your reeling messages in a network in general because you don't necessarily know the contents of it so it's kind of a byproduct byproduct of normal operation so it depends a bit on what layer you look at it if it's sort of the normal operation or if you're looking at the edge kind of thing and then the reputation thing is another aspect of it okay so there is no direct instances in the network it's just a side effect of producers wanting more users uh kind of like this these levels of it right there's different types of incentives uh and uh they're really Network itself empirically it's not the big problem right now it is definitely a recess area and it's not something that we are looking into and we have some ideas around it but it's not actually a high priority if you look at empirically problems we're having the problems we're having are more around this kind of edges where there's a service positioning as well as how you discover things in a web browsers and and reputable nodes and these type of things so that's higher priority uh and empirically but things might evolve and yeah do you have any more questions I have two questions first is is Alan based on semaphore second second question is is there any gas payment involved in uh zero knowledge verification if if if there is how do you prevent from uh exposing the identity from guest payment yes that's a good question so our land is you can look as kind of semaphore but then more things when it comes to actually preventing uh double uh double signaling um so semaphore plus some other stuff to do that then do the slashing and so on uh as for the CK like CK verification this is actually something that's a bit different with this peer-to-peer infrastructure because it's not happening normally on the blockchain it's actually you're verifying it on each peer-to-peer node sort of that's running this thing so that doesn't require uh gas usage when it comes to slash things if you've detected the double signaling then you you have to go on chain obviously and interact that and that will also verify the proof but you can use the relays and these types of things but as part of normal operation you're not actually interacting with blockchain it's all happening peer-to-peer right unfortunately time is up uh but thank you Oscar uh again I'm going to repeat the fact that you can go talk to Oscar uh outside of the room so please uh follow up on our conversation there uh so again thank you [Applause] and just one comment next up we'll have Jackson blazinski and severiano Cisneros uh telling you about the story of building snark Solutions on mainnet so in five minutes there is more snarks um yeah [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you foreign foreign foreign so the next talk is going to start in a bit it's going to be a tail a snark's tale a story of building snark Solutions on the mainnet uh by Savvy Accord from from the graph but before we are ready uh does anyone have any interesting snark tail or is the do people do people actually use zkps here uh in any like user way or is one person that's nice could you could you tell us could you tell us your snark Tale what is you when was your first time you know just sit backs close your eyes and and tell us about the first time you ever use a snork oh there's he doesn't have a microphone but I'm going to I'm going to run there well to to send the transaction on the media Network which is a ZK layer one nice that was a that was a nice and not push at all shell of Mina uh um but yeah appreciate it thank you for sharing uh so so yeah finally please welcome on stage Savvy uh from the graph [Applause] all right thank you yeah so uh I'm a cryptographer at semiotic labs and this is a joint work with Jackson blazinski from Edge node like I said we're core developers from the graph and basically we're just kind of going to walk through one of our stories of uh trying to you know build Solutions using snarks and then actually running them on ethereum mainnet so first I think everybody here has at least heard of a snark um so let's just kind of quick recap of the main character of our story this is the you know the expanded acronym of snark succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge in particular what we care about is the sickness property of these snarks so it's kind of like that computation compressing uh the scalability solution for ethereum uh those properties one like notable Omission from our uh from our snark here's we don't have the ZK piece and so in our Solutions we don't necessarily care too much about the ZK the Privacy piece which is like really this scalability piece that we're after um and also as I'm laying out the acronym snark I notice something that one of my co-workers 10 year old daughters noticed and she said shouldn't it be called a snack and she's not wrong so all right so our story every story has a challenge a reason for it to exist and this is our challenge um let's you can't really see the bottom line there but that's all right the so basically what we're trying to do is we are trying to use a snark to uh resolve like one million independent payment channels within the graph protocol so the graph protocol the way that the ensure indexers get paid is they have an entity called the gateway and every time the indexer provides a result from a query you know they get paid some amount and so then the Gateway issues them a receipt that's been signed by the by that's been signed by the Gateway and then uh it says you know what's the value uh of your of your transaction right so the nice thing about the payment channel that the graph uses is that you can basically instantiate up to a million independent kind of payment channels right and these are all asynchronous so the Gateway can just be firing away receipts as the as the indexer is serving queries and so the indexer ends up with a bundle of you know say a million different receipts uh and their total uh amount that they're owed is kind of the sum of the total value over all of those receipts and so for the indexer to be able to prove that you know they're owed the total amount that they're owed they need to somehow prove that all one million of these receipts uh have valid signatures that none of these receipts have been repeated and that the total value at adds up to the total value that they claim that they're owned and so one way they could do this right is they just take that bundle of a million receipts throw that uh on chain and then run some you know BL signature verification on all one million receipts but you know that's a little costly so we want a better solution and so the solution seems like really well suited for a snark right basically we want to take this computation of you know a million different signature verifications uh throw it into a snark that can say yes all one million of these are valid total value adds up to the claim total value all IDs are unique and then you get out just one nice little succinct proof with some claimed total value amount that goes on to chain and you run your snark verifier uh algorithm on chain and the indexer gets paid and so let's look a little closer at this problem and why it's interesting this table here that we're generating right this bundle of receipts we've got a million different receipts and so whenever we talk about snarks there's always this talk of like okay what circuits are used to verify your computation and all that type of stuff so basically our circuit needs to take in uh easily needs to prove one million different signature verifications so initially we're thinking about using BLS signatures you can maybe say that a BLS signature can be uh proved with the circuit of size say two to eight if you wanted to prove all one million of those transactions with this size to the eight circuit you could just take that to the Circuit copy and paste it and then you have some huge uh size 2 to the 28 circuit that you're going to be using in your snark to verify and and to prove and verify and so what's interesting about that is 2 to the 28 is about the biggest circuit size you'll see right so in all the literature analysis but people run their asymptotics and they go up to size 2 to the 28 and we haven't really seen much bigger than that and so already we're talking about trying to prove statements that are at the edge of what people have have used another really interesting thing about this primitive is we're trying to use a snark as a black box so really we're just trying to get incorporated into this payment Channel protocol and we don't really want to have this snark impose any extra requirements on the protocol itself right we just want this snark to be this black box we plug in a Scala table we get out of proof that proof goes Unchained you can verify it and you don't really impact the security of the system in any way based off of your snark uh and then yeah the final thing here the business side of of this oh yeah can you make this whole process of proving and verifying costs less than thirty dollars otherwise it's not very useful to the indexer so thanks yo all right so so now we're going we got our challenge we're trying to prove this massive table of data and basically prove this massive table of signature verifications how do we know whenever we're done right how do we know that we've succeeded there's a bunch of different metrics to quantify smart performance we use prover time prover memory proof size and verifier compute so approver time is basically just it's the amount of time that the approver spends generating their proof right so in this case it's the indexer the indexer has their big table they're going to run this proving algorithm and it's going to take them some amount of time to generate that proof prover memory this is like an actual physical requirements of the machine that they're using to generate this proof right so they they've got uh if they got a laptop with 16 gigs of memory you're not gonna the algorithm requires more than 16 gigs of memory you're gonna run into issues you're not gonna be able to generate a proof proof size this is the size of that proof that could spit out of the snark this is what gets sent on chain so this is obviously important right the bigger your proof is the more expensive is to store it and then verify or compute these are the computations that are run on chain uh in the verify algorithm and for the purpose of this talk whenever we talk about the verified compute we're really going to just highlight the most expensive operations that the verifier is going to run and so this gives us kind of like a quick way to filter out uh techniques and estimate gas costes and all that uh just another thing on this on these figures right we'll see them repeatedly this x-axis basically this is showing our statement size as it's growing right so we said we want to prove this big table of signature verifications uh the goal is to get to this kind of size 2 to the 28 instance and then by seeing you know how this how these uh these metrics Trend we can kind of get an idea for like engineering Solutions right and we get an idea how our problems are growing and stuff like that so those are our plots and now we start our story and I like maps and I like stories with maps and so we're going to have a map but a quick caveat about Maps is this is a map of the world in 450 BC it's accurate but we can tell it's not the full truth right there's a whole lot to be discovered still um so here's our map this is cryptography land as we saw it at the start of this program and especially in particular when we're looking at snarks so we've got kind of two major continents of snarks we've got transparent snarks and we've got these non-transparent Starks and so non-transparent snarks these are snacks that require some sort of trusted setup right so we saw yesterday when we're talking about dang sharding and we're going to have you know this kzg uh trusted setup ceremony that ceremony is what is required for these non-transparent snarks transparent snarks the idea is they don't require this kind of trusted setup ceremony um you can kind of run them out of the box so that's our map um now we say Where Do We Begin right how do we start this story and really the the when we started out we said okay one of these unique properties of the problem it's a black box like we said we don't want the snark to impose any security requirements on top of the system that we're using and so when we think about this trusted setup we can debate how like the Practical implementation the Practical implications of this uh trusted setup right like if you only have two people running the trust instead of ceremony you have to trust that both of them are honest you know as you increase the number of participants you know that that level of Trust might change but the point is you're still making an argument right there's still some other additional argument that goes on top of the math of your proving system and so initially we said we want this thing to be as black box as possible we don't want to have to deal with those extra arguments so we want to start with the transparent snark all right so now knowing that we're going to be using a transparent snark where do we go from here and so we start by looking at our problem statement and we start trying to find you know what's the next best snack to use the thing that's unique about this problem statement right is it's highly structured so basically we're kind of proving the same function you know a million times so if we could basically if we could kind of reuse these circuits right maybe we could uh significantly reduce costs either proof size verification time that type of thing and so in particular what we're curious about is we could come up with one circuit this is some f circuit that can be used to prove all of these uh snark things for a single row and so then if we could if we could do that then could we you know generate proofs for each individual row and then somehow like aggregate them all together and then we get some aggregate proof and the hope is that aggregate proof will cost only about the same to to verify uh as verifying this single small proof so people have been looking in stocks you can see where we're kind of going with this we are going to recursive snark land um and so in this space there's a couple of Primitives uh Halo is one of the big ones we hear about uh and there's there's talks on this week uh but at a very high level recursive snarks it's kind of like what it's saying right we we have the idea is we have a circuit we want to repeat the computations on that circuit and then kind of like aggregate these proofs together and the way that recursive snarks tend to get around this in practice is you take your original circuit you can like augment it with some uh snark verify circuit so it runs the verify algorithm of the of your proving system and then you have some resulted F Prime circuit and then this F Prime circuit is kind of what you start chaining together to approve all of your rows in our case privilege rows with a Scala table and the the really important thing here is the cost to verify and like the cost and proof size is really only tied to the cost for proving and verifying this this one F Prime circuit so that's really encouraging uh maybe you know we could uh significantly reduce our problem uh using this we use a primitive called Nova so it hasn't seen too much uh Traction in this community that I've seen yet but it's a it's a newer primitive it was presented at crypto this year uh the it's what it really has going for it is it can do kind of what Halo does but it has like the smallest constant size verifier circuit so we remember that F Prime we've got a little verify circuit the Nova is is the smallest that exists in the current literature and it's constant size so it doesn't depend on uh the size of your original F circuit uh yeah just a note for in our case this this F Prime circuit ends up being about size 2 to the 15 and so this is this constant proof size and the the verifier work is tied directly to this kind of two to the 15. another interesting thing about Nova is it uses another uh uh IOP called Spartan and what Spartan does or it's its Advantage is it's a very fast prover uh and it it might still be the fastest prover in the literature uh it doesn't use any ffts and it also has a relatively efficient verifier um some more notes about Nova the actual open source implementation that they have they've instantiated with with bulletproof's IPA so this is kind of like the expensive IPA that people talk about in the literature sort of expensive polynomial commitment scheme um but that is you know this bulletproof is only used to uh for a circuit of this size so you end up with a bulletproof instance on your polynomial it's tied to this size uh and then just another note on their open source implementation they're using these pasta curves so similar to Halo when you're generating these these recursive proving systems you have some like kind of unique uh mathematical Primitives that you got to use and so in that particular is called these cycles of elliptic curves and nobody uses the same thing that pasta does and it actually worked together on this so I think too surprising there what gets surprising now is whenever we actually start looking at our costs uh the first thing that we notice is these constant sides here right so the proof size is constant this verify is compute is constant so basically what we're saying is as we increase on our x-axis here we're basically proving more and more rows in our scalar table and this proof size and this verifier compute stay constant because again the proof and the the proof size in the verifier compute are tied only to that F Prime circuit so we get this nice kind of constant proof size verify compute that doesn't depend on the the number of rows that we're trying to prove the prover time here this is pretty much linear in the instance size that we're trying to prove so linear in the number of rows that we're trying to prove because basically like the prover has to do the work right so in in this particular instantiation the prover is just kind of going row by row uh kind of proving and accumulating so you kind of just see this linear growth here um and so I mean based off the implementation that we have available you know we would estimate you know 51 hours to prove uh using Nova for a an instance as as big as we want to get uh that may or may not be a a fundamental limiter um but really what we see the big limiter is this verify compute so even though verify compute is constant uh it still is a very expensive operation that needs to run and so in particular it's part of this bulletproof's polynomial commitment scheme you have to run this elliptic curve multi-exponentiation and it's you know size 2 to the 15 so 32 000 uh basically up to the curve uh multiplications and so the problem really is nobody's going to work with pasta curves ethereum only has pre-compile support for one curve all to be in 128 and so this is kind of a famously known problem at this point um so if we wanted to run this verify algorithm we would have to implement smart contracts for pasta curves so that that in itself is a cost that we would have to absorb uh and then if we did we would see you know based off of some people who have done similar work a scalar moment would still cost about 350 000 gas and so if we could use you know some algorithms for speeding up this multi-exponentiation we could get these these total costs down to you know 764 million gas or you know 76 000 off of some uh estimate of gas to dollar ratio so clearly this isn't the solution that we're looking for um maybe there's some engineering things we could do we could take advantage of all bn128 it also has a cycle um but for now we'll table this and we'll go look elsewhere so where do we go from here um again we want a transparent snark and we would really like to use Primitives that can take advantage of you know things that are supported by ethereum so we look for uh Primitives that use Albion 128 Albion 128 is a pairing friendly curve so we're going to look for transparent stock Primitives to use uh pairings and we don't really have to look too far so Nova the same authors who wrote Nova they also uh authored something called quirks and so this is a another transparent uh snark primitive and in particular what's unique about it is they invent some pretty unique polynomial commitment schemes that use pairings but they don't require a trusted setup and so they can get some significantly better performance than say bulletproofs uh from a verifier from a verifier standpoint so it's pretty unique again similar to how Nova was written they're using Spartan as their IOP so basically they take one of their polynomial commitment schemes either Copus or Dory pair it with Spartan and then now they have a snark uh the nice thing about them they've got fast and spaces fast and space efficient provers that's a property of both the polynomial commitment schemes and the Spartan primitive the proofs are they're a little bit bigger than what you would get out of something like bulletproofs uh but they could be manageable and then the nice thing about them too they have relatively cheap verifiers oh yeah then just another comment there's actually some more research by the same uh kind of group of authors about Spartan that is used to prove kind of like simdi computations right so uh you have basically our scaling table right we have one circuit we have multiple inputs uh single input multiple data and so they've got some stuff off the shelf that can seemingly help us with our problem so we get really excited about this so let me start digging in to uh quarks and we want to use it and we want to try to try to build some arcs with it the first problem that we run into is there's no open source implementation so that in itself makes things pretty challenging uh there's no copis nor is there a Dory PC although I was talking it sounds like there might be a door implementation uh available somewhere as a as of a couple days ago but I haven't seen it yet um so knowing that this polynomial commitment scheme is kind of like the primary cost driver for these snarks we implemented the copis PC using uh the rust Arc Works libraries and then we ran it to get some some benchmarks right and kind of get some estimated costs uh and so these are the the results for Copus PC the one thing that we see in approver time now is is pretty nice right that's 565 seconds for the biggest uh incidence size that we would want to prove so uh yeah that's nice uh the prover memory requirements you know the if you have a machine that has four gigs of memory you should be able to run this again this is a proof size so we're in the orders of kilobytes here right so the small basically at the biggest InstaSize we got a proof of about nine kilobytes and then this verify compute this is again the we'll see this this becomes the big problem um we're talking about doing elliptic curve arithmetic again some of those how bulletproofs was doing the instant sizes are significantly smaller but there's still significant work to be done there uh to contrast copis with you know Dory which is the other polynomial commitment scheme Dory takes advantage of some pre-computation to reduce this verifier time or this verify compute work even further and as a consequence like their proofs are about three times bigger so just take these proof sizes multiply by three and then the verify compute is significantly less like we'll see on the next slide so Quark silic promising at least the polynomial schemes look promising on paper uh the problem is now if we want to start again running this verifier on ethereum the problem is particularly even though there's all bn128 support uh there is no GT exponentiation support so yeah and so uh yes that's that's a significant problem and basically we simulated we implemented some GT arithmetic we simulated the total cost and we got down to about 4 million gas to do one exponentiation and so a whole Dory verify would cost about 125 million guests or you know 12 000 so smaller but we're still not there yet and so now we start asking questions you know where do we go uh is do we really want to use a transparent uh snark uh let's go see what this plonk is all about that everybody's using so you know clock's very popular it's got a ton of support proofs are small verification is the cost is known and really what we'll see really importantly is uh plunk is supported the verifier is supported by uh pre-compose in ethereum so all of the the heavy arithmetic is cheap so we dig into Planck uh fortunately like I said Planck is so popular there's a lot of high quality open source implementations there's a lot of high quality uh blog posts describing Planck and we see you know the famous small verify compute small proof size uh the problem with pumpkin this is a known problem too and this is why everybody is trying to make this prover efficient and trying to optimize circuits is this prover time improver memory is expensive so Planck needs to run ffts ffts require you know n log n work and they are also not space friendly and so if we try to prove just a raw two eight a two to the 28 size instance we're looking at you know that that's 500 minutes so we're looking at like about eight hours and you need about three ten three terabytes of memory on your machine to be able to complete the proof of this size uh you could do it you could you know go to the cloud uh rent a gcp instance and you can get it done for about 200 um but you're not gonna be able to prove this out of the box all right so now we start asking our questions uh We've we started getting introspective we've surveyed we've surveyed some snarks we've flip-flopped between transparent snarks to to trusted set up snarks uh what are the important questions here so one thing that really popped up is why is Planck's verifier so much cheaper than say dory's verifier and so if we just look at the algorithms that are being used Planck's verifier requires pairings pairings require GT exponentiation so a pairing should be more expensive than a DT exponentiation and if we actually do the math it's uh in dory's PC should cost only about 16 times the uh what plant costs and so that's uh that seems like a reasonable trade-off that somebody would be willing to make even if they don't have to uh run a trusted setup and so the the reality is as we saw the cost is about 500 times uh Planck uh verifier and so really it's this pairing check uh EIP and so one of the one of the big points that we're trying to take away here is we've seen that there are kind of cost competitive transparent Primitives in particular there are interesting polynomial commitment schemes these Copa schemes Dory schemes uh that could be useful but we're not going to build a room we'll never be able to run on ethereum mainnet because things are too expensive because they're not supported by say pre-compiles um and so one of the questions and this is kind of just like a a thought question right is ethereum ecosystem artificially selecting for snark Primitives with costly don't reflect reality we say ethereum is driving snark research uh and it is and we're seeing like a flurry of development especially for Primitives like Planck uh but is I mean the reason is it's cheap to verify and so the question is you know that costs aren't uh reflecting reality we want to address this question uh if there are other people who've kind of run into some other things like come talk to us we have ideas of how to address this um yeah with the last minute where do we go next right so we've gone all over the place uh We've surveyed a bunch of snarks actually there's a ton of snarks in practice right and we look at all of these this is this is this was our path but you know there's a whole bunch of places we can go uh the other point here is snarks generally we think of them as proving kind of arbitrary programs NP complete or NP uh NP statements that power as a cost there are other proving systems that have cheaper costs uh signatures are one such proving system so we sell away from the land of starks to the land of homomorphic signatures and so what a homomorphic signature does is it basically allows you to assign data and then if you like sign two messages you can add those two messages together and the result is a side uh message for the sum of the two underlying messages so it's a pretty cool primitive uh I haven't really seen it used much in practice but we have a unique application here on blockchain uh and so we could take advantage of that and run you know this this reference scheme uh and basically the the bottom line is we get small proofs small verify time similar to Planck uh these costs are about the same cost of aggregating just regular Bill signatures so elliptic curve arithmetic and we can get something done for you know less than 30 dollars quote I like it's worth thinking about um again this is we are edge of node semiotic labs for core Developers for the graph I'm with semiatric AI we're looking for people who are interested in these types of problems we're also looking for people who are interested in you know AI reinforcement learning all kinds of good stuff we're looking for people if this was interesting Reach Out thank you awesome talk Savvy thank you so much so if you're interested in talking to Savvy please meet him outside of the room uh now we'll have one hour lunch break and in one hour we'll be back with the famous Carl talking about the optimism stack so the uh [Music] my life [Music] to me [Music] everybody [Music]

is optimism's op stack and uh Carl's excited to be here so I'm gonna turn the time right over to him let's hear a round of applause [Applause] all right why hello wow that's so much easier to be loud oh my goodness okay so before we have any slides I'm just going to tell you a little bit about me I'm Carl I'm a contributor to the optimism Collective I'm working at op labs and today we're going to talk about the op stack it is op and the super chain which you will hear once and you will never forget because it is a sticky meme sticky meme now well my slides have arrived just in time like ubereats okay okay this is gonna be a fun talk let me tell you let me tell you so as usual I have a bajillion bajillion slides so in 2018 we set out I use we very liberally we set out to build plasma group plasma group was a non-profit focused on scaling ethereum with layer 2 technology we wanted to unlock tons of applications bajillions of transactions per second and so you know we sailed out on ethereum cyberspace following vitalik's Doctrine following his advice we knew what to build and so we went and in fact we did some cool stuff last Devcon we talked we introduced optimistic roll-up and we introduced the unipig which was like the first implementation and it was pretty sweet if you don't ask if you do ask me so ethereum we did good things good things for ethereum public goods this was open source software it already got forked immediately but guess what happened we could not get funding for it because we were a non-profit and ethereum did not have the public goods funding infrastructure that we needed to support the building that we were doing to for the public good no bueno no bueno at all anyway so we formed optimism and we set out to not only scale ethereum but also fund public goods fund ethereum public goods optimism public goods build the community push the community forward and so that we did not realize it we thought it was going to be like 12 people at the you know doing optimism that was an absolute rabbit hole and so this is a story all about how the op stack was formed and now I'm going to tell you about how the op stack became the super chain and that powered the optimism Collective the social technology which I hope we can use to fund public goods to align people to really make a serious difference and dent in the way that we live our lives in the future millions of people you know and really billions in my humble opinion maybe maybe you know trillions if we go multi-planetary billions of AI really more than that trillions of transactions actually weigh more than trillions that's for sure all of these things promoting humans over capital and impact making impact profitable right we need to be expressing what we want as impact and make that profitable that's public goods funding really at the end of the day so optimism Collective that's why we're here but that is not the story let's go Leroy Jenkins the rough start so this is the whole journey a whole journey rough start right we formed some you know terraformed some land and ethereum cyberspace and you know created our little your little community and built an ethereum Layer Two that was evm compatible and you know it was pretty cool but to be honest it was not easy not at all we had built a roll-up we had built a fault proof but it was complicated it was hard to maintain it was difficult to onboard new people this was not the you know easy sailing that we thought we were gonna do we're like yes we know how to build it now let's put it into production wow this is really hard really hard and so by the grace of ether's Phoenix the god of rationalist retroactivity we happen to be eating dinner and we saw in the back corner of our eye George hotz literally the you know founder of comma AI builder of really really good open source production software and we're like George yo come through and it turns out he knows ethereum make a new ethereum Layer Two is pretty insane so you know George on his little you know Journey kind of stopped by our little island said you know what's up and he looked at our code and I'm not gonna lie he gave us some you know it's a hard pill to swallow he said one he said you have a hundred times the lines of code that you actually need for this two every line of code should be worth at least a hundred dollars that means the cost of maintaining it the cost of people learning it it is expensive to write lines of code even a comment and finally the goal your goal should be to Upstream to ethereum and build software that is so simple that it can be standardized and built on top of that's your goal and so to kind of prove this point it was like okay let me take this compiler that you have that was thousands of lines of code and let me rewrite it and do it right and turn it into 300 lines of code that was the beginning of the formation of our North Star towards Simplicity and standardization and so of course as jiohad does he he left and then chapter two we finally had our North Star and so we could start measuring progress towards it we were going to boil our code down to its Essence we were going to reduce our death diff to less than 1 000 lines of code that was our basically our whole road map at the time and so we went to coding our little gerbil selves you know all these are durables well they're really hamsters because hamsters actually are cuter than gerbils anyway um I'm sorry gerbils okay we started making improvements to our L2 Island right we terraformed the land further it really we like started making real progress simplifying our code it was easier and we became fat gerbils off of our great successes and so we had made some serious progress and in 2021 Q4 we released our evm equivalence upgrade and that thing has served us well we have been evm equivalent for basically a year now and fast as ethereum and it has been nice it was a beefy release it was fantastic but our job was not over we still hadn't finished because Joe hot came back he just popped in and he said all right let me tell you something else well done you got rid of a lot of your code that must have hurt that is hard but your proof system is way too complicated still you're going you're going off the deep end here I can help and so what he did well he contributed Canon just this really simple proof system and why did it why was it so simple well it was because it separated the client software from the proof software from the proof layer you compile the client down to the proof and in fact vitalik at the same time was suggesting the same kind of architecture but George actually took that and created a you know pretty pretty solid version that people have been playing with ever since and that showed us something else that we hadn't thought about before that showed us the power of modularity the fact that he was able to achieve this evm equivalence was because he split it out into two different components and so right evm equivalent fall proof less than 4 000 lines of code the client compiles to the proof and it showed us that power now we had a North star but for our goal of reducing our get diff down to less than a thousand lines now we had a path to achieving it and so we also at the same time happen to be listening to some nice like streaming episodes and this is one of my favorite moments in in like every podcast that I've listened to basically it's just this line is when things are beautifully done usually there's a well thought out set of abstraction layers it has the thinking about the problem space slicing it up and then going at it that mentality it changes the game for software development and architecture so you know he's off again and next up the last Mile right we had just made this 10x line of code reduction we but we still had 5x too many lines of code and get it was crazy and we still had 10x too many overall so what did we do well turns out that we started coding and we noticed that eth2 was coming to the same realizations that we were having as well they realized that they needed to modularize the E2 clients and make them talk to each other via the engine API they realized that the currently it was too tightly coupled too monolithic and so what did they do they took the client software and they split it further into consensus and execution that's why we have these consensus clients and execution clients so well we saw this eth2 consensus we were like huh we could just write a roll-up consensus client and boom slot it in in the same way and now we can reuse all of these other execution clients like Geth like Aragon like Etc there's so many and this gives us that multi-client ecosystem that is absolutely critical for securing a chain which has billions of dollars we need we cannot stop with one client unless you're going to formally prove your client and good luck and anyway formal proofs are like two clients anyway okay point being we finally had our golden ticket to a less than one thousand line of code diff in Geth and so we got to building in 2022 to do terraforming building cool things and boom in our Bedrock release our upcoming Bedrock release we finally have that commit that single commit that turns up you know normal death into op gaff with less than a thousand lines of code so let's you know 8 21 less than a thousand we achieved our goal we got to have a little hamster celebration gerbil celebration we include all rodents in this talk the Bedrock release finally we had created this code in a simple modular way we split up consensus execution and the proofs and we renamed the proofs to settlement because it's more Mimi and boom we had achieved that goal of Simplicity and standards but then something unexpected started happening [Music] I really didn't I did this from memory I have not refreshed the actual sound I just know the dirt sound anyway Rattata okay no we started getting forked literally all over the place it is absolutely mind-boggling right we multiple people set out took our code base forked it set up their own settlements and further it got crazier some were modifying evm we're modifying to evm and the execution layer in Geth and some were modifying the actual roll-up part of it to make it a plasma so that you don't post the data from like all of these forks and I'm not talking about like you know Pet Project Forks I'm talking about like Mega you know you look at l2b you got the little Ops shout out we got some Forks in the room so we had set out we had created the consensus layer execution layer split and then things got crazy guess what next guess what next well if you were at a talk like five hours ago you would know what next someone literally took the code base for like forked it and made a three-day Survival game that is fully on chain literally playing something that is unrecognizable brand new software and and literally every single block like like I just gotta momentarily like we're not talking about like oh yeah you know you get an asset and now you have a nft or something no I'm talking about like you mine a block and that's a transaction or you put something in your inventory that's a transaction that is crazy sauce right stuff we never thought was possible and they're modifying right like we modify the the roll-up to become a plasma for extra uh scalability and modifying the execution layer and wrapping it with mud shout out to Mud making it super fast right and we get to reuse the whole settlement layer code base for that process and next Hannon literally made it a Game Boy like made it prove a Game Boy emulator so that they can then literally play Pokemon and fall prove it literally having a freaking you know Pokemon roll up it doesn't make sense it's like ridiculous what you can really do with this code this guy really is the limit right you have the rust program they turned Canon into rust all of these things because we were Building open source we were building foundational modules that stand alone and are elegantly built so very we got all these new Forks all these new little Islands out in ethereum L2 and then our North Star of Simplicity started bearing fruit great exciting so and thus this begins a new era it creates it was time for Branding because our code base had no name it was just the code base you know it's like that's kind of boring so we're like hey let's turn this let's flip it let's make it cool let's make it fun let's call it the op stack now everyone is using the op stack they're contributing to the op stack to give it back to the stack we're all building on the stack and so just build the stack build open source public goods push the ecosystem forward um so the op stack what is it it's our open source software stack designed to power blockchain ecosystems built for the optimism Collective so that includes that includes of course what we've been talking about this whole time the whole chain software right the decentralized stack required for spinning up chains the consensus layer execution layer more layers to come literally this is just the beginning additionally it also requires a governance layer things that we're building such as the identity layer the retroactive public goods funding all of these things need to be built in a modular way so that they can be reused and all on top of ethereum of course where are we right now come on what's on my shirt now we are in Devcon actually that was a great transition I did not mean to make we are in Devcon in in case you didn't know talking about the op stack and so this is kind of the time that we're just really talking about it and that means that this story is bridging into the future okay now we're in the future gal okay so everyone in this future in our future everyone's future contributing back to the stack right with shared modules this is the lesson I literally came from a talk on you know practical pluralism everyone is able to share base layers share modules that's how Innovation happens in this space and we can all benefit we can literally push the ecosystem forward and so there's lots coming down the pipeline literally so much we have this really nice code base that we're releasing very soon with bedrock it's super hype it's clean it's like the cleanest but there are things that we can make improvements to such as introducing multi-client fault proofs such as introducing multi-client ZK proofs and critically this means that deploying a you know deploying one of these op chains we're calling them it doesn't tie you to a single proof system it doesn't tie you to a single technology you can have a ZK roll up with a seamless upgrade so that no one even has to notice you're just lowering the withdrawal times in the background right these kinds of things happen because you have clean apis where you can separate and plug things in and additionally we got you know plasma consensus for some ZK plasma for super scalable op chains and you know we got a Pokemon execution apparently for ZK Pokemon plasma Bitcoin you know whatever you know the sky's the limit really so everyone can benefit from these shared modules really nice so one person creates a little Greek statue which is of course a great contribution to the op stack and boom now it's an OPI second boom everyone can adopt it no problemo it's great and by the way and retroactive public goods funding right we're not doing this and the whole the whole reason why we got into this thing was because we wanted to contribute back to the open source software the stack that and then make sure that we would get paid even though we were building public goods and so of course you know people got to get paid for their their great Greek statues so with everyone contributing everyone gets paid everyone's happy let's go plasma groups dream is starting to be realized all right well that's not all y'all that's not all because right right now it's like oh there's these little Islands these op chains and they're they're doing their own thing but the reality is we are in this together experimentation cannot should not must not equal fragmentation at the same time as we're experimenting we need to unify we need to bring the user experience the developer experience everything together because it's better right so that means that we're standardizing op-chain security right when you reuse these modules you don't have all these crazy Bridge hacks literally every week because everyone is running the same software bending fitting from the same Lindy effect of that software it's all you know proven formally proven multi-client whatever it is we need to standardize because it makes everyone stronger additionally standardizing off chain tooling we noticed this with the evm equivalence upgrade everyone got to use their tooling from before and standardizing option governance everything from building governance modules to even introducing people into the collective through an identity layer so that we can have democratically run governance all of those things are absolutely critical for people for us to share as a community and and it's important to note that just because you have two different options does not mean that they cannot communicate atomically with one another right you can send a transaction to One op chain and have a flash loan Atomic Swap this is something that is very possible and it is enabled when everyone is running the same software and even shares a sequencing layer so no bridging who bridging bridging is Lane I don't like bridging I like doing things that's not a doing thing that's a doing thing to do a thing anyway very very that's how we design things I mean really it is actually in some sense okay the op stack is not about pushing people apart it's about bringing people together so we can all have a gerbil party together and so talking Drew loud now the final evolution right we're doing all these standards we've got all this composability we're getting to the point where like the software stack is maturing it is this one thing we're all contributing to what does that mean that means that we are starting to form a superstructure not just defined by this or that you know up chain doing this thing this saw you know we're actually bringing people together with the network effects of cooperation to form something that is entirely new and what is that thing well if you remember the beginning of the talk you might start to find out as the islands configure the super chin we're back baby the super chair I told you I was gonna do it that would be weird if I didn't anyway the super chain birthed through the op stack through these standards through the shared compatibility the atomic composition shared sequencer set we start seeing this thing the replacement of the web 2 infrastack with decentralized Alternatives that can power horizontally scalable applications like we're talking about the internet's computation and this is not multi-chain right options are not app chains everyone is a part of the collective we're all part of this network additionally this is not the mono chain right because at the same time as we're all interconnected we're also not you know the same right there is still multiplicity there's still biodiversity and it's horizontally scalable so instead it's all connected by the same Technical and social fabric it is not the multi-chain it's not the model chain tell your friends y'all it's a super chain let's go but wait but wait I just went Ham on some tech let me just real quick bring it back to why we are here because I forget that literally I get so into the tech it's so much fun anyway but we are here because we are forming new technological social institutions we are forming the optimism Collective why we want humans to be valued over Capital we want identity citizens Etc we want impact to be profitable we want to build the optimism Collective and just contextualizing this why now right why is this so critical now it's because we are entering a new era in the internet and as a species period because I'm gonna tell you right now I'm a species in the internet right now my life is crazy so today we are living in a world where profit maximizing corporations they are the ones that are operating our our social public infrastructure right I can't post on the internet without going through a privately owned Corporation also we're literally we are confronted daily with global coordination failures from conflict to biological stuff like it is getting terrifying and we're doing this in this crazy Melting Pot World very misaligned all while we're about to birth a super intelligence that's going to look at our economy and be like oh yeah so you the way that the things that we reward in this system is extraction and you know bad behavior right that this is terrifying to me our future is not guaranteed we need to build this thing this is not not an isolated problem so right unprecedented times require unprecedented social technology the end of the day blockchain is a social technology it what it's what brings us together it's the social problems that we're fixing on the internet today reframing those incentives so that's why we're building the op stack as an open source public good right we're funding public goods retroactively we need to be doing this on a massive scale our social institutions for funding public goods are not adequate and we need to be providing people identities so we measure human utility not just you know shareholder profits so we can maximize impact and give profit to people and that's why we're building the optimism Collective and that's because together we can make impact equal profit and summon ethers Phoenix it's like it's like the it's like the rationalist god that will like give you money for making it come to be and you know you're You're Building public goods and you're you know being a good person anyway it's just like our the pull towards Utopia our better selves ethers Phoenix so that's how right we started out as building out we built out this op stack because we realize that's how we push open source forward we that is going to become the super chain and that will all power the optimism Collective which will align incentives and y'all please come contribute align your incentives with us and stay optimistic and thank you very much all the loves all the hearts I'm out of time [Applause] okay thank you for your energy in Spanish we say optimista hello to everyone I was late story and the next talk is about modular relapse Theory through the lens of the op stock and enjoying for Unchained games the speaker is Kelvin featured and he's building the optimism collectible also it's not work ah there we go there we go all right all right all right you just heard Carl talk um about a lot of high level things my talk is unfortunately that slides don't look like Carl's talk so it's a little bit different um I want to I want to ground this what Carl just talked about in the actual Tech behind the op stack right I want to present to you what the op stack looks like under the hood I want to present to you the theory of how you build modular blockchains right not just oh you know let's make some charts and let's figure it out and and you know somebody will piece these things together I want to give concrete apis and functions that describe the different layers of a system like this so you can really start to wrap your head around how something like the op stack works I'm going to be continuously out of breath because we're like 8 000 feet up in the air it's really hard to talk so here you go modular roll-up Theory through the lens of the op stack AKA you just watched Carl's talk and now you want to understand how this whole modular roll up thing actually works okay all right let's go um we're gonna do drawings we always do silly drawings uh in these talks so here we go uh first I want to give some context so I'm going to be talking about the theory behind modular roll-up architecture stack is a specific software stack that turns this Theory into practice right this is about taking that theory and turning into specific software components that you can then use to build modular chains um and I just don't like talking about Theory alone I think Theory alone is not very useful unless you ground it and so I'm going to be using this stack to keep the talk grounded right I'm going to be using the in the abstractions that we came up with in the op stack to keep things grounded I'm also going to use typescript types to represent things typescript is god tier don't at me here is typescript ascending into heaven because truly greatest language of all time I hope you enjoy it let's go all right so modular rollups 101 which lost the money oh there we go we get it back um give some brief history back in 2020 everyone was building monolithic rollups this is what they looked like Beefcake Roll-Ups really absolutely ripped six-pack abs roll ups it was one giant code base and it was really hard to understand where the separations were and what what a data availability mean um basically all the everything was defined and limited by our proof systems right so we would we would we were like okay what is a roll-up well uh we an optimistic roll-up we have to build this this this fault proof so we're going to build default proof um and then we're going to figure out how to make the system work like the evm inside of a functioning fall proof and and we did that because we had no clue what we were actually doing we had no clue what Roll-Ups really were this was us how do we roll up who knows let's just build something oh yeah that's what we did mental models are really really important if you don't know what you're building you're gonna build it wrong as an aside I think this is funny you know like I've been working on this stuff probably for like five years now and every six months we sit there and we're like ah it actually works completely differently from how we thought it works like the other day Carl and I are sitting there and we're like oh withdrawals are just totally not what we thought withdrawals are so it's crazy it's just interesting I think you know we really don't understand the problems that we're working on it takes a long time for us to build those mental models and so if you don't understand something that's okay because not everybody does nobody really understands what they're working on even when you're working on it and building a whole protocol out of it um then we finally got it so between 2021 2022 we started to really understand Roll-Ups in more detail the first key realization was that proofs should be execute or should be separated from execution we should not allow the structure of the proof to control the behavior of our execution layer and this was you know so here we go you know with the power of mental models I Vanquish the monolithic rollups oh oh Jesus oh they got ripped in half oh no um and so then we got stuff like optimisms evm equivalence upgrade arbitrims Nitro upgrade all the same idea let's separate proofs let's just run the evm as built with minimal modifications to make it work like a roll-up and have the proofs be so General that it doesn't matter what you can what you do on the execution layer you can do whatever you want all right then we also came to realize that we could break out the data availability layer um bra right so uh you know we had got a fork and it added a data availability committee arbitrum releases Nova with the data availability committee this is all a realization that we can also separate data availability right we can we can include a different thing that's not ethereum and these systems can still work with different security properties and so Roll-Ups were coming modular right we start to see this we generally start to see Roll-Ups beginning to break down into three primary layers if you've looked at modular Roll-Ups before because people have been screaming about this for the last year you kind of understand where it's going consensus execution settlement that's the high level idea but that's the high level right isn't that just modular blockchains yeah in a way but really it's about taking the theory of modular blockchains and putting it into practice it's about saying okay let's not just have charts in a blog post that says well if you separate it if you put this it could be this thing and if you put this it could be a validium and whatever but actually saying let's define a software stack makes it possible to put the things together for the average person to not have to build the whole thing from scratch and it was time to make things official so this was modular blockchain design and being put into practice but the beginning was very messy and very haphazard right people were kind of just ripping things out they were kind of just tweaking the execution layer and hoping it worked there wasn't a formality around it so you know what time it is it's formalization time uh you know like Loosely formalized because I never graduated college so I don't know how to do that but we're gonna it's good enough it's good enough all right so here section two now um the section numbers are completely messed up I just never even got around to fixing it but whatever beep boop bias warning I'm going to use the abstractions that we Define in the op sect I think these abstractions are good there are other abstractions out there but I think the OB Stacks abstractions are pretty good so deal with it I'm going to use those um like I said there are three primary layers we got consensus inside of consent this we got two things what we call data availability you've heard of that before derivation you may not have heard of that before then execution then settlement so let's look at consensus let's specifically look at these two sub-components we've got data the data availability layer and we've got the derivation layer right so what is the data availability layer even right let's try to formalize this a little bit well you know it's like the place where we post data right like how does that actually work so let's form let's get slightly more formal um I like to say and I think a good way to think of the data availability layer is it's an ordered list of blobs it's just an array of byte strings right that's the most abstract way that you can think of the data availability layer there are certain properties that you might want out of a data availability layer in practice right you really want this to be a mostly immutable append only list you want this the data to actually be available but that's a that's an implementation detail of the data availability layer itself at the highest level it really just looks like this it's an array of byte streams in the context of ethereum right if we look at this what is that array of byte strings it's pretty straightforward it's just every new block every block is our blob right and every it's this array of blocks that just grows and grows and grows and has pretty good data availability properties and has pretty good immutable prop mutability properties so you can do that you know here's a whatever some code of we're pulling the data from from L1 blocks those are our blobs um same idea in 4844 except you're looking at the 4844 you know data sidecar instead of looking at the primary block got stuff like Celestia and you got like a stack of Post-its like you could do it with a stack of Post-its if it's like a sufficiently good stack of Post-its um all right so array of blobs pretty straightforward generally blobs blocks now let's get into derivation because derivation is what I think to be one of the more interesting layers in this whole system at a high level derivation is taking the data availability layer and it's understanding what that data means and it's parsing it and using that data plus the current state of your layer 2 system it's producing the inputs to your chain right it's producing for example I'll get to it but it can produce transactions you know that's sort of the classic example in our case we use the engine API the op stack uses the engine API why the engine API it's like one of these things we're opinionated on basically we think you know where as as optimism we're building this evm equivalent optimistic roll up the ethereum already standardized the separation between the consensus client and the execution client it didn't really make much sense to come up with a totally new way of driving execution you might as well just reuse the same thing because the apis are there um all right let's go so let's formalize this what does this actually mean I think this has a relatively simple function signature and it kind of looks like this you have this derivation function and it takes the previous state of your roll up or your system it takes the data availability layer and it's either going to produce a payload for you to execute on the on the execution layer or it's going to produce nothing and it might produce nothing if let's say you're a roll-up and there just haven't been any new transactions published to layer one it might just say well I looked at this new block that came in from the data availability layer and there's nothing new to put into the Roll-Ups I'm just going to produce nothing or it could look at a block in the date availability layer or a blob whatever and it could say okay actually here there's a transaction that we need to execute on our layer 2 system so let's make this a little more concrete let's look at derivation in Bedrock we look at data from Three locations the number one piece like the most common place we look for data is sequencer data posted to a specific address on layer one this kind of makes sense we the sequencer collects a bunch of user transactions compresses it shoves it onto layer one and it posts it on to a specific address not a contract interestingly enough you know and it's here's the many it's actually very complicated if you want to derive this and and make it extraordinarily efficient so it's in multiple files here but you could make this much simpler if you really wanted to at the expense of gas costs then we derive data from a second location which is deposits sent to the portal contract which is basically our deposit contract so when there's a deposit event emitted by the portal contract in a block we're going to derive a layer 2 deposit transaction here's how we do that right whatever then the layer one block data itself every time there's a new layer one block we're going to derive a special transaction on layer 2 that carries the information about that layer one block into Layer Two into the layer 2 State here's how we do that whatever the point is that we can transform all of these different sort of data sources into payloads that get executed on Layer Two um and this abstraction is actually really really powerful and I want to kind of hammer this in because if you want to build a roll-up you did which we do what we just talked about right you read sequence transactions read deposit data read block data whatever but that's not the only thing you can do with this you can derive data from almost any piece of information that lives on ethereum or lives on your layer one uh or your data availability layer so I want to just show you a toy example of something that I think is really cool that you can do with this let's say that you had a layer two without user transactions without anything right and the only way that you derive these engine payloads was every time there was a uniswap swap event on layer one you derive a transaction on layer 2 that includes the assets and the amounts right and you feed that transaction into a smart contract on Layer Two that keeps a running tally of the volumes that kind of looks like something like all of a sudden you have this thing this provable thing that is deriving data from layer one and is generating some sort of you know State on Layer Two and it kind of looks like an indexer you can essentially build an entire verifiable indexer as a roll-up are they just Roll-Ups who knows I think secret indexes are kind of just roll ups people just didn't realize it um there's a lot you can do with this you can derive Layer Two payloads from anything on layer one and you can do so much with that all right section 4C it skipped section three this is uh this is whatever section three four um what is the execution layer let's get on to it it is what you think it is the execution is what you think of it is it's the interesting part of the state transition function it's the fun stuff it's where you get to do your crazy crazy applications of course in this system it's also represented as a function in a very abstract way it looks like this you take the previous state of your system you take a payload that was derived by the derivation layer and you're going to transition your state into the next state this is very abstract this is not you know in in this statement it says nothing about the evm it says nothing about the actual State transition function it just says you need a state transition function derivation and execution in this system work together they work together to form something that I call the state transition function Loop the loop is very simple when there's a new element that comes in from the date availability layer so let's say a new block was produced on ethereum we're going to pass that into the derivation function and the derivation function is going to do one of two things either the derivation function looks at that block and it says Ah there's nothing in here there's nothing to put into the layer 2 system there's no payloads to derive you know no transactions were published to the special sequencer address whatever and in that case it's just going to wait for the next element to come from the data availability layer to look for the next thing that it might derive then the other option it has is to return a payload if it returns a payload it's going to pass that payload into the execution function where the state is going to get updated then we're going to go back to the derivation function see if there's anything new to derive and this thing just repeats and repeats and repeats and this is your entire transition function if you want to see that as little drawn out image essentially we have the data availability layer a new blob comes in we derive something is it null then let's just wait for the next thing to come in if it's not null then we're going to derive a payload and then we have to execute that payload see if we derive anything new and it goes in this you know beautiful figure eight for all of time right this is how derivation and execution work together to form the state transition function Loop all right execution in Bedrock let's make this a little more concrete how does this apply to what optimism is doing in optimism it's just the evm we just change the evm we you know mostly it's just dbm um we added a few things that you need to do to make a system roll up compatible the primary diff in our div is the addition of a new transaction type called a deposit transaction type which allows contracts on layer 1 to interact with Layer Two right it's what allows you to perform deposits it's essentially the message passing layer you need this in the evm right now I don't know that we know of a way to do it without adding this diff but it's a very very very small diff um and essentially we're now at less than a thousand lines of code in a segment uh here's the diff like Carl showed and actually 71 of those lines are this uh Circle CI config file so it's 750. uh this gives you a really important thing because it gives you support for multiple clients it means that we can very easily Port our diff to multiple clients and if you don't have multiple clients running a bug in a single client can be catastrophic for your roll up no no matter how good the proofs are because the proofs are just confirming the execution of your clients if the proofs are just confirming the execution of your clients and there's a bug in your client then the proof is going to say go ahead the bug executed correctly and nothing matters so you need client diversity and having this small diff is a critical part of that if you want I don't know if people can scan this ship scan this is the diff or you can go on our GitHub repo op Geth and you can find it's a single commit which makes it extremely easy to rebase onto the latest head state of ethereum of go ethereum makes it super easy to deal with so all right let's continue because I don't have a lot of time left just because we're doing the evm doesn't mean you have to do the evm this approach is really really flexible there's nothing in this that says you have to do the evm you can do whatever you want you can annoy the Maxis and do a Bitcoin you can put a Game Boy inside of a roll-up you can do a python interpreter inside of a roll up as long as you have a state transition function you can put it behind the engine API and the rest of the system will just work publishing transactions to ethereum will just work the pro default proof system will just work everything just works you just switch it out as long as it compiles to mips you're good you're fine so like Carl said the sky's the limit you have so much flexibility with this design and I highly recommend that you mess around with it okay on to the really final part of this talk settlement settlement is you know like kind of the fakest part of all this it's a little hard to understand is it even a real thing and I think yeah you know in a way um this is how I'll Define it you know for the sake of the op's time settlement is a view that another chain has your chain and it's about making claims about the state of your chain to another chain and being able to back those claims up and so if you think about that for a second that means that you can settle to multiple chains at the same time there's nothing about this definition that says you can't settle to ethereum and Bitcoin at the same time there's nothing about this claim that says you can't have multiple settlement layers settlement mechanisms to the same chain right because you could be making claims you could be backing those claims up in different ways essentially it's just about making claims and backing them up um and actually let me get to that in a second well we'll see whatever fine all right so you can make all sorts of claims about a system but the one that you'll find most commonly is making a claim about what we call the state route of the system the state route in ethereum you you kind of if you've played around with ethereum before you're probably familiar with it basically it's just a commitment to everything right the full state of ethereum so similarly generally the easiest thing to do is just to make a a claim about a commitment that commits to everything and then when you make that claim about the commitment that commits to everything else you can just prove against that commitment and now all of a sudden you can do you know pretty much whatever you want um but that doesn't mean that's the only way to do commitments you could do commitments about specific claims on Layer Two like this very specific thing happened on Layer Two um it's just that the most General and generally the easiest thing to do is to make a claim about the state group in order to make a claim about the state route we see we need a function that looks like this it's this validity function this looks very straightforward we have a previous state we have the next state that we're trying to figure out if that next state is valid given the previous state we have the data availability layer we have the derivation function we have the execution function all stuff that we've already talked about and we spit out a Boolean right we spit out something that says is this state transition valid and so the key question of how do you actually make this work in practice right this is this sounds great but how does this work in practice so look at this carefully let's try to figure out where each one of these inputs comes from on chain let's say we're settling to ethereum where does this come from so state is a given the previous state we agree on the previous state generally that's how we want to design these systems we start with a previous state that we agree on and then we have a next state and even if we don't agree on the validity of the next state we generally agree on the fact that this is the thing that we're putting into the function so the first two are Givens the derivation function in the execution function are literally functions right they are pieces of code that run and you could Implement those things on chain the old ovm optimism's old architecture Implement those implemented those things literally on chain so you execute the entire function on chain um generally speaking that's not feasible depending on how complex your system is so we tend to bypass this and instead of implementing the functions on chain we basically Implement something that acts like a proxy of the function and that's usually either fault proofs or validity proofs right these are our proxies for the execution because it's too expensive to actually carry out the execution on chain but you can think about how this fault proof of this validity proof is representing the derivation in their execution functions it is the code of those functions it's just that we execute it in a different way we execute it in a way that is actually feasible to do on chain but the interesting question is how do we access the data availability layer right how do we get access to that data availability layer on the chain that we're settling on of course it's another function if you remember our data availability layer takes the form of this array of blobs so we want a function to access this this data availability layer and kind of an easy way to do this is you have this thing that says get Blob by Index right if it's an array and you have like get Blob by index you can access any element right but there's something really important being formalized in this idea and the important thing is that there's two properties that this function kind of encodes under the hood the first property is that the ability to resolve this function the ability to actually return a blob by a given index is fully dependent on actual availability of data on the data availability layer if the data is not available how are you going to return something out of this function you just can't the second thing is that you have to depend on a mechanism to prove that the blobs are correct because otherwise I can just give you anything right and I can just say oh the database is you know ABC but it was really something completely different so you need a proof mechanism um let's see if we okay let me go to this really quickly go back for a second okay so in ethereum uh you know you know the proof mechanism we'll get to that in a second but for something like let's say Celestia this Celestia's data lives on a chain other than ethereum and so what we need if we want to prove that a given piece of data is correct we need to First carry over commitments to Celestia on ethereum and then we need to prove against those commitments so now we're essentially relying on the not only are we relying on the availability of the data availability layer we're also relying on the correctness of the function essentially the like client that is carrying commitments to Celestia onto ethereum so there's two things that you need to think about when you want to use something like Celestia as your data availability layer all right so let's just look quickly about how Bedrock sort of does this validation in Bedrock we start with the latest block this is the magic right ethereum has this beautiful thing that ethereum from the latest block you can access everything it's beautiful the block hash hidden inside of the latest block hash is all of the information about ethereum for all of time because I can start with the latest block hash and then I can reveal the block and I can reveal the previous block hash and I can reveal the previous block hash for that and I can just go back in time to infinity and I can access every single block in the entire history of ethereum and not just every single block I can pull out every single piece of data in every single piece every single block in ethereum and so what I'm going to do in my validation function is I'm going to start with the latest block and in my is all of this is kind of hidden inside of the the fault proof but my program is going to walk backwards and walk backwards and walk backwards and figure out which blob in the data availability layer in this case ethereum blocks it's going to start the state transition function loop from that's the loop that we just saw and it's going to apply that Loop over and over and over again in the program until you get a final State and you compare that final state to the final state that you pre you know you proposed and all of this happens inside of the Fall proof so none of this computation really happens on chain you just sort of have to you know if you want to challenge it you just have to do a single step but this is the magic of ethereum which is that you can the data is guaranteed to be available and the data is guaranteed to be correct because you're settling and putting data onto the same place all right so bringing a bell back together really quickly um with the multi-headed angel thing going on here there's a lot of content but there's not that many components to something like this remembering the components we got the data availability layer which this is array of bytes right array of blobs we've got the derivation function which takes the previous state and the date availability layer and it's either going to spit out a payload or it's going to spit out nothing you've got the execution function which takes the previous state and it's going to take in a payload generated by the derivation function it's going to produce a new state and you've got this validity function and then inside of this validity function you have this get Blob by Index right so this is all of this composes each one of these different layers is an API that you can plug into so you can take this and you can build your your dream chain right this isn't just Theory this is in optimism's code base in the Bedrock code base you can build whatever you want do you want to build a Bitcoin plasma yeah you can build a Bitcoin plasma you can do it really easily go build a Bitcoin plasma you want to build a bridge that's actually a roll-up and it has multiple data availability layers and multiple settlement layers why not you want to build another paralyzed VM and raise like 200 million dollars from VCS why not you can do that you can build whatever you want you just have to fit the apis right that's what we've we've boiled this all down to a set of apis if you fill the apis you can build it so that's the whole talk uh thank you try to remember life my name is Kelvin I'm building the optimism Collective uh Bedrock specs get in touch thank you build something cool foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music]

the most vulnerable the role UNICEF plays in encouraging the impact Trinity real world use cases open source software and for-profit business models let's welcome to Evelyn Casanova and Shino Connor Shane works at sorry Evelyn works at Unicity office of innovation she's focused on partnership and honored relations to advance and but an advocacy efforts for every child Shane O'Connor is an innovation manager at UNICEF office of innovation exploring how Technologies like blockchain drones virtual and Ultimate Reality AAA and data science can intercept with the needs of billions people just Larry UNICEF impact for children's previously Shane LED technology for development and Innovation effort for Unicef in Sierra Leone before joining UNICEF Shane was CTO tribute and knee and co-founder of mobile Financial Service platform and that's all okay we have to share the mind so let's okay great quite the intro buenos Tardes everybody that's that's all my Spanish now finished um yeah so thanks very much for taking the time to come and hear us speak and hopefully um it'll be an interesting topic for for you all um as mentioned I'm Shane O'Connor and I am working in the office of innovation working for Unicef why is UNICEF here at Devcon what do we have to do um with blockchain with Frontier technology um I'm guessing a lot of people here have heard of Unicef before you know uh that UNICEF is a un organization and we have a mandate to advocate for children's rights um to really try and make sure that they their basic needs are met and also to try and um really expand their opportunities so that all children can reach their full potential um UNICEF operates in 190 countries around across the world and is very much a country office up based um organization however we do have an office of innovation and that is where um me and my colleagues are based and and really we're looking at trying to find innovative ways to really help Drive unicef's programming uh to deliver results for children across the world so really looking out at the technologies that are around the world that are outside of un which is important and really trying to make sure that they can be brought to bear for unicef's mandates and also to kind of generally improve the social impact around the world now even within the office of innovation we have another team and that is the ventures team and I'm part of the ventures team and since 2014 uh the UNICEF Venture fund has really looked externally for the expertise that we don't have within UNICEF that maybe doesn't exist within the UN system to see what's out there um in the private sector and see what's out there in the kind of startup ecosystems and we really look to support Frontier Technology Solutions that we believe can benefit children and the world in general you'll see from the slide there where we placed ourselves at the kind of outer edge uh focusing on emerging Technologies and some of the areas that we have done work in drones um uh augmented reality we do some work in Ai and of course today we're here to talk a little bit about the work that we do through the Venture Fund in blockchain and cryptocurrency as well and in fact within the office of innovation back in 2019 um UNICEF launched a crypto fund which is unique within the the UN system and you may have heard a little bit of a discussion about it yesterday and but it allows UNICEF to uh receive um hold and disperse cryptocurrency which we think is really cool it's uh was a first for the United Nations system and it's something that has um is really Innovative in the in the sense of of how the UN works and certainly how UNICEF works and it allowed us to to Really um build digital Solutions digital public goods to be as Equitable as possible and open up the access for these tools for human development with a with a focus on on child outcomes part of the way the Venture fund and the crypto fund operators that we we do thematic technology calls looking for solutions that you know we can fund to support um to support the work that we're trying to do one of those cohorts as we call them was our blockchain cohort and this is bringing us on to our um three panelists here today who are from three amazing companies and I think I can say that we're friends at this stage as well so that's pretty good um the three companies that we're going to hear from today are part of a larger blockchain cohort and you can see some of the results here of the just specifically of the blockchain cohort from uh from a venture fund um uh investment round so without further Ado I don't want to keep talking myself all day and I'm going to introduce our three panelists or rather allow them to introduce themselves and so please Rumi would you introduce yourself on your work thanks Shane um I'm Rumi Singh I'm the co-founder for roomsen our product is called Rahat it's a blockchain based open source cash and voucher assistance platform and we were a company based in Nepal and our solution is really focused on helping humanitarian organizations strengthen their efforts towards greater Financial inclusion and also supporting beneficiaries by promoting Financial Freedom and dignity by even letting them use their feature phones as a digital bank and really helping them get access to the aid that they need the most with that I'll probably pass it to urmia thank you so much thank you Shane and yes I'm Irma I'm the co-founder of Twitter is a web tree plugin for planting trees it helps developers users to plant trees and build a Greener bolt and then on the other side it helps local communities to get supported by planting trees and I have a background in product design I'm from Iran but now I'm a digital Nomad for the last two years I was in Latin America but my Spanish is still very bad so um and um I'm really happy to be a part of Unicef portfolio companies and um yeah that's it I'm gonna talk more about the project later so yeah Jose thanks thank you to you all my name is Jose trachtember I'm the co-founder and CEO of xcapit we've built a self-custodial wallet First Mobile in which we bring Financial inclusion by developing an end-to-end solution mainly we focused on Latin America and the Emerging Markets nowadays we have developed one of rams we have gamified education we we carry really really much about education we we see that over there that's the starting point so as to bring more people on board and always have it in mind and having the purpose of transforming finances into an engine for human well-being and we started from scratch and now we are here so really proud really excited and really grateful about sharing this panel great thank you um yeah so you know we at UNICEF feel so lucky to have been able to work with these guys with their products and um you can hear as they describe they they're all different products but they all focus on different areas that can really support unicef's broader programming so UNICEF Works particularly in health education protection and even social social policy for for children around the world with host governments and each of these products and each of these companies have have have something to add to UNICEF specifically under each yeah well in some of those programmatic areas um so what I'd like to maybe do now for the audience is if we could just get a little bit of from each of you from your own perspective of your story of how you came to join unicef's Venture fund how you you know heard about it why why did why did this journey begin and I'll start with Rumi first as well if that's okay sure um so I'm from Nepal and for those of you who don't know Nepal is on the other side of the gloves and it had a 33 hour journey and but anyway so I'm still just lag um so Nepal is highly susceptible to natural disasters so earthquakes and we're just dealing with uh Monsoon floodings last week and um and and it's all of these situations are really more intensified because a huge number of the population live in extreme poverty so um getting Aid on timely Aid efficiently becomes very very critical and but the the Aid distribution processes are usually very inefficient when it comes to speed cost and you know they're usually very opaque and that truly um builds in challenges of potential fraud and mismanagement and um and and and financial Financial inclusion part as well because you know globally we have over 1.7 billion who are unbanked and um getting to them becomes very very challenging so um when we started our solution Rahat um we were exploring how we can use blockchain as a solution to really building efficiencies um really um looking at how we can include or create a program or create a process Aid distribution processes that are more inclusive and in and applying the opportunity to apply to the Venture fund could not have come at a better timing for us because we really needed that push to build a um a robust product and also build a very strong business model so um and then on and not to mention crypto is illegal in Nepal so it just makes the whole process very very difficult for us and the the adoption or getting the authority authorities to understand you know what blockchain technology is what's crypto is and we're working within the realm of the regulations it's very tough so this definitely looked as as an opportunity for us to get that foundational credibility to have an organization like the UNICEF Venture fund support a blockchain solution in a country like Nepal where it's um you know it's it's it's it's illegal I mean crypto is illegal so we really want wanted to get or try and apply for that opportunity so I'm glad that we made it it was very intense process and we've we've already started seeing a lot of um uh you know support and a lot of credibility because of the Venture fund support thank you thank you Amia do you want to tell a little bit about your story of coming into the Venture fund coming to UNICEF show so when it has started I was in Iran and also it was a bit after I had to start a treasure as a global project but just in apprentices I would mention something that as an Iranian it's hard to start an impactful project on a global scale because if you want to build I don't know even a charity website something like that if you want to list it on um Apple Store I don't know Apple app store Google Play Store or something like that is impossible because Iran is under sanctions so the story of treasure is both a bit personal for me and also about I mean I mean when I was thinking about how I can make an inclusive um impact project for local communities around the world in Latin America in Africa in Middle East to get rewarded get incentivized to plan the forests and protect them it was not possible like even if I wanted to do it so um it was like basically with ethereum that it always started it was how I actually got into ethereum because I found it very interesting about how it can be inclusive like unlike many of the other Technologies um um but yeah regarding the UNICEF um cohort I was in Iran although I was in the process of going out from Iran at that time I learned about UNICEF and the way they support impact projects it's an equity free investment next to many many more important benefits that brings for your project the mentorships the network all the support and um it was like that it was a um yeah it was an intensive process but we finished that um and we are happy that we are part of it right now and now that we are graduated from the UNICEF cohort now that I looked back we learned a lot like we we became I mean in a standard open source project by all those mentorships that we had we became a certified digital public goods and one thing I really liked about UNICEF was that like the reason I didn't want it like when I had the opportunity and I wanted to raise money in the very beginning I felt like at that time many of the VCS I mean refi and regenerative Finance had not start it was not so trending at that time many of the VCS I felt like are more into money uh than impact so that's why I tried to not go towards the VC although I knew some of them probably we're not like that I didn't want to waste my time at that time so I learned about UNICEF their values were aligned with treasure we could keep treasure product more aligned with our initial vision for a longer time and that's why we went to UNICEF and applied for that and we are happy for that and now that I look back like it was awesome thank you that's great well we're very happy that you're a part of it as well um so maybe Jose you can briefly tell us a little bit about excavat's Journey to the Venture yes it has to do mainly I have to say that I was born in Argentina actually we suffered from all the pains and troubles that Financial access not offer in the region we suffer in in first person how inflation evaluation governmental issues restrictions impact on the whole population and also having in mind that the almost 65 percent of population don't have access to financial products and services that that was always on our minds we knew that we we had to do something that's when first of all blockchain came to us and the possibility to bring a global and impactful solution came by we loved the idea of the centralization the idea of bringing accesses like the the common breach of everything we do and I think that even the cohort brings access that's a powerful word in the places where access is banned or restricted so enabling people means giving possibilities to reach whatever they want to do and reach their personal objectives that come by with some tools Financial tools are powerful in terms of reaching what you personally want to do and and the intersection uh with that purpose and having the chance to apply to the Venture fund and also getting to know that was a crypto fund uh just uh a small comment we didn't know that UNICEF was investing in crypto and I think that it's important to to remark that the thesis of the fund was investing on those startups that could break intergenerational cycles of poverty that was meaningful for us that was powerful and we wanted to honor uh with our job that objective and I totally agree with you guys that uh it helped us the whole process helped us first of all focus in on impact having metrics on impact measuring what we were doing not only digitally but also on the ground we received so much support from mentors the the networking Force unbelievable and they keep us supporting what we aim to do because all in all we know that we are really aligned in terms of bringing a valuable solution that could change the status quo in the region so I think that that way we came by and we are so happy to have fulfilled the whole process this is great we're also happy um thank you very much guys uh that's a good little uh synopsis of like how you all came into the Venture fund and to be some of our cohort companies and so I think we're here in a little bit you're talking about The credibility of working with UNICEF the equity free investment which is not an unimportant thing um but I think it's important to maybe reflect a little bit on some of the on you all touched on a little bit um on some of the kind of other support that you got while going through the kind of year um within the Venture fund so maybe I could ask roomie to speak again a little bit about the mentorship that you went through and what that meant and what kind of benefit that was to you guys I'm sure so we made a lot of progress last year in terms of also you know overcoming a lot of barriers and learning a lot of different things for the company to uh get better and um in addition to the investment that Jose mentioned which is extremely extremely important and helpful for us the mentorship that we got was was instrumental um we had I think it was sort of like a two-fold I would say like we we got a lot of technical assistance and we had I'm using the word access I know Jose used it in a very different context but for us like access to the different resources that we got through uni staff was amazing and I think um coming from an emerging market like I don't think we would have gotten that access to the amazing resources like the ethereum foundation and all of the other uh folks in addition to the mentors that you guys got us connected to was huge for us coming from a small country and getting that visibility and that access to Resource was very very important for us and for the twofold the second piece in addition to the technical assistance was also the mentorship on you know the business model and how we can make a a greater or a a stronger business model for the to for us to sustain and then again back to the impact metrics because we're also a company really focused on impact and the impact mentorship was also very key for us to really understand like how do we position ourselves and how do we look at the impact metrics and how could we try to find follow-on impact uh Investments so I think that was very very um helpful for us and um you know the open source piece in the digital public good leg we were very new to that process and the UNICEF team literally really held our hands to walk us through that path and and now we're a proud registered DPG solution so that has also been very very amazing for us so thank you Chris um yeah like there's a lot of mentorship that goes on I hope that there's also like support as well you know the mentorship is almost like the technical um you know guidance I suppose but I hope that there's there's some support because I want to kind of pivot over to my next question for Amia which is really about some of the challenges that you face and like so you get technical mentorship but tell us a little bit about some of the challenges that you faced as you try to you know bring about this product for impact in the real world so there was a lot of challenges because especially when you connect the smart contracts to the real world is a totally different story if you are building um I don't know decentralized exchange or something like that it's like in a closed loop you're still in ethereum you are just communicating with other smart contracts even I don't know if it's a landing protocol exchange or whatever usually the data is like um that you need for those smart contracts on the blockchain but when you're building something like treasure you are coming you're connecting with uh you're interacting with uh the smart contracts interacting with real humans like they need to provide data um so one side is the technical limitations and some of the shortcomings of the blockchain technology that we have like civil attacks like um um many things that I mean the problem of oracles these things exist and for many of them there is no uh big solution so far even right now so that was one side of the challenges that we had the other side was actually like the challenges that you know are there when you want to introduce a high-tech solution to a community that didn't know about it local communities in rural areas and they don't need to know about it you don't you shouldn't force them to know about like blockchain and it's even better not to mention that they're using blockchain because it makes it complicated so many new questions so what we try to do on this side was to make it so easy for them to use the project so just to have a recap of the project we connect donors to local communities who do conservation work protect forests the protocol gives a proof of impact impact in the form of nft to the donor and on the other side the money goes to the protocol and is managed in a similar way to an escrow system whenever they provide updates from the forest from the trees a portion of the money is unlocked and goes to their non-custodial value to wherever they are and um that's how Toyota Portugal works the version one of the protocol of course we are doing a lot of more things so to do this um I mean to get the rewards for conservation I mean um we try to make it um similar experience to their web 2 experience like like having a WhatsApp Instagram application on their mobile so we built an application um which has integrated some seed phraseless valid non-custodial valids they don't have seed phrases they don't need to know about the complex nature of valids in blockchain so they use their email but it's not custodial we use web3odes for that at the same time you sponsor all their transactions on the supply side for local communities we use stable coins instead of volatile assets like ethereum Bitcoin so they get their conservation rewards in Dai and many many other works like I many of them I forget but this was actually one of the most challenging parts of our job to um make it like because it's actually important like we had to take one of the things that we learned is that um some of our early local communities that were using a buggy and both complicated profile left actually the movements the project because it was too complicated for them and the more we try to make it better for them user friendly the easier it was for them to stay in the project and of course with UNICEF we got a lot of mentorship like referring to the impact mentorship in the case of Teresa it's not only about planting trees because we onboard the local communities are who are less privileged who have less access to um actually the typical opportunities in climate Finance so it's about social impact as well that's why we actually um have that kind of social impact project as well and the impact mentorships have helped us uh quantify measure those impact so we learn uh what we're doing like um in a better way and of course the open source like this is one of the best things that you can get out of this um um investment because you think you are open source but you are not like a open source friendly project so lots of documentation contribution guidelines um many many things like I think it was awesome like that that part like now we feel confident about like being a good open source project even if the project fails the resources everything out there in a good ways for the future Builders to use yeah that's it great um lots of challenges um congratulations on getting through all those challenges and and really thanks very much for putting out such an amazing product of benefits for for everyone with the conservation that it supports um that that kind of like something that benefits people all around the world even if it's done in local communities makes me think of equity which is one of you know the key lenses that UNICEF UNICEF is an equity-based organization everything we think about we use equity as a kind of a lens for that and and one of the ways that we think about digital products and how we make them Equitable is digital public goods which is my next next question which is for you Jose um first of all sorry I should say congratulations to each of you for becoming a certified digital public good which is very impressive and challenging to to get done um but Jose would you tell us a little bit about xcapits and your journey to becoming a certified DPG um how did UNICEF support you um in that process I mean I know it's somewhat through the mentorship but um what kind of benefit then like after you talk a little bit about the process what benefit do you see and I know armia mentioned a little bit some of the benefits of dpgs what benefits do you see from your perspective and even talk a little bit about maybe you know being a for-profit business with an open Digital public goods okay that's a whole question yeah so I will try to to wrap up everything or I will try not to forget part of it uh but the starting point for was uh thinking about building a digital public good that could achieve the sustainable goals from new and so from starting point I think that having onboard all of the support of Unicef Innovation fund had to do first of all about thinking on the impact thinking about the resources thinking about leaving something that could be scalable that could be secure that could be useful for some other products just to use so first of all I would say that becoming an open source project has to do with developing a layer in which other people could build so from that starting point UNICEF was amazing um and having the impact in in the main objectives of building a digital product has to do with uh first of all measuring it theory of change was one of the mentorships and it's amazing how you could measure your impact on a region and actually that's that a profitable digital probably good a company that could create lasting and social economic impact and coming from Latin America that's a huge depth of the region so for us was easy to to like have that purpose but still difficult or challenging to build it in a way that could be useful for everybody so uh at last but not least I think that uh every project should be sustainable and should be um profitable in terms of creating value and creating value has much to do not only with revenue or incomes but having these things in mind if you could align your project so as to build it with values and having in front people that have needs and if you could fulfill those needs through through technological Solution that's great and just to mention some objectives of digital probably good we have no poverty gender equality quality education no poverty those are like huge North Stars to have and an invitation that should be done on every entrepreneur that it's building their their Venture it's to to continue tackling those objectives uh it's a huge rock that we need to defeat it's not one or two companies who will make it come true it's and that this has to do with web3 too web3 with web3 it's a matter of community and this is so loud loud voice in and in an ecosystem as web3 that first of all makes me proud to be part of it makes me wanna collaborate with other projects that are tackling the same problems and joining forces I'm sure about that uh it will be more fulfillable than going just by my own so uh just uh in a rough sense of this I think that that's what uh left us to become a digital probably good it's great um and I I like that you brought out the aspect of community as well as soon as we're here like Devcon and there's a very strong kind of feeling of community around the like the technology but also like the the problems that some people are are looking to solve and and for for us as UNICEF and for me like it's it's exciting and it's inspiring and energizing to get that feel of community and hopefully being able to like get people to come and join us in our in our journey and in our work but yeah that's that's that's great thank you very much um I think we'll maybe try and talk a little bit about so we've talked about the DPG process the process of um you know joining the Venture fund your your journey with the Venture fund um I'd like to talk a little bit more about real world now it's it was part of the uh the title so taking you've gone through you've joined the Venture fund you've accepted you've gone through mentored now maybe I'll ask roomie to tell us a little bit about um the opportunity for piloting the actual product that you gain with with UNICEF can you tell us a little bit about the the real application now that we've gone through the process we are currently in the midst of piloting our solution Rahat with the country office the UNICEF country office in Nepal we are working on um uh with 1500 households for an unconditional cash transfer of about I think 150 000 through the country office and the Innovation fund and uh with that pilot um we are really looking at um building or bringing in or bringing in some learning insights about the impact of how a blockchain-powered solution can bring in efficiencies in the cash transfer project so um how for example real-time monitoring could help um the country office understand or understand how the cache is being transferred understand the flow of funds and get verifiable transactions so um so we're really looking at working not just with the country office like but along um site with the local authorities and the government bodies there so we're bringing them along for this particular pilot and getting them on boarded or getting them to understand the process and really as hermia had said like really not talking to them about what blockchain technology is but really getting them and showing them the benefit of how they can use a system like this and get Aid to the ones who need it the most efficiently like cost effectively and in a very um I think like an auditable way because with all of the financial reconciliation that happens in in these aspects that's a huge uh time and resource sucks so uh we're looking at how the time and resources can be saved through this particular pilot and where we're trying to see if we can take all of the learnings from this particular pilot and replicate it hopefully replicate it in other country offices and globally so taking um Rahat from a local as almost like a local product from Nepal to sort of see how we can globally um amplify it so that's kind of where we're at with the pilot currently and um just as an example right now like you know if you're sort of bringing uh training the the local government bodies and how they can use the dashboard look at some real-time information on how the transactions are coming through and how the data is coming through and sort of see if they can detect anomalies and escalate it immediately and act upon it so um giving them or showing them the value of what some information like that could support them to make a greater impact great thank you um I'm actually really excited as you know I'm very excited about this pilot um I wonder can you have a little reflection on so you mentioned you know asides from your own company you mentioned two other entities you mentioned three actually you mentioned units have country office you mentioned the government and of course the beneficiaries can you maybe just speak a little bit about how uh The Innovation fund facilitated with the UNICEF country office the engagement with with the government because that's that can be be difficult if you're if you don't have that like evidence as yet right um in Nepal all of the cash transfer that we do like we usually have to work with the government so there's definitely the piece of onboarding them to understand for them to understand and be open to it so again the the because again because crypto is illegal getting that or making them to understand the difference and that was definitely a little bit of a hurdle but with the rate concept and the rate understanding with the Innovation fund and the country office we were able to have a number of conversations with the local government and you know in such real world cases at times we're talking about emerging Tech and you know blockchain and then here you are where everything is like paper-based and um you know and the beneficiaries like they don't even have like they only have feature phones that they don't even have phones so just making that leap frogging to that is is very difficult and and then getting even the local government to say okay this is a dashboard or you can get in you can see all of the information so that definitely is a challenge but um we are having these conversations to bringing them along one at a time and the country office is definitely paying uh playing a huge role as being part of uh and joining us in the field as we have these conversations with the local government bodies and with the beneficiaries and really looking at some issues that are on the field where you know where the beneficiaries there's a struggle between okay who's going to get the cash and they're like real world problems beyond the monitoring piece as well great thank you um that's great um I I would actually love to talk more about about this particular topic and I really one thing I want to point out like cash-based transfers is a huge uh programmatic tool to basically get funds get currency get money directly to the beneficiaries which is a I've seen it in action and it's really hugely effective efficient and important and we heard someone speak a little bit about subtraction yesterday in um in the opening ceremonies and I feel I would love to speak more about it but I feel that cash-based transfers and using Technologies to really speed them up and facilitate them kind of speaks to that subtraction so thank you very much and thanks for the great work that you're doing um we have a few minutes left what I'd really like to do now actually or me if I can ask you to be the first one if you could take a couple of minutes to think about what kind of advice you would give to someone out here who's maybe in a startup situation and wants to become working in the impact area or even if you were talking to yourself you know 18 months in the past or two years in the past what kind of advice would you like to give to yourself are to our audience so I would say like one of the most important things that I mean impact projects in we're impact Founders like us need to consider or the challenges that they face is the funding so you are not a typical startup that probably can make money from the early days or even if you can make money or attractions probably are not very similar to the some of the startups that VCS are very interested to like invest in so you have this problem I mean now it's easier because refi has become a trend in crypto and VCS are understanding it and but unfortunately you are now in a beer pocket so you will have hard time to raise uh some money compared to I don't know one year two year ago so you have a number of options based on our experience and takes I mean the best practices that we had in Treasure so UNICEF is of course one of the places that you can go if you have an crazy impact idea and you think probably I mean a crazy impact idea but not very unrealistic you think it works like uh and you have some small Pilots because if you're in the process of application UNICEF doesn't accept only the ideas like there should be some metrics some tractions that proves that this idea um even if now it doesn't I mean um and it's not a charity I mean you need to make a sustainable project so all these together makes it challenging to actually get funding so UNICEF is one place the other place that you have is kidscoin um which you can consider we raised um I would say almost equal to the uh I mean similar to the amount that we raised from UNICEF from git coin I think 85 or 90 000 in different rounds in climate rounds and um there are also of course the I mean the product your product should make money and if I mean we want to make it sustainable that's really important so all in all these helped us to keep treasure in a aligned uh um I mean capture aligned to our vision and now we feel much more uh comfortable to raise money from other VCS and we are doing it now and um that's what I think about I mean the challenges and things that you can do great thank you okay Jose from your experienced position now what advice would you like to impart on on early stage startups wanting to get in to kind of follow the great example that you guys have given I would say impact should be in the roadmap as the essential path um I would say that and I will just share a small mid that I had before we were selected and it was kind of the spirit of the program and we were like working with the work plan with the the plan that we were gonna present for the units of innovation fund and it was like too ambitious and we were asked if we wanted to to change that in order to be fulfillable so as to achieve it and our spirit was let's make the ambitious possible and that had to do with the spirit of what kept us not sleeping what kept us working through the whole journey um what I mean to say it's it's great to to have huge objectives in mind a huge purpose not only could help in your region it starts by helping you and your team we we never had uh such an amazing team such an aligned team since we we didn't add that purpose so clear so so so focus on reaching that so I strongly recommend if if that's possible uh for the ones who are trying to to follow that path of impact and and becoming uh a startup that could create some change in your region have a great dream afterwards have a great purpose share it with valuable people and count on the support of like UNICEF in this case that will make this harder at first because it's challenging but afterwards uh it start paying and will continue to pay Time After Time great that sounds like good advice uh Rumi you give me your advice in one minute please yes um I just wanted to get done um I just took Jose's point about they make it harder in the beginning because when we applied and we had done we had to do this full-fledged work plan and as soon as I submitted I just looked back at my team and I was like I'm not I don't know if we're getting this investment but I think we're set we have a whole road map and a plan and a purpose and a focus all set so I think that is key to have that process in tight and uh I think I completely agree with Jose about that can really set the stage and how the team work in the team is set to do that as well so I think that's definitely definitely very very helpful I think the one last thing that I would add is um I felt like for us the non-tech challenges have also been very very high and I think it's very important to design for you know like non-utopian conditions so we are looking at the real world problems and not just working in bubbles so I think that's very very important so I'll pause it that perfect thank you very much guys can I ask you for a round of applause for our three great companies and thank you so much for the great work now how can you guys how can you join us all the all the impact startups are out there I hope you've been inspired by hearing the great work from our three panelists here um please if you are in the same position that these guys were 18 months two years ago please if you have something that you think can help apply to the UNICEF Venture funds and you will be brought through that difficult but rewarding Journey um we're also looking for people to partner with us um and you could also um if you have spare time spare expertise you could join the um the mentoring process that we have for the next round of venture fund companies and finally the last 15 seconds I'll say if you have a little bit of spare eth or some spare money you can certainly contribute to our fund as well and you can be guaranteed that it will go towards um impactful projects like what we have up here on stage I have two seconds left so thank you very much everybody I hope you've enjoyed the panel if you have any questions for us please come up and be happy to speak to you outside or later thank you [Applause] well thank you um the next panel the title is the influence of crypto regulation and open blockchains opportunities and challenges and we have three speakers Florian glass trained as a lawyer and software developer with many years of experience working full-time in the blockchain space Florian is aware of the key issues in the intersection of crypto assets and regulations has co-found and lead the German blockchain associations has president for its first four years he advised political decision makers at the German and European level of blockchain Regulation Marina is the co-founder of aoec we changed to propel UA regulation to become deffy friendly since 20 2017 Marina has been advising crypto projects on governance and legal mothers with focus on decentralization sorry please if you wanna any question to the speakers uh you can talk outside of the room sorry okay Define it she previously lit the advisory team of blockchain as laredoco founded co-found.it and confound a crow investment platform and Simon Paul wrote educating on crypto and public blockchain since 20 050. um well welcome um please give it up to the speakers [Applause] so thank you everyone for joining our talk my name is Marina and together with Simone and Florian we're going to talk about the crypto regulation and its uh influence on the open blockchains so what we see today it's an increased activity of crypto regulation all around the world okay sorry we'll just wait for two minutes because the counter then starts so what I will talk today is basically on the um increased regulatory activities from all over the world we are coming from Europe and we're trying to talk about the trends that happen all around the world but basically what we're expert is in the European law and why this is interesting is because last week we had some new laws being finalized in Europe and they are I would say the beginning of what's happening globally so um as sir of course so um Florence Simone and I started the European Crypt initiative which is a non-profit based in Brussels exactly two years ago when the first crypto assets uh draft for marketing grouped assets regulation has been issued so basically this has been leaked and we have seen it online and we said we should do something about it so immediately in the next week we basically started talking to The Regulators about this topic um okay sorry there's no presentation but I'm going to go uh on without it so basically what we are doing is talking to the regulators and trying to explain what is happening in the crypto area and trying to educate them on what we're doing and what blockchain is so what happens in generally in the last two years specifically is that there has been an increased regulatory activity from Regulators all over the world and what is very important is that this activity is coordinated so it is happening in Europe it's happening in the U.S but what is also very very important is that it's happening on the international level on International organizations so basically organizations like farev ayosco and some other organizations are very actively looking into crypto and also very actively looking into D5 specifically in the next I would say one and two or two years we will see reports from all of those organizations being published and this will be a big influence not only in the world where we're coming from Saudi European Union but basically it is going to be a big influence also in Colombia in South America Asia and all over the world what it is important is that many times those Regulators they are very well intended and we are talking to a lot of them they are interested to learn more but the problem is that they don't have that much time so of course we have like an hour one hour talk with them and we need to be very precise on what we are discussing in this really short amount of time and the problem is that many times because they don't have this I would say knowledge or at least opportunity to learn more the outcome of this regulation is even more negative that they wanted to at the beginning and so I think that educating Regulators talking to them and even educating about crypto in general is very very important so besides what's happening uh I would say on the international level we have seen also a lot of bad news happening in the last year and this is not helping The Regulators are seeing and mostly reading news that are negative and this is then reflected in regulation we have seen in the markets in crypto assets draft edit a new article specifically talking and specifically being I would say a consequence of what happened with Terra Luna and we also can see this in the stablecoin bill that is written in the SEC so in a way it's also important of what is the image that the whole crypto Community projects in the world but also in the specifically for The Regulators so why this time right now is so important for all of us to talk about regulation is basically because we know that crypto exists for more than a decade but at the beginning it was really seen more as a toy for geeks I would say and it was not seen as something that would be problematic for the financial system which is right now so in from 2020 or for the last I would say couple of years there is an increased concern from the regulator of what crypto is possible we have seen a lot of scams we have seen D5 being developed but also the increased usage of nfts and this is what is also concerning from The Regulators especially when it comes to consumer protection and so what we need to do in the future is think about really new options and New Alternatives and how to have an even more increased dialogue with The Regulators because the all the development that happened in the last years will most probably not be just copy pasted in the future because of specific limitations that we will we will see coming from the regulatory word so I'll just come up to date so this is what I was talking about an increased activity from The Regulators in the last few years as I said last week we have seen markets in crypto assets regulation and the transfer of funds regulation being finalized in Europe and what does this mean for this community what does this mean for the people that are building applications and they're building protocols for the people that are also using these applications and protocols and I will only give you a few examples that are I would say quite important and again those are European examples but it's in a way only the start because the markets in crypto assets regulation is the first worldwide overarching regulation for crypto so if you are a crypto asset service providers for example is an exchange or a wallet you will need to be incorporated in Europe and you will need to get a license from a European National competent Authority what is important is that you're also going to be need to be compliant with anti-money laundering rules if you are not you will not be able to issue or to offer services to the European Union which means that the European user is only going to have the opportunity to use services that are regulated and compliant are their marketing crypto assets regulation also an interesting part is the crypto asset issuance so if an entity wants to issue crypto Assets in Europe and offer it to the crypto asset to the European users you will need to be incorporated again in the European Union but at the same time also write a white paper very similarly to like a very short um very similar to an IPO and in this white paper there are a lot of rules around marketing but also there needs to be a report on the energy consumption of this specific crypto asset and the blockchain that it uses this is going to have a very important effect on the listing of different crypto assets so again the crypto assets that are not going to be compliant they will not be able to list it on exchanges they're offering their services in the European Union and let me come to the most critical part of the markets in crypto assets regulation so this regulation was basically written because of DM and so the aim is to regulate stable coins there is a big part in the regulation that regulates stable coins and this is I would say the most critical part there is a cap of 200 million transactions per day in the European Union that needs to be observed by the issue of the stablecoin but also by the regulator so there are obligations like reporting obligations that the crypto issue stablecoin issue needs to send quarterly to the regulator which means that they need to send all the information of the number of transactions the users Etc and if those limitations are not met the the basically it's not possible to operate in Europe anymore the license that this stablecoin issues would have they will lose it at that moment and there's another part the marketing computer assets regulation even talks about the stopping of issuance of stable coins from those stable coin issuers this is I would say quite critical and we're going to see how it will work in practice but the markets in crypto assets regulation is public so you can read it online and then form your own opinions the last part from my side is the non-fungible tokens door those are excluded from the regulation but only the ones that are unique and usually linked to an art and also issued in a very small collections so that's all for me I give the mic to Florian thank you thank you Marina oopsie bringer of bad news Okay um whether I click here okay perfect yeah so let's talk about the positive sides of this regulation because it's not just bad I mean that was pretty bad I agree but um not everything is that awful so the scope of Mika of this Market in crypto air regulation is limited in a sense to centralized uh applications of crypto technology meaning that decentralized Finance nfts are officially not in that scope yet so we expect in a sense a me card to regulation to sort of follow up in I don't know a few years and that's something we'll address later self-custodial wallets survived a pretty pretty hard harsh attack from the European Parliament we were afraid for a few weeks like most of you probably that they may be banned so good news Europe still accepts self considered wallets going forward proof of work also survived so there was a real chance that proof of work assets would be flat out illegal in Europe that also was this year and I think they got away with a slap on the wrist so proof of work assets have been labeled as unsustainable but there are no consequences yet tied to it but the foundation has been laid for a potential ban later on or very negative tax implications for holding them those kinds of things the result is in a sense sort of a white elephant so it's not as bad because it's sort of scoped to only regulate centralized applications not the decentralized ones however it's really framing everything in the terms of the status quo and in terms of financial assets so Europe does not yet really recognize on the legislative level that crypto is more than just money um and you know what we just celebrated as wins are really just temporary exclusions for The Regulators um the long-term impacts that we see of the regulation in Europe that has been passed now and that is you know following um is definitely um going to be looking at that it's going to be looking at defined nfts much more it's already on the radar of regulators data they're writing reports on this in the European commission and the Parliament and um a big big question there is what is actually decentralization is this a real thing can we actually observe this in the real world can we pinpoint Regulators to assist them and say look at that this is true decentralization this is what we mean when we say decentralization is not the same as centralized services the energy crisis in Europe of course is real everybody knows that and so we expect you know more sort of restrictions around proof of work um it's probably not going to be a sustainable business or investment uh for Europeans um stable coins continue to be the most controversial and sort of most regulated topic going forward we expect the U.S for example to draft a stable coin bill in the next 12 months and Europe will definitely uh you know continue to be very strict on regulating them funny enough nobody talks about Facebook anymore and their stable coin because they shelf the project now it's just a Terra Luna as being the scapegoat um we've all seen what happened with tornado cash so privacy preserving protocols will be very very um highly regulated going forward so um this is uh definitely still something where we advise everybody to be super super um careful yeah thoughts on the future um right now the legitimacy of the crypto space the perceived legitimacy of the crypto space in the court of public opinion is pretty low it's maybe at its lowest point ever um the incumbents that we challenge with this technology are super active in spreading fat about crypto you can read their reports central banks of course Regulators on the international level like the financial action task force commercial Banks and National Regulators they are all sort of aligned on keeping this technology from reaching Mass market adoption in its current decentralized form and so you know there are two sort of problems we have to address as a community one is the fact that regulation is certain but the other one is that we do not have the support of the public right now we're literally a small Elite that's sort of growing but not fast enough and most people are not inside our bubble and they sort of follow what they read in the news and that's mostly bad so we have to somehow come up with a way as a community to surface the goodness and sort of label the bad stuff as what it is bad so scam tax money laundering paid chills and influences uninformed Investments by the public in things like you know stable coins that are going to explode next week we should sort of not do that and it's I think a collective failure of the whole space that we haven't come up with any effective means um to to do this and um I want to give it to Simon to to take this further thank you thank you thank you so yeah uh what do we do now and the future looks uh uncertain and the global perception of crypto is not ideal and maybe what we thought the crypto would would make as an impact to the world as not yet fully materialized so we are at a very critical moment because as you as we said all The Regulators are looking at us and the results that we are pushing forward and maybe not as wonderful as we want them to be so what we think now is that we have to be a photo proposal like as an industry as a community we have to somehow and we'll have a plan for that um create some form of proposal some form of initiatives that basically go from Trend The Regulators front-friend institutions and explain what we can do what we are doing today in a very positive manner and with actual practical mitigation proposals for all the risks and all the issues that we see today and to do that one of the critical thing is to create some form of consensus inside of the community inside of the industry of what is acceptable and what we can push forward because we definitely don't want to give IDs to The Regulators that would be contrary to the values that we want to defend right so there will be difficult choices to make and there's a lot of potential solutions that we can think about both technological uh or in terms of initiative that the community can make but are they acceptable is this something that we want to push forward and this is an open question that we will discuss later so for as an example um the European commission launched an initiative to study whether it would be meaningful to basically embed the civilians of the blockchain or real-time surveillance of public blockchain in in some form of of a system that would be used by The Regulators to basically be alerted and and act on potential issues happening on the public blockchains do we want that do we do we do we support this kind of initiatives do we regulate interfaces of course this is a very big subject and to another cache sanctions really make in China and this is still an open question uh do we regulate and if so how do we want to circumvent that by creating Shadow interfaces uh is it a long-term solution open question again do we want to Leverage The these in some form like creating identities that would be recognized by institutions in some way do we leverage on the the initiatives of the institutions on the IDS because there are some in Europe specifically um do we basically segment regulated and Degen space it's a potential solution and of course the whole sanction in general is it's it's a very big subject and still uh with a lot of different implications where there's a lot of also of open questions you've all seen the discussions recently about do we need to basically sanction address at the protocol level it's a very uh dangerous question to us but also a very practical one and the the answer has to be has to be given at some point so these are basically solutions that could be moved forward do we want that and basically to decide this we need to decide what are the non-negotiable values of of the the community of the of the industry today it could be a lot of things like uh credible neutrality of the the public networks is that is that the the most important thing that we want to protect is this like the composability like the openness so we want to basically fight every kind of you know kyc um things that could limit this composability uh is this the fight on self-custodian wallets that we have to to prioritize is it privacy preserving systems and it can be all at once it can be all those things but we need to to be sure that where we cross the line and what Solutions we can put forward or not um and for this I think uh it's very critical that we have a very clear Way Forward and there's a few things that can be leveraged to move forward with the with the institutions in general the first thing is that um everything is not Bleak and there's a lot of people um inside of those institutions that know about crypto and that are interested by uh what's going on they are open to suggestions and those people we have identified a lot of them at the EU level but there are some of them at every single um in every single institution worldwide those people we need to help them and we need to feed them with suggestions we need to feed them with actual proposals and so this is the main uh leverage we have um then do we have all the the good Obviously good use cases of crypto that we need to to push forward and to move forward quickly um that we've talked a lot about with defy about this High uh public good fundings uh non-financial use cases of crypto all those things uh together they bring forward a very positive way of doing crypto and this is something we need to work on and of course there's the constant Innovation and Improvement in the space that is already happening and that that we need to leverage so being sure that there's the constant information transmission of information to the regulators and to the institutions um and maybe to do that I would like to end uh with a call for the for Community intervention so basically it's a call to you um in general and all the participants here uh you you came here so you you're basically interested by regulation and sit and and what's happening in in the future you can help I mean all of you can help because we need to there's so many paths open today and there's of course the path of Regulation is bad uh per se and we want to be basically crypto to go dark and and just don't care about the regulation this is a way forward we want to fully Embrace regulation and basically cancel the centralization meaning you know abandon all the all the values that that we are trying to build today we can create new standards we can self-regulate um like creating entities that that bring rules forward that that are followed you know spontaneously by by the protocols when they want to be when they want to be compliant we can you know push to make gasps maybe the crypto assets always provided to get creeper keepers of crypto this is for now more or less the approach of the regulator but do we want to push in this direction um do we want to create a did standard for D5 altogether do you want to create a list for name and shames cameras hackers I don't know there's a lot of things that we can do we have IDs we have proposals of course at euci but we would like you to contribute and to help so please join the conversation we have a telegram we have a Twitter account we have a website and we organize a big event in Lisbon from November 1 to number four feel free if you are in Europe at the time or on or nearby feel free to come and and walk with us on this on these Solutions thank you very much [Applause] I think we have time for a few questions so hello great thank you so much uh it was um very great um I have one question so you've mentioned that nft is now currently exploded from micro regulation but um if we take a look I would just you know browse what European console says we see that European console is aiming to do some assessment within the next 18 months so uh the revocation is coming but it's you know we don't know in which form yet therefore my question was um what in your opinion do you think in what shape or form the regulation on nft would be coming and perhaps if you could just share some insights what would be the best way in your opinion to shape that regulation and nfts thank you thank you so for concretely on the nfts at the moment there is a loose definition of what an nft is in a Marketing Group does its regulation and then every time there's going to be a new insurance the national competent Authority will need to look into and do an analysis if this is really again unique enough and if it's issued in a small collection so it will not be regulated and it is excluded from formica what is coming next and we were just talking to one of the MPS from the European Parliament that is going to lead this effort into regulating nfts and we're also writing some positions on this topic but it is it has started already and there are a lot of thoughts and activities especially in the parliament at the beginning to just start with a general proposal an opinion on this and then I think in the next few years we'll see more activities as everywhere the European Union Works in Cycles in mandates the European commission that usually proposed the regulation will finalize their own mandate very soon in a year so we'll we'll wait for the new commission to have more ideas how to move forward do you think that the European Union is going to be at any time at Dao and I'm here Florian Ah that's a beautiful question um I I do think that the idea of a Dao is uniquely aligned with European values so I for example I think Europe is the continent of cooperatives I don't know if there's continent with more and I think cooperatives but also associations are sort of the old world equivalents of what dials are shaping up to become sort of inclusive Cooperative ways to work together um yeah so is the European Union itself uh fit to become a Dao I don't think yet they are clinging to their hierarchical Design Systems design but I think citizens of Europe are ready for daos and so I do hope that they are going to front run uh the regulator on this one and then potentially you know just I don't know swallow the EU and it I have no idea but yeah I would I would support the EU becoming a doll for sure let's go okay there's another question over there oh many questions maybe a microphone to these gentlemen over there here sorry okay hi my name is Charlie um from a regulatory perspective um if a cryptocurrency exchange goes bankrupt what's the best approach you mean a centralized or a decentralized exchange both okay I don't know for a decentralized one uh for a centralized one there are now regulations in Mika that um you know the um the money custody by users needs to be protected from insolvency right so this is really important um so that so I think Mika as a regulation protects consume interest quite well vis-a-vis centralized business models and crypto asset service providers so in this case Mika really does help right the problem really is where Mika touches upon more decentralized applications and where the rules don't fit the use case anymore so um yeah I think solvency of a centralized Exchange in Europe is regulated now with the Mika regulation I'm not an expert on insolvency law so this is where I will stop giving advice I don't know if Simon has anything more to say on that uh no but I see that the time is is out so I think for the next questions feel free to reach out to us and and we'll be happy to help you thank you everybody thank you very much well thank you to all the speakers if you have any question please uh you can find the speakers out of the room and we you can talk with they thank you check foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] to get a chance to catch me [Music] foreign [Music] thank you okay let's go well the next talk is ethereum gombe the money layer of the internet if people think it's an Heritage trojanis come four ways to change the narrative and the speaker is James back welcome thank you so much okay James Beck is the director of content and communication at consensus where he has spent the last five years telling the story of ethereum to journalists and the individuals around the world prior to consensus change work in public affairs and lead us U.S politicians and journalists on delegation to China to improve in understanding between the two countries James is an enthusiastic member of the queer underground New York City dance scene and also it's a volunteer Street tree Steward in New York City thank you and welcome thank you so much um so that was a nice introduction um do I have a way to flip through slides this thing there you go so a lot of this talk is really setting the stage of 2021 um beyond the bull market that was really the year in which I think web3 ethereum all the things that we've been talking about at the last five devcons really ascended into you know a lot of the popular narratives in pop culture but with all that new attention came you know a widened aperture of critique so first of all one of the things that really brings attention is money unfortunately and that's when we had 2021 was record VC investment so 40 of the 47 web through unicorns were born in 2021 we also had web3 outpacing biotech as a sector which to me is wild considering what we've achieved in web3 so far and similarly a lot of the deals at least in Q4 2021 happened in the United States you see outsized you know deals going to the United States compared to places like Latin America and with a lot of popular uh understanding of web3 came celebrities also changing changing their profile pictures to board Apes um I encourage all of you to see if they have their pfps we also saw a lot of media doing like what is web 3 crypto explainers nft explainers and so in a lot of ways this you know web3 is already part of the popular imagination and similarly Brands started rebranding so you have metaverse become or you have Facebook becoming meta for whatever reason because they think the metaverse is the future you have Radio Shack I don't even know what Radio Shack is doing but if you check out their home page they seem to be a crypto company that is doing swaps and yeah also Square became block and not to blockchain but with any frenzy sentiment turns so um you know there's a couple people I have shown here this is Molly white she had a whole little feature on her in the Washington Post she's a very prolific Wikipedia editor and now has devoted a lot of her time to maintaining this website called web3 is going great which catalogs all the the stuff that we'd rather not have reflected on our industry uh Ben McKenzie he's a pretty washed up uh actor from The Orange County he has also created an entire online Persona around critiquing web 3 and really and really pointing out scams and and critiquing shills of of crypto finally Steven deal I think a lot of people if you spend any time on crypto Twitter have seen him get dragged by the crypto Community but he has you know he has submitted an entire paper to the U.S Congress you know urging them to resist crypto's increasing lobbying efforts in uh in Washington DC um if you want to see I mean there was a crypto policy Symposium last month these are the the sort of Who's Who of people who've really made their entire online Persona being a crypto critic you have Jemima Kelly if any of you work in PR don't respond to her emails at the Ft she's not gonna listen to you in good faith there are people like Jacob Silverman though who's actually he's doing a podcast with Ben McKenzie talking about the latest crypto scams um we have Francis Coppola who's as she describes a banking expert but there are a lot of these people that spend day in day out uh critiquing web 3. and it's to be kind of understood so water and music analyzes music and technology and how they intersect and recently the founder Sherry who has been really focused on music nfts which I think is an interesting way of looking at Pop Culture intersecting with web3 narratives so they released this report last year sort of analyzing all right if you're a big artist and you're doing an nft drop what were the reactions on Twitter they used various Twitter tracking tracking tools to understand sentiment and as you can see there were very few nft drops in late 2020 mostly in the genre of dance and electronic music and then all of a sudden in the second quarter of 2021 you have all these major labels taking their their artists and saying how do we get into this this seems to be a big chance for a cash grab Let's do an nft launch and as you can see perception started shifting but overall you could say most of it was positive sentiment that doesn't explain though then a lot of the artists some artists that I really love all of a sudden deciding to drop their plans for an nft um these are some of the things that she analyzed in the report and some of the things that she noticed so one Twitter has not proven to Be an Effective platform for artists to address fan concerns around nfts especially around environmental and financial concerns and she she says Twitter is not exactly the best platform for nuanced discussion of complex topics also Twitter data ultimately does not provide a complete picture of a Fan's experience with music the fear of adverse Twitter reactions alone can certainly dissuade an artist from experimenting with the technology and we saw a lot of that whether it was Jacob Collier had a pretty exciting nft launch planned dropped it and Niels from who's a Pianist who's German also spoke out vehemently against nfts after he started learning from his community of uh people who were saying he shouldn't do an nft job but you know one of the things she also noticed is that negative sentiment doesn't actually doesn't necessarily affect the financial performance of an nft drop um Charlie XCX ended up getting a lot of blowback from her fans but sold her nft for 20th similarly even if you have an active Community it may not be the best way to sustain Community engagement and Community Building experiences okay so clearly some Brands thought okay we need to confront this nft stigma you have Royal calling nfts limited digital assets finopoly calls them digital Collectibles and Cirque calls them fan passes so already there's an idea that you can shift perception just with a name but I don't think that's all there is to it narrative shape our perceptions narratives and then our perceptions form our realities which end up influencing our choices and actions people hear a good story once and remember it for the rest of their lives so that's why I think narratives are important these are the four tactics I'm going to discuss for the remaining 20 minutes and hopefully have some time for questions these are just tactics and and actually Florian's talk prior to mine set this up pretty nicely because he was kind of describing in the ways in which there's already such a Negative sentiment among mainstream uh regulators and how is that affecting the way in which people understand web 3 in our space so I'm going to go through each of these but first one is we need to better understand Global sentiment around web3 and that happens through polling and brand analysis we also need to celebrate the inspiring stories of web 3. every day there's going to be a hack every day there's going to be a scam they're going to be grifters but there are many stories that are inspiring and I've been going to a ton of talks here and I'm hearing them every day we also need to win over environmentally conscious consumers and companies and finally we need to inspire with knowledge that Sparks action so how do we better understand Global sentiment around web 3 I have to say crypto polling has gotten better but it's really limited there are you know there are a number of mainstream polling companies like morning console that have regular crypto polls uh Gemini actually did a really good one called the global state of port and it surveyed 30 000 people in 20 countries but one of the things that is important is that they were only asking questions around crypto as a digital asset it makes sense Gemini is an exchange people buy and sell eth Bitcoin and other assets they weren't thinking of web 3 Beyond buying and selling and speculating on these as assets um this is another one that actually came out not too long ago from morning console they had a lot of coverage but I'm just focusing on this one seven of the top ten adopter countries have some form of capital control and that's only something they realize through doing this survey and so Nigeria actually leads in cryptocurrency activity with 55 of the of adults responding to the survey saying they buy or sell crypto at least once a month contrast that with the us only 16 percent say they buy or sell and then most of Western Europe fall below the median uh cryptocurrency usage range and then you also have a quote some countries such as turkey and Argentina have expressed or have experienced extremely high inflation in recent recent months which may be encouraging the retail use of buying and selling cryptocurrency but I have to say again morning console is defining usage as buying and selling not using your web 3 wallet like metamask or rainbow connecting to an account buying an nft that's not included in this so again people are only thinking and pulling around buying and selling of cryptocurrencies which to me is only a partial story especially when we talk about web 3. so for that reason we at consensus have actually earlier in Q2 of this year we did a survey of 22 500 adults in 15 countries I just noticed typo but what we wanted to do is actually contrast this with some of the other surveys we've seen out there which are just about buying and selling assets and think about actual web 3 usage the report is going to come out later this year but I've actually highlighted some interesting data so for one we asked do you own a non-fungible token is a pretty simple question and some of the responses you could say yes I own one or several no I don't know what an nft is look at Vietnam it's pretty remarkable in that of the respondents although this this was a survey conducted online so there's a bit of bias in terms of people who have internet access 50 said they own an nft contrast that with Western Europe very few people have an nft or even know what an nft is I think that's pretty telling given that this is a global community and there's a lot more adoption in places that aren't necessarily represented by those early statistics I showed a VC investment similar we saw similar things with Dow awareness and participation Vietnam India Indonesia all are higher than any of the other countries in terms of awareness of what a Dao is and yet at the same time in Vietnam there's so much awareness of what Taos are potentially through Reading and and just general interest in cryptocurrencies but a lot of people aren't involved in any and I think that's a huge gap for us to approach as a community this I don't know if any of you have been following the discourse ahead of Devcon but it was pretty uh discouraging to see some bigger names in crypto critique the ethereum foundation for hosting Devcon and Bogota I think this is actually a perfect place to host future devcons including you know maybe in the future Vietnam maybe we could have something in India or Nigeria and so um I saw Cami write this this article which is really timely it came out a few days uh before we all left and she's like the dead end of Euro Centric crypto and you should read the whole thing it's on mirror hopefully you can see in the top left but some Choice quotes um I believe emerging regions are where the next trailblazing use cases for crypto and blockchain will originate why necessity breeds innovation the financial political and social issues that so-called developing countries experience paired with the maturing blockchain ecosystem will result in an environment ripe for the development of some of the most high impact applications of our time so I think when we go to our next segment how to celebrate the inspiring stories of of web3 I think a lot of the inspiring stories we haven't yet seen yet because I think a lot of the applications and use cases are currently being developed in places I need the most and we can talk about remittance payments we can talk about all the novel applications of Dao's so when I was talking about Molly white earlier this is her website web3 is going great it's a running log that I have to check once a week just because I need to know I need to feel the pain but this is just this week alone you know the ussec is investigating yoga Labs we have mango that that hack happen I believe yesterday and then you know Celsius their their masquerading as defy as C5 and they're yeah they doxed all their customers it's it's really messed up so there's just a Litany of all these stories that come out often and so when you think about web3 and we want to encourage everyone in our industry just to really share the stories of of like utility and action and positive benefits it becomes hard when it's drowned out by all these negative stories and I don't want us to just be these sort of uh people like you know Carl Menger who say Bitcoin fixes this I don't think that's that's where we're going I don't think we should just say a dow would fix this you know a multi-sig would fix this ethereum fixes this instead it's got to be real use cases um uh I'm gonna I got his name wrong but Max yesterday gave a really exciting talk on the ways in which Ukraine has been supported by ethereum donations and cryptocurrency donations in general but if you think about it it came out of necessity the National Bank of Ukraine made it difficult to transfer funds from Ukraine to the EU what is an always-on Network 24 7 Financial access it's cryptocurrency but then already we've seen impact from crypto donations I thought it was fascinating that more than half of all the donations have actually been spent in cryptocurrency so it's not people immediately switching them to Fiat they're staying within crypto and spending um and using it and using crypto and there's been many different estimates but elliptic said around 77 million in crypto donations were given to the Ukraine war effort since uh since the War Began 45 being eth um and you know we talk about refi a lot especially in the git coin Community but one thing that I liked after eath Barcelona was this there was an op-ed in coindesk um from a professor who said ethereum is to act as a laboratory for broader political project or for a broader political project and a site of economic experimentation although Pro markets the aim of web 3 is an explanation but regeneration and a lot of what um you saw at shelling Point were projects around regeneration you could even see in Bitcoin grants 15 all the different environmental projects and I donated to a lot of them but it'll be interesting to keep following up with all these groups and it wasn't just groups in the US it wasn't just groups in Western Europe these are groups all over the world that are using an open funding platform to Source funds and hopefully solve environmental issues either on very local levels or on broader levels like you know turning carbon credits uh on chain people may have forgotten about Constitution doubt but a lot of the ideas around Constitution Dao last November about a year ago have really still like I keep thinking about when are we going to see the next Constitution Dao for something that isn't so frivolous as buying a copy of the Constitution there was a really good write-up in FWB from Drew Miller and Kevin Munger and these are these are people who study social movements and write and they said here was a group of people staking a claim for web 3 as a tool that could be used to build a world with new rules by purchasing rules of the old one Constitution Dow represented a super-sized version of something that the world they created would be extremely good at so what what is web 3 extremely good at Mass mimified mobilization and you could see in how much money was raised just for this really fun activity of buying a copy of the doubt not even knowing what they would do with it after and not even knowing that they could be outbid because all the funding was transparent but think about what we can do when we have that ability to quickly fund across borders not needing to require ACH transfers and actually moving money and and coordination at the speed of the internet um I don't have time to talk about this slide but I've been on the Susu Tanda Hue however you call it uh trained for a long time so if anyone has ideas for uh rotating savings account please talk to me I think there is an easy way to make a pool together that actually is sort of the same Financial tool that people have been using all over the world for hundreds and hundreds of years prior to the prior to Banks and lending um yeah it's an awesome idea and I think it needs to be made at some hackathon sometime so step step three is to win over environmentally conscious consumers we merged to proof of stake that was a big deal um it was I I had been writing about it for a long time I've been off by the date and I said coming soon coming soon um but when we did this survey uh earlier this year we actually hadn't even gotten to the point of proof of stake and now we have a network that's using 99.995 less energy and I say 995 because we actually did a survey or a report with the cryptocarbons rating Institute to actually understand not just um in in theoretical back of the envelope math but by running validators and comparing it with the proof of work ethereum Network and what they actually found was that beyond the energy reduction CO2 emissions are down 99.992 so from 11 million tons annually to 870 which is about 100 U.S homes that's incredible and you know the overall the consensus marketing team said how are we going to get people who are maybe not that interested in ethereum maybe don't know what the merge is to care about this uh environmental fact and so we did this big campaign around the merge we also tried new tactics such as paid media across like earned paid partner and we really I think this is one of the first times as a community overall there was a lot of messaging alignment You Know Carl at the EF started with the 99.95 more Energy Efficiency a country's worth of power no more but what we ended up seeing is that 90 uh what we found is that 90 I think it was I don't have it on this slide but 98 of the articles that ended up covering this were either positive or neutral sentiment we ended up taking out a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal you know Joe and other Talking Heads were on mainstream media and so we had this moment to where the world's attention was on ethereum and we could actually reiterate this environmental message but it shouldn't just stop there um and and I think just to put this in context this is maybe the largest decarbonization event of any industry in history and it really aligns well with what's happening at cope27 there's a lot of Industries trying to figure out how to decarbonize and the ethereum community did it in a decentralized way across hundreds of different companies thousands of actors and so it also shows us that really really complex Global problems like you know the Earth swarming climate can actually be solved in outside of necessarily using governments or Industries um so it was a pretty cool story that we need to keep telling fourth step we need to inspire Inspire knowledge that actually Sparks action and this is about not just using you know cryptocurrency to buy and sell as an investment but thinking about the actual novel use cases that web3 enables everyone and I've heard a lot of talks everyone is talking about how education is a challenge and we have some amazing groups um shifai for example 101.xyz Rabbit Hole there's a lot of people focused on educating people about the web3 app ecosystem and from all the polling we also see that you know globally people are more likely to you know try and use a wallet if they understand what you can do with the wallet um so more than half the respondents in Latin America 51 said educational resources make them more comfortable purchasing cryptocurrency so what we're doing is we're building a learn website for metamask I'm going to give you a little sneak preview but we're really excited about this because in a lot of ways and what we're going to hear Taylor Monahan is giving a talk later sort of about the original sin of needing uh seed phrase and and how challenging that makes it for mainstream adoption um but given that we still need to teach people about where web3 is now and we're going to do so in a way that prioritizes you know simple messaging but isn't talking down to our to our readers we're going to have it available in multiple languages we're hoping actually 10 different languages based on where we're seeing the most metamask usage and that's not places necessarily that you think it does represent some of the places we saw in uh the map earlier such as turkeys such as Vietnam such as Indonesia and we need to meet Learners where they are in their own language and finally we want it based on experiential design so the idea that you're not just reading pages and pages about the theory of web3 you're actually able to test it out without having to download a wallet without having to load it up with eth and actually risk financially what you know maybe you clicking accept for something but it's actually going to give you permissions to drain your wallet or give someone else permissions to drain your wallet so this is an early look at it don't Focus too much on the 3D because the these are all changing but the idea is that we're going to start out very simple this V1 of the site it's going to be a web 3 101 course teaching you what a digital identity is how to keep your secret recovery phrase safe what what a crypto wallet is and then introducing people to Dows D5 nfts and every single lesson is going to have some experiential component where the user actually gets to click through and experience what for example doing a swap on metamask or another site or where you know we're going to have it try to be fun and engaging where you know for example on the nft side you're going to get to use a very simple illustrator and make your own nft and go through that process um again this is a work in progress we're hoping to have this out by the end of November so we look forward to sharing this with with all of you soon um I'm gonna end with a quote if this will switch so um just as kind of a closing thought for a minute for questions there's a tendency to treat technology ethereum as agency that has some essential property rather than as a site for struggle where people are fighting both internally and externally to it so I don't think that there is any inherent indelible principles to ethereum I think that technology is technology it's neutral inevitably it's this community it's all of us here at Devcon it's the people that use and respect our technology that are going to be applying and describing values to it it's a site of struggle crypto can be used to scam people of their money but it can also be used to fund uh recovery efforts in Ukraine crypto can totally be used to sell monkey pictures online but it can also be used as you know a novel way of transferring digital ownership across different metaverse worlds and so it's not there's no fixed State it's always changing and it happens with narratives and so I'd love to talk to any of you if you have ideas and uh thank you so much for having me Devcon [Applause] um I think we have uh one minute for questions if anyone has any any questions yeah there are alfida welcome Fida she's a nft artist from Colombia welcome bearded guy on the back hi hi hello I'm the person if the artist from Colombia so congratulations welcome to my country do you like my country I I love Bogota I can't say I have been anywhere else besides Bogota this is my first time but I have to say it's like anyone who is worried about safety is hasn't been to Texas where there's a shooting every single day thank you for having us [Applause] okay any other questions no we don't have any time well if you have any question please look for the speaker um oh yeah and in the white jacket she's been avidly okay but but quickly please thanks for your talk my question is it appears that the general sentiment for crypto and nfts from Western countries is very positive is very negative but from developing countries it's very positive what do you think are the causes of that Divergence I think that a lot of the nft sales I mean we look at our metamask statistics and a lot of this the marketplaces have been created in the U.S so you talk about Open Sea Foundation inevitably you know there's going to be a wider aperture of critique if you have more people participating in them and also in terms of like pop culture board Apes were really like a lot of people if they think of an nft they think of that or they think of you know you go on Twitter or Instagram and you immediately have thousands of people saying by my nft a lot of bots I'm not sure I think you know I've lived in China I have experience you know on WeChat groups and I think there's just generally a different understanding of what it could be used for in the future you know that's something that deserves further investigation that's a great question um I think why I brought that up though is to say in our efforts to popularize mainstream ethereum applications people should not be overlooking East Asia especially Vietnam India Indonesia um there hasn't been as much nft adoption for example in Japan all right I think we're at times yeah sorry but thank you give it up for back if you have any question to the speaker it was very amazing uh please follow him in on the questions outside the next panel is

hola hola foreign [Music] foreign software okay let's go with the next talk the next talk the name is going on Safari researching users in the metaverse and the speaker is Georgia rakus I it's is it correct racism so difficult for me because I'm Latina uh Georgia is a seasoned user research and has a specialized in the web 3 and crypto space for the last five years she works for tooling wallets defy nfts dials and gaming clients to help to to help them understand their users and build better products and establish the user research Dao a collective of ux research experts dedicate to elevating the quality and quantity of user research being conducted in the web tree space so welcome and please give it up to the speaker thanks for having me if you can hear me okay yeah cool all right I'm Georgia Ackerson I'm a user researcher thank you for the great intro um I'd like to get a quick sense from those in the room who has played in the metaverse as a user oh quite a few okay and it's anyone building in the metaverse here good all right both excellent um so I'm going to share some of the research findings from a recent study that I've conducted into the experiences of early adopters in the metaverse and then what happened afterwards um and just for clarification when I say when I use the word metaverse and I did a quick word count I'm going to use it 61 times in this presentation I'm specifically meaning the web 3 enabled metaverse experiences that exist right now things like the Central and crypto voxels spatial the sandbox Etc not the non-web 3 enabled metaverses um things like Minecraft Roblox VR chat um metas Horizon as well okay great so a little bit of background for you um earlier this year protocol Labs commissioned a big study on the experiences of metaverse users and the objectives of This research were to uncover the characteristics of early metaverse users identify the meaningful experiences and user pains surface opportunities for platform improvements and deep dive on themes of identity ownership and portability so we interviewed 16 users all existing metaverse users in these kind of in-depth one-hour interviews and the research is now at the survey stage so and the full results will be made public available later this year but I'm going to share a few learnings from that study with you so from the research we mapped how people first encountered the metaverse and What affected whether they became a regular user or not and early adopters fall into like four main camps they're either just inquisitive people they want to get ahead of new tech Trends it's really up their street creatives people looking for new outlets for work investors those are folks who are maybe already in the nft space and people already working in web3 and the triggers for getting started in the metaverse really bearing for these different people so it could be that they've introduced to it by another person that they know hearing about the term in the media or being driven by the opportunity to make money so though nfts go hand in hand with the metaverse um there were some who in in our pool of participants who came to it totally fresh they had no knowledge of web3 or nft and the metaverse was their first web3 experience and whether users continue once they try it depends on whether they experience a wow moment early on so wow moments might be social engagement or realizing the creative or earning opportunity these users move pretty quickly then from just trying it out to becoming quite active but some people have really negative first-time experiences they might be put off by the quality of the graphics if you've played it you may have a sense of that or from not discovering positive social engagement those users just don't come back so there was an assumption going into this research that um all of these early adopters were going to be Gamers right gaming is the really big use case for uh the metaverse um we're not there yet gaming in the metaverse just can't compete compete with the web 2 experience um and early metaverse adopters are quite likely to be in a stage of life where they have less time for serious gaming so a lot of early adopters are millennials so some of them actually have children who are playing Minecraft right now give you a sense of who these people are and they have other priorities other than grinding in play to earn games so a lot of them had never played any play to learn games but their Nostalgia for that formative gaming experience and Nostalgia for the early internet does impact how they perceive and react to the metaverse so gaming in their youth during the emergence of um online forums in the early 2000s I'm sure some people can uh this resonates with them it's prepared them for what actually being in the metaverse is like now the convergence of 3D virtual worlds and social media and this user spells it out great to me the metaverse is the ultimate social platform it reminds me of AOL chat in the 90s but now you have visuals and tokens attached to it it's an improvement on life so those who are looking for AAA game quality are not going to find it right now and they are disappointed in the graphics it's enough of a turn off um and you know and the playability it's enough of a turn off for them just not uh not to come back ever again um so it's likely that committed gamers are just not going to be into this space until these um experiences vastly improve so from the pool of people that we spoke to if it's not gaming that brings them what is it the ability to find your tribe and create shared connections is really really powerful this user was a DJ who ended up quitting his full-time desk job to work in the metaverse he said I've spawned a lot of meaningful relationships it holds tremendous value to me it's stuff I wouldn't be doing in real life that I've always longed to do it's hard to go out there and make friends in my job nobody shared the same interests as me the metaverse is an easy way to focus in on a group that has similar interests and then continue those relationships even outside of the metaverse so social connections make the metabus really sticky but hand-holding is essential for that positive first experience so we heard that if users have someone to show them the ropes right at the beginning they're more likely to work through the hassle of getting started which might be overcoming reservations that they have about it in the first place working out how to move their Avatar around all of that kind of The Growing Pains really of getting started and they end up on this fast track to those wow moments that keep them coming back again and again for people without um anyone they know to hand hold them they can feel lost and it's unclear to them where they should go and what activities match their interests so a question for those who are building metaverse experiences right now how can you fast-track users to those meaningful experiences um and is the handholding you're doing now optimal the path from Explorer to full-time Creator in the metaverse is really short I was surprised how far some of these people went from like zero to I've quit my Normie job and now I work only in the metaverse there's quite a lot of them and that's Testament to the success of web3 as a way for people to monetize new ways of being creative and it's also Testament to the fact that metaverse platforms are showcases for what can be achieved so this user was a professional artist in real life who's invite invited to display their work in the metaverse for the first time and he said I could see my art virtually on the gallery walls it looked stunning this would cost ten thousand dollars to display in a gallery in real life and here I am doing it for free a collector had questions and everyone in the space could read my answer I only had to answer one question once at Gallery shows I have to answer the same questions 70 times and still make it seem like it was the first time the question was asked that for me was like the golden wow moment but there is a challenge of course so many of these people have no prior web 3 knowledge so they have this really steep learning curve in order to on board learning about wallets nfts a whole bunch of new Concepts so how are these platforms actually supporting web3 newcomers with all of this learning so as I was writing up the findings for This research I reflected on my own personal experience of having used the metaverse and honestly I'd only used it once I dip my toes in I think it was for an East Global event like some years ago I tried it I remember feeling lost not really feeling like it was for me being unsure what the etiquette was and I I kind of found the experience a bit scary but after doing these interviews it got me wondering could you do research in the metaverse could you study user behaviors motivations and culture by immersing yourself into the virtual world so I had some initial reservations for those of you who are researchers in the room you'll be thinking well usually when conducting research you try to take yourself the researcher out of the situation so that you are not influencing uh what's going on around you um thankfully a much bigger brain than mine has written a lot about this topic so I consulted the Bible on netnography it's called netnography by Robert kazinitz so netnography is qualitative social media research it's an adaptation of ethnography which is the study of people and their behaviors but instead of going to physically to where they are all the action happens online it's focused on human experiences and cultural understanding not product ux research is not the focus for it and it's informed by a sense of self-awareness of the researcher it's not spying on what your users are doing in public forums watching from a distance it's not that it's researching at the same time it's actually participating in the culture you can think of it like action research so it involves watching what people do online documenting what's going on collecting lots of data where that could be screenshots links anything video as well as immersion by the researcher into the space that they're researching and reflecting on their own role in that process as well and then interpreting all of that information and answering research questions now most of this book which I do recommend it's like quite a big book uh it is a good read though um most of it explores really this method around traditional social media there's very little reference to Virtual Worlds however someone has done their own netnographic study of Second Life the author Tom bowlesdorf spent two years doing it I realized I didn't have that much time so I just wanted to get a taste for like what this method was like and whether it's useful for other people to do too so what does it look like in reality so the researcher keeps field notes like a journal and whenever they're observing or immersing they take notes with a focus on social behaviors and the researcher is writing what's happening and how they feel and they reflect on their own role in the experience as well now there are some very important ethical considerations for doing this type of study there's this concept known as the consent Gap um if you think about it all of us do it many people are always sharing information about themselves online publicly you know posting on social media but just because they do that doesn't mean that they're consenting for that their data to be used in research so um an ethical netnographer needs to make their intentions known to the people that they're studying you can't go undercover basically another thing I needed to consider was that I'm studying web free people and I know that they're really privacy conscious so I needed to be extra careful about what I share in my research findings not everyone I interacted with said yes please share screenshots of the tweets I sent you so um so I'm being overly cautious on that front so with some trepidation I set up a page for myself on notion uh describing the re what the research was about I would then add the link to that in my bio in the in the metaverse platforms and direct people to that if they wanted to know more I updated my Twitter profile to say what I was doing and then I began observing and I started on Twitter Reddit um Discord following threads I dipped into different um metaverse platforms before finally ending finally ending up in decentraland so I created my avatar there she is a in order to um adhere to the netnographic method I made sure I looked somewhat like myself and I also called myself g-rack researcher just so there was no ambiguity where people would recognize me and I spent many hours doing this work I kept a journal and what I'm going to do now is read some excerpts for you I went to the decentraland events page chose a game and teleported there there are about 30 or so people their avatars all stood around in groups but not appearing to be doing anything I tried to work out how the game works which was tricky I wonder how everyone else Managed IT I felt a bit stupid and wondered whether I was the only new person to the game without any helpful prompts by others what is the experience like for other new users I engaged in the text chat it seemed people were up for surface level conversations but when I asked a researchery question I had no response which felt very disheartening it made me feel that my Approach of asking people upfront questions was wrong I noted how others were welcoming people they knew using web 3 signifiers like GM to one another looking around everyone else was in very flashy outfits and I began to feel self-conscious that my chosen normal looking Avatar was some sort of signifier to others later I follow the coordinates someone posted for a live music venue I teleported there and the atmosphere was immediately totally different I entered the venue and there was a live band I hadn't heard of playing streaming their performance into the venue my name g-rack researcher sparked some interest and people asked me what I was researching I noted in the text chat that some people share their real life locations I think this is a this is a grounding to the experience and a wave of people to find commonality looking at what I'm wearing compared to everyone else it seems dressing to be a likeness of myself is unnecessary for netnography in web3 a player's name feels far more important for Avatar recognition just as in real life you can't just jump in with questions for people you don't know you have to do some social lubrication to get people to warn to you after participating in the rituals of wishing people GM even though it was my afternoon and welcoming others by name to the event space people began to ask me questions and this became a great opener when I explained what I was working on people were very positive towards it and offered to connect me to other people who might share their experiences in my earlier observations I saw how sharing screenshots of activities in the metaverse on social media is a really common activity while I was at the event the band encouraged people to tweet screenshots so I went ahead and did so after tweeting I got a vocal shout out from the band that felt very validating and enforced a sense of multi-platform immediacy I noted how this multi-platform experience requires a lot of multitasking I wonder how many browser tabs all the other users have open once the event finished someone in the text chat told me to check openc for a show app which I'd not heard of before thankfully they told me where to find it in the openc interface as otherwise I wouldn't have known I didn't ask this question they preempted it which suggests to me they've helped others with the same problem this person is a guide when I found the nft just there it was gratifying a souvenir from that moment that came to me automatically a question I began wondering how did the band experience the the events from where they were streaming live so as my emotion progressed I brought some Mana I jazzed up my outfit a bit ready to fit in a bit more um I definitely upgraded the look and I did try a few different platforms but I kept coming back to decentralam because that's where most of the social engagement was and this study is about people so um that was why I came back to decentron for the purpose of trying out this method so on to some later Journal excerpts a couple of days since spent playing in The Meta verse feels like a long time I wonder why that is I think I had such a welcoming experience from people here so I feel like I'm part of something that it is now for me when previously it wasn't I feel bold confident I visit a promotional bar there isn't much going on there it's sort of a liminal space with no obvious Focus there was a squid-like bartender which I interacted with but it was a chat bot and that was really disappointing to me interacting with it didn't really support my goals as a user but then I stumbled across another player whose first time it was and they were lost they wanted some help understanding what to do I told them about a music event coming up and Bam I felt like I'd instantly leveled up from newcomer to experience player The Apprentice had become the master except I wished I could take them around to venues with me the best I could do was post coordinates in the chat for the music venue wouldn't it be cool for us to tether together in order to travel as a group between locations I accidentally clicked on my own coordinates in the chat teleported off and then couldn't make my way back to them hopefully they found their own way around did I feel a tiny bit of responsibility for their experience I wonder how I'd feel if I were in their shoes and the person giving me advice just disappeared and never came back I went to the venue with the Dance Floor there was a DJ live streaming I saw some friends and they called me out in the text chat it was nice to feel so welcomed I'm thinking back to other online music experiences I've had could this be better than watching a boiler room set at home you could just set up your avatar dancing with all these funky looking people and get live shout outs from the DJ and sit back and enjoy it I can imagine putting this on the television on a Friday night with some friends in the house instead of a Spotify playlist I wonder what everyone else is doing behind their screens at home whether much in-person social engagement happens simultaneously as in the metaverse the next morning I received a direct message on Twitter thanking me for my participation in the event and asking for a wallet address working in the space I get a lot of random DMS related to crypto and nfts but I checked out the profile picture of the person who messaged me and recognized them from their Avatar made sure I checked their profile I replied with my wallet address and I was excited to find what might be dropped to me it turned out to be a wearable it feels to me that participating in the metaverse is like a massive multi-platform treasure hunt so another time um I decided to begin my journey on a Twitter space the hosts were talking about spatial a platform I'd visited before but decided not to spend my research time in it because there wasn't a lot of social engagement going on so on Twitter two links were posted to a parcel of land in spatial on the left that one of the speakers on the Twitter spaces had been working on and a venue in decentraland streaming the space in spatial So I entered both spaces and was able to have my avatar in decentraland watch my avatar in spatial whilst I was invited to speak on the Twitter space I was in three Worlds at once and it really got me thinking about interoperability of avatars and what use cases there might be for how wanting to have multiple versions of yourself to across different platforms it also really reinforced to me how early adoption is that so much of participation in these platforms appears to be about demonstrating what is possible so I conduct conducted my Explorations over about 10 days I spent about 15 hours trawling social media about 10 hours 15 hours in the metaverse itself and really only to test this method out to test the value of doing it I didn't expect to find out anything very certain in this period of time but I did come away with some reflections so you can learn stuff about people this way and I think it's really interesting that the engagement level on social media definitely feels more prominent it's busier than actual platform engagement and I know there's a lot of discussion about active daily users on these platforms being really low I did find lots of people I also found lots of the same people on these platforms um uh if anyone who works at decentralan can give us some insights on their daily users that would be interesting but I I think we have to see social media as an extension of the metaverse because it's part of the experience for it so Twitter twitch Discord openc telegram all of these form part of the metaverse experience and that poses a question is there value in folding in these social networks into metaverse platforms or should they exist outside of the 3D World so um as a place where culture can be observed tribes rituals and symbols are everywhere in the metaverse the sharing of screenshots seems to be its own art form there are people who are photographers who do this and that's what they um they get group photos of people together um there are so many rituals and symbols celebrating and welcoming one another the use of web3 language the symbols in wearables and even Avatar movements uh gifting items supporting new people with technical challenges all of this good stuff so if you're new to web3 culture immersion like this is a fast track way to get to know web 3 users but for the already initiated if you've been in the space for a long time like I have it may not be as fruitful it certainly reinforces what we know about web3 users um but I suspect that the culture in the metaverse will change I'm interested in the questions around how web3 culture now affects people who are outside of it what do they think when they join the space um and what new cultures will move into the space or emerge as adoption grows um I thought I thought I was being really clever and put loads of questions together that I was going to like Grill people about in the metaverse and that was totally the wrong approach to go for um they were all the wrong questions and it wasn't the right format good questions really only emerged after spending time in the metaverse and the netnographic method does cultivate very deep empathy with users sometimes it's hard to remember that you are studying other people and it's easy to slip into the mindset of I am the user um and you could end up just performing a ux audit you know just writing a journal of all the problems that you find as you go through but it's really it is about people um it's about observing people not just about the platform however I do think it can be used to identify opportunities for platform improvements the questions that I came up with as I was going as I was journaling on my Explorations um point to those um certainly it can uncover good research questions for further inquiry so if you're building in the metaverse space I encourage you to get close to your users don't rely on just Discord signals to plan your feature roadmap like please don't do that method methodical there we go about your approach to collecting data right and triangulate with multiple methods that's really important interviews observations and immersion too and if you want to learn about emerging online communities in general virtual worlds are a great place to start so very lastly if you're a user in the metaverse then I really want to learn about your experiences to support this ongoing research um and the final report so please scan the QR code complete the six minute survey potentially win some usdc um and I really look forward to being able to share the full published results um gracias [Applause] I think we have time for one question oh excellent so proactive hi Georgia I talk I was wondering how could you keep your user in check your inner user in check and keep on being a researcher while you are immersing yourself and you were deep diving into this universe um I think it's the journaling I was doing I was doing the journaling live I wrote thousands of thousands of words as I went collecting like every data point I got like hundreds of screenshots as well that that keeps you on your toes to remember that you are observing the experience as a researcher and not just as a user otherwise you just go about you know you cover uncover a problem or maybe a question might enter your brain and then leave again because you're not documenting it so the the important bit is the field notes it's the documentation of the process okay well uh I think I I think uh we don't have much time sorry but you can follow to Georgia I'll try off the room thank you Georgia ah please again give it up to Georgia okay the next talk is social composibility design how those can let for the future of work and the speaker is Dominic Emmanuel horn is the lead product designer ux UI of common ground about three native communication platform he is freelancing as a uxn product designer for clients such as Siemens Mercedes Amor and he cares deeply about designing products with emotion that look and feel great and push to boundaries the user is being forward so please a clown of Applause for the speaker we go test test hi everyone my name is Dominic welcome to the talk about social composability design can you hear me okay yep okay test test okay okay so I know it's 5 30 and it's been a long day and I know everybody's thinking about dinner but let's talk about social composability so I want to talk specifically about how Dows can leverage it for the future of work okay so I want to start with actually who am I right so actually I think that nobody here knows me so have we met you and I would you hire me for 300K a year probably not right that would be insane right not yet exactly have we met no do you trust me probably not okay so exactly so who am I which beg is a question if you don't know who I am why should you care about what I have to say right you came here you don't know me right so what's happening is actually that invisible identifiers are at play here that we subconsciously respect right the fact that I'm up here at Defcon giving a talk means that you to some extent respect the approval process of Defcon somebody has vetted me and said this person has expertise worth sharing right but actually I would probably think that nobody here knows what the Defcon approval process looks like so you're trusting something that you actually have no idea how it works and this is even more difficult online right the internet is absolutely crazy platforms don't talk and reputation that you build on one platform is completely irrelevant on another if you've got three million followers on Twitter that only matters on Twitter technically right did you know you specifically that I used to be the head of design at Spotify yeah no of course not because it's a lie I'm not right but on LinkedIn anybody can say anything right I can just go on LinkedIn and say yeah I designed the internet as we know it right there is very little checks and balances of that system right when you hire somebody via LinkedIn you need to go through their referrals you need to check their CV you need to invite them to an interview there's an arduous process for verifying that somebody has the skills that they say they have which brings me to social composability right this is something unlocked hopefully by web3 that I think is going to change a lot of things going forward so composability is for anybody who doesn't know it's basically Lego right web3 loves it it's how can I make a basic building block that anybody else can start reusing and social composability specifically it's about social identifiers as Lego so information that says something about you that represents you as an individual and about the skills that you have but what do we actually want to know about each other what information makes us who we are in the age of Dao's we actually need to change the kind of information that we need to know about each other because the type of work has changed so we kind of need to as Gamers would say min max it right we need to maximize the useful information about each other while minimizing information that we don't necessarily want to know about other people we need to respect each other's privacy as well so right now money talks in web 3 I if I've got loads of money I can buy a board ape become part of the board ABF club and suddenly I've bought my way to influence so that's not kind of the web three that I want to live in so what if more could talk than just money so at Common Grounds I'll get to that in a moment we're building based on boardier's theory of capital and he was a French sociologist that basically came up with a theory of capital there are lots of theories of capital but his is the one that we are using to build because it was concrete enough for us to build good software with it so what year says that you have multiple types of capital at your disposal one is economic capital which is basically cash right your assets the the nfts that you have the properties you have and all of this money your Colombian pesos you also have social capital though and social capital is your connections it's the people you know it's your parents it's who what clubs you're part of the influence that you can exert via your social capital and then there's also cultural capital and cultural capital is your knowledge it's your education it's your mannerisms it's maybe even having a British accent right it unlocks certain doors because of having access to this kind of cultural capital and finally that's symbolic capital and symbolic Capital it's Prestige if you have two rich people but one person spends it all on culture and being a patron of the Arts and another rich person spends it all on gambling and cocaine they have different symbolic Capital they are perceived differently by Society if I write books to extend my my respect in the world I'm growing my Prestige and therefore my symbolic capital and all of these things are deeply in interconnected so you can trade these things for each other so for example I could spend economic capital to become part of the board API Club to grow my social connections I can through those connections earn knowledge or Insider alpha or whatever the hell using that Alpha I can maybe write blog posts about it and get really trending on Twitter and grow my symbolic capital and using all of these things I can start making money again so all of these things are interconnected and they say a lot about your standing in the world and the influence that you can exert over it so let's look a little bit about identifies in web 3 that say something about you so for example in economic capital somebody has a hundred Doge that's okay this person has a wallet understands a little bit about cryptocurrencies cool they bought some Doge good for them this person whoa it's still a hundred but who is this person right like this this is probably an important person or at least a very rich person right so but you need to know the difference between these two things the average person has no idea what this means and for example Social Capital if you have 72 followers on Twitter maybe you're writing good content maybe not who knows but you know you don't have a broad audience so to speak but you add a k to that 72 suddenly you're a big person you have influence over the space I want to get to know this person with 72k followers I want to know what they have to say it's I don't want to it's biased but I want it I don't know why and for example cultural capital so the knowledge that we have for example if you participate in governance good for you you've understood what governance is you've read a proposal and you put a vote on it cool you already know more than 99 of the entire world however if you pass the governance vote so if you wrote it if you defended it to your audience and got it approved in your Dell clearly you know a lot about the subject matter that you just proposed you have a different cultural capital at your disposal and another example is for example the Devcon at ND so this is you the audience right you have certain knowledge you've understood what ethereum is you understood how to come here and that you want to learn more but it's not the same as Defcon speaker me in this sense who's been invited here to be an expert on the subject matter I have in theory more knowledge about something that's why I'm standing up here and finally symbolic Capital as an example to be a member of a Dao is a fantastic interesting thing it means that you've understood what a Dao is you're contributing in some certain way it doesn't necessarily give you a lot of prestige however if you are a founder of Adele maybe you have more connections through that people start talking about ah this person founded a Dao oh my God who who is this person so they have access to different kind of symbolic capital and this again influences all of the other types of capital so you get the idea web3 says a lot about you but only if you understand it and actually understanding it itself is cultural capital it gives you an advantage to know these things and most people don't understand it so let's talk about designing a system of identifiers and this is I think where it gets a bit more interesting so we think a common ground that a major source of identifiers should be when humans interact most of society is built through humans interacting and I think it says a lot so for example if we build a chat app where one person asks for help and another person provides that help this is very qualitative as an act and it's difficult to quantify it's difficult to say this person has provided a helpful service but what if in web 3 we could say actually if this other person says yeah thanks for for helping me this person could grow helpfulness in a kind of gamified way you build this identifier that in a way you are helpful in the space and this is just the first example another example is you become a member of a Dao so if I join a Dao as a designer and I contribute for a month slowly my little Dow contributor level can go up and eventually of course once I'm level two level three people will be like whoa this person knows a lot about contributing to Dallas and another example is governance votes if I vote Yes on governance proposals I can grow my governance expertise and in a few years people will be like wow this person has participated a lot in governance and what this does is basically you start mapping out a skill tree of The Human Condition you basically collect and map out your accomplishments and in a certain way web 2 companies already do this except it's a quarterly review you sit down with your supervisor and they say what you're good at where you're performing where you're underperforming but it's a very subjective thing it depends on your boss it depends on your supervisor and ultimately if I quit a job and go to another company I have to start again from scratch I have to convince them that what I did at the last company was really good totally believe me guys uh you know regardless of of what I'm actually being reviewed as so it's a very subjective thing and I think once we start mapping out the Human Condition in this way you can start becoming more objective but we'll get to the cons in a moment so this becomes a massive skill tree summarizing your entire existence into badges right this is amazing loads of projects are building this right now it's going to be really cool so these social identifiers become verified credentials to be used anywhere this is the composable aspect something I earn on one platform I can use anywhere across web 3 that's where it gets interesting and pay attention to VCS because you're about to see them everywhere in web3 actually the w3c in March this year recommended starting to use verified credentials so it's officially endorsed and I think loads of projects are going to start using it so I think my work here is done right easy I've mapped The Human Condition that was super easy and nothing bad can come of it probably but it's not that simple right because designers have a massive responsibility when actually trying to map social behaviors and uh social inequality to basically a glorified skill tree so all human beings are fundamentally Born Free and equal and dignity and rights so this is from the universal Declaration of Human Rights and basically that means that these kinds of systems have to be designed really really thoughtfully because they can have ramifications socially that maybe you don't entirely are able to put to anticipate right so what's to stop my entire reputation that's on chain ruining my life in three years through some reason it conducts me and suddenly people find me at my home and that's it because of some reputation thing I did three years ago so we need to start actually talking about preventing reputation trails so we need to start with something called self sovereignty which is basically I get to be the master of what I share and what I don't share so when I start building these skill trees I need to be able to say who can see what so you need to have control over these systems what you also need to be able to do is to revoke certain things so binance actually you know they do a kyc and this year they started issuing a token for this kyc that you can claim and then prove on other platforms that you've done the binance kyc but this is revocable so you can actually go back to binance and this token that you have in your wallet you can revoke and say actually I don't want to have it there anymore right so in case binance is I don't know suddenly turns out to be super evil or whatever and you don't want to be associated with it you can revoke it and then there's also consent so I don't want to be airdropped soul-bound stuff that's on my wallet forever please ask me first right I need to be able to claim these things there needs to be a mechanism of consent especially you know when you start talking about things that might be on chain forever and finally Rehabilitation just like in real Society if I break the rules I go to prison and in theory that's to be rehabilitated so that I can become a normal member of society again I don't want reputation that I collect in these skill trees and this in the social composable system to basically track me and I can never do anything about it again another thing that we have to talk about is civil resistance so civil resistance is basically the act of being resistant to civil attacks which is when people use pseudonyms to subvert a system and if you've ever asked your cousin to leave you a five-star review on your Google Business you've in some way committed an act of civil attack or if I post something on Twitter and then I quickly change account and upload my own thing and I support myself then you are committing a civil attack so what do we do about that right we can do things like reverse Turing tests which is humans having to prove that they are humans but we are some kind of test you know the picking little uh Street lamps or whatever but then there's also things like dids so there's loads of projects starting up now talking about decentralized identities uh this is basically conducting a kyc and it's often like holding up a passport on a camera but there's also privacy preserving dids which is basically it can scan your face and say you are a unique human being but we don't want to know your name or Identity or anything else so this is also really interesting and finally passports so you've probably heard of the git coin passport and I think disco XYZ is also considered that what they do is they basically put verified credentials and dids into one cool little identity so when you connect to a platform you can say I just want to share this part of my passport to get access to the platform and it basically confirms that I'm a human being and I have the credentials that I need to access I think these are going to become very very common but verify credentials are only as good as a system that issues them so it doesn't matter if I make a decentralized application and issue myself a badge that says best designer in the world like it's irrelevant because it has no value it has no reputation the system that issued it so you actually need to think about who is issuing these things you need to actually have a reputable issuer issuing reputable credentials so that the user can themselves become reputable so it's really reputation all the way down so you're going to see a lot of projects in the next few years issuing all of these Badges and all of these verified credentials but you always have to think in the back of your mind who are they to be issuing these things do they have robust mechanisms in place and do they have a nuanced view of the world so that these issues are these credentials actually are fair and good for society and not just you know the next thing so how does all of this change anything at Common Ground we are building basically something which is decentralized collaboration coupled with verifiable credentials so we want to be the intersection of this we're building like this communication platform and as I mentioned at the beginning interactions are where things happen so what happens when you start using these verifiable credentials and start planning online spaces with them this is where I think it gets very interesting because probably most of you use Discord so Discord is a cognitive overload catastrophe you join three communities and suddenly you're spammed with 7 000 notifications and then you're like I'm going to mute all of them and that's it right it's it's kind of pointless so what happens if you actually start building areas which are more Dynamic using verifiable credentials so let's say that you have an online space where you have access to the areas that are destined for you based on the credentials that you have so imagine you're a Dao and you can basically make a space for each of your working groups that people can only get into if they have the right verifiable credentials and this can be an automatic process so if I build up my reputation because I provide my services as a designer and then one day I'm designer level three I automatically unlock access to the right space and everything else that I don't have access to is fuzzy and in the background it doesn't cognitively overload me I think this is the way that the internet is going to be shaped in the future which I think will make everything a little bit more focusing what it also allows is more trustworthy interactions so with this did credential for example we can say only verified humans can talk in this chat for example Twitter could tomorrow Implement dids and the bot problem would to 99 percent be solved it's just they're not web 3 they don't care right they're not going to do it but they could the technology exists and there are applications right now saying only verified humans can use the app so it basically means you're locked out of participation until you verify your humanity and you can do this in a privacy preserving way what it also allows is for more concrete information maybe you shouldn't have access and a view of everything and here is an example of for example a governance vote that is restricted so you for example if somebody asks should Defcon give more swag maybe only people who have attended Defcon and have the verifiable credential that they did attend can vote in this thing because they are the only ones who know how much swag was given so you don't suddenly allow everybody in the world with their token to participate only the ones who are relevant for the vote and what is what this is going to do is also streamline entire Industries and this is a big statement but I I fully believe it um in fact you could imagine that if common ground which is my Dao would choose to hire a senior designer for example I could set the verifiable credentials that we require the applicant to have I could say it needs to be designer level three it needs to have a tested Badge of being a good communicator and this person needs to have verified their Humanity for example on the flip side if I Dominic um a designer looking for work it would be as easy as enabling a toggle that says I'm available for jobs and then another toggle Auto submit my verifiable credentials to matching dials anonymously you can imagine how suddenly the recruitment industry might get a little bit worried if this would be the simple this is how simple the process could be you wouldn't need in like in LinkedIn yeah the interviews and the CV and the whatever these credentials if the system issuing them is is trustworthy and reputable then you can just set the verify verifiable credential that you need and suddenly people are matched right this thing can happen instantly and imagine multiplied by all dowels and the entire Workforce suddenly everybody gets matched in a system that is really robust so I think I broke it oh there we go summary okay so just getting to the end now your online Persona is about to get much richer and stickier with verifiable credentials this is going to happen you're already using them your driver's license is a credential your passport is a credential your University degree is a credential this is now going to be translated into web 3 and internalized on the blockchain so it's coming whether you agree with it or not it is going to come and I think as we as designers should be very mindful of Designing these systems in a way that makes Society better and not worse right and oh God I'm pressing so hard okay so you also need the quality and social responsibility behind credentials um they really really matter right so it really is all about reputable systems issuing reputable credentials that are well researched so it actually causes public good and not more trouble and finally we're looking at fundamental changes in Collective agency so if we pull this off in a meaningful way and this is going to be the challenge then web 2 organizations will not be able to compete with the Synergy and the doubt collaboration that will be afforded by this change right because they will have to transition quickly because of the fundamental changes that is going to be enabled by this in terms of collective agency so I think that we are really talking about changes to the fabric of our society and you know this may be it sounds like hyperbole but you know if you look at the world how it is right now I I think we have to do better and I think this could be one thing that takes us there so thank you very very much for listening follow me on Twitter to grow my social capital questions whoa I'm sorry wait in terms of skills I would say no there is no um issuer of skills that is yet at the degree of nuance and sophistication that there needs to be if you start talking about issuer of like decentralized identities as credentials yeah there's already loads I mean there's like bright ID there's fractal there's lots of these projects that are trying to issue these credentials in the most privacy preserving way whether or not those systems are perfect I don't know I don't think so I think there's somebody from World coin or whatever said he had two identities so probably in some way it's gameable but I think the systems of reputation that grow on top of those basic decentralized identities then we'll eventually build a better web of trust so I would say to answer your question no there is no reputable systems yet this is super early hello um I love the concept but I was wondering what happens with sensitive information with sensitive information yes because let's say we have a Dao and we say that only people with verify credentials can access some information but it doesn't prevent that I take a snapshot a sorry a screenshot and share it with people who don't have the credentials so how do we prevent that attack yeah I mean there's lots of uh security mechanisms to be able to prevent this I mean what we're talking about here it's this kind of skill system that gets you the entry right but this is built together with an overall reputation system so you could also say that it's a combination of trustworthiness via a matrix of skills and the participation in the platform that you can say only a person with a minimum trust can come in if I break that trust then maybe I'm slashed socially or in terms of tokens or in some way maybe there's even like a staking mechanism that if you enter you need to stake your reputation and if you misbehave and share screenshots you are slashed in some way so there are mechanisms that are very very interesting to be able to address these problems so native Dao Workforce is a tiny tiny fraction of the entire Workforce yeah industry tiny so how would you see like the initial data dump right like the the the bridge between the the old ways of doing reputation I don't know uh degrees or work experience into these kind of things so I think there's lots of ways to build a skill system like the one that um that I was talking about here for example you could even start with self-assessment so when you join the platform you give an estimation of your skills and abilities you rate yourself in this kind of nuanced contextual system and then maybe others who know you have worked with you can verify you over time so it you don't necessarily have to start a skill system at zero you can self-assess and then stake certain things and if you then live up to that self-assessment then you can participate effectively in the system if you don't live up to that self-assessment then you are slashed in some way so I think we need to of course be realistic and you know we can't expect everybody to start at zero especially what happens if got an established skill system and then you know everybody has been there for five years and you get a new user who's has nothing that what is it gonna do they can't compete right so there needs to be a system of self-assessment and say or or somebody vouchers for you somebody Stakes their reputation and says this person has the skills they say they have and if they don't then they're both slashed so there are mechanisms to get a head start in the skill system so that you don't get left behind you know if that answers your question ideal thank you great talk so I'm just curious about your thoughts on China's reputational system because they gamify the way they want their population to behave yeah and that might necess not necessarily be for better yeah but so you're talking about this as a social credit score yeah right so I think the social credit score in China is a little bit different because um it's tied to you as a person and there is nothing you can do about it because you will only ever be you in web 3 in theory you know I could create a new wallet and generate a new identity and start from scratch so there is ways for you to reinvent yourself in web 3 without having to you know create a whole new identity so it's not I would say the same as the social credit score because that one you can never get rid of the government has labeled you with it and there's nothing you can do with these kinds of systems you can create a new wallet and you're a new person okay and and follow up and how do you how can we give opportunities to those that haven't proved the reputation because those are going to favor those who have been proven more yeah so I think this goes a little bit back to the the previous answer as well so be able to say that they are skilled in a certain thing and maybe they can then be a probational period for example if I say I'm a master designer and I join a Dao and you know they don't know it's just self-assessed that I'm so good at design then for example if I start working with them maybe the money that I earn is in an escrow account so like a third party during this probational period for example and if I confirm to the Dao if they say actually this person has been doing a good job then the money is paid out or if I don't live up to those expectations then maybe that is slashed is that in the right direction yeah yeah how do we discover this the skill or I'm not sure I understand maybe we can talk later sorry because I think it's a discussion a large discussion and anyone has any okay and just the last one so as you said you're basically reinvating Reinventing the wheel uh the qualification and credential system already exist yes non-digital world I think the biggest problem with scaling it to the larger size is how you rate the issuers so how you actually make sure that the people that give credentials are the reputable entities yeah I think this is going to happen organically I think there's going to be a lot of projects issuing a lot of credentials in the next few years and I think it's going to happen organically based on how people interact with these credentials so is there a threshold is the system robustly designed is the system transparent so people can understand how things are weighted and how you collect these Badges and these skill systems I think there's going to be an avalanche really of these skills systems and badge issuers and whatever and it's going to take time for that kind of to stabilize and people actually starting to realize which ones do we take seriously and which not so I don't think it's as easy as you know somebody uh vetting you know a issuance system and saying this one's really good I think it's going to happen more organically but this is just my opinion okay that's it okay yeah we are we don't have thank you very much everyone yeah [Applause] it was amazing thank you um this is my first time closing a stage in English so thank you very much sorry for my English and see you tomorrow let's go to rape
