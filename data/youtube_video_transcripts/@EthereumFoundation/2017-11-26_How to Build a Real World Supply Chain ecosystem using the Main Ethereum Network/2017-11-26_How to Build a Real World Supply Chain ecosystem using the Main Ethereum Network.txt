[Music] okay good morning everybody today I'm here to introduce you a project that I really wanted to see implemented on the main net is this project is about implementing real world supply chain for Italian products and in particular we started with the supply chain ecosystem this project is baked by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture it's big in complexes so I don't have time to cover all the aspects so in this presentation I summarized them the key aspects that I think may help you to build a similar solution in other countries I will happy to answer other questions during the break so let's start from the conclusions I'm this is suggestion from me I am in developer I'm a solution architect and head of the blockchain competence center in amoeba so let's go fast supply chain exists regardless of IT solutions so you must fit their process no you not the contrary okay so you will have submission that evolves with business leveraging the technology so don't be a blockchain zealot you cannot expect the clients want to know details of your solution or is interesting in how disruptive for the classical 80 world it is each actor of the supply chain as its own expertise vision business models and goals so you cannot convince them all this the culture to converge to a single goal ok creating an integration or supply chain because it is a matter of business not technology so stickers I want to only do its own job not to be IT expert and Sakura used this technology that gives them minor cause and better results so what you need to do is find the scenarios that really need addison tries the co system so you need to search for a tech genius stake holder with different goals so for example a big company with many suppliers it's not a good idea many intermediaries so if you are in Italy it's a good place to start from and a lot of bureaucracy Italy also a good place to start from and EU also let's continue the conclusion so you cannot force a supply chain ecosystem you need to create a problem my opinion I create a promise' environment that all actor wants to use so you create a virtuous cycle that makes other stakeholders to join what is a promisor environment so it fixes some issues from the beginning let's from some actor it can grow without relying on a single actor and every actor can implement new features it has a reputational system that emerges during the normal use of the environment by this decoder so endorsing should not be separated step it you should not and at the other step to the stakeholder business process providing environment must be massive private investments that are made to create as they call their IT systems and it should be cheaper than existing solutions or at least and at least the same the same features stakeholders can live and must can live enjoy the ecosystem whatever they want without shame and justification and regulators must recognize and participate in the environment really important bold underlined so private companies look for retro investment sooner the better they never really do charity so I think that your company does not exception so you I suggest to stick close to government organization they can really boost the creation of the environment because they can spend money for go of the community and this is exactly their own return on investment and we conclusion you need the regulator's to get rid of regulation so don't try to be the new regulators just because you master the blockchain and you need the materialization really really much damage organization start creating a decentralized solution that simply works don't try to build a complete solution from the start so you cannot force the use of specific IT supply chain solution because it never fits the needs of all stakeholder in any case there there's no single solution that rule them all there's no single smart contractors rule them all so it's always a matter of integration please use the blockchain for what it is better so leveraging all the peer-to-peer technology and integrate those technology with legacy system we need legacy system for many years I go more and again you don't need to do all on the blockchain really you need so don't do it start with solution integration features the prepare the environment for the grow of the ecosystem ok so if you follow these rules I think you can use a theory of Manor for a builder decentralized supply chain solution and you can build it now just gather with others don't try this at all alone and if you want you can start building with us so when I who we are we are quite big company so we are in all over the world Italy Brazil United staes we have many many people that works with us and we cover all these markets so in popular public administration teleportation energy istic and so on I think you understand the kind of love company and we have many partnerships so if you want to be with us just say hi and to cover all the aspects of the new technology we have many components Center as well ready said I work with the ml of blockchain command center and I work with other comes the center to provide this kind of solution because it's a need to be many competences to provide this solution to the customer blockchain is used here as a keyword as a shortcut because I really trust that the focus here is to create the centralized solutions so blockchain is the the main technology for this solution but it's not the only one so scenario Italy is one logic agriculture producer of food and processor in the in the European Union there is 1 million people directly on directly involved in the production chain we created not one but four marks of guarantee that the food of wine products tasted as a traditional food okay so the main architect capture market treat that they want to solve is product counter failing national international we choose to start from wine because Italy is a larger wine producer in the world so we produce 500 millions of liters of wine per year we are very thirsty and the possibility of Italian agri-food is the most discussed stopping for benefit it can make in several application areas so what we need to do to guarantee quality consumer safety and protection of Italian of the middlee project of made in Italy products sorry and to determine the origin and characteristics that make the products unique traditional tracking meters are not enough to contract and discourage counterfeiting phenomenon so the actors involved in this ecosystem are many we hear here you can see the main there are producer wireless transporters consumers association all associations are all these player sources or producers wineries and so on model g√∂ran organization and so on they all share essentially the same issues militaire documentation intially often is stealing paper and container they don't have information so there is a delay in data gathering because all these actor needs to send data to the ministry so they have different days different laws and the ministry can do they can really do the math because different actors can declare different numbers and it's not easy to understand who is saying the true I would say he's wrong so there are high costs for former controls because it's a fully centralized information that is required to go to the ministry and there is no easy access for the consumer to all these data so the data is there but is available only for the ministry known for us so the project is this we set three goals reduce reduce grow up chat board cut the burdens for actors involved in production chain simplify mandatory declaration management automating the collection of information and removing duplicate stale dialogue create a certification system based on innovative technologies to support the wine supply chain this is important it should not be it should be coordinated and supervised by the Ministry but freely freely usable by the market SME retailer setup for building the veil of value-added services and enable more effective control management by organizations so how we do it with an English 3.4 4.0 supply chain platform for through Sabido grapes transport processing and bottling well the benefit admits that even for my suspect simplification facility certified and accessible to place and consumer easy sharing of guarantee data for all controllers of supply chain and we have real real time at to product information decreasing cost for formal documentation checking in the check of the authenticity of product also aboard we I think all know it is but we have bandages of lesson right platform there are no single point of failure we have cost fairness one of my favorite because reduce cost respect existing solution and it is a fair this will cost among all players it's safe we can run smart contact and we have that protection that are immutable almost and can be encrypted what it's different the improvement respect drive of solutions based on the blockchain already existing so we the platform born and dedicated to incentivize collaboration effort so included encouraging data usage and building new application rehabilitated data data are also certified by public administration systems not just for private individuals it is legal valid and there is legally very legal validity and simplification involved because we integrated with the system that already used by the Ministry and are used to fulfill various bureaucratic burdens so the company does not any anything at all and you can track the dissipation and just now actors would certify the entity so we can integrate with the specific existing systems for an entire application for example the IT system of the ministry or the SPID that is an inertia National Italian unification system it is a dissolution it is provider ET item provides a realistic so every stakeholder can choose its own IT provider to use the platform it don't know they don't need to choose us or the ministry and save private investment in the ecosystem because it is a real lasting Livni's on the platform guaranteed and even if the ministry decide to stop using it the platform is still there what we created is we choose six players and we created a application for everyone so the first is a producer that send grapes and land information with a mobile app transporter take that information and certificate that it takes those load and bring to the winery the winery we operated the system that I already use to track this information also on atrium we created dashboard and analytics for the ministry and for to monitor the the all the transaction and to apply flood detection and we are waiting to create the the step of a seaman FC tag eastery to the history and we created also a web app for a consumer to verify information how we create this we use an eye level architecture like this which is a platter we are ready on inside the arm Aviva it's called Otto it was born as a night as an IOT platform then evolved as an integration platform and now it's also blockchain platform it's a very high level view overview the platform the the main feature of this platform can be mixed so the model can be mixed as as we wish so we create a specific platform for every customer in we work with in this case I choose this kind of a summarize a little bit about in this case the supply chain is this we have on premises solution on VMware because ministry product and we have a legacy system a you see in grey with Java with Vinnie cultural register and other application this application needs be upgraded to send messages to the data leaks for analytics you see a bunch of a classical a little product like elasticsearch Park flora and we created the the the front-end we dangled our engines and the backend API with graphic well and no GS / Sicily is for blockchain 16 we used to client parity and get and get we put get on the cloud so all actors and third parties can interact with the ministry or via classical way legacy system or directly through the blockchain so what now the the third part is now sent data directly to the ministry tomorrow it will send only to the blockchain the same thing let's say something about the smart contract we created this platform so everyone can work with so as my contest as some so everyone can use my contract that is not contract just a moment okay so everyone can use this must contract the question the issue is we can create a supply chain we need governance we need the endorsement so the ministry endorsed each step if I don't want in the means in darkness I can use this platform in any case so the consumer or every player every actor can see who endorsed what's that what step so so we can see we can say that chain is dynamic and every step can be endorsed by everyone for example we can now the identity of the the company is provided by the ministry but tomorrow can be for example and I really see residency credential maybe using the Oracle is proof of identity and allows them to endorse every step in any case so it's up to every player of the supply chain to choose what endorsement to consider valid the ministry said some constraint about for example the the quantity so if you produce the fix the amount of wine you cannot bottle more than the capacity of the bottle you have so and I can show you just what they think about upgradable con smart contract please do not upgrade its mark on work really fast because I don't have so I prefer and I suggest though don't upgrade as mark honor because these put a government inside the something that should not be government it's better to send a message to the clients that does not contract for me for the ministry is not running anymore okay so if I want to use them that my code I can continue to use that but I know that someone know that test my code is not valid anymore for the for the ministry okay so I finished the time so this is a really fast some screenshot of our console made in angular that shows the production and supply chain steps it's really fast this is some analytics from Cabana and we have deviation from the historical series for example this is the snapshot for from the mobile application for customers so you can scan the NFC call and see she code on the bottle and check all the step of history and understand where the wine is is made from and so one last thing tomorrow the story is yeah you may radiate off this somewhere by someone and you can build a tedium and there's a nice application now in production don't let them catch you doing it though thank you [Music]
