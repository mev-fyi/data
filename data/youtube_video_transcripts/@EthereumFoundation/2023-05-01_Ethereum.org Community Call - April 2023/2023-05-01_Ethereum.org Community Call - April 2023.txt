hello everyone thanks for joining the ethereum.org April Community call on this call we'll mostly be focusing on some of our ongoing and upcoming Q2 initiatives that we'll be focusing on in the coming months in case you've missed it we just published our Q2 roadmap this week and it's full of interesting work we're all very excited to get to I've just shared the link in the chat um so feel free to check out our Q2 roadmap and reach out if you'd like to get involved with any of these initiatives before we go through the agenda for today's call though let's start with the usual clarification that this is a community call for ethereum.org not for the ethereum foundation or the ethereum protocol we want to use these calls to keep our community up to date with what we've shipped what we're working on and how you can get involved as well as hear from all of you so feel free to share any input feedback ideas or questions you might have in the chat or in any of the relevant channels here on Discord so here's a quick overview of what we'll cover on today's call first of all Joshua has a very special announcement and introduction to the newest member of our team next up Joseph will be talking about how we've revamped the upgrade section on the site and introduced the new roadmap section that covers the ethereum protocol roadmap after that Corwin will cover GitHub maintenance and our approach to keeping up with all of the issues in PRS in the ethereum.org repo Corwin will also introduce two new features we'll be working on specifically the community call widget which will show previous and upcoming Community calls on the site and the learning quizzes Hub where we're planning on improving and expanding the learning quizzes currently available on the site next up I'll be talking about our efforts to move Beyond translating just text and how we'll be approaching localization of images and infographics on the site as well as dubbing videos to make visual content more accessible as well and finally Joshua will give an overview of the writing cohort that we announced yesterday and provide some more details on that and as usual some quick announcements and call outs at the end in case any of you are attending ethereum conferences next month and want to meet up with us before we get into it I also wanted to mention that the poab distribution for this call will be a bit different today so everyone who wants to claim the PO app will need the poapp app on their mobile so if you don't have the app installed please take some time visit the App Store download the poapp app set it up by adding your address or ens so you will be ready to claim when the time comes if you need any help with downloading or setting up the app please let us know in the chat and with that out of the way we can get started so at this point I'm gonna hand it over to Joshua and Isabella hey everyone hope you can hear me okay um yeah just a brief one from me and maybe I'm not sure if that's available or want to see anything but I'm super excited to introduce our new community Elite Isabella the the hiring process yeah go ahead oh could you mute yourself okay uh as well have temporarily new to do because we had about Echo going on but um yeah as I was saying yeah the hiring process for this position um was pretty intense to say release we had over I believe 600 applications for the role that probably hundreds of interviews with tons of amazing people um I know there were many many people in the community who are very excited about this role and it was definitely hard for us to disappoint so many awesome people along the way yeah so if you don't apply for the rule just know we probably do something you're awesome still we're really happy with the choice we made and we think that asabella will be a great addition to the core team uh with our our understanding of ethereum and its ecosystem as well as the passion she has for helping way pre-communities thrive and so moving forward asabela will be working hard to make our community more connected more engaged you'll be the go-to person as we shape the future of the community so if you're interested in getting more involved in some way or if you have feedback you want to share let her know and we'll we'll see how we can help so I hope I speak for everyone and govern Isabella back warm welcome we're stoked to have her on the team and can't wait to see the amazing things we'll be able to accomplished um so yeah welcome Isabella feel free to add as little as you want thanks for meeting Joshua can everyone okay we can hear you near you I can just hear him that's all thanks for reading Joshua for being true hi everyone I'm super happy to be here in the chatting uh to chat with you all my name is Isabella I just joined the itera.org core team and my main focus um like Joshua mentioned will be coordinating all things related to community I've been working in the way of three space since 2021 and I actually got to know ethereum.org last year thanks to Lucas presentation at Defcon Bogota about the translation program so as you can probably tell English is not my mother language I can fluently speak to variants of Portuguese and I do a little bit of Spanish as well it's a bit Rusty but I can't speak some words so supporting the community um in the efforts of translating and making content educational resources and overall opportunities available for everyone is definitely a very dear calls to eternal.org um the way the ICT in the torque it's much more than this core team that it's in this call right now it's much more than a website it's a community it's a community contributing through various areas um with the skills and the knowledge each one of you have towards the advancement of the Interior ecosystem so in this infinite Garden uh my role is pretty much to be a gardener helping you all guiding um like showing the ways like who folks can contribute um listening your feedback ideas so please don't hesitate to reach out to me uh with any contribution ideas feedback how do you want to get involved you for sure hear a lot from from us very soon but like I said ethereum.org is a community and you're definitely part of it and we need you all to make things happen so and you'll definitely hear a lot and towards today through the community it's all about a roadmap for uh Q2 and so on so excited to be chatting with you all very very soon and thank you so much for the work welcome foreign next up we've got Joseph talking about the updates that we've made to the upgrades pages and how that's turned into the ethereum protocol roadmap section over to you Joseph hopefully you can see my screen um yeah okay so this epic aimed to make accessible content that explains all the upcoming upgrades coming to ethereum in the future spanning the near term all the way into the far future the reason is because it can be difficult to grasp all the various ways that ethereum is expected to change and part of that is because the upgrades are often very technical and related to specific pieces of the protocol or sometimes just because they're shrouded in kind of inaccessible jargon right so we try to we try to address that issue by designing a holy section of the website that goes through all the major upgrades that we expect to see in ethereum's future and explain them in a way that guides new users from the highest level Concepts right down to the low level details in a kind of welcoming way so practically what that means is that we have this new roadmap landing page that you can see on my screen right now and this is where you can you can kind of discover why ethereum has a road map and how it's managed and why it's important and we've had these four cards on the page where um you can see the benefits that these upgrades on the roadmap are going to deliver to ethereum users and if you want more information about how those users have been how those user benefits are going to work you can click through so for example click through on cheaper transactions and it takes you into this slightly more detailed page um and you can understand the specific problems that are being addressed and at a high level the solutions that we're expecting to be implemented to to resolve them all right so from those pages you can also click through again into some more detailed technical information about specific upgrades and these are the pages where we sort of get into the nitty-gritty of EIP numbers and digging into parts of the protocol they're being changed and how they're being changed um at much finer resolution than in the previous pages and then if you really want to get even more technical still those pages should provide enough context and conceptual knowledge that you can go and actually read the EIP documents or some technical documentation or maybe even some other client code or something so it's a really really grock the fine details so that was the idea with this epic to guide people through from the very high level introductory information about themes upgrades right through to the uh the low-level technical details we've tried to make it all as aesthetic as possible and lay them out in a in a kind of user-friendly way and give a good experience to especially to new beginner ethereans and nuno's also been experimenting with some new AI illustrations using mid-journey they're going to be pushed onto these Pages very soon just to make it look even nicer okay that's it um happy reading remember that these pages are pretty fresh so there are probably improvements that can be made and if you're inclined then please please come and get involved on GitHub and look forward to seeing any Community contributions thank you very much and back to you Luca thank you Joseph great work on revamping this section of the website and a big plus one to um the call out that if people want to read through this these pages and end up spotting a typo or a potential Improvement PR's and issues in our repo are always very very welcome next up well we've got Corwin talking about a number of things so GitHub maintenance Community call widget and learning quizzes Hub take us away Corwin [Music] you need to meet myself can you guys see my screen okay [Music] yes awesome all right hey everyone um so one of our epics that we had last quarter that will be also carrying over as GitHub maintenance never ends um was a GitHub maintenance epic so part of what we did last quarter was release some actual documentation on what our issued triage process um should and will continue to look like um so basically we've outlined what um what it takes for an issue to be taken out of eating triage and the assignment process for whether it's a core team or a Community member working on an issue at any given time so I'll share these links after um just because I'm sharing my screen kind of weird but um just you know we've yeah launched a GitHub issued triage process that we're looking to follow we've also added a deploy and pull request review process which kind of outlines the different types of contributions we get at any given time on the repo and kind of an expected timeline on what we aimed to do reviews for with those different types so not all PRS are created equally some take less time than others to review and we've tried to outline Affair um and accurate kind of like timeline on which we aim to um deliver these reviews on now we say that but looking at our numbers uh we have 77 open pull requests 283 issues are we actually maintaining the repo I think that's a fair question to ask um and we've done just looking at uh some of our GitHub activity in the last month just outlined that we have been maintaining it and we still have more to go um at any given month we have roughly 100 um active members and it's kind of leveled off especially with the um fair market of that we're currently living through but um we have roughly a hundred members at any given month contributing to ethereum.org um and these have to do with individual PR's and issues opened by contributors so as you can see we get roughly 100 pull requests from contributors every month as well as um I think if I go to the bottom here I think it's a better graph which outlines so we have yeah like I was saying about 100 pull requests opened every month by community members and about 100 opened by uh the core team so thinking about that that's about 200 pull requests a month that we get coming in at any given time um 77 open and that's been the case for a few months at this point I think we can say we're doing a pretty good job at maintaining the GitHub at this point still have to do some more work on um allocating resources to this and that has been something we talked about and we'll be doing in Q2 and moving forward is making sure that the core team spends a bit more time allocating um some of their time to helping maintain the GitHub repository that being said though these numbers look high but I think it paints a different picture when you look at um how active our community and how active this project is um if we get 200 pull requests a month and we're sitting at 77 months later I think we're doing a pretty good job still maintaining this repo um but that paints picture what we did last quarter what are we looking to do moving forward um I've already mentioned that we're going to be adding more resources to helping maintain this we also want to kind of add some clarification to the community when they're interacting with their repository so some of the things that that looks like is will be auditing our tagging system here our labels I guess what they're called in GitHub but auditing our labels and looking to improve the GitHub actions that label our issues and pull requests this will make it easier for whether it's contributors or the core team looking to review things um quilty being able to filter down into different areas of the repo that maybe they have more expertise in and can find where their time would be best spent easier other things we're going to be looking into is adding GitHub actions to actually share these triage and review processes on pull requests and issues themselves to help communicate and set better expectations for everyone in the community as they're contributing um but that's largely been like yeah where we've gone and where we're going when it comes to GitHub maintenance and again I think it was really cool to kind of come back and look at this graph of um comparing literally what's opened by the community and what's open by the team and we're basically at like a 50 50 split at this point which is pretty uh pretty incredible honestly like we get a lot of community contributions and that kind of shows how much you guys helped Drive the site as much as the core team does um so that's all I have to touch on with GitHub maintenance next up um I'll talk about the community events widget that we're looking to add um I was hoping to get this done for today but I did not unfortunately run into some issues with Google apis but um an overview of what we're looking to build here is a widget that's going to start living on at least the homepage of ethereum.org but we'll be able to put in other places and what this we're just going to basically do is call out when our next Call of a community call of some sort is whether it's um all right well the next call that we're going to be hosting whether it's a community call a design Community call office hours whatever that looks like what we're going to do is be putting this into a calendar pulling that data and explaining it in this component that'll allow you guys to see what's coming up also will allow you to take these events and add them onto your calendar in case that is something that um is beneficial and helpful for anyone trying to plan their days and then after this I'm also presenting on our learn quizzes so as some of you if you've been coming to our community calls regularly probably no and if you don't we have um quizzes at the end of a number of pages on ethereum.org and the idea behind these were to basically take the content that was on a page build the quiz around that content to help make sure that a user who came and read this content understood what they just read so these quizzes are built off of the content that you would see on a given page not necessarily just like random questions um about a topic so as long as there's content to support a question that's what you'll see in a quiz we had a relatively good success coming with this we've had uh relatively we've had pretty like tremendous success with it we have tens of thousands of people who have taken these quizzes since we launched it in I believe it was November or December last year and um from there we're looking to kind of build on top of what we've done with the quizzes and extend this into a quiz hub so instead of needing to visit individual Pages um you'll then be able to just come to a quiz hub and see all the quizzes that we have on ethereum.org and the idea is that we're looking to build more interactivity into ethereum.org and by building out this I guess like hub for you to test your knowledge this will be a step for us to like validate building user interactivity on ethereum.org more this also allows you to get a quick glimpse of how you've done on previous quizzes um see what quizzes you haven't done and allows you to like find content on the site and quizzes to test your knowledge on the site that maybe you didn't know was there before um so we're excited to work on this this quarter and get this shipped out so that we can have a hub to build on um moving forward with this we're going to be opening up a new issue template um around adding quiz content onto the website as well as a contributing guide for how to add quiz content onto the website so while we may be taking on building this Hub we're definitely looking for contributions on adding quizzes throughout the website um moving forward it's not this Hub can be fully fleshed out with uh quizzes on all our pages um that's all I got so I'll be passing this back to Luca but thanks everyone thank you thanks Corwin exciting stuff coming to ethereum.org next up it's uh my turn and as you're probably used to by now I'll be talking about translations if you have been part of our community for some time you'll know that we take localization very seriously and strongly believe that providing educational resources in multiple languages is a simple yet impactful way of educating more people about ethereum and onboarding more people to the space regardless of the language they speak the result of our commitment to localization is the fact that ethereum.org is currently available in 54 languages and non-english Page views account for over a quarter of all visits to the website this year alone and it's not even end of April yet we've had over 1 million unique page views on the site in languages other than English clearly shows the demand for educational resources in other languages is there and people want to read and learn about ethereum in their native language so this quarter we are leveling up our efforts to provide content in different languages the first such initiative is an exploration into translating all kinds of images and infographics there's a lot of diagrams and infographics on the website but they're currently only available in English which means when someone is viewing the site in another language they might be able to understand all of the texts since it's available in their language but not the English images automatically using Google translate or another similar translation feature is also not the easiest to use on images as you would have to download the image in question upload it to Google Translate and then also trust that the machine translations are correct so it's kind of a long-winded way of getting translations for images to address this we have compared different ways of localizing images of any kind came up with a process converted all of the existing images on the site that contain any text into a translatable format and we'll be uploading these images for translation to crowding next week so during the May source code Source content update while you still have to do some work on the dev sites to properly Implement translated images in different languages we expect to have the first batch of translated images on the site available sometime in May once we have an established process for translating images and adding them to the site will also be able to add more visual elements like infographics and diagrams in the future hopefully making some of the content more visually appealing for our International audience if you are a one of our translators helping to translate the site content in crowding you will soon see these images for translation in crowding and translating them will be just as simple as straightforward as translating any other text and if any of you are involved with other projects and would like to translate some of your visual content also feel free to reach out to us we're always happy to share any of our findings or help out with localization efforts of any kind at this moment I'm just gonna briefly share my screen so I can show you a very concrete example of this so this is a regular image we have on the accounts page in the developer docs this is the English version of the accounts page so all of the text is in English the image is in English if we switch to for example Chinese you can see this page is fully translated into Chinese but the image is still in English so that's the current state of things that's what we're moving on from um and we have a good example of a translated image already on the website this was created by um wackero and this is the merge infographic so this is the merge page in English the infographic is available in English but once you change the language into Chinese again you can see the whole page is translated into Chinese and so is is the infographic so this is the state we want to get to with all images infographics diagrams any visual content on the website really so this is coming up a lot of these images or all of these images are going to be available for translation starting next week a lot of are already going to be translated sometime later on in May and moving on uh the next epic that we'll be working on and I want to cover is video dubbing so very similar to the previous point we also link out to a lot of explainer videos on the site for simplified explanations of certain Concepts and easier learning through Visual content some examples of these include cinematics videos and other videos explaining basic blockchain concepts again while a certain page might be available in a different language delete the video we link out to is currently only available in English but with the rising popularity and quality of AI dubbing tools will be comparing different options to transcribe translate and dub some of these videos in other languages while the work on the video dubbing epic has not started yet I'm personally very excited about the potential that tools like this can have for providing more accessible and inclusive content to everyone at the moment it's much easier to imagine a world where you open a video select the language and listen to the video in your native language than even a couple of years ago the tools for this already exist and some content creators are already using the technology to provide the videos they create in different languages thereby making their content more accessible and also attracting new viewers who might not have been able to watch this content in English because of their limited fluency and the language as part of this epic we'll look into and compare all the different tools that enable video dubbing create a process on how we want to handle this in a sustainable and scalable way and just start dubbing some videos the end goal of both of these epics is also quite similar which is having the ability to provide any type of content in as many languages as possible in my view this is one of the easiest ways to help educate more people from all over the world about ethereum and when it comes to new technologies everything starts with education so if you'd like to get involved with this effort for example if you have experience with video dubbing or you are a content creator feel free to reach out to us and if you're simply someone who likes to learn by watching videos I guess keep an eye out for a whole bunch of ethereum videos becoming more accessible and available in different languages very soon that's it for me on this um on these two epics and moving on we have Josh who's going to be giving out some poapps and also sharing out sharing more details about the writing cohort that we just announced yesterday um over to you Josh thank you sharing my screen oh um yeah so as look I mentioned at the start of the call we do need everyone to have their WAP apps on their phone I know you can get it on the iOS store or on the Google Play Store there is available other places as well and but that's the only way to clean this plot as far as I know if anyone knows otherwise then let me know um but I've created a little guide for people so if you get your apps or if you just look and then you can download your app later uh it's fairly straightforward though I just did it and found it a little bit frustrating um so sorry about that but we're trying it for this time maybe we'll go back to the old way on the next poll so yeah what app and when you open it there's this little mint button down the bottom and you need to select the secret Words which will bring you to this screen here um our secret word is welcome Dash Isabella I'm just putting in the chat as well so if you put that word in and then hit meant it will take you to the best screen unless you're as the frustrating part um basically you need to select the numbers all the way up to a thousand it only takes like a minute but I found it quite annoying um so just keep going if you make a mistake it's fine you've got lots of Lights just don't use them all and when you get to a thousand which will take you a while and you'll get to the screen like you know it's been minted and eventually the minute will happen so um apologies again if this if you find this annoying also apologies to people who do not have the co-op app or don't have a phone that they can download it on but I have an Overstock on our end hopefully everyone can get their flame length if you can't for some reason maybe DM me and I can find sort something out after the call um but for now this is the best way to do it um cool so I'll continue talking while people are claiming their poet math in the morning yeah indeed okay on to the next thing this one I'm really excited about so ethereum.org is running a writing cohort we've partnered with captives to run a three-week cohort where a bunch of ethereum door community members and core team members can come together and learn how to write better through writing tips and guides get feedback and support from the people at Papa or in the cohort and hopefully have a good time that's literally the elevator pitch you can see from their website it's all about teaching people how to write bear and I can imagine there there are people here thinking like I don't care about writing why would this interest me um I would say even if you don't want to be a writer or aren't trying to start a blog or something else like that the writing cohorts can still be massively beneficial for just a couple of hours of time investment and the whole philosophy behind captive is this idea that clearer writing equals clear thinking you know clear writing as clear thinking I'm sure everyone here has used another person as a sounding board to develop an idea on their head similar floor thing can happen when you write something out so even if you don't want to write but you want to articulate your ideas better then the strike in court could benefit you um that being said everyone has a writer who's text you send the ends you reply on Twitter so if you want to check out personally I participated in the bank lift writing cohort in September I believe last year and I still Rave about how much better it made my writing and even how I think about problems sometimes and so the founder Grant is helping facilitator he's an amazing teacher and writer he'll be facilitating the whole cohort for us making sure everyone has the support they need to get the most out of the experience um yeah I've given the hard sale there did I mention it's completely free at medium.org is as good a resource as is because of thousands of people from the community who have devoted their time to improving in some small way so that's just one way we would like to get back by helping community members improve the writing abilities they are writing better writing habits develop queer thinking you don't need any experience or skills and writings if you are interested in improving your rate skills or hanging up hanging out with a bunch of like-minded people from the community then we would really love for you to join us so I'll drop this link in the chat uh at luckily takes 30 seconds to sign up quicker than claiming their pull up uh just drop in your desktop username and your email and we can get you on board just to the cohort which starts on May 11th look forward to seeing you there I'll pass it back over to the Luca thanks Joshua so that concludes our regular part of the call we have some miscellaneous announcements and call outs mainly focusing on events so may is going to be full of ethereum conferences hackathons different events some members on the team are going to be at East Lisbon some members on the team are going to be at East Dublin some are going to be at edcon in Montenegro so if any of you are visiting any of those events please reach out to us we'd be happy to meet up at these events if we do get more multiple community members if we do get a larger part of our community there we would also love to organize some some hangout or an informal ethereum.org Meetup or whatever form that Stakes but um yeah if you'll be it uh any ethereum conference slash event in may feel free to reach out to us we'd be happy to meet up and the the last announcement is as always the May Community call is going to happen at the end of May most likely the last Thursday in May um will create the event and send out the announcement for that by the end of this week most likely so yeah that pretty much concludes the community call if anyone has any questions feedback input ideas anything for us feel free to drop them in the chat or speak up if if you want to um but yeah happy to meet some of you in person at a conference next month potentially and if not see you all on the interwebs thanks for joining the community call and see you all at the next
