[Applause] this very lousy technical talk also one layer to UX design patterns I shoulda landed other people studies about development but it's about design actually so how many of you are actually familiar with layer 2 technologies NoHo plasma state channels work comic don't okay a few we will have a tiny tiny primer above that so that you can get out dispute so on the agenda I will give a tiny detail about precedents for the framework of how we went out and found these principles tiny principles at the primer only to technology so that those of understand what we're talking about and then there are these leads to design patterns very very little and few patterns because there's not being much time to test with real users I test only with you who will tell you about that and a summary of insights and of course in the middle is it going yeah okay we will have the voices of the users okay that is these bubbles of things that people and users actually told me I mean to do that non crypto users but Victor of Korean users also and they will be speaking in the middle of the presentation so that you can hear the voice as well so unless you represented this Web 3 design decision making framework was a tool that came out from the interviews of many different companies in this race that helped us map the different problems users have into different types of buckets of questions that were fundamental to decentralization and things that are related to the technicalities of the object this is interesting because it leads to how we found the design patterns and also why we started doing the layer 2 design happens so what we found out is at work there's new mental models and there are there are also new complicated concepts and these fits in different things and the solutions that these companies were using range in two different buckets as well if you want things that you could hide you should type to the user and things that are technical you should oh and you can alight you should explain better I'm not going through the whole presentation I would love you but just a simple example to the sound like gas is a multi-dimensional problem you can't have things that you can hide away like what is got right designers and projects have had a lot of success in finding different questions but there are other things like why is there a price at all who is it getting it that you need to find better explainers for this and these happen also in the negative and of course the solutions these companies were using could be mapped out in here and so this is where the layer two comes in which is there was a high degree of consensus among developers and designers and working in the space but sometimes it's okay to have a server a server that helps you in the middle that there is a degree of centralization especially for newcomers for non crypto user it's okay to build them by the hand and then on portable to real decentralized technology and so this is why I thought that lady two had that promise of bringing the degree of centralization but it still has the security of layer 1 so right now a primer on state channels and on plasma and state channels they all basically work more or less the same thing you have layer one technology that will all change if you I'm not saying where you have a smart contract you drop in or you lock in some tokens some ether ok and anything have been obtained either in the case of state panels these are like normal server transactions where two parties Alice and Bob sign each other messages and so you are constantly like messaging each other the new state and you agree on that space it's always the last Tuesday and whenever you want to withdraw you go back to layer one and there is where the security comes in through a challenge period maybe this guy wants to cheat but this guy here has the last the state and so it's mathematically provable that this guy will win the layer 1 security ensures that anything that happens off chain is secure ok and there is few to clear networks like me connected with Berto right or through hubs intermediary six month where a lot of users are connected together ok plasma is a little bit different but as the same concept you have the main layer one chain where you have contract you deposit tokens of ether in there as well and what happens of chain is actually another chain but that has a faster throughput they have less validators there is you can have like two thousand transactions per second more or less here and you're competing periodically every 32 seconds Morelos minutes 32 blocks thank you you're committing that space into the chain so this is the difference between state channels and plasma which is in plasma you need periodically to send transactions on chain and to register information in state channels you don't and they are called optimistic layers if you want because you don't resort to layer one until you actually need it if L if we are behaving well you don't need to go on the plasma does this thing but if only in the case we are behaving badly you've gone to a fair one and site change maybe you have heard of this things tide change are not they do we'll talk about that is basically an atomic well swap between two different chains so there's a few more Bitcoin whatever we the public ones open and it's minted on the other side but I'm not going to talk about this because the side chains are not layered to and actually right now there's another talk somewhere downstairs exactly about this site no site is really so if you hear sightings are nothing to and okay basically to speed up we did interview people in the space and users I want my mission is to unboard my mother and my brother okay and so I try to talk to non-critical users only few of them five of them because there wasn't much time with people releasing stuff right before they're going to actually have something in our hands to touch with there's three main moments in the design or the user flow okay you need to enter this you need to use the system and exit the system and in these two cases you also have to sign things which is normally you will think of transactions but transactions are is a pattern that works inside of a wallet or when you transact value but in this cases you can also transact stage of applications you know so you should not call them transactions if you want and the exit has two patterns which is I'm exiting fine and friends with my friend and I just go fine or adversarial and entering the system so unfortunately today this is a problem you still need to go through then you want to get into later too and so everybody still presenting with a savior key but Capulets of my dream was shattered right of the first stab you know yes we can on board non proof to use it no not yet and of course their solution for this of course the question is what the is a key ok this is a literal question use of us and this solution is of course to use contract base account the universal of you might have heard those those solve that onboarding process please start using contract base accounts everybody then there are so many accounts in some cases you need to have your a theorem key or your normal theorem will have been a contract base account and in some cases you need to have your own peeler alert your own sidechain stylist is the state channel or plasma car like if it was a bank account if you want so these are like three wellnitz and people of course ask why do we need another one no seriously why do I need another volunteer repeat this thing they know they have to do this yet but they don't grasp the meaning and Wallis to date and make the effort to explain what are these things and of course if you can just pour them directly here obstructing this information and getting them directly onto later too if you want or explain if you want what is one wallet why doing it another wallet etc Vika token this is a problem state channels and all the plasma say hey you can onboard with any token deposit any token so a new user goes there and see that which one do I choose and there is a lot of things with all the easy easy and this is one of the questions we have like which one do I take you know well what the is a token also is the one questions and which one should I pick and what am I paying this tube yeah so they have no clue of why you have to die doing this and white or everybody confusing with wallets so pattern here is game of tonality new users simplifying just one option maybe die or whatever and expert the s you can expand and chew their own always be there and options until exit maybe you decide when you exit and explain better the difference this was one of these solutions from the previous framework that works then what's your language is the end another pattern that all these people start using developer lingo okay these words don't mean anything and deploy doesn't mean divide this is a factual question user had so floor legged to later one doesn't mean anything at all for usual so experimentally - yes it's experimental its internal for us but not good for non people users we had so simplified language hi the technical complexity possible which was a solution then using the system you're on step 2 and right now this is not a diet okay this is one of the biggest insights if you want of others research they were very confused because these wallets there's different by the wallet single state channels in plasma etc they all use dye but when you are inside of these networks the dye of network one is not the diode network two is not the dye of the main chain so my user is actually trying to send each other die from state channel from the layer one wallet or to another state channel wallet and they did not understand why we're not the same diagram there's no sign whatsoever in these softwares already that this is a custom die if you want so then you try to send it to a friend okay this is one of the insights that we are multiplying the complexity not simply funny unfortunately and so solutions here is of course like God it was retaining the design principles a very long time ago define now explain what the network you are using you need to be transparent about that or you make it interoperable this is a an invitation for all the layer two and developers to talk together and say hey yes we can call it die if somebody tries to send it to someone else we should behind the curtains be comforting and I'm pouring this on to the other network and more work together somehow I'm better naming of course because of this problem here the many tokens okay maybe they should be called die space channel once I plasma one and spectrum I saw that so also because they could find each other better so this is not a time what else multiple transactions this'll go very fast away there is a the ideality protections go very fast but in the case of plasma you still need to have nonces and wait for a transaction to be there and plasma has the problem that the finality of that transaction is not instant in say channel is instant as soon as you receive it that's it in plasma you need to wait that this information is actually put the 32 blocks later but you can assume that everything but there is that problem of timing in there and there's a new pattern emerging of using state channels inside plasma channel which is an open question how that works although we work for the users over question and for me personally I think that we should find a technical solution to overcome transaction sequentiality the announcers have confused a lot of users that they needed to wait until one transaction came back or that has passed and talk about using like there's generic problems like you on board it but then you don't offer the next thing there is a user like say what do I do now I don't know so it said free but I continuously see different transaction fees and I they they don't understand what these transaction fees are so you need to be wary of using the right words because this is actually I said it was fog it says free but it's a worse than monopoly they are screwing me and every step we made this was actual comment so that we had very snarky users and design the users next step this is basic behavioral design doesn't pertain to their - and don't say free or don't say layer one what your name was again etc open questions phases because not much could be used yet again there is this idea of agreements in state channels when you enter a channel with someone okay you are making an agreement about when the exit will happen how long it will take okay so this agreement is a new pattern okay there is not yet anything that we could test I personally think that we should make them flexible and dependent on the amount of balance that you are exiting if you are editing one coffee value you simply do it right away or it's two minutes or whatever if you are exiting two hundred dollars or one thousand dollars maybe that time span expands flexibly right now in space so that's one of the things that I think they need to work on and how are we going to manage many open channels because if it's peer-to-peer technically I could have a channel with each of you in my wallet I would have like thousands of lines or if I have a hub I would have the hub with a thousand align with people like might have connections with the apps will be installed in my wallet and this is good to hear that also minimize yesterday's introduce the fact that they have these plugins ideas that you will have absolute side of your wallet to to manage and yeah you need to differentiate these things and yeah I was stationary cytoplasm will work we have no food hide as much as possible interoperate this is what these solutions so probably are and exiting the system this is the science fictiony because right now it's only ideas there's nothing implemented the only company that had designed something is seller is again actually seller x worth it at the job in calling it court mode okay so they use a nice language to explain that there is a challenge happening and how it works and so this idea of exiting that you could have challenges happening okay it has a requirement on the technology that you as a user need to be looking all the time at the chain this is no no go for ux so there are people coming out with watchtowers these are the name one of the company's called pisa is becoming in the watchtowers and and so this is one of the unknowns how this part will behave you know for from the user perspective my opinion is users won't need to worry too much about the challenge if you can find it there's a consensus or there's three different approaches right now either the app itself watches the change for you so if you connect every once a week or whatever it solves it automatically for you if you or they have by the service of a watchtower so it's a service and it's looking addition is a name you have a problem i'll send you notification on your phone about basis fate or dollars among the people participating in this channel saying that company product or user is being malicious I'll kick him out and simply offset for the user in plasma you are also you have also these multiple speeds to exiting okay since in plasma right now one of the Constructors to have two weeks or one week when you actually exit before you can get your money okay there are people that are creating crypto economic phenology so there are services that say hey you as a user you don't want to wait one week so let me take your risk I'll buy your one you're either within one week for one percent fee or for two percent fee so there are services that are going to gather a thief for you to recover your money right away a user wants to recover the money right away and this is the original solution this is why I'm not totally convinced about the plasma construct especially for my user perspective but those are solutions that are coming and so you see there's a more complexity still rather than less which was my hope and in general in the whole space and in layer two space as well we need to balance or explain better this idea between cost and responsibility okay and in later to is becoming more a theorem okay you can have more cost or less cost or a bit cheaper the transaction if you as a user take more responsibility on waiting doing watching waiting the X days etc or if you want the convenience is going to be more expensive but it's more convenient so this is something that is unsolved today I think in the whole ecosystem and especially later I'm done most by data so this is the summary basically trying to interoperate so that people are not confused with as multiple kind of tokens try to hide as monster the technological methodologies behind okay and make it simpler to the user use Universal login type of wallet or contract based wallets or accounts so that users don't need to store private keys etc we simplify that initial step and maybe we have something to onboard my mother and my brother thank you [Applause]
