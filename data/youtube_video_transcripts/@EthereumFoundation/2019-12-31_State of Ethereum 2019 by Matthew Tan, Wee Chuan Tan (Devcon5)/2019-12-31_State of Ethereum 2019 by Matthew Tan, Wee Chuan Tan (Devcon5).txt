[Applause] so to all right expletive I am weak and I'm an attainable missile with a sexual intercourse with some of our genetics before we talk into hysterics jen has the main compartment in this vision and getting closer will [Music] this is a [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] possibly be the reason some people price questions and not just minutes for those projects including taxes next we'll look at address the very solution there are worse things xfinity in addresses and excluding their process but the summaries are all that 6% on basis and once it receives it as the 0.03 some addresses the bells of more than 1000 the post of course almost does apply Ethier is known for a smart contract government loves all contracts and according to the watching the mayhem most of the sorry that we saw you to our JavaScript language and you know even so fools over hundreds of 2010 irrelevant honnestly and censure roll through subdivision Network and accessories in divorce - Ashura and sentimental are you very much from a transaction sometimes respond and they've got a lot of [Music] [Music] it's a new top on the spider dropping probably looks mostly as mother was that we're not doing points for you guys has a bottom any weapon or partisan trying to have trouble 2% full run Joe needs now water crisis is far countries are comfortable with it's practical and it's important to track in originals countless others disappear every day there's other patients ah marriage to those times just under 7,000 and it looks like yet and you [Music] the sometimes that when there was also fun Francis has been thin slices and he has network the network implies a justice at all I'm a college is possible with every people - degrees of [Music] [Music] [Music] so one way to post is of course look at what existing end points and we think of if we can build solutions so and divert strength reduces so what that right now is not that is usually issues and power this common and use a bit points will be an awesome time so the token ad schemes can be pretty confusing at times no yes TUSD was a security hot hot follow token versus a very similar and the the go skate has Louie or the investment community refactor so often there is a lag time perhaps in the UI after confirmation time this computer and this company occurs and exchanges and so the user gets pissed answers expects the gate immediately and when is not it can get 10 G's the specificity is like what do you do when a transaction fee so questions are all guess we filter or some other airports so especially dismisses asking about why dia consumption still and what are the next steps they need to take this yes we are you forward focus will cash deposit every bank accounts so essentially users who want to cash out not going on do so stay tuned all right so that's good what can we do so we have Katya so I think we'll definitely have additional information on what to do next when I network first did you have a tablet or better still like why did he occur in the first place and what are the steps that they can take in order to prevent it from happening and a lot of confusion with sending to the wrong addresses the Warriors are using human readable as it seems but DNS services and when it comes to security always assume that everything can be in hot water it's not natural it's per pen and when that happens what are the next and as simple and it's often a cache of program uses economy but can't eat ketchup and here's an idea for a damn refundable confections tendus be done so I understand that it goes against the human body introduction it's all right [Music] so so what I'm going to do is using chef's job and data derived over the last few years and work first believe a model of what to do in reserve okay so Valentina sizegenetics one of the first few interesting things we found were the last year's contractor she's you know Georgia distance so it was back in Mississippi the u.s. been up for five percent of the doozerdom progress in 2017 we know that increase or users coming from China and this trend continues into 2018 and in our users in China was imperative go fast forward to 2019 is funny top five users you know essential facts with China coming not include us for the u.s. Germany Ukraine and so I think we understand where users are pizza yes to be a cool night optimize located on servers figuring out like which then this support or deciding where to allocate success for user so this is on a slightly related topic right so from probably understand right so one of the criteria or design confusion Thank You Tommy did here is that we messed up the previous definitions and compare them in the following year user location demographics what so from our casual observation we found that your past four years that there was indeed an increase in the percentage of users from locations where sorry you see this textual observation /qe host true the Messier defcon5 whether God every sees increase of adoption [Music] however what I expect of you maintenance these even over the last few years at least one increase in the proportion of female users so that 2017 only 8% the users first of all very naive we see this number Tavella [Music] so ability market demographics essentially segmentation for user interests and marketing activity so look at the ability in market attitudes we just we see a study from unit and traditional parents office and technology and those interested in financial and investment services so compared with the previous years you know this is a slide she means we can tree so for general you signed up and analysts are elected in elasticity you use a browser and screen resolutions and from here you see that the majority of users use the Chrome browser and review and Safari and spa fitness screen resolution speed 19 20 and then he keels after using a desktop service and this is the okay so for the first category we see more more users interacting through mobile phones on a desktop interface expected number users using mobile devices to make up moved an aspect of the users over the next 12 months so as for use operating system so the bedrock is Windows 8 for Android I know the vaccaei check that one is asleep last year more Windows users are interacting alright so coming to the party bus picked up as a single device type we - c'mon Suraj Parthasarathy as my stinky odors that quality operational readiness of mind please do is the book but they are in and that's what their mobile systems I pretty much quality USB Dom will encourage capturing the large contractors okay so one thing and all it because and this data and he right ready 1983 music assalaamu that email from industry in fact they form located in China in us yogi Ukraine software Technical University services use the windows-based PC and provost right also and all likely to give us an apple I put some some operators poverty right back alright so summing up sorry so firstly we tend to see an increase of our temperature ratio surprise because in 2070 was nothing des koala with the business 390 we have actually reached ecosystem of robotics was that as well shifting you geolocation demographics as we did that back in 2017 China was great market today number users coming from China is proportionally larger what our PC increased gender diversity past patient we double a proportion of female users so the user interest groups they remain relatively static but we did not increase the drainage tunnel technologists so relax Warhawk but there's still a long way to go for mass adoption it does not appear making baby steps to us both mysteries all right that competition [Applause]
