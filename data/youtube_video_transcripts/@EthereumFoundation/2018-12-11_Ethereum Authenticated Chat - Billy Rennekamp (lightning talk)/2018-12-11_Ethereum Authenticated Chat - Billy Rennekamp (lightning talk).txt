everybody my name is Billy developer researcher and artist I work for cosmos Network gnosis and for myself on various of the project one of the things I think that most started excited about which were working with aetherium and all these different currencies is the the fact that you actually sort of get exposed to cryptography in general a symmetric cryptography in and you kind of realize all the cool things you can do with that and it's really exciting that actually it's cryptocurrency which has been a push to get kind of normal users to have a private key to manage spread key to have something like venomous so thanks to cryptocurrency you kind of get all of these really cool features and the past few months or whatever there's been multiple situations in which for my own apps I had to do authentication with meta mask where you kind of are able to do this amazing medication system where you're not storing a password for a user or preventing or presenting some sort of a password honeypot that you actually let your users sort of authenticate themselves you see this at crypto kiddies you see it a lot in an absent so I did that a few times and talking other people other projects kept coming up of oh you know actually don't really even need a cryptocurrency to that you just need to use with a private key that can do something X Y or Z and for different reasons it kept coming up like oh yeah just authenticate them with their for the signature on something and then give them access to whatever the most common version of that was a chatroom so a couple weekends ago I just decided to spend something up the point of it being what's possible when users and there are private keys so because it was a weekend project I decided to do it as fast as possible so I used a bunch of evil centralized services many things go really easy they do a lot of the work for you but basically this is a chat room built with Google firebase who offers really simple pub/sub databases it's hosted on a service called amplifier which is just basically a wrapper for a soft web services using Amazon Web service lend a function for verification of user signature and I'm using amber data that ayah which is a kind of block Explorer who keeps token balances for all year C 20s and years e720 ones so if you just want to ask a for a specific address and get all of the ears a 28-7 West tokens they up they have an API endpoint for that which you don't really have it either stand or really even at open sea so I'm using that for that but uh without further ado I can show you that the app works basically by clicking start asking you to sign a message helloworld by signing this message blah blah blah sends it to land the function which make sure you actually have that address check Samper data for all your talk of balances and then gives you authentication inside of google firebase for every single chat room that is named spaced by those contract addresses so here you can see inside this account I have some crypto keys some web I made another project called ENS 50 which is an empty wrappers for NS names so because I have those like in chat in that room yes see there's a couple of people who had cryptic kitties who joined the chat at some point there's the lobby where as soon as you sort of been authenticated you can jump that and that's kind of it I guess I can prove that actually in here or the Berlin token so if you were here during their hackathon and you've got any of these you can sort of prove or associate me with the people who also have them right here so that the fact that I'm actually in there or not maybe showed up any other room so I mean this is super simple this is something that ends up popping up in a lot of different projects it can be used for elective and things as I see more sort of interesting non fundable token projects that are based around not necessarily speculating on a project but having a community based around it maybe the proof of work that goes into it is something more interesting that spending computer cycles or paying money it is actually showing up to meetups maybe it's extra strength depends means knowing somebody maybe it's gifts maybe it's these kudos I get coin the idea that you would want to sort of create an access determined by those sorts of communities there's something coming up more and more often and so I spot this up it's on github the authentication stuff super easy to the lambda whether you want to use it with something like firebase or their own social network or whatever you'd have basically the same configuration so it's not about just to get my mind around how to buy the different things we'll be applying it to projects for fun and profit maybe but mostly just to see how it works feel free to jump in I use Portus actually I should list that on here too what does that do is a really nice solution to users who don't have wallets so it's basically a mascara I think it's the meta mask alternative where you sort of embed madam asked as a Jas spot they give you an address they store your key encrypted so that when you use username a password they will end it back to you you decrypt it in your browser you can have the same experience so if you put it up on Safari or Google Chrome on your phone you could actually log in and start chatting probably you just be in the lot of you because you account without any token balances but that's their ready to use this is just a weekend project just like talk actually it may I mean like three four years back or whisper first time we use whisper and we hope somebody will you know like updated to the latest whisper because the cherubic is never really saw the day of life for real it's positive and maybe people easily you said interface for your little chat here just overtake it and takes it where messages are retrieved and send this publish whatever you hear it's called these four meters something whisper chat either under theorem or my first point new minimis process word asks you but you better not ask you to connect with the Deaf when you restarted does that actually design a message under the hood so so that's still you even have to do the signing over the first time you visit if you've never come to this site before that mask will stay this site once here on your address you say yeah but my address bed mats will say you want to sign this message so once you touch my first time doesn't happen so that's why didn't happen and also you should check out these they're down somebody told me about a week or two ago and I mean it's not like science but it was a nice project why do you use and why don't you do on education client side because the cool firebase handles authentication for the users do you have permission to read and write product all right this is basically a giant choice an object and each like branch you can get a reading write permissions based on user IDs so first I checked your token balances and then I gave you reading write permission on all the branches that are namespace by those tokens so in each branch has all the chats within each of them so I need a private server somewhere who stores my firebase private key or authentication in order to give permission on a user to read and write to different chat rooms otherwise you just show up and NH Evremonde read and write to it it's not the the mapping between the user name and that is more like yeah that kind of access to be for anything it could be like a tutorial style it could be for a blog post it could be from movies for songs whatever hi confession regarding a signed message isn't it security it's always the same message because if someone gets a hold of it they could just act as you because it's basically your identity right yeah if you wanted to be a little more security should put a timestamp or an ox or something like that so that they can be timed out after a certain period it's what I'm doing with my project yeah I think that's a great way to go hi nothing it's very very serious and this presents
