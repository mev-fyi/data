[Applause] hello everyone hey hey hey what's up okay I'm not stop for matter because a little Japanese class how many of you here for the first time into her like 30% 30% ohayo gozaimasu good morning Ohio kanpai Cheers hello chain it's boxy Sonia okay okay we gonna stop yeah so I'm gonna talk about like about Japanese ecosystem maybe three miko system since we in japan a little bit of a history of it and then how far we be you know growing coming so far so this is me in this use kov not people call me Obi Obi Wan Kenobi ourselves i co-founded in japan really well like three years ago and also when I said that years and also a nice conference call not Tokyo and I'm starting a new company Oh No so before if we did I ecosystem stuff I'm not talk a little bit about the history of Japanese Tyrion / developer ecosystem so before like January 2018 like to palace or about you know investor speculation so I'll say there was a big new comedy fouled or like you know investing 3 : it's very annoying nesting icos and there was almost no like like a developer community activities so there was even like you know the idol group codependency girls is like two singles but it's got my a mess blockchain check it out this is the girl representing us Ariana and this is the anything girl also represent he's really so well so it's been all fun but you know we wanted to change a little bit to more focusing on like developers so we started on community and in March 2000 we had a first big event so we organized this Nina of the University of Tokyo and then we brought speakers like Batali I just gonna curl people on these projects yeah this is Alex speaking fizz's me I was wasting here back there yeah so hotel we call like 500 people a lot like the Japanese media newspaper companies and yeah that was a great kick start of the Japanese community so since then oh yeah on the next day because I have like ECF launch yeah so gonna talk about like was being happening after this like it would be certainly not in Japan so standing from developers startups so this been like a lot of like grassroots activities going on so uh as a certain developer Kimiko high ether organizing interim Developers Conference oh hai Kaun from last year that they wanna do it again nothing November and then there's like more like student young people focus community that I thought I started called crypto page and then there's being like a mouse the very hub for launching meetups going on cold like Tokyo I'm gonna show you a little bit of pictures Gavin go hop like so I guess so they get you mean to leading workshops yeah like a several like we can hack assault for students so things since then we have at least like two or three developer meetups or activities activities in months and thousands of vortex is the in Turkey and some guy from cryptic comics electron plasma white paper and a lot of developers were getting excited about plasma and yeah this is the very far and the cryptic you have have a lot of actually most of them like that the real players do users on the 50p fellas these meetups like cops yes and for the last year's that phony pride even though that's super powerful so do you have like I think about fifteen twenty students and the whoppers okay this like a this is the Kazakh organized is the first developer focus watching the conference in Japan I like these members this is the F climb this year in April in C and I think this is the first big international intern come friends that house like Japanese developers from like Leia economic stuff most of them will be presenting up and come later and not only just like you know growing existing box chain the progress we also like try to bring more new like developers of boxing space into introductions on staff as eg know hash have organized during the hackers are called decrypted around 500 very new developers into blockchain like running around box chain and feeling something on the weekend and towards this year's that one from Japan community has been organizing meetups called road to death part we have like Oh meetups in the past four months in total over 200 people join when Iowa's in town acting all very merciful Suspiria and yes very poor and then this is the like a very short list naughty student is exclusively spotter I created back in June and then I have updated a little bit more so this is like waiting like four five months they have we have like more and more like that you know active players in a space there's a lot of startups and walking spaces or like educational centers for developers also like for people to the blockchain there's like a a very good like a block shake specific media one of them is here on the economy so if you're interested in Japanese market if you if you hope to get interview just talked to guys talk to this guy and you have also like a lot more like consulting focused companies trying to like dedicate it enterprises and then build something together yeah okay so enterprises this is also the less like afraid of our community so we have a lot of like you know the tech giant's against article exchanges like raft a lie SPI and stuff and also we have lot of like non tak traditional companies started feeling some projects using box chain and then some of the traditional media companies like Nikkei or Dentsu or fu Japan started more broadly a specific video explaining more focus on luxury and companies fight with true Tamura the biggest investment bank in Japan so SPI have been investing a lot in blockchain startup probably some of them invest directly in tokens and if their Enterprise is terrible I have just got a I asked the chairman Alliance and these I think five or six companies from Japan are being Alliance including the KDDI of the biggest temple telephone company in NPD data of the Research Institute included too and I think one interesting things that are happening in Japan is the next star block she started I just do these have been in like kind of like a background of those technovic enterprises and helping them to adopt its variable blockchain technology so like their ex has partnered with Microsoft Japan to support because of Isis to learn about blockchain and help them they could actually block something a little bit and actually Microsoft Japan is being very big supporter 43mph apparently have been creating a lot of localized resources for developers in Japanese another example is like the comics love has partnered up with one of the biggest energy company called chubu energy power to test out like a peer-to-peer training of prospects or energy I think that is like an actual sample with the one of the biggest company traditional confuse is something that's not still happening in most of the Muslim places in the world especially like energy sectors have been I think one of the most was recives traditional industry viewers option okay the last thing is about students young people so so April last year I have organized the first option meetups for students and I wanted to like maybe focus on young people is because when I first started to dream space I noticed like most of the people driving this ecosystem in the world was actually very young people so I wanted to like encourage young people in Japan to yoga what Shane and I was hoping some of them you know studying your own project product developing other resource projects together with the people around the world so this Mina was very successful we have like 150 people all students joining us and after that some of the students in pop University's creative block saying research groups are like walks generally I think the two biggest one is like a big bears from Waseda Thurston and big penguins from University of Tokyo series that is really something Oh God some students from those groups have been to Hong Kong to join the conference I think that this was one of the biggest we did young people last summer like aya spoke in front of people only under 25 years old talk about what is it how boys have foundation the wine and [Music] what's funny was like after this event I talked to me like she was kind of you so disappointed about Japanese community or market because she used to be at the sheer speed ahead of that bracket depend and she was mostly just interacting that they are regulators or just all people in industry but this was almost her first time to actually in collab with the very young people who are passionate about watching and then after the event she survived she started having a hope for Japanese ecosystem again yeah so I think without like less like people you know community in Japan I think this step on it also wouldn't happen and you know having disliked very iconic event in blocks industry in Japan was like one of my you know very ambitious goal when I started doing that meetups about two years ago so I'm very happy to see everyone here today thank you so much for coming to Tokyo and yeah that's yeah end of the presentation but what I want to emphasize is like I didn't have a wedge thing a lot of you will come up again to Japan and then you know yeah so you might place a lot in fact it's not even a comment on the documentation about this of the day we talked a substance one day my god it's that it is to everyone small nuances any question maybe one more [Music] are you certain posts are chatting while you are doing I think so we may be dead for six I think like around like October November you ji-sung be great Baptists Antonio so like this year we have a coin as Japan organized a conference and then as like no Tokyo also hosted a developer focused event as well say oh so yeah I'm trying to make it like Tokyo watching week sometime next year also maybe like the first ever eats Tokyo hackathon at least I already have at least talked about Kanto being already so yeah I think this is the end of the time so thank you very much and if any of you still have questions just reach out to me and happy to answer have a good time together thank you [Applause] you
