all right Trinity is today I want to talk to you about Trinity Trinity is a client for the theory network similar to get their parity we are however in an alpha stage don't use this in production yet this is a project I started around two years ago we had our first public alpha release earlier this year and in August we had our first successful sync with the etherium Network here's some numbers we've got three full-time engineers on the project I have put two years of my life into this and it takes about ten or more days to sync with the network which is slow right now we're working on a couple of things main efforts are on making synchronization faster the research team from Taipei is working on implementation of the beacon chain in our base EVM library and today I want to talk to you about our plug-in API which is the cool part as far as I'm concerned a good way to think about plugins is that they're similar to extensions for a web browser they're like a native way to extend the functionality of the client and rather than I figured the best way to talk to you about what these can do is to talk about some use cases that we foresee happening one of these is application specific JSON RPC endpoints a lot of applications have a lot of business logic tied up with them often the developers of the applications or protocols know how those things are supposed to work and being able to expose these at a high level through the JSON RPC API it's just a better user experience at least that's what we think so we are one of the use cases we see is the ability to expose JSON RPC a new JSON RPC endpoints to your users through our client another thing that I don't know if I made this word up but protocol daemons a lot of protocols have a need for like an off chain actor to perform some actions things like that and these are often shift shipped around as their own binary and you have to link it up to a running aetherium node we foresee packaging these up as a plug-in as like a much better user experience anybody who's already running the Trinity client it's like gonna be a one-click install type thing and make an on board to your protocol and what we're shooting for is entire the ability to implement entire protocols altogether so we're gonna be looking at whether or not we can implement the beacon chain using this API similarly at some point here I suspect swarm and Whisperer will be on the table for plugins and I would love to get even broader beyond our own personal ecosystem and get things like IP FS but this is the one that I'm most excited about a couple weeks ago this thing showed up on reddit one of the members of this community made this this is a in terminal wallet that has like a cursive style interface and when myself and my team saw this we got really excited because for a long time I thought UX is always going to be in the browser user land is always in the browser and while end-users are not likely to use terminal applications there are a whole suite of use cases that are absolutely suitable for a cursive style interface and we think that there's a lot that can be done here and we want to enable that that through plugins we are dogfooding this API pretty heavily we have converted a bunch of our internal things to be plugins we are considering and and we have the idea of converting our entire synchronization to be a plug-in so this is an API that's new it's an alpha we got the documentation up today I encourage you to go check it out but now I want to do something completely different so the original idea for this talk was for me to tell you a story about Trinity how it got to where it was today and where it's going but as I started working on that I had a hard time digging my personal life out of that story all of you have a story how you got here today how you got into blockchain and why you do this work and I want to tell you my story I spent three years of my life doing this three years of code three years building and creating three years steeped in the uncertainty unsure if I'm making a disparate difference but desperately wanting things to be different I'm back at the beginning now it's 2013 my newborn son takes his first breath while the cpu on my laptop spits out one more shot 256 overheats and burns itself to death the Silk Road is open now the Dread Pirate Roberts shows us something new my mind expands while the weapon tracks citt√† she has given us a glimpse of a world without walls but the walled gardens continue to grow my son is one now it's late in the Attic Tanvi main lines yet another blog post about this Ethier iam thing I spend money I don't have on an idea I don't understand but a small seed is planted in my mind my mind the part of myself I hold most dear powerful flawed beautiful but wracked with unspoken pain crumbling and falling to pieces my son is too now to seed lies dormant darkness encroaches my demon is coming my demon has no name and it destroys everything everything that has come before consuming me from the inside leaving me hollow broken the shell of a person and like so many times before I could fall into its embrace while it tears my world to pieces given and let go while it burns everything I love everything I hold dear my marriage my life my son my son is 3 now my daughter is born my demon is at bay my demon has a name its name is depression and in naming it I can know it and in knowing it I can fight it but the fight is brutal and I am in pieces but I put the pieces back together I will not let this define me in the seed is sprouting now the seed is growing spreading its roots taking form and I'm at the frontier the network takes its first breath and my mind breathes it in at work I build I create but I am uncertain is this real is this the force of change that I've yearned for can we really build this new thing we're a few but we are strong we know it can be better and for the first time I feel empowered we are in this together a community distributed but connected we create fulcrums with game theory and economics we create levers with protocol and code we want to move the world my son is for now he is strong-willed and kind my daughter is one now she screams less and smiles more and I am remade the molecules and memories remain but the whole is something new and I start work on something new I work alone I am isolated but I am inspired I am building the lever I want to move things I want to make a difference but I'm afraid my an imposter I am uncertain I work at Build I create is this real I think it's really feels so real my son is five now he starts kindergarten when he grows up he wants to be a ninja programmer trash truck driver spy literally my daughter is two now she is joy incarnate and an unstoppable force of nature when things don't go her way my demon is always with me I will never be rid of it but now I know it I medicate it there's always there I will never be rid of it I work I build I create there's six of us now and I no longer work alone but I'm Austan lonely but we thrive we create and build together we have a vision we are strong the lever we're building is taking shape we can make a difference we can build something new we can build something better but there's still work to be done we work we build we create remote work has been harder than I ever expected it to be but I have never felt so empowered as I do being part of this community if you take anything away from this it's that you're not alone and we're all in this together thank you [Music] [Applause] you
