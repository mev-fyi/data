I'm welcoming I'm going to give a quick introduction to the next speaker who is a coin centers Peter Van Valkenburg and I will speak for a few minutes first because as executive director of the foundation I am also the main point person for compliance and regulatory and legal issues and we are very we pay a lot of attention to these things because it does make a difference we live in a real world where there are real concerns for any type of blockchain company startup organization and every jurisdiction is different and we operate in a number of them so it's something that I strongly believe people should take seriously for your own benefit for your own protection and for to be able to further the innovation technology that we all do here that we all support we are not that organization that is more like a 501 C 4 we are truly a you know we're Swiss stiff tongue which is closer to a 501 C 3 and we support research and development and the education and outreach that surrounds it however we still have to deal with regulatory considerations and I've personally invited coin Center to come and make this presentation so that we can address it and get it out of the way and enjoy the rest of the the technical presentations that we have lined up for the retina next three days so Peter yeah thank you so much Ming thank you so it is a tremendous honor to be sharing the stage with all of you I didn't know you'd still be here but honestly the work you all do is incredibly inspiring to me a humble regretting liberal arts graduate who foolishly went to law school but thank you so Thank You Ming and thank you to the etherium foundation for inviting me my name is Peter I come from coin Center I come from the government but I'm here to help unfortunately to do something super lame and give a disclaimer because I'm a lawyer I am a lawyer but I'm not your lawyer the following talk is for educational purposes sorry um if you need a lawyer you should hire a lawyer does this clicker work it doesn't oh okay so what the hell is coin Center hmm coin Center is a nonprofit that's based in Washington DC and I'm going to put our mission up here but it's probably better if I just talk about a little bit of my background so I as I said decided to go the liberal arts route went to law school while I was in law school I started becoming very interested in Bitcoin this was around 2012 I got very close to setting up a pretty powerful mining rig and then there were exams and other things and I got distracted and it's one of my big regrets in my life but nonetheless learning about the technology while also learning about the law gave me a unique perspective I thought I always wanted to work in copyright law or digital privacy because those are areas where the Internet has already disrupted a lot of expectations as to what is possible to enforce from a government policy policy perspective and what is not but Bitcoin came around and gave me an opportunity to work in a very new area that's being disrupted which is financial services regulation which is the Internet as far as truly decentralizing it and building at the it should have been built from the beginning so I got a Google fellowship to go work in Washington DC in policy I worked first for a think tank that was doing copyright and surveillance this was around the time of the snowden links and then a guy named Jerry Brito who I share on the number of mutual friends with came up to me and said hey Peter do you want to be the director of research at a Bitcoin think tank and I laughed I laughed at that and I said that's ridiculous nobody would do that and no such thing exists but then I said yes and we've been around now for two years so our passion is defending these open networks so in a nutshell mission aside we want to be to decentralized computing networks with open consensus mechanisms to crypto currencies in general what the e FF was to the developers of the early Internet a point where you can find a go-between with policy makers in DC where we can communicate the value of the technology where we can set an anchor bias in some policy makers so that they don't see this as just another way to sell drugs or subvert authorities we have a full-time professional staff with three attorneys on staff we have support from the number of key businesses in the space some of the big Bitcoin startups among them but also some of the venture capital firms that are financing a lot of the work in this space but actually over half of our support comes from individuals who are passionate about this technology and want to see it flourish additionally I should point out that like the e FF were not a trade association we set our own agenda we don't represent specifically any of these companies as I said we want to help smooth the path to decentralizing all the things and so if people want to support us in our mission and believe in the work we do we take their support now what do we do we do education policy research and advocacy patient is sort of the big part of this because especially when we started two years ago the amount of knowledge on the ground in Washington DC and in policy circles globally was very poor when it comes to what a cryptocurrency is and how it works and what it can do we also do Policy Research where there is a existing law that potentially applies to something you're doing using the technology and there is an open question as to how that existing law should be enforced because the existing law is drafted in a vague or a broad way we develop policy research that advocates for a way to enforce that law that allows regulators to still meet their statutory obligations because that's what Congress put them there to do that's what their legislatures and their respective states put them there to do but still provides the freedom to innovate as much as is possible so we're trying to find a peaceful way forward basically we have a series of plain language explainers of discrete topics in this space we have a fantastic background herbai vitalik explaining Bitcoin in a way I mean it takes whoa explaining aetherium in a way that will make sense to policymakers we deal with a number of different topics also at the legal intersection of these technologies some of these are also useful resources for developers aside from policymakers because they explain a difficult beagle construct like Oh FAQ which is US sanctions law we develop policy reports that deal with bigger topics like securities regulation access to banking for companies and consumer protection laws particularly difficult in the United States with the state-by-state money transmission licensing set up and periodically most of our advocacy is done face-to-face meetings with policymakers but we do periodically file and regulatory proceedings so just recently for example we filed with the European securities and markets Authority I didn't know if any of you have seen the paper they put out they basically said something like we're really excited about blockchain for securities but we understand that it will only ever be closed or permit Ledger's that will be used in these systems personally I think there is value in permissioned Ledger's I think there is low-hanging fruit in reconciling siloed data structures even if it's through a consortium consensus mechanism but I think that the conclusion that only a closed consensus mechanism is suitable for high-grade financial services is premature so we filed a comment in this explaining how so many of the advances that are essential to financial services are being developed in the open space the pioneers here are the people working on a theory and are the people working on Z cash for example with zero knowledge proof you mentioned ring signatures earlier the only way that all be privacy for financial services data is through the things that are being developed in large part on these open networks we testify we've briefed members of the European Parliament we've had several different engagements in our two years and we love etherium we really do so in the early days we focus mostly on Bitcoin and there's a reason for that this was about two years ago it was hard enough to get a meeting with someone in Washington DC to discuss Bitcoin but at least Bitcoin was something they already knew about and they already wanted some answers about that is beginning to change now and we start to talk more about just open consensus mechanism driven networks and what they can do and the idea I think of having a general-purpose decentralized computing system is incredibly exciting so again thank you for all the work that you do and explaining that to policymakers is one of the most worthy things I think I can do with my time in DC so with that I'm going to turn to the less happy side of the talk and talk about some regulatory considerations for people who are developing decentralized applications and that means this talk is going to be about securities laws so why securities laws first because they're heavy duty regulation these are laws that say seek permission do not seek forgiveness and if you didn't seek permission there will be strict penalties additionally a lot of crowd sales and pre-sales may subject developers of these technologies to securities regulation several scams over the years have drawn attention to this area already and several vocal pundits many of them from the closed-door consortium consensus mechanism side of the technology will freely tell you that they think that all app coin or crypto crowd sales qualify as unregistered securities issuance and I think that's wrong and I think we need to correct those misunderstandings now why US securities laws there's a couple things here if you have any purchasers for a say an app token in the US any of them you are potentially subject to US securities regulations and if you're in a country you're based in a country that has friendly relationships with the US extradition could be possible so this is some serious stuff the US securities laws are by far the most broadly applied of all securities laws and there's a couple reasons for that so in other jurisdictions there's generally a statute a piece of legislation that enumerates specifically which financial products are regulated as securities and then usually which are not what are excluded in the u.s. there is no such enumerated list in the statute there's an undefined term that says investment contracts and the federal courts have interpreted that term and continue to interpret that term to apply to various different schemes additionally the US Securities and Exchange Commission is already investigating the scamming cryptocurrency pay coin take point fence and the Dow I can say has gotten the attention of staff at the SEC and they are actually surprisingly well-informed we've tried to help correct some misapprehensions they had about it and generally flesh out their information but they are surprisingly well in for so why are US security laws broadly applied the definition of security includes an undefined term as I said the term has been defined by federal courts courts have sought to ensure that the definition is inclusive in order to reach and this is a quote from a case the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others for the purpose the promise of profits and that language comes from a case called the SEC versus Howie and it's from that case that we get the Howey test for what is a security or not so in order to really understand these issues we need to quickly actually look at the Howie case I think like a lot of strange and vaguely alarming stories it begins in Florida Howie was a he owned an orange grove in a hotel and he would invite rich New Englanders down to floor is my like this Mike's working now right this is working him and he would invite rich New Englanders down to his hotel in Florida and give them a tour of the orange groves and he'd say look behold the the beauty of Florida's orange fields and then inevitably the New Englander would say something along the lines of oh the orange groves they're so beautiful and how he would say la it's funny you asked that the orange groves are for sale and then he'd proceeded to sell him one acre of the many acre orange groves that he that he owned basically was partitioning his property into a number of parcels into a number of parcels and and selling them as property now when you bought this property you would also be pressured into signing a contract and that contract would say how how no I think now I'm gone yes we'll just go with this so you'd be signing up you'd be signing a contract that says you look to Howie in order to maintain the fields the soil to pick the oranges to sell them at market for a profit it's working now okay good louder okay good so you look to Howie to maintain the soil the trees pick the oranges sell them for a profit and he will give you the profits from the land that you bought so it needless to say the orange grove turned out to be less profitable than many might have expected there was a lawsuit it went all the way up to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court says this is the exact kind of thing that we want the Securities and Exchange Commission to have jurisdiction over so that's why this is the formative case and from that they created the Howey test which has a number of elements I won't go into specifically but what's notable is that it is immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed by the enterprise and sales of such nominal interests in physical assets have since that case panics into all manner of things sales of beaver pelts sales of condos sales of minks of gold bullion of golf course memberships and condominiums all of these has been have been interpreted as issuance of securities rather than just sales of a physical object or asset and with the SE C's interest in pay coin it is not unreasonable to assume that crypto currencies or some crypto currencies may be added to that list of sales of nominal assets or transfers of nominal rights to assets that qualify as securities and it's because of their interest in pay coin that we created a framework for securities regulation so if you are interested in this area I highly recommend you go to our website coin Center org and you look at the whole framework it's posted there and you read it if you're a developer you will not need to read the first two sections which explain these technologies to policy makers you can skip to the third which draws legal conclusions pay the applicable legal tests and the aspects of the technology that are salient to that test so I'm going to skip through this here are the key findings for people who are developing app coins or DAP tokens the following are less likely to be treated as securities if the token was purchased for its use value rather than merely with the expectation of profits so the line of cases here that build on the Howey test deal with condominiums actually so in New York for example plenty of people will buy a share of a housing co-op now is the person issuing those shares issuing a security the Supreme Court and some of the federal circuit courts have found no that is not the case because while people may expect the condominium that they buy to go up in value they also may be buying it to live in it to rent it it has utilitarian value and those are not the things we regulate as securities another factor the token was purchased at by the way on this previous one the utilitarian value if theoria more ether is a very good example of this so yes lots of people speculate as to the price of ether why isn't a theory and security well one reason is that ether is essential to using the etherium virtual machine you can't run contracts unless you fund them with gas basically and there's this utilitarian core value proposition that saves it potentially among other factors from being a security token was purchased after application is already up and running so in other words pre-sales are going to be more suspicious and the line of cases here comes actually from golf courses and Country Club memberships so basically if you were a developer and you were building a golf course and you wanted to sell memberships to the golf course but the golf course wasn't built yet you were actually going to likely be found as an issuer of a security on the other hand if the golf course is already built and you were selling memberships in those cases courts have said that that is not a security so I don't know if this is interesting to other people or if it's just my being a huge dork for the law but these are two things that the commute actually I think would agree on as far as ways to prevent scams or as ways to judge what is real and what is a scam so if you haven't built anything if you have no hope of necessarily proving anything but you're asking for money more likely to be a scam and if you are selling something that is purely speculative that has no obvious use case more likely to be a scam so the law actually lines up pretty well finally the tokens value is dependent on the purchasers own efforts or the efforts of a large number of other unaffiliated investors users or developers the intuition here is that if I buy gold bullion from an open market I am NOT buying a share of the gold bullion industry of the gold industry there's multiple people who make gold valuable people who dig it out of the ground people who will find industrial uses for it people who find jewelry type uses for it so if there's really a widespread community that gives value to the thing less likely to be a security and then the last thing I want to talk about is some things to avoid so one big one is just using language that suggests that this is a securities issuance this shouldn't ever happen initial coin offering that comes from initial public offering it's almost like you're playing a joke on the SEC which is funny to some people I guess but as a community I think we should find it more frustrating or annoying profit sharing is another term that commonly comes up in securities issuance so if you're using this language to describe your application and the tokens that you're going to be giving for that application or selling for that application you're basically asking for scrutiny from the SEC and that's fine you know I think freedom is freedom I love the open Internet I love the emergence of amazing things and technologies and I'm not here to tell you not to do things I just want to say you should consider the regulatory risks when you do them and not including language like that is one easy way to hedge some of your regulatory risk and this is the big one endorsing risky ventures or claiming endorsements so the securities laws penalize people who are promoters of unregistered securities just as much as they penalize issuers so if you're thinking should I endorse should I put my face on this particular decentralized application think carefully consider your appetite for regulatory risk and then more importantly if you are building something and thinking of putting someone else's endorsement on to some public materials think very carefully have a conversation with them make sure they understand what their potentially signing up for it's sort of it's it's sort of be a mensch because these have potentially dire consequences and so an endorsement should only come when there's truly been an endorsement so in conclusion please please please please think about your regulatory risk appetite when you develop these things when you contemplate having a crowd sale or a pre-sale and please feel free to contact me personally at Coyne center if you have questions related to this we'd love to learn what your building and talk about the path forward because there are definitely legal ways to go forward by structuring the way you actually develop your technology from a issuance point of view thank you very much Peter Van Valkenburg of coin Center
