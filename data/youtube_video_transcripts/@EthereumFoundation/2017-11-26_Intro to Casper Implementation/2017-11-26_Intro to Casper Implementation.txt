all right so since for coming to the first talk at the Quaker alcohol so today I'm gonna talk about Casper implementation and the D I will update the latest status of development that's in our research team okay about me so actually I'm I'm xiaochun so right now I'm working in Metallica's research team as a Syrian researcher so actually my background is coming from security and the privacy and most of focus on the wild wireless networks and the behavior and networks so I'm also a type of amia organizer so if you have any chance to come with typing maybe you can contact with me directly and then I was happy to have you have a presentation there and so right now I'm working on a Casper so that's why today I'm to give you a brief introduction on how we are going right now and I also use Piscean and a pice app - I mean - up Casper so the right corner actually is our Taiwanese local at our Islands logo it's made by Lee is ruined so it is designed by stop our company called army which is also from Taiwan okay so Weis Casper so Casper actually is a next-generation consensus support proof proof stare consented photo in insulin so it's mean it says it's deposit base means that you need to put your deposit into the smart country so then you can become a very teacher and now and so you can start to vote for a particular point so why is why do we need to have a deposit into the smart country because because the validator could do some pep in so if they do some bad thing we can delete layer deposit and also it's the proof that is based on the piece of time for torrents for torrents so that means that if a mole and to cert ability to follow the protocol and no comfort in Brock will be finalized otherwise I mean if an amateur T is less than 2/3 that means the system will get stuck so this is a code like lightnings and this is a kind of situation we want to avoid so I think maybe it kind of confusing but right now we have two kinds of version of Casper in our internal research team and one is designed by the tardicaca code it has verified friendly finality Quecha casper FFG and also we have an hour casper design which is a pie valla which is called Casper CPC I think he will have a presentation this afternoon so yeah the last vel√°zquez but this is super cool so I yeah so don't miss it so today I want to I want to give you a brief introduction of how does Casper work yeah because I think people have already learned some of Casper work on our wiki or on some of the article but because we have true version of Casper I mean talk implementation so it kind of confusing so today I'm just want to introduce you the catch / FF / g so hopefully hopefully after this presentation I can make you to the Casper more friendly today okay so what is the advantage of the Casper so basically because it's a pro of stake proko it doesn't lie it's not like love work so it means that you don't need to buy the hardware to have more I mean computation power to to solve the problem that we code mining so you can get a reward from the poor for work so it is kind of like you know no wasting some electricity so for the green purpose so this is why we want to have a pork steak we want to have a Casper because it's more energy efficiency and the second reason we want to have a Casper is because it's a conical fine energy it's a pretty I mean novelty comes out of the Casper because just like as I say before because you need to put your deposit into a smart country so once you you know validator misbehave then we can delete all stage they are deposit in my country but you know in the pool of work even even the minor have more than you know 51% computation power you cannot just punish it puncher name you how you can do is just focus chain okay let's the reason is we want to reduce the risk of centralization because in the proof deck is the boat weight is actually is dollar by dollar dollar by dollar it means that if you pay one dollar you only can I mean gets the 1 dollar benefit but in the proof work if we have more if you have pretty high computation power it means once if it later if you want to have more computation power the price you need to pay or the course you need to pay is quite cheaper so that this is very different from the probe work okay so yeah so and I think that we need to know this is because this is a busy time for torrents based so yeah once again morning to serve very dated need to follow the poco so no conflicting class will be fine and we need to keep in mind because validator could misbehave so they maybe want to try to get the system stock or maybe they will I mean spit into two groups and in each two groups the board weights maybe is draw so the system can get stuck so yeah as for this kind of situation we need to avoid so high is the change of the Casper so basically our goal is to want to have a ever-growing canonical change just like we have in two of war so the Buc could be coming on by one so everybody will see the sanction that means we can have a data consistent consistency however you know because this is very different from the true of a war because everybody need to reach the consensus so in the proof a walk if there is this only one minor even he has a very low computation power he can still solve the problem maybe he just took a long time but in the proofs take if revegetated to some kind of misbehavior or they or malfunction then the citizen could I mean get stuck so the change problem we need to solve to solve is accountable safety and a crossbow Lebanese and I would explain them later so okay so now I will give you so high it's very data how to become a participant into a Casper so if you want to start to run in a helper you need to become a validator so right now any easier holder can become a validator so for example if you have if we can set a fixed amount of ISA like a threshold to make you become a validator like it may be one south of $5,000 $5,000 you can become one over the validator so basically if you want to become a very data you can just send a request message e to the smart country here that you put your money inside so the smart country actually will record your signature and also it will record you how many deposits I you put into a small country so it could be used to I mean used to reward or used to tyrannize so why is the law of a know very data so just like I mentioned before the big data's job is to reach a consensus via votes so each time when when when the validator see the checkpoints is generating so they were bought for the checkpoint so because so yeah because the checkpoints will come one by one so very today each time in the robot for checkpoints however sometimes because the chain could be folk so maybe la very data could see two different chicken point H it's the same as in the same wrong so like this if if if here the VOC weight of the meditator is morning to third then this system will be fine because the citizen could work yeah because this is a bit person time for turns feature however if the very gate has paid into two groups and each to code each two groups less than 2/3 the insistant will be I mean stuck so this is yeah but this is all easy department we need to avoid sorry okay so what is both wait so actually look the both ways is not everyone hence the same both weights it's actually it's proportional to the total deposits I let the deposit side okay so let me give example so here that we have five meditators and each one have $10 $30 10 10 and 40 so that means they do not have the same both weights the both ways should be 1 1 2 3 2 1 2 1 & 2 4 yeah okay so what is the highest level data's job so if we lay both for the particular check point if these check points it getting finalized then they look very Gator can catch the reward in our small country we need because in each time validator can require consent a request Majesty to say hey I want to join into the Casper to get a reward or being a validator so we will have a type here that so every time you can send a request but also if you think that the investment into the into the Casper is not worthy to do leh also you can make a request to deeper group so it's more like a dynamic of ready to vary data set okay so we know the Casper is called hyper Casper that is because when we see this because the validator need to both follow checkpoints so actually where is the check-in point form right now because we are lay in POS on top of pure W means the tracking points hae is coming from the pure W so every every one hundred bucks would could be a tyre period we call it a epoch and then in each epoch we will have a check in/check a point here so this is a very later and they need to vote for ok and why we want to do the hyporheic has per one the other reason is we want to incent your minor to microwave to POS more smoothly because we can relate they are doing the proof of work the reward they can get maybe is less than the reward they can get from the POS so they can make it acclaim I mean have an incentive to move the micro to POS so we want to hope hopefully we want to make a Kinetico chain and the checking point that could be finalized one by one the more fine l'amour checkpoint getting finalized that means that we can guarantee the more secure this system could could have okay so let's that goat diaper into the votes so what is votes but is basically the basic elements into a smart country so just like I mentioned before everybody to every very data they have a different both weights so but each time when they what for a particular points this kind of ball will recall in Thule smart country so how does the vote stands for and how does it go so in our assistant implementation we we will have a most basic about message and this what message you will have for parameter so the first is the last epic epic epic target and the hashtag and impact sauce and the hot sauce so let me give you example what what does it mean so each time when the check point is is general when the new choke point is generating so the meditator could see the new point so they if they want to vote for a particular point they need to include their it's its target and its source so what does talking means it means I want to vote this target two points so basically it's hash is one fib and each epoch is equal to and which is a reference from the source G is sensible to Nana's buck which other hash is age-defying and each be part in a packer one so the both measure is kind of like it need to include the hockey hash and it's sausage and this is also very day Bob AGG yeah you can vote from here to here and here is the source and this is the target okay so here we see there is a curve here so let me we call it a supermajority link so what a supermajority link if we have a chirp point which has a tacky and the source just like hockey and sauce so the very data evil a vote for this checkpoint and to a moan and to serve elevator board for these checkpoints then that means this is a supermajority link yeah this is also super mature didn't Inc so we also define satisfying sure points what does that mean okay so the first definition the general is is always justify and finalized so I so here always said G is justified so here if revegetated both for this for this chicken point because this is coming from the tooth to serve very date I mean this is coming from the judge vulture points so that means if these check points is it's it's also have to a two-third of married at her vote for that means that this checkpoint is getting justified I think the color here should be a pink okay so why is a finalized checkpoint okay so basically the finalized checkpoints is means that if we have a checking terrified chilling point here and we could have a knowledge just by checking point here and which is the red which is a directed child of the previous checking point or just by checking points then this checking point will work and finalized so this is the definition it's just like a recursive I mean you can recursively do that if the chicken point is net is no he is one by one not let so for the summary this is the hybrid our Casper so yeah hopefully we want to have a lot of a finally checkpoint like this so every 100 bucks or we call a park then the chicken point will get finalized so they to talk about a misbehavior so the bean I talk right now is just a normal situation of how does Casper I mean how does the very tail boats so let's talk about evil of editage could be a big guy or they could be to some 15 so how do we deal with that okay so the reminder later I mentioned that because the validator if you want to become a validator you need to put your deposit so when you put your deposit you also that also means you put your signature and the you are deposit ages record into a small country so let's means we could have each meditators identity so once they do some misbehavior then we can slash their deposit okay so this is the definition of account for safety so at this one sort of total deposit will be staged if two conflicting checkpoints are finalized this is because sometimes unfortunately if there are two checkpoints are getting finalized that means each chicken Point has has 2/3 of working wage so let's means we need to get one set of deposit be stretched so how we need to avoid is we need to avoid the top of all means that the very data could not bow for us different checkpoints in the same Park this is an example just don't control yourself with the stand around and another situation want to avoid is a kind of surround board so assume here so you have already make upwards from here to here from the source this is the target so how could you make another boat from here to here because you have already known this is a justified chicken point usually this issue if you want to make another boat from here to here you should be both you should use this as a sauce and this is a target so this is a the illustration to show that once the validator find another one make a misbehavior he can send his misbehavior report into a smart country and then if it's true then this this meditator who to wrote about the it's the passivity stage and this editor work if some small portion of reward okay so this is a possible Lebanese because I am the only of time so I was just too pretty quick finish so I just want to mention pic here I do not have very I mean verification because in his afternoon your Ichi were to verify Casper if you are interested in its correctly you can just follow his talk also hot so I will give you I will give you an update of our status so basically we were helpers my country who to manager the dynamical very data set and also over the boat Rico will be record in each epoch and we have stage condition inside a small country that means each radiator you will find there's someone to submit big 15 then they could be punished eyes so this is our POC Phi and we call Casper refugee country and we also have a testing language for simulation and later we want to have a testing area to evaluate the correctness however we do not have a particular day - I mean allowing us that this is down because this is also research ongoing research so if you are interested in the Casper you can you can you can click some of the reading from here and this is our HR team and most of people are from Taiwan and virtual is from Singapore and this is our team leader with hard and showy and the cabin right now they are doing shouting and me and Snickers and iron kayo are doing Casper and suchan world what a world plasma later and this is our research team feature and so it stands for listen [Music]
