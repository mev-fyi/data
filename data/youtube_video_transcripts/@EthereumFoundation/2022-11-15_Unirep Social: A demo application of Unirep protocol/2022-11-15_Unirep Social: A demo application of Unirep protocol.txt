foreign [Music] and I'm also from PSE team and I will demo the universe social today and universe social is the example application of unirail protocol so what is unirad so you know actually universe is a cross-app reputation system so uh you can imagine that there are many applications there are reputation system upon them but they cannot communicate with each other so if I use in uh to the application and how can I prove that I own this deportation to a GitHub user so if you just show the screenshot of the Twitter and then you cannot uh you can easily Forge them so unirp is a reputation system that just uh the neural knowledge proof to let users to prove your reputation to another application so you can imagine that unirp is a ERC sender and they they can uh you can issue a token like reputation token and used it in your application so this is a summary of universe that it is a private and non-reputable reputation system that based on zkp so to make it more simpler and in you to use in unirp you can give your reputation and receive rotation and also prove your reputation and one of the universe application is the universe social and it is an anonymous social media and why we use the reputation in the anonymous social media because in decentralized social media we it is hard to um it is easily to spend or you can say something irresponsible so with the reputation system you can you can know and we can avoid people to say something really bad or we can prevent spend and in this social media if user has uh not enough reputation they cannot post or comment in this social media and I will demo what is in a universe social so you can log in with your old ads like Twitter or GitHub account and then the universe social will offset to see if the account has logged in before or no and then the most important part is that actually we are not signing with Twitter or GitHub account we use the semaphone identity so uh the user has to keep this simple form identity and we will just use this symbol for identity in the whole universe social system and then after you deciding you can create a post in this social media and the interesting thing is that um now in this system we don't use the we use the uh it's called subsidy to let users to post and in each airport user has three 30 subsidy and each post costs five five reputation so if after this post you will uh you will minus five reputation oh and also uh to create the post you have to prove that you're signing the uni rep system and also sorry and also you you have to prove that you own the Persona here yeah because in the unirv protocol the users will receive reputation by these personas yeah and in this version of universe social we will have reached text editor so you can use markdown to uh to post and also include images okay when you finish your post and you can create a zkp proof to prove that you own the subsidy and also you deciding in this system okay this generating the zkp proof and we will send it to the blockchain after the it is the transaction was sent and you can look at the uh like it's a scan to see your transaction yeah and the uh when the post is published and other users can boost or squash this post so that is what uh what our at least where the reputation system used because if you see this post is really bad and you can swatched it and you the author of the post will receive this bad reputation and if you receive too much bad reputation and then you might not able to post in the our next few epochs yeah and besides post you can also comment in this social media and also common like you can see here's now there's 25 subsidy here and comment also caused uh also requires user to generate a dkp proof to uh preview signing in this system and also on this persona so it's pretty similar and then you create a they can be proof and with it on chain and then uh in this universe social system we have a user information User info page so you can see what you post and also what you have comment before um okay so and I want to also introduce that we are some upcoming features uh the first one is the edit post and comment features as you can see we post and comment with the to be proof but how can we edit the previous post so uh in this edit function we will generate another [Music] like Persona proof to prove that you are the the author of The Post so you can use the dkp proof to prove you are the author and then you can um uh submit another transaction to uh to this post to edit this post and another feature is that we can set the username with this universe protocol uh so what do you how they use the username work is that a user will query a username request and then the universe social Smart Control will give you a reputation that includes this username so in the next uh in the next episode when you receive this reputation and then you can prove that I own this username so not only the positive reputation and negative repetition and also a lot of things can be proved in uh with the unirad protocol so if you want to learn more about unirad we will have a workshop tomorrow at 10 30. in a ZK Community Hub and also you can follow our Twitter account and join the our this course server yeah okay thank you thank you Vivian um yeah we can take like uh one question hi thank you for the presentation can you please explain what happens on the when you do the guitar authorization are you extracting any information from that um sorry so like uh I saw like doing the login there's like a GitHub pop-up for like I guess some oauth stuff what's happening there um we use the OS only uh without any information just if the user has signing before or not but yeah no more yeah operation okay okay thank you
