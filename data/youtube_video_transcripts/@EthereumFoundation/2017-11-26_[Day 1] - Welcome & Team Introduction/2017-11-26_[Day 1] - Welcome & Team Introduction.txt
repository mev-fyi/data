[Music] thank you I'm gonna try this in Spanish Bienvenue DEFCON three their serum foundation I can Mexico I'm we're a little bit late in starting so I'm probably going to go right into the etherium team introduction the team is the team leads are here and I am just gonna say their names first and then have them come up and stand beside me and after that they will each come up and do a quick introduction of themselves and the projects that they that they lead in the efforts that they lead so Vitalik butterin chief scientist overseeing research Martin spender security lead [Applause] Peter salade you go team lead jolt tenfold a go team like client lien dr. Christian right beast now C++ solidity lead yo Ichi hit I formal verification testing research [Applause] Alec spirit saucy he was um a theorem jf and solidity yan laro remix Piper Miriam I am [Applause] Victor Tron although I think it's d√°niel nagy who will be standing in for him Daniel swarm team flag go Huskies what here come on up whisper whisper team lead average in Fraga representing the mist team and Fabien Vogel Shella of web 3-2 j/s and mist okay Vitalik Vitalik okay hello everyone yeah so I am and as you all know the founder of Ethier iam project and the chief scientist of the etherium foundation and I basically spend most of my time focusing on research problems so this basically has to do with figuring out what the etherium protocol might look like in the future coming up with thinking about working on refining various advancements including proof of stake sharding scalability solutions privacy solutions basically things that will take etherium from the state where it is now into something that actually could be used by decentralized applications that would be used by millions of people so and I the etherium research team has expanded very significantly in the last a few months from only maybe a few people to something like 15 people altogether and it will only continue to grow so and we'll talk about much more of what we're doing a leader over the over the course of today and some of the following days but some of the highlights include Casper which we have in Vlad's iam fear carl Forsch and changwu who is going to be presenting about an hour and a bit right right after I make an introduction to aetherium we have sharding which is a scalability solution that we have a couple of developers starting to work on as well and we're also focusing on just various smaller protocol improvements including things like paralyze ability cache ability something you're here about called stateless clients and this various other smaller but very significant improvements to the etherium protocol so I also I just personally hope that everyone enjoys everything that we're going to present over the next couple of days and you know just listen and I see ya you know see what's here and just you know hope there's something that you find interesting so thank you [Applause] hello everyone my name is Martin sander I work as a foundation security lead which means that I'm part of basically all the projects and trying to ensure that the security aspects someone looks at those and takes care of those during the life cycles of the projects and also not only within the organization but I also work with actors in the ecosystem in general for all the issues concerning the ethereum Network and the protocol and security in its various forms for all these participants and in my talk tomorrow I'm going to talk a bit about a retrospective of what's happened during the last year and how we have improved and in what ways and what work we've done in some snippets of the security field thank you hello everybody my name is Peter you probably don't want to pronounce my family name and currently I'm the team lead at Goethe reom and just I would like to give you a quick recap of what happened behind the scenes over the last year since Shanghai so Goethe had quite a large progression we since Shanghai we actually released mobile libraries for Android and iOS for etherium we have been working and you will actually be able to really hear more about these on the status talk tomorrow and the Wally's talk tomorrow then we have actually developed a new peer-to-peer discovery protocol to aid in private networks and test networks Felix will give a talk about this again tomorrow from 9 o'clock 9:15 3:50 we have been working and released a light client version 1 and version 2 short will probably detail this in a moment we have and we did a lot of things to help developers for example we supported configuration files you probably remember last or that at the beginning of this year where the robson test network fell apart and thus we actually introduced proof of Authority protocol in to go with theorem to have a test Network that's not attackable with a pluggable consensus model that actually has functioned really well for the last year or so and we're already at like 1 million and something we're really proud of that one swarm had a huge never mind I'll leave it to the swarm people it's simpler we introduced a support for hardware wallets for example the ledger and tracer which we're kind of proud of and just to give you a sense of what we're currently working on we kind of feel that one of the biggest issues at least for GUI theorem is performance bottlenecks currently so we've put quite a lot of work into on this front for example we've reduced the database size by about 50% we reduce the synchronization bandwidth by 60% we kind of introduced long or improved long filtering by two orders of magnitude from minutes to seconds and currently we're actually working on in revamping the entire sync mechanism so hopefully we could get a node up and running in maybe two minutes but maybe that's a bit too optimistic but that's our ago and so that's a really really quick recap of the last year and if any of you have any suggestions or anything you would like to see goey theorem support in the following years then feel free to find me and tell me what your pain point is thank you [Applause] hello everyone I am George featherly I'm also working with the Foundation's Goethe reom team I'm mostly responsible for the light deterrence a protocol and the goal ID client this year has mostly been about under the hood developments as Peter already mentioned we have just recently merged the second version of the NES protocol and its implementation in our code base we are soon going to have a lot of nice new features and performance improvements we are going to have a fast lock searching and and ultralight clients and transactional status which we've also feature wise we are already quite good right now the biggest challenge is to expand the team with more people to work on the light client and work out all the important details and finally bring this project out of the experimental research stage and make it a real product thank you [Applause] hello my name is Christina at least now I yeah I participate in several projects and among them are the etherion C++ client the solidity project project and yeah also some CK snarks and over the last year we succeeded to get CPP if you went back in shape and Andre and Pavel mostly worked on that to get get it sync again to the against the maenette so c+ theorem if you remember is always useful to have a third validating client to check the tests and consensus rules and we now implement it snapshot sync so you can sync it really fast and we're yeah removing some for the last race condition bugs so I think C++ is Tea Room should be usable again soon and Greg Colvin is also working on an improvement of the etherium virtual machine as part of the C++ project which is called EVM 1.5 and he will give a talk at some point but I don't remember which talk which date will be on and yeah in in the solidity project we also did some improvements I guess the there will be talks to explain that in detail and especially we're adding a new form verification framework where I will talk about on day 3 I think and then another subject I'm working on is SDK snarks which adds privacy but also improve verification of computations and there will be a separate breakout session about CAA snarks and also a talk by Jakob Eva hat I think on day 2 where he will present a framework to make CK snarks more easily accessible and usable thanks my name is yuuichi Hawaii I write proofs like mathematical proofs sometimes I prove my own wallet correct and I put my own it own it and ask people to attack it and steal my Itza because mathematicians proving something doesn't necessarily guarantee anything about reality to know the reality of SRAM I follow the metropolis changes carefully I translated the Zips improvement proposals into the specification document a yellow paper I work on generating test cases with Demetri Martin's Mindy Jared Guido Casey I also work on the ship last breaths framework for generating these test cases on the sidelines I also work improving caspo correct I talked about that this afternoon thank you [Applause] hi my name is Alex barrack sassy or x''k on github and I'm involved with three projects the solidity atrium Jas and he was him so I'm going to tell you a bit of each of them and so solidity just some of the facts from the last year we had probably 300 entries on the changelog 15 releases and not that many bugs or at least not many bugs discovered I guess the major changes we had from Shanghai includes most of you have seen all of these but includes like function types contract metadata which helps verifying contract and we have also added a new compiler interface which would help in retrieving everything from the compiler in a much better way than it was before now for the next year we really work on a new intermediate language which I will gonna have a talk about after after lunch today and as Christian has mentioned we have a new form of verification framework called an SMT checker and that's almost ready as well but this is that a big part for next year and I would like to thank all the external contributors all the volunteers we had for solidity because the numbers is really growing and we have a lot of good people helping guide now with it here iam j/s we also received a lot of volunteer contributors this year and with the help of them they were able to update all the MGS projects to be up to speed and support Byzantium this is actually very important not many people know about this but it is very important because it really is is used in many widely used projects which include remix truffle meta mask and many others now regarding II was him which stands for a tearing webassembly there hasn't been that much development in the last year mmm but that's due to a few reasons the specification is is practically ready it doesn't include Byzantium but updating it to Byzantium shouldn't take a long time secondly the intermediate language in solidity which I mentioned will enable us to create to compile solidity contracts to webassembly um and also we receive a lot of new contributors there which seems like it will kick-start the project into creating a new client where you soon thank you hello everyone so there's a lot to say on he mix so he mix is web ID I forgot to say this is a way to develop smart contracts and then to run smart contract in a test environment he mix has been I started development like one year and our foe and we are now in the way of improving the UI we already improve the code back-end code and we have what to say so I will be presenting on Friday one talk about timox one important thing that we add since last year is this new why does Abed melt like few weeks ago but we also add new users since few months we have a Makita channel that allows people to give feedback about the you I'll give feedback about he mix the application and we also have an quite importance for a free three new contributors so we have a hub which is everything and we have Nina and Alex with us walking on hammocks and they help the community to improve remix and to go further under control development so for the next I will be giving a torque then on Friday but basically we are in a point where we can be proud of what chemists do now but we still need to work on it and we still need to improve some some stuff in hammocks for example we need to split down the code of remix so it can be used by the community we need also to find a good way for the community to be able to have continuous integration on hammocks and so this is a bunch of walk that will be done in the in the next year and I will be presenting on a Friday some samosas are features that we have made last year and I will be also presenting some new features that have been merged a few weeks ago and yeah I hope to see you around for this week so we can just show you how it works and we can just show you how it's now become easier and easier to develop smart contracts Thanks [Applause] hello I'm Piper Miriam and I'm the Python team lead for the foundation let's see earlier this year and myself and a number of other framework developers came together and established a spec for packaging smart contracts I'll be talking about that a little later today shortly after lunch I am responsible for a lot of the Python tooling in the ecosystem and this year we've been working on maturing that tooling bringing it closer to being up to par with the JavaScript ecosystem and I've been working on an alternate implementation of the EVM and Python called PI EVM and I will also be talking about that later today later in the afternoon over this next year the hope is to bring that implementation online as a new light client node as well as getting broader support and adoption of package management across the ecosystem thanks [Applause] welcome I'm not the victor I'm standing in for him I'm Daniel and I'm the architect of swarm our project has grown a little bit beyond this original scope of providing mass storage decentralized mass storage for aetherium and it also now includes applications like high bandwidth communication between the nodes our team has grown considerably to grow up to today to the new challenge tomorrow we're going to give you a more detailed report on what we are doing and what have we already achieved but briefly I would like to mention a few cornerstones so first of all we have developed a simulation framework where we can test how our network and how the algorithms that we're building are going to cope with various situations at scale like network partition bandwidth bottlenecks or high turn so nodes leaving and joining the network rapidly the first practical application of swarm is being in development it's going to be a cloud storage where people can synchronize data between their devices and also share large files and directories between each other there are third party applications of swarm emerging such as life beer which is going to be live video and audio streaming using swarm as a transport layer and perhaps it is also worth mentioning that we are working on issues such as privacy and censorship resistance so that we can actually support sensitive data and censorship resistant communication so please come to our talk tomorrow and also our breakout session is on Saturday I you [Applause] hello I am vlog Bukovsky and I am working on whisper which is a communication protocol for distributed public applications and it it's more secure mode of operation whisper is supposed to deliver darkness which means that communication is not only encrypted but also not no meta information is being leaked and this is very important for the cause of Liberty and on the last day I am going to talk about Liberty about whisper and how to achieve darkness with it thank you [Applause] hi everyone I'm Everton I'm from Brazil I'm from the maize team miss was first written by Fabian bugger stellar here am i right and alex van der Sonny who couldn't be here for personal and really good reasons I work this year on bonding together some other projects into the browser and dealing with some security concerns which is a primary one for us and we also have Victor Maya which is a really skilled developer who is presenting a new experimental project this this week and we have also mark Guru a really nice guy worked with Redux and his refactoring mist to to be more scalable one for the future well I invite you all to to our presentation on the main hall on Friday 9:40 well see you there hello I'm problem for estella I build the initial mist and working on web 3GS I also built a fume wallet and a few other things probably now known because of the ERC 20 tokens standard I took a metallic initiated working currently in web three.js I will have a presentation on the third at 1:00 p.m. about the 1.0 refactor which is a major refactor and it actually includes a lot of new features and it's right now it's I think the tool which I always wanted to have working on maps and I will also present later today and new ERC I initiated called ESC 7 to 5 it's about identity and you're welcome to join the breakout hall at 3:30 today which is downstairs and maybe a short notice the the Wi-Fi password if you want to know Wi-Fi its attendee is the Wi-Fi name and it's the uppercase 3 attendee lowercase yeah thank you [Applause] thank you all and thank you guys for doing this on time we're actually we have a few minutes but I'm going to invite you to step down and we'll invite our special guest speakers for to start off the event up Jerry Britt oh and Peter Van Valkenburg of coin Center are here to do the regulatory update and look ahead this is the talk by coin Center we invited them last year to also do the regulatory talk then theorem foundation takes regulatory and compliance matters very seriously so we do this at the beginning of the DEFCON event and then after that we have a full agenda for all four days of topics on etherium platform development base layer development researched is greatly happening today in both this hall and the presentation breakout hall downstairs on the second floor and just generally we didn't really I don't will give you a quick overview of the four days so today many of its the subject the subject matter of the talks are there's a lot of research there are a lot of research talks going on today tomorrow we have core development and a number of technical talks related to core development platform development and base layer development then day three we have we're moving into DAPs and tools and and then on day four we have a number of topics that are miscellaneous of different interests and different data for just to let you know we are moving the main stage downstairs to the Cozumel so we have this room today tomorrow the next day and day four we will be self contained on the second floor so [Music]
