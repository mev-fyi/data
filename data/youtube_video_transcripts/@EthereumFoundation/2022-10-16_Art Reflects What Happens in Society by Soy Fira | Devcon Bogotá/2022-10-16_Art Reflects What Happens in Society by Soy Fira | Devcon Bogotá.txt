foreign [Music] Welcome to My Country I'm the first female nft artist from Colombia so I'm super happy seeing you here drinking water you know dancing a lot I know there are like a few girls but if you want I can introduce it to my friends and today is Friday I know many people like are hungover like me but let's get it started so since I was a little child I have been like super super curious about life about everything and and like my Manifesto talked about it when you are connected to your soul you can shine brighter and we are all we are all connected by one single trace so that's my odd that's my Manifesto and that's me and when you paint in one single trace it's because life is a female and you don't know like how much time you will be here on Earth and when I paint in one line single trace just like start drawing and then you just finish and you are like ah this is horrible this is amazing I like it or I love it so for me that's live you know you need to be passionate about what you do and just Express all yourself you know of course I'm a bit terrible with guys because I express all my feelings out there first time and I feel afraid but it's okay it's man if they will like me they will like how I am you know so I started painting in my in my in on paper and I studied civil engineering because my dad has a company but guess what happened I didn't continue with the company and I started just like yeah with my dream so at that time I didn't have money for buying an iPad so I just started painting on a paper I scan it I use an app that is called in my phone that is called Pig collage and then I just send them in a jpd and guess what like when I I started selling for 15 when I arrived like 100 people were asking me like hey give me a certificate of authenticity like this is really expensive just you send me a JPG I was like we're in pandemic like it's more expensive like sending you my yeah like the artwork then like the shipping was more expensive than the than the artwork but in paper the 15th of March my life changed forever when I became the first female nftr is from Colombia people sold this nft the 11th of March of 2021 so I'm like in the in the way their wave of people you know but the funny thing at that time like you know I'm Colombian like I speak Spanish I love salsa and they were not like there was not information in Spanish like like nothing and like few information in English so my when I speak and I give this conference to people like be curious you know like life is that so this is me like one week ago Bloomberg I appeared on the Bloomberg list of the 500 more influential people in Latin America and I love that not because oh I'm in Bloomberg list no because I say people hi look at me I'm an artist I don't I don't use like you know like formal clothes to be here I'm just like connected to your soul I inspire people and that's why I'm in that list also one of my nfts went with Jeff Bezos to the space I make the nft of a woman football championship I'm a global Ambassador I was in Times Square and I'm going to be in nft London speaking if you are going there I will be there I've been in 40 countries thanks for blockchain technology like I love you know vitalik he changed my life so like even he dressed like not fashion I don't care like it's like I love you thanks for changing my life and changing live on many digital artists so again my Manifesto if you are connected to your soul you can shine brighter and my invitation to you is just be you just shine with your soul just know who you are and that's the path that's the way again my face please again take a picture that's the the message I want to spread um in the world and also also loved blockchain technology you know so how is like what is the difference between this and this it's art it's just a medium so when I give the conference to not not crypto people I'm like this is Art what is happening right now I reflects what happened in society I enter into this world because I realized that art reflects what happened in society that's the phrase you need to say to the people when they ask you why the is an nft I don't understand that and you say I reflect what happened in society babies so then I started telling about the like the history of Art and in this period of time in the Middle Ages uh they like if you see they there's like a lot of religious like religious religious yeah religious art and it's because at that time the church want money and you know how they ask people to get them money with paints it's if you don't do this you you will go to um you won't go to heaven so give me money give me money and voila they use art to teach people then um in the Renaissance you know why the Mona Lisa is so amazing because Leonardo da Vinci was well super intelligent now because at that time starting Anatomy was like it was was a must at that time why because in my face again I reflects what happened in society um I'm inspired sorry like now the center of the universe wasn't God was a human being so they start studying Anatomy you know then at this period of time impressionism they created tube of oil so now the artists have their tube of oils they can go like like out of their like houses and they can paint so if you go to Music Museum in Paris where you will see a lot of Landscapes again my face I reflects what's happening in society and then under our whole Country Museum and in the 50s USA you know so he was like okay I want to be a billionaire you know how he was on the world and you have two options to sell one art piece for like millions of dollars or sell this the like copies of the same like like super cheap so he did that like once you miss him oh it reflects what happened in society and then voila and nft what is happening now technology and you know that you're a crypto people like most of you so when you mix art and Technology what do you have digital art you know but when you make little art and blockchain Technology what you have nfts Bola that's what's happening right now so that you my my invite for you the crypto people is please teach nfts in like in the history of Art and people will be like oh my gosh yeah like now I understand this because many crypto people explain like it's a non-fungible token who's like what is that like even I don't understand that you know it's always as you know like color kinds and then what happened like pandemic has started everyone left pandemic so so what happened everyone made like soon parties so everyone live like like the necessity of Technology before technology was only like a tool so what's the difference between this and this is what's increases in Dubai nothing just a way to show the art and what is happening again I reflects what's happening in society technology we're using TVs voila and hockney hockney is a really famous digital artist he need to print their like his digital artwork in order his artwork have a value now look at me I have a screens I don't print anything like my certificate about authenticity is on the blockchain and that's amazing that's like you know people tell me hey Peter give me physical things like no baby rpflex will happen in society I won't print you anything really like I don't like it to do it and like social networks are anything but social nfts allow us to unite and bring our community closer together through everything so it's like you never think that you will like be friends of these kind of people you know but you have a poor day of these monkeys and now you're like I have a poor name I have a poor Dave so that happened so anonymity is not a JPG it's not even a work of art is a key that opens a door it's a key that opens like anything you want and like really like social media is not like it's not social you know but nfds give you that you can like communicate you can connect with anyone if you write to I don't know you're I don't know Richard Branson and Richard Branson would like will never answer to you but you have an NFD that which are like the same Community you have more like possibilities he will answer you so this is an example this is one of my art collectors who was like super happy with the Steve Aoki oh my gosh my time is over I I need to finish okay so my my friends and I met a friend because I have an nft and what you're waiting for to teach and I really like funny and good way because we need to teach babies and again we're all connected by one single trace and thank you I think yeah thank you
