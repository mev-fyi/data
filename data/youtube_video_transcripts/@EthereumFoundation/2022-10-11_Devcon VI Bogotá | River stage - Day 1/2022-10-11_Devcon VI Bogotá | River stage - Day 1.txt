yourself about cryonics but you know Merkle trees are great and uh dojas are also great but Ralph worker will do just are not actually connected the only connection is that I like both of them but the um so what are mortal trees right a Marco tree is like this data structure that lets you create one small object that commits to a large number of objects where it becomes very easy to prove for any one of those objects that that object is inside of this entire big entire tree right so you have this one object that's called Infinity Noah header and it might be committing to like a million different things and for any one of those billion things you can make a short proof that shows that that one thing actually is you know in these set of things that that's been committed to why do we care about this well ethereum blocks are big the ethereum state is even bigger right the ethereum state is like 40 gigabytes so what if you wants to prove something that happens in a blog or proves something about your account and you want to prove it to someone that has these block headers that are at the top but it does not have the entire 40 gig 40 gigabytes or the entire you know really huge amount of the of uh of data in the ethereum channel well vertical proofs come to the rescue right basically you just provide the value you provide a couple of like sister hashes going up along the tree and anyone can verify the proof by just kind of continuing the hash up the values going on going up together and then see right so really powerful technology ethereum actually you know uses it everywhere um last fun thing for your two protocol is right so most people die or increasingly more and more people don't use ethereum directly they use order called player two protocols that inherit security from ethereum and add higher scalability on top right so roll ups I wrote an article on them they're really fun there's a bunch of them from a user's point of view living on a modern layer too feels like living on ethereum you know applications work the same way but because these applications don't stick everything on ethereum directly these are many so marriages are great leader twos are how ethereum is feeling and you know we encourage everyone to pay attention and learn a lot about layer twos this year so finally you know future directions the merge done yay um okay next stop the surge increasing scalability going finally going sustainably below five cents a transaction going getting us the thousands of transactions a second next stop The Verge replacing purple trees with more efficient structures the butter theory of noise be much wider ethereum nodes don't have to have huge amounts of data becomes much easier for anyone to run them yay The Purge clearing out all data clearing out technical debt making ethereum know it's easier to run to making the ethereum protocol simpler and uh the Splurge grab the Egg of various useful stuff account abstraction PDF improvements proposing older separation making everything amazing with CK starts yay ethereum's getting better and I'll have to keep rewriting this presentation for next year amazing thank you guys bye-bye oh huge round of applause for metallic engraving oh wait metallic I need that Clicker it's Alec Metallica um okay so we are coming to a close of the opening ceremony but before I close it before we finish I would like to give you all a quick orientation to Devcon to what to expect over the next four days uh and maybe some things that we've done differently this year uh I guess when you give a team three years to plan an event they start to get creative and start to uh think a little bit differently uh and we've learned a lot from past events that we've done past Dev guns and really have tried to make this one better uh and so a couple things that we've done we've also tried to hear a lot of input and feedback from the community so uh roughly two years ago we launched the dip process which is the Devcon Improvement proposal process mirrored after the famous ethereum Improvement proposal process which is named after many other similar Improvement proposal processes uh the the gist of this is basically we want to hear feedback from you all and we have heard a lot of feedback from you all uh and so we're super excited to have a lot of different Community Integrations in this year's Devcon that we hope you all enjoy uh one of those to highlight is the community hubs on the first floor this year we have six different Community hubs interest groups from around the ethereum ecosystem who have their own dedicated space so be sure to pass through there and talk to them everything from a a woman leaders Hub to a a temporary uh Anonymous Zone to a ZK Hub uh regen and more uh we also have in the basement the hacker basement um it's a little hidden so let's see if you can find it but I think I promise it will be worth it if you do feel free to head down there and co-work and chill uh even into the evening hours because Devcon this year is open until 11 pm each night for the first time in Defcon history we're not kicking you out at 5 PM sharp we're open until 11 pm to continue fostering Community collaboration and fun and things like that so and we don't just we're not just leaving the venue open we're also facilitating and encouraging community activities so we've built a Chiva chillout we're calling it in the back of the venue basically with a live stage where we'll have live music from fellow ethereum musicians performing throughout the day and particularly in the evenings alongside our happy hour from four to six so you're no longer so now you have an additional option to stay around to hang out to collaborate and to check out different art uh experiences that will be happening also in the hacker basement and the chiva chillout alongside a special Eve's flat Sam Community Hub if you're from Latin America and you want to meet your fellow community members head to the chiva chillout on the first floor to meet them and I'll also mentioned a fun dip actually something that was proposed by the community is a treasure hunt so I was told to basically mention this sticker as part of the treasure hunt and to leave the rest up to you just been working on this for months months to make this treasure hunt cool and interactive and they've been here in the venue for the last week or so trying to make it fun so uh good luck in that treasure hunt uh and lastly I will say this year we hope you really enjoy the programming we've had the most applications we've ever received at a thousand three hundred plus applications for speakers for for talks for workshops we only had room for roughly 300 of them and so we really had to be selective and so hopefully the content that you see here is is of the highest quality and accessible and available for all so we we wanted to have talks that were not just high level only for experts but also for for beginners and for intermediates so do check out the mobile app that we also created just for Defcon to uh to find the talks that you would like to to attend uh and I'd like to welcome you to what is officially now the biggest Devcon ever by a factor of two and to mention that this is just the start just to start not just of Devcon not just of this week but we're still early this is the start of ethereum we have a lot to go and a lot to do and a lot to build and but look thank you all [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign [Music] show you the okay yeah yeah just right and you've got even more slides all foreign hola hola there you go thank you Steve we made it so we are with the full room tonight today sorry it's been long days for the Defcon team happy to have you here so I will be fast we have Steve he's going to talk about alternatives to liquidity staking so uh is this talk is going to have questions or you're going to run 25 minutes uh I'm gonna run hopefully to get some questions in at the end but I'm fully aware we're up to coming up to lunchtime so okay so people might want to ask you questions over lunch perfect so okay thank you very much welcome hi yeah my name is Steve Berryman and I'm from attestant attestant is a an ethereum only staking company and what we're going to look at today is an alternative to liquid staking liquid staking has been phenomenally successful phenomenally successful and as with anything in the ethereum ecosystem something that becomes that successful becomes centralized and then becomes an issue so we we attested and been talking to some other staking companies uh try to come up some other ideas around how to transfer validators from um from one owner to another without going through the exit queue so really this is one idea that we've been floating around and we are looking for you know other staking companies to to to to be part of this building this out if if we think it's a successful Direction foreign yep it's this box is it okay so what is staking so I've kept this quite light in the way I want to go with this is is um is to really give the justification for what we're trying to do and the detail getting into the weeds really I think if you're interested come and speak to us and and we can sort of talk through some of the detail but it's really the rationale why we're doing this so let's have some context around what what is staking in the first place what is staking in ethereum so okay okay I'll keep talking um this is a very high level clearly there's a lot of complication goes under underneath the hood of this for ethereum staking but in from a very high level in in how we want to view this is uh we're locking up funds uh 32 each you send 32 each to the deposit contract this was that this started in December 2020 uh you sent your 32 eighth um to the contract and that basically gave you a ticket onto the beacon chain and that that ticket enables you to build a validator and go through a certain number of steps and duties and if you carried out them duties you receive the wards so some of the things you see receive rewards for are testing that's the uh you're doing that every six minutes it's the bulk of the rewards you receive and if you're online and you're testing you get a very small uh a small amount anybody that's used the blockchain uh what website has got a validating we'll see their walls the rules keep chipping in um and proposing the block doesn't happen very often now there's 7 200 blocks a day there are 44 000 validators out there so roughly every 62 days you'll get a block but they were the only two uh places to get rewards back in December 2020. then we had the uh Altair fork and that introduced sync committees sink committees are even aware than blocks block proposals you'll get one of these I think maybe now once every three years but when you do when they do turn up you make a lot of money during that period it's only for two days so if you're flying in two days it's uh unfortunate and then of course what we've seen with the merge the merge and this is really everyone's excited because now we can we we're not only getting transaction fees which used to go to the miners but now we can spend it and we couldn't spend before so this you know is exciting for the first time after almost two years of having money locked up finally we've got some we can spend and of course meth comes in here as well you know so that that's that's staking in a in a nutshell or ethereum I can get this to work okay liquid staking so briefly what liquid staking is and it's hard really not to um really not mention lie though because Lido's the biggest priority and there's going to be tried to be other players but again it's another centralizing Force so what is liquid staking and why do people go for this this approach well currently over 30 of the staking rewards go to Libo and that's not great but then again liveo runs under different node operators so it's not quite as centralized as you may feel but still you know it's an ecosystem we've got lots of various different options but why has this become so popular well however easy you know some of us techies think it is to run a node is just not easy and there are lots of complications and you have to keep the thing updated and you know number of people I speak to go oh it stopped working well you know you've just not committed enough in what's going on in the community so it's difficult it's difficult to stay on top of things um and so and so with that people are going to want an easier solution to pick up some rewards and of course you've got to slash in I mean you mentioned slash into somebody and they're going that's it I'm not even going to touch touch homestaking but being in the staking company we always try to get people to stake at home but I mean you know the Technologies for most people is probably out of the reach and they've got to be want to do it so when you know Lido came along it's just a perfect it's convenient it's so simple you just go and buy their token you go and take your you know you're easily go and buy some uh token you've got two choices you can go and mint it directly or you can go and buy that buy them for on the exchange uni Swap and and basically you're there that's it you stick it into Cold Storage you forget about it Lido uses a rebase token so your rewards go straight to your wallet there's there's no missing about cost you 10 but you haven't got to set up a box and you haven't got to worry about it um so so and it's been you know a phenomenal big success well what's the downside to it well one of the downsides is you lose control with your ether uh however good Lido are you are handing it over you're handing over your ether to a pool of ether and you're getting effectively an IOU now for individual small investors less of an issue for large institutions this is a No-No that it won't get past the compliance Department there's also some other issues which are very interesting regulatory issues um you're in a pool the pool gets tainted with tornado cash it comes tricky um so people don't want to necessarily large institutions don't want to be involved in in a pool system and of course there is a tax thing in some jurisdictions going from one token to another can be seen as a disposal and a taxable event um so that is something I think probably a lot of Lido users probably don't realize that many jurisdictions put that as a as a taxable event Okay so so what is an alternative approach um now we've been we've been throwing this idea around for for a while but the thing is is you know there was this little thing called the merge that sort of kept us busy for a while but now that we're sort of over that and you know it's I think Danny said you know it was uneventful which was for a staking company that's what you want uneventful so now some of these things come back on the radar and also they do require some extra changes to the evm in order for some of this stuff to work but our idea is that we make validators transferable so that they can change ownership now when I say transferable I'm not talking changing staking company the the validator will stay with the same staking company but you can transfer the ownership to somebody else and um at the moment the way validators work you have a validator key and that's the thing you have online to create your rewards and you have a withdrawal key the withdrawal key is just a regular ethereum in fact it can be ethereum one address or it can be a BLS address but when submerged once the um once you get past to the withdrawals something means um and get to withdrawals this thing doesn't have to be just a withdrawal key it can actually be a smart contract and we've already got a smart contract that handles this sort of thing very well nfts so we could use an nft smart contract which issues a receipt to the to the validator and now the validators transferable it can be moved around and it's also an energy that's actually valued something it's not you know it's not a jpeg underneath it has actually got 32 East under it um so so this idea um once you've got once we create this smart contract then we've got a lot more flexibility and it's in one way it's not up to us to decide what the market does with this it's just quite interesting to put the great thing with D5 you put stuff out there and see what happens but you know I've got a couple of my own use cases where I think this would be particularly useful for example you've got a large institution wants to buy a thousand validators and somebody wants to sell a thousand validators now you can off-board it it takes at least 15 to 24 hours if there's no queue or and then somebody else on boards it's quite heavy on the network as well for ethereum to do that and also both sides are losing accrued interest so if you think if this is a bond you know you're losing money for for the 24 hours and if there's a queue it could be a lot longer so wouldn't it be more convenient if there was a marketplace where two people just bought the validators off each other this instant settlement uh the ethereum network handles it extremely well it's just a transfer we've still got the same validators running uh and you know they it just becomes a a much easier way of large institutions to be able to buy and sell I mean clearly the marketplace has got to have liquidity to do this but you could imagine you're just about to get rid of a thousand validators you would go to the marketplace first if there's a liquidity you're going to get a better price or you're likely to get a better price than just unwinding it because you're going to lose a day's worth of interest and Rewards um some other stuff you could do with a receipt and I don't know if this is an advantage or disadvantage I'll let you decide but it could be used as collateral in defy so all them wonderful things and the great thing with this it comes with a revenue Stream So anybody's into Financial engineering could come up with many different views of ways that this could be used and it could be very interesting um and I think a marketplace where buyers and sellers can come together I think would be very interesting um and as I say it's for the network for the ethereum network it's also better not having these ether huge amounts of ether coming in and out of the system and and you know why wouldn't this why wouldn't this be the better way of transferring and providing liquidity to staking assets without you know without going through the uh the the on and off boarding Okay so what are the benefits I mean the biggest one is you still own the ether it is a receipt you still own it it's yours it's not pulled okay so it means decentralization because you know we we're you know people are not pulling this thing into library or into another pooling system so um and the other thing with this is something as a staking company we think about if you're a good staking company in Lido or you're a bad staking company nobody cares because all the rewards are just mixed with this we start to find out who are the better ones because the marketplace can monitor it the marketplace can can do uh can look at all the stats for all the different uh validators and clearly we think that's a good idea and uh it's something that also if you think of these things are starting to look very much like bonds credit spread could actually be these are like credit spread so the the staking the staking companies become credit spreads and I think that would be quite an interesting Marketplace I think this is also the vanilla Vision we've got but I could imagine we could take a step further on a lot of this stuff and we could build insurance we could build fees we could be a lot more because now it's a smart contract so everything's up for grabs really so why hasn't this already been done the obvious question can't do it or we can't do it easily we can't do it easily the biggest problem is we've had the merge and so what's the problem with these two things and now talk to each other but they don't they don't we we did the minimum to get the merge over the line and so at the moment the evm can't talk to the beacon chain so we've got no way of being able to test the state and test you actually own that validator so there is actually an EIP which is is aiming for Shanghai which is the 4788 and what this does is produces an OP code for the evm which allows you to see the beacon route the state route and what does this able to do you can build a miracle proof and you can prove the validate is yours and then you build the nft so it just needs this little bit of glue and then we're away and hopefully this will get included into that uh Shanghai and we will be testing some ideas around this uh yeah so so really that's the main thing of this not being done is just we're waiting for the next the next thing for the you know this this EIP to come through hopefully in the next uh hopefully in in the next round of updates right potential issues there's always going to be some um you know it's the same thing as the advantages it can be used in defy you know and you know we we've seen we've seen the good and bad of that so let's just be wary of it um and we could have bugs it's a smart contract you know I've seen a few of them as well in the last few years I think with the bugs thing though this stuff is used in the standard technology we're using an nft contract we're not doing it we're not putting any innovation in new stuff we are gluing it together differently so clearly lots of audio very around that but we're not going out and building some new smart contract we we're using technology that we've all been using for the two or three years right and that is the end of my talk is to say it was quite lightweight to give you a rationale of why we of why we're looking into this um if people want to get into the weeds please come and contact me we um you know we're looking for getting more staking companies involved this thing only really works if other staking companies it's a network effect you know it's if it's just a test and it's not going to work so so clearly we need other people involved to build the tools out to to make this you know if if if the community thinks something like this is is an alternative and even if it takes a small percentage from people using Libo that's going to help the uh decentralization and I think thank you Steve we have four five minutes more so maybe a question from sure yeah so here um thanks for the presentation so you mentioned that uh just taking a liquid sticking tokens are subject to attacks here we are also like receiving a receipt that receipt will include some yield right for staking rewards so yeah I think it's the same disadvantage here correct you mean from the tax point of view right so you could be I mean it does depend on jurisdiction because you could argue and you know we're I'm not know much about tax but you could argue that a receipt is different from a token transfer you know it's all you're doing it is like a receipt for goods I know the UK government doesn't do that so I know you're right in that fact but there is a lot of debate going on about it but really there has not been a transfer of assets so that would be the thing I would like tax authorities to look at to go look you've just got a receipt you still own these assets right but you're right in that it's uh it's messy it's a messy it's a messy field and that's for the collateral I mean that sounds messy right because as well because collateralizing nfts I mean nfts are non-fungible by definition yeah so uh yeah I mean I mean NFD as a collateral for a defy I mean it is already done so and I'm not suggesting this is a good idea it's already done we've seen there are many platforms already doing this and you know it's not it's not for us to try and decide where the market takes this stuff it's it's just the point that you can use it for collateral and I'm sure somebody will do that so right thanks yeah hi thanks for the talk it was great oh sorry uh maybe a silly question but um I'm gonna take the chance to embarrass myself so validators don't they run with Hardware um is that a thing so how how are you then going to kind of transfer the hardware right so I didn't go too much into that but it is a good question because there's a certain assumption I've made in in the presentation this would be done by staking companies okay so we as intestine we would still be running it so it's not transferring from the point of a staking company so if you're if you've got a validator you're still and it's with us you're staking with the test and you're just selling it to somebody else so an attestant is still doing its job so it doesn't stay I mean a validator is basically made up of two keys a validator key which is what a testing hold and then the withdrawal key which the client holds so you know all you're really doing is is changing the ownership but what we're not doing is changing the people that are doing the validating thank you have you all thought about what this looks like with shared operators inside of the nft so it's not just one staking company but it's a collection of people running together um I've not really I've I personally not really thought about that we've kept it very very simple in a way of you know providing some liquidity to clients who would need it this is where this has really come from and you know it's just a way of taking the pressure off the network that you know it seems silly to me we've got a lot of validators coming in a lot of validators leaving and really it's one big organization once wants to buy and another big organization wants to buy so it seems a natural way to do this I mean there are also some other things that like you may you know one institution may have all their staking with one company and another institution has all their staking with another company and I could imagine for risk management they may actually swap some of their validators over to split the risk so you know I'm sort of making up use cases but this is sort of thing that once you've got a Marketplace then then and it's liquid enough I think people would probably use that sort of facility all right thank you so much Steve um I think there's another there was another question here uh so you mentioned Lido I'm curious if you think there are ways to synergize with existing like Port staking uh derivative projects um or if like if you have any thoughts in that direction I mean definitely we talk a lot with Lido I mean um we we write a a software stack called vouch if any of you are familiar with but voucher 22 of the Lido operators use vouch so we there is constant communication and with these guys um whether they will get involved in certain things but certainly lie though don't want to be 40 of the network I can tell you that so it's in their interest to have um you know options that work to to spread the load so you know we talk to them about various different things so they will certainly be in the conversation uh you could again I think let the market decide all right because you know you could would it make sense to do many things with this stuff I think I think being able to transfer ownership is the big use case for for my thinking but you know they're I can imagine there'd be lots of funky project products built off the back of it so you know somebody involved as a thank you thank you so much thank you Steve thank you very much thank you that's right that's a bit quicker than I thought I know I know yeah oh how do I get rid of it maybe 20. let me get rid of the mic first exactly thank you did you manage to get some oh no next time let us know we can save you some okay at least something yeah um I know they told me to point it this way but I guess it's not right now but in general it should work um and so in terms of timing it's pretty much 25 minutes okay and that's fine right that's okay perfect to it sorry foreign just popped is this I think this just popped a little up I just find yeah oops isn't that too too far up yeah no don't worry it doesn't hurt like no problem oh oops thank you very much perfect this seems perfect thank you very much perfect excellent I think I smile a lot so I'm worried that this is gonna go off but it's yeah okay yeah yeah we gave we had three winners it was super nice there was three really cool teams that were on top of us that's cool I was the level of uh for you I mean you were having like actually a pretty good like we were in Denver before and then we we didn't have a single good submission and now we had seven submissions and three were really good so it was it was super happy about it ah yeah yeah the jackets yeah yeah it was good no it was super nice like over a very good experience no I have been here before I used to live in Panama for a little bit and then I took like weekend like extended weekend trips to Colombia I was in Bogota and Catarina yeah exactly but that's nice cool yes you were great right so many like 5 000 people are so okay you know very big very very exciting have you been to any of the other defcons yeah oh cool oh that's awesome yeah yeah we have a few Spanish speakers on our team like we should send them like one time to like be oh what is this can you even moved it some construction s all right so play One Direction hello everyone so this is our second talk we have Anna George I think she has the best tagline that I've seen on the agenda and is the master of cows CEO of cows and she's going to talk about one block one batch please put those lights [Applause] hi everyone thank you for being here um so I should have put Mev in my talk title because we are actually talking about Mev and I think we would have a higher attendance but anyways it's going to be an interesting talk I promise um so um yeah the focus for today is um how basically application design decisions can remove or at least reduce the centralizing force that Mev is placing on the ethereum blockchain all right so let's see and basically the first part of the talk we focus about how or the degree of centralization in proof of stake so basically we look at a few data points telling us how decentralized are we actually today and then the second part we focus um on a more bright out a layout for ethereum where we are heading and hopefully um yeah ways of how we can avoid the dystopian future scenario and that will lead us to the next part where we will talk about how specifically we can make design choices for applications to reduce MAV and then dive into car protocol as one implementation um of batch actions that basically facilitate this cool let's Dive Right In and look at some data and so we had to talk the talk right before was focusing on validators and like he was saying actually is that the set of validators today is quite centralized in a way you have staking providers such as Lido who hold more than 25 of the market share followed by individual stakers but then already you have the centralized exchanges coinbase current and buyers who intuitive combined also make up more than 25 of the entire validator set on ethereum today so you can say if you have already some degree of centralization in ethereum today but of course now um with Mev you add additional risk of decentralization growing further right like Mev why is that helping Central today um why is Mev causing centralization is because people um are like validators that have the chance of proposing the next block they can um move transactions around in a way that they are able to extract additional value out of it in this way they're actually able to read more Rewards um from the blocks than anyone else would be able to do and this way they grow their pie more and more over time and this was already bad this already existed in in proof of web a non-proof of stake this was accelerated because now you also have um the downside basically that you know in advance who are the next set of validators so you can have more sophisticated Mev attacks that involve multiple blocks and even are taking place across multiple blockchains um the response to that is PBS The Proposal Builder separation and where basically you now divide the tasks of the of the validator into two you have the black proposal and the block Builder and now the block Builder is basically competing against each other and the one that is able to extract most values winning the competition because they're basically um yeah bidding against each other and the one who is able to pay the most to the validator is the one who is picked so you might say that basically um now PBS is helpful to move the responsibility like to move the centralization away from the validators to the block Builders but now actually this is problematic because now we have more centralizing force on the Block Builders you can even enter a scenario where basically more than 60 percent or even more and more than 90 percent of all blocks are created by one single block Builder and this can even be accelerated if they for example would have access to private order flow so if now you would have a wallet such as metamask who decide my transactions um to to a single block Builder um then the single block Builder would have additional advantages over the other block Builders and would more reliably be able to win this Blackberry competition and gain more and more share of the network okay now let's actually get to the interesting point and look at some data so here you see basically how much Mev has been extracted 145 000 blocks before the merge and after the merch and this is roughly equal to 20.1 days and basically I mean proof of Stack has only been live for not even four weeks at this point and if you look at this data it almost looks like we are extracting less Mev right now than we did before the merge it's interesting right but what is the conclusion why is this the case now if we look at this slide we basically zoom into one specific kind of Meb sandwich attacks and we can look basically that it's starting it's showing the the first 20 days of Sandwich attacks on proof of stake and you can see basically that the amount of value extracted where this attack is growing right so basically at the beginning when we move from proof of work of proof of Stack we had one short period of time where less Mev was extracted but now over time we are getting back to the same stage as we did before and now here what we see here it's basically a chart that is showing the adoption of math boost and math boost is the protocol created by the flashbots team that allows for this proposal Builder separation that allows for this block Builder competition and the interesting part is that basically they correlate right like you see how with the growing adoption of math boost you also have growing extraction of Sandwich attacks so that's that's one important point to make um but then also let's see how the adoption is going so at today already more than 49 of our validators that we were looking at in the first slide they have already integrated math boost now let's go one level further and look actually at the at the relays themselves so math boost was created by the flashbots team but it's open source so anyone can create their own relayer um with their own rules of the game for the competition however the relayer that was created by the flashbots team is by far the most leading one right it has 83 market share so you would say what's the problem with that what's the problem about flashbots having a large market share but the problem arises then when one of these relayers decides to start centering transactions and this is exactly what flashbot does today right there they are complying with OPEC with the office of ofak with the office of foreign asset control and this means that any transactions that were created by the accounts that have previously interacted with tornado cash are not being put into these blocks so if flashbot says 83 market share of 50 market share basically of those that are being integrated by validators this means that today already more more than 40 percent of all blocks on ethereum at censoring transactions that censoring the accounts that have previously interacted with tornado cash now we Zoom one level further and look at the Block builders so who is actually Behind These block builders and here you see basically this is an entire overview of all the block Builders today operating with any of the relayers in PBS and you see that the top two have more than 50 market share that means if basically you have 50 adoption of math boost and within math boost 50 of blocks are created by two players that encoder of all the existing blocks that are today created in ethereum 25 of them are created by two single individual block builders and then just adding again the argument that I'd mentioned at the beginning basically if you have private order flows or anyone else is deciding to sell their order flow to this one individual block Builder you have very fast and accelerated centralization Force even more like you have these these Blackboard has been will win even more market share and suddenly this dystopian future scenario of where ethereum hopefully is not heading towards certainly doesn't seem so unlikely anymore already today you have two block Builders having 25 market share and they can easily grow this very quickly okay that was like the negative side of the talk that's now focused more on like the hopefully more YouTube utopian future where we are heading in ethereum and for this let's have a look at a quote that vitalik said earlier this year so what is his vision for ethereum right like how can you avoid this avoid decentralizing force of Mev and what he is saying is that we have to create an insulation layer around the core protocol to basically ensure that this negative externalities that are created by Mev cannot affect the core decisions that we are taking because right now with having smart contracts built on top of ethereum you have these applications that now allow suddenly for decentralized exchange trading and for liquidations and all these transactions they basically set in centers now for Value extraction that give more power to very important players and stakeholders of the ethereum network and we need to find a way to not do this because right now our solution is basically okay damn validators are centralized so let's move it to the block Builders but now the block Builders are centralizing so where do we move this and we need to find a way to avoid this we have to have a better structured way of protecting the ethereum core protocol and what is what vitalik said himself is basically The Way Forward is that these risks that need to be absorbed elsewhere they need to be absorbed either by layer 2's or by the applications themselves here we have another quote by Stefan um the co-founder of flashbots who actually last week announced that he's leaving the team because he does not agree with its centering that flashbots is doing today and he is also stressing the point that the right way of dealing with Meb is not to basically try to extract it and then sell it or like distribute it but the right way is to create applications that don't extract the value in the first place and this leads us basically to the next part of the talk where we will look at how can we design applications in this way that they're not exposing Mev to do that we first have to understand where Mev is actually coming from like right like why why do we have this we need to understand where it's coming from in order to be able to avoid it um we basically believe or it's pretty clear actually that one of the reasons or like the main reason why mbv exists today is that within a single ethereum block you have multiple different token prices for a single individual asset so if you use the example of decentralized trading for example yeah you can have a Blog where five people all want to sell usdc for example they all interact with the same amm but each of them would get a different price within a single block that has one single time like it it's very interesting right like you have an amm one person inside Exquisite they move the price the next person interacts with it they move the price again and because of that um they basically create incentives for other players to jump in move their transactions around Place additional transactions in front and after them to extract value from these users and to give a more concrete example of a real block this was like six days old um we had one single block where there was 11 different traders that all traded East usdt and East usdt is obviously a super liquid pair right it's like one of the most liquid pairs on ethereum and still it was in the single block you had eight different clearing prices yeah like the price spread across 1337 USD to 1351 so you had more than one percent spread in price within a singular serum blog and this very much demonstrates like the value that can be extracted if you have so many different prices in one single block and here this was just like a nice pointer because Mev obviously has been discussed for a very long time it hasn't been addressed for a very long time but it was known about since 2014. and this is a Reddit post and the the interesting part here is basically the screen shot on the right where vitalik interacted with and he basically said well one way of how we could tackle this problem of value extraction is by processing orders and batches so let's take a look if like looking back at the previous block that we just saw where we had 11 different traders who got eight different clearing prices what would happen if you were able to batch them all together and would give them a single uniquely and clearing price then we would actually be able to even offer them better prices because we wouldn't have to move the price on a price graph up and down up up and down but we would actually be able to not have this much price impact and have additional value that we could give back to the users and in this concrete example it would be 930 US dollar that we could additionally pay out to the users but the real benefit on top of this is that because you have a single clearance price you don't expose those trades to Mev thank you okay and this leads us now to protocol which is basically an implementation of batch auctions on ethereum today um how does car protocol work so we are doing better actions we are batching trades together and um what happens is that basically users on cow swap or car protocol they go to our UI and then they assign messages they sign and intend to trade and this is actually really important right like because they sign a message and they don't just execute at um they don't just sign a transaction on this year this gives us more flexibility what you do with these transactions we are actually then able to to match them together so we collect all these orders in our off-chain order book and then we have a competition we have a competition of so-called cow batch builders that basically look at what are the transactions that currently exist in our off-chain order book and try to find the best possible way of matching them together with by finding a unique clearing price for all these trades and then the winning cow batch Builder is the one that would settle these trades on chain and what is to be highlighted here is that it looks maybe on High level it looks very similar to The Block Builder competition but it's very different it's quite the opposite actually because in the blood Builder competition you are really high like you're focused on extracting most value from the transactions right in order to be able to win the competition against the other block builders but on cow swap you maximize the value for the users the bug Builder the batch Builder that disabled to find the best possible prices for our users is the one that would win the competition and this is enforced by the objective function that we are using the batch Builder that is maximizing most the utility for the users is the one that wins the competition all right so um how how does this work how do we keep our cow batch Builders honest is they they participate by staking on our protocol then they can participate in the competition and in case of malicious behavior they would be slashed but if they actually win the competition and they execute the trade on chain they're being rewarded by the protocol um so now this is all like all sounds very good in theory right let's look at it in practice so cow protocol has been live since a year and a half we have been processing 15 billion dollars in trading volume so we have a lot of real life examples um this is like an example badge from 11 days ago where we had one user that was wanting to sell forty thousand dollars worth of money fault against usdc and another user that wanted to actually buy money for I wanted to buy forty eight thousand dollars worth of money for it so in this particular batch our cow batch Builders were able to match the two trades together and in this way create additional Surplus for our users additional value that could be given back to the users because instead of processing forty eight thousand dollars worth of tokens on one amm and Shifting the price and then settling another transaction of forty thousand forty eight thousand dollars and moving the price back instead we were able to match these two trades directly against each other and only the leftover amount of roughly eight thousand dollars needed to be placed on executed in an Unchained amm and this way we were able due to the due to the price impact the removed price impact we were able to save fifteen hundred dollars for users and also we were able to save on um protocol fees for the users an additional 800 that didn't have to be paid to the amm cool and that basically leads me already to the final slide of my talk so our vision is to protect the users and our vision is to protect the ECR core protocol against the negative centralizing externalities of Mev but to achieve this we really have to become the backbone of decentralized trading on ethereum and for this what we would like to achieve is that really like our cow batch Builders are submitting one batch for each ethereum block ideally this batch would actually be placed first in the block because this way we could also avoid negative slippage and fair transactions but the real argument here that I want to make is that even if our our batch is not placed first in a block by growing our share we are basically reducing the total amount of Mev transactions in a block and this means in other words growing the share of cow protocol means at the same time reducing the share of Mev thank you everyone we're watching guitar thank you Anna we still have five minutes more so if there are questions I got one two okay I have one question how it can be more profitable when meal so you have to reward more than a flashbots right um do you mean can you repeat your question you mean how can we be how can we ensure that how you can give more rewards to cover Builders and then mere Builders so that's so we basically maybe can I go back in my slides just to make this point clear is that possible so so okay otherwise I can explain it but basically we had this one slide where you could see that um the value chain of a transaction from it's being placed and it's being executed on chain so basically yeah okay so what we do so this these are two separate processes right like the first part is basically car protocol that is the application on top and what we do is we collect the user orders and we collect them they're signing and tends to trade so we collect them off chain in an off-chain order and then we have the cow Builder competition and they basically they have their own set they have their own rule set and their own competition rules right and that it is completely separate from the black Builder competition so someone who is participating on a cow batch Builder competition they basically they they know if they participate they only get rewarded they only win if they are Maxi maximizing value for the user but this is orthogonal orthogonal to to the block Builder competition and on ethereum that happens at a later stage so right deck the cow batch Builders they find they find the perfect solution they then submit them on chain and on chain they can actually decide how they want to submit this is is up to the to the batch Builders they can either submit them directly to the to the public mempool or they can submit them via a relayer if they decide that they want to additionally protect themselves against Mev however basically at this point in the execution if they're being front under sandwich this is actually something that the block Builders the sorry the batch Builders have to pay for so at this point the user is already protected by the the price that the cow batch Builder promised so the cow batch Builder wins the competition by promising I can get at least this price and then they're hold accountable for this so this is for sure the price that the user gets hey uh thank you for laying out the problem with L1 right now in terms of maybe the very nice slides um I'm curious about how you uh moving this problem into the application layer how you deal with uh censorship resistance problems in the off-chain order books specifically so um today if I go to the Cal swap website and I make a transaction like how do I know I'm not going to be censored by the cow swap like company or whoever runs this protocol yes no that's a very good question it's basically something that we're working on we still have some centralizing facts I have components in the in in cow protocol that essentially basically this is um right now we have this option order book that is hosted by us but the idea is that in the future this will be decentralized and not host the bias anymore um and yeah but basically this is the answer it's like it's a it's a it's an ongoing process where we have to decentralize more and more of the components one last question and here and um question is when you're trying to remove the meth in the blocks by cutting these batch balls in between how is then how is it then still attractive from a builder perspective since he has less math in the block now how can you still win the bid auction and then how you make sure that the block gets actually proposed um so I mean right now usually not a hundred percent of these transactions in a blogger Mev transaction right so basically you would even if you're not the first in the block you could still ensure that you're part of it but I think one interesting point that where we could get it is by the more order flow we are actually processing the more Surplus we are generating right like this was the point on like this one slide over here where we have this like real example of creating an additional two thousand three hundred dollars in Surplus so what we could do is for example if we would if we are creating this much more value for users we could take a percentage cut of this if it was needed in the future to pay block Builders to guarantee execution in a blog we could do this but our future scenario is more focusing in the direction that hopefully this won't even be necessary right because we are basically trying to win over more share of the general transactions on ethereum and then that would automatically reduce the amount of Mev transactions in a block thank you Anna we are running out of time so you have enough time to go to the next talk thank you so much and a big round of applause for anime yeah this is for you oh thank you very much yeah yeah every transaction in about auction so you have one price yeah exactly so could that have negative externalities providers because they would get less fees over time yes yes that is an argument but I think I'm a few answers to this so a I think in general AMS are super inefficient right like you have you need to store a lot of value on chain okay and that in the service yes oh yes problem let me help you out sorry if I oh there you go oh I don't want to there you go welcome everyone we have plenty of room so you can come inside we are going to start in two minutes all right when I start this we have Dr Klaus kursave sorry if I'm pronouncing that well or not okay of course I was like German last name foreign 's taking big round of applause please one two three test test yeah again okay so let's try this again so I'm working on introducing diversity on the blockchain layer and the end goal would be to change ethereum but also other blockchains themselves to enforce diversity on that level um a set of working for the weaker protocol that's a derivative trading platform that works on its own blockchain if you want to know what exactly Vega does yes a wonderful Workshop tomorrow where you can spend one and a half hours playing with it I'm talking about the lower level so I'm doing blockchain research Mev fairness and yes diversity in our case tender mint but it's an approach that works everywhere and should also work on ethereum and that's the goal to have a discussion with ethereum developers how far can we drive this to put diversity onto the blockchain um so generally why do we need validator policies in the old days when Bitcoin started we had this beautiful anarchic cyberpoint uh point of view that we have millions of validators in the dorm rooms securing Bitcoin uh that used to work but now validating is a serious business and that has caused dependencies that has caused a centralization factors so some of the basic assumptions we had are wrong and Anna has just shown there's some very few validators that owned an enormous amount of the ethereum share um share so it's not really that decentralized anymore so there's a couple of policies and some other works that I also would like to advertise as people actually thinking about a structural way to figure out what actually do we want from validators the bad thing is if you start with the same axioms you may end up somewhere totally differently so this still needs a lot of debate but one thing that I think nobody needs to debate anymore is we need more diversity and centralization or an undiverse system is is a very bad idea and um if you don't have enough examples so from other blockchains Bitcoin at some point uh had a vast majority of the mining capacity in China so if China had not set you guys use too much energy get out if they just said get out and leave your rigs here then China would now own Bitcoin pretty bad idea ethereum has a similar problem that there's no so much validation in the power in America that the United States has the same decide um ethereum is now a U.S citizen so we have legislation over you so congratulations ethereum you know such as of the United States um we had other diversity problems early ethereum test net 75 of Supply validators had a canine code there was a bug in there the whole thing stopped almost 40 percent of all validators run in the same Amazon Cloud so if Amazon goes down then so does Urbana that's not really diversity and if you go all the way back in history lesson lampro to actually invented the term Byzantine agreement already set um the whole threshold model just doesn't make sense that's not what I meant when I said Byzantine so we're even using his term in a totally different ways and it was originally intended by assuming failure Independence so we need to assume failure independently States fail implementations fail um flesh pots May Fail or behave in a bad way so we need definitely more diversity on the chain one controversity in there and that's a discussion that pretty much always comes up when talking about this topic how about enforceability so if I say I want Geographic um diversity a valid data can just lie about where they are and that's true they can they can use the VPN so I can be in China and claim I'm in the US no problem there so there's a couple of things so a just because I can't 100 enforce a policy doesn't mean I shouldn't have it I have door locks at home I have friends who can pick those door locks but that doesn't mean I remove my locks and put my valuables on the street they still serve a purpose even though they're just 90 five percent secure and we if we create a business case that at least honest people create diversity and dishonest people at least have some risk and need to show some criminal Behavior um to violate diversity then we have something it's not perfect but just giving up because we say somebody can lie about where they are that doesn't really help and there's some really fun research on finding out where you really are even if you're in a VPN and you probably if you ask Netflix or Amazon they're also pretty good at that um so it's a discussion that needs to be had but my opinion is even if we cannot 100 be sure about what a validator says who they are what codes they run where they are that doesn't mean we should just go home and say well then we all end up in China fine and we can just stop the whole thing um the way we normally do this or the first idea to implement policies is by economy um so ethereum is very heavy on slashing issue misbehave we may slash you so you better be a nice validator we can have positive incentives Like A diversity award if you run your validator from New Zealand we give you more money or something indirect like a delegated proof of stake if you add diversity's Network you're a good citizen more people stake to you you get more money everybody is happy um that has a couple of problems um my favorite one being Mev I mean you have to mention Mev here with Mev we don't know what's business model of the validator is anymore they don't make money by fees they make money by Mev extraction so paying them A diversity bonus is like paying police a small bonus in a country where the list of generally of bribes um that's not the business model to get the salary the business model is getting bribed so economic incentives may not really work we have fun financial instruments that can Outsource flashing risks um and if it's just economics and if a higher incentive to cheat so it's one approach um definitely is one error in our toolkit but it's not the end solution so that's why we want to um Implement diversity on the consensus protocol itself and to get there I need a little bit background on consensus protocols and um there you see how old I am because this is papers from 1984 so the impossibility results pre-pre-date everybody in this room or almost everybody um and the worst one is it's actually bugging the whole Community since uh 40 years by now um it's called official lunch Patterson and they proved that consent is actually impossible the end let's all go home um well they're more precisely proved there's no deterministic asynchronous product coil can guarantee termination even if one uh validator May crash and this is a result we've been working around for the last 40 years so this is a reason why every consensus protocol is a bit messy because if it were easy we would run into an impossibility result there's others you can actually write papers with thousand impossibility results in the area which are a very fun read but that's actually the most fundamental one now of course we can cheat We Have Cheated that is why we're all here um the first way to cheat is it says asynchronous so if you use a timing assumption you get can get around it um this is what tendermint is doing for example the bad thing is if you guess or your timing assumption wrong uh then bad things happen you get very inefficient the second one is pluralistic it says deterministic protocol so that's actually my favorite approach we just terminate with probability one which is generally good enough and then I don't need a timing assumption or what was invented by Bitcoin essentially and is now also partially used by ethereum a y terminate in the first place if ever longest chain protocol I just run it at some point it's good enough but technically you never really terminate now after the merch you do but technically a longest shame protocol never finalizes you always could theoretically roll back your transactions so this is the three ways we got around this that gets us to uh the consensus map so we have essentially three approaches we have the randomized approach the partial synchronous approach and the longest chain approach and they all have nice properties so the both committee based ones are finalizing which is great um different timing assumptions their disadvantages they don't scale as well as long as chain protocol every validator they need to talk to everybody so if I try to run those protocols those 40 000 validators um everything will explode so this is why people still use the longest chain now the reason why I'm actually going to all of this um the technique I'm now talking about is actually very well explored for the two committee based protocols we know exactly how it works there uh for longest chain protocols um like the old ethereum Bitcoin Solana we sort of can make it work but we probably need some more statistical evaluation to be sure what we're doing and for Gus per uh well we we need to talk because gospel is a pretty complex Beast it works there I'm just not sure nothing explodes if you'd implement it so this is a where it would be a very good idea to actually have a small discussion um so what we want to do is um call generally adversary structures so normally as you saw in these protocols you have thresholds like only one third of the uh validators may be corrupt or longest chain half of them and we want to get rid of this so forget about thresholds they're boring what we want to do is write down explicitly all coalitions of adversaries I want to be able to tolerate if they are corrupt simultaneously so I could say I want to tolerate if a quarter of all stake plus an entire country goes corrupt independently on how many validators are in this country and for now I just write down these sets and say this is sets I want to tolerate um it's a pretty flexible notion we can later scale it down to make it more manageable then we want to modify the protocols to work with this and um unfortunately we also have some requirements we can't just say I want to tolerate everybody going bad so there's some some limits what we can do in there and if we look at the committee based protocols or also the customer part of ethereum you usually find somewhere in the code something like wait for 2T plus one or two f plus one votes so this is where the thresholds come in and in pretty much every modern protocol there's exactly three thresholds they use it's n minus t for n value datas and up to T Traders 2T plus one and t plus one if you now go back in the protocol and if they say t plus one what do they actually mean with this what do they want from this property um we have three things we need we have a threshold where if I talk to that many many validators I know at least one is honest um honest majority or this is the longest I can wait before I can't wait anymore because everybody else may be corrupted so this way we now can replace the thresholds with actually sets so the t plus one is replaced by any set on my list of people I want to be corrupted plus one more guy and for as a committee based protocols we can just essentially take the thresholds out as a protocol replace it with our set properties and we have pretty much automatically transformed that protocol into a more flexible model we can do the same for the proofs although it's probably a good idea to manually check the proof afterwards but we can generically take a protocol that is threshold based and go to set-based version which is then much much more flexible which allows us to explicitly write down I want to tolerate all of these people going bad and there's some limits so the limit we need for committee based protocol we used to have a third of the validators can be bad now it's three of the sets I write down um must not cover the whole set of validators so if I say I have three countries and I want all one of them to be able to corrupt it doesn't work if I say I have four countries and I want to tolerate if one entire country goes down that works so that's our limits um on on the sets it's necessary and sufficient so we know if I satisfy this condition I can still solve consensus if I doesn't it's impossible so this is how we can compute what are what are the sets we actually can generate um how do we Define actually how who we want to tolerate to be corrupted as long as chain Protocols are slightly different they don't have a threshold the thing we have here is um leader selection algorithm and the longest chain rule so what we can do here is change the definition of what a longest chain is so if I have say consecutive blocks generated in America I can say the lengths of each block goes down in the longest chain uh depending on the number of blocks that were generated in the same set before so first block generated by an American validator has lengths one second block generated by an American value data has length 0.95 third block is going down 0.8 something so the more blocks are generated by validators in the same corruption set or say in the same country in this case the shorter they get so at some point just anybody go coming from another country will be longer because they just can't add to the chain anymore so we can use this approach to also secure along this chain protocol and have these corruption sets on the longest chain base parameter choice is a little bit difficult this is where we need experimentation that's a general problem with protocols like with all long as chain protocols like Bitcoin like old ethereum that there's a lot of guesswork so right now we have um how many steps do I need until I actually trust that my block is sort of final um it is guesswork it's statistical evaluation so this is what we need to redo now if we want to go to these generalized adversary sets Casper is getting even more complex because it's a hybrid protocol so as I said I think I can put this into gospel I could implement it in gospel but um given the analysis of it is a relatively very um flexible way now to deal with validators was actually too flexible so what we want is actually an attribute based one and I use this already in my example so I use countries what we want to say is I want a quarter of the stake to fail plus one country plus one implementation plus maybe one cloud provider Plus flashbots um and if we Define it by these attributes we give all the validators corruption sets from saying I want the entire customer to fail you can compute backup we are implemented and then our algorithm can ensure that not only can tolerate half of the validators to fail or assert but in addition an entire country an entire code base an entire flashbots client or whatever um the problem in here is and I guess it's an issue with all diversity implementations more attributes I have along which I want to be diverse more validated so I need to actually implement it so it's easy to say I want to tolerate an entire country to fail saying a country plus an implementation is pretty doable adding a cloud provider then it's getting messy so the more attributes we have along which I want to be diverse and more difficult it is actually get that implemented and I guess that's the same also in normal diversity in real life if I have a board of a company and I say I want more women on the board that's fine if I also want different ethnices handicaps whatever then at some point I need a very very big board to accommodate all of this um so the danger we have here is that we need to avoid minority stacking that's a validator say great I have one value that represents all minorities on the planet so it's its own operating system uh client nobody else uses located in Vatican State um so such a valid data may get an undue weight in the system if you're not careful how we Define our sets but in general what that gives us now is I can give validators attributes and rather than saying a third of the validators can fail I can say everybody with a certain attribute is allowed to fail and the discussion we need to have as a community is then what attributes are actually important is it more important to have geographical diversity is it more important with client diversity where do we want to set the priorities and which diversity aspects actually in the end less important so that's my parting summary already so plain blockchain implementations um are getting serious diversity errors we have a huge number of examples economic incentivation dusts sort of work um but it has its limits due to new Financial tools due to different um business models or validators we have a tool that we can put things onto the consensus level that we can enforce diversity properties on that level we know how to implement this for some protocols um this is proven this works ethereum is a bit more complex it can be implemented but we still need a security proof and the last thing is we can also calculate the limit on how diverse we actually can be so we have a mathematical way to produce the maximum amount of diversity I can get via the consensus layer if that's enough that's fine if you need more then we need to sit back and maybe combine consensus with economic incentives or really go back to the drawing board but we can complete uh precisely calculate now what kind of level of diversity can we have um and the legal question that comes up um which was also essentially one of the new motivations with American uh with ethereum now being American does it actually also help to give us a legal document her argument does it just make us technically more secure or are we also now legally more secure by saying well there are no blocks that can create be created only in America I always need non-american validators so ethereum cannot be under complete American law but that's freeze the wrong crowd to answer this but of interesting questions in there so um thank you I have two questions any questions up here um clearly a lot to think about in terms of diversity and it's not as clear as just you know you know more clients or more countries or whatever do you have any thoughts on you know things like Lido that are building their own node operator sets and are you know taking it upon themselves build their own set in the way that they see a diversat looking um you know there's some people that say oh it's so great that we have so many homesteakers but like you've kind of mentioned you know a lot of people might not be stating their own infrastructure they might just be running on AWS so do you have any thoughts on like how we can kind of economically ensure that there are diverse sets and you know do you have any thoughts on people that are going ahead and doing this themselves like Lido one thing with this approach we could actually say that Lido is in an adversary set where we need blocks to be generated by not light or on a very frequent basis so they can't completely take over they have an upper bound on how much control they can have um the approach generally isn't economical so if it makes a lot of monetary sense to centralize this is not stopping it it just gives you less weight so um the more people are joining light always and more weight in the consensus people get that did not um you can link this with an economic incentive so if you also use the same approach for the leader selection algorithm then you can also say um the valid data set at diversity get more block proposals so they make more money so that at some point also an economic limit on how centralized you can be so it probably would be a combination that both by consensus enforcement you say I need valid data set at diversity but they also would earn more money so after a certain size it just doesn't pay off to grow and grow much more so it can be implemented the only problem again is if you have too many access among we want to be diverse then we run into issues of implementability all right thank you so much we are heading for the next talk or is there any one more question maybe we have room for one last there you go yeah thanks for the talk um is this for a team also applicable for distributed validators like I I think it will be difficult to produce it [Music] is not cryptographically um sure script together assert the evaluation certain company but what I think when this could maybe well I could be applied there distributed values like their SSP networks or opal or Thursday working on um I haven't thought about that yet so probably you could make it on the second level um I I would still hope that it gets into ethereum even if you don't know exactly where somebody is that we prefer semi-perfect policies over 100 cryptographically short ones um I don't see a reason why it couldn't be used with distributed validators uh maybe it gets a little bit more difficult to Define than the policies on if you have two levels I mean it's a similar thing already which is a problem that hasn't been completely solved yet in ethereum I have two protocols that both have different thresholds and there's different sets so how do I combine this I think if I get in a distributed validator I get so at one uh should be solvable I don't see a fundamental problem but definitely needs to be worked out what that means and if the proof still goes through so the main thing is you need to still approve everything still works and that's a part that is still a lot of work well big round round of applause [Applause] hey how you doing of course my ass representative Danielle um [Music] yeah of course good luck SOS I sorry manga um test test it's work seems to be working here seems to be working those are not stairs I was taking it perfect ly yeah it's working yeah I think so a lot of [Music] so those stickers come in Spanish right here full room bags yeah it seems like sort of sticking is really important well Defcon organization note this down next Defcon we need a bigger room we did that not in the main stage when you double in the base station we need more solo stickers we need more people more talks for solo stickers we need more solo stickers totally well no further Ado let's start the top here we have Paul on that note um guys the space is yours thank you all right so let's let's set the stage uh who is uh solo staking or who's taking by themselves nice nice nice okay yes good awesome fantastic who's staking through a staking pool all right okay yeah not bad I would say like that was like that was 50 50. okay who's taking through uh an exchange like Kraken coinbase okay out of the room right now now I'm joking I'm joking I'm joking you're fine okay good no I hope the the talk that we're gonna have today uh convinces this last group of people that this might not be the best decision for ethereum and that it's actually not that hard to take cards into your own matter and to actually start doing it yourself so yeah let's go for it [Music] um this is what metallic published not that long ago and this is the road map of ethereum and solo stakers are people that are not professional stickers they're not professional validators they're people that have their own jobs they're people that might or might not have children they might have hobbies they might have other things to do than just keeping up with this so how the heck are they supposed to keep up with all of this and that's the purpose of this talk we're gonna try to lay down in the next 25 minutes um the next things that are going to be huge and that are going to impact us all as solo stakers and that we need to take into account um and how to react with it so first of all um let's to try to convince these people that are still sticking with Kraken um okay so it is vital that there are more solar stickers the reason of this talk is because we need to convince you that you can stake and that is actually worth it it is valuable it is vital for ethereum and it's actually an existential threat to ethereum if we don't have enough solo stickers so we all have seen this um we'll have seen how a very few entities control a huge majority of the uh of the validators um who he remembers the steam Fiasco the blockchain steam Fiasco right so actually having centralized validators or centralized centralized um with it actually can can do things like we're just inside the steam Fiasco was just in San bought steemit which was a company that was behind the blockchain Steam and there were some people that were that did not agree with him so he basically went to poloniex and a few other exchanges and said like hey hey guys take this couple Millie and we're gonna vote for an invalid State transaction when the accounts of these opponents of mine are going to be emptied from one block to another imagine your ethereum accounts emptied like this invalid State transaction this is what happens when we got centralized validators so yes it is dangerous okay but not only this there's even a more Insidious thing that's happening in ethereum right now right now we have compliant block production through things like Mev boost we have a 32 percent of the blocks being produced in ethereum right now at 32 percent of blocks produced that are ofac compliant that means that if you have ever used tornado cash there's a 32 percent of the blocks where your transactions are not going in did you know that did you know that you're being censored in 32 of the blocks this is huge and this is Mev boost and if we go into the Meb boost produce blocks this is 87 are come from relayers that have said that they are going to comply with ofac this is why it's so important right Okay so brief uh brief introduction to dabnode we're here to make it easy we're here to make it easier for people to run nodes we provide a UI you don't you need to be technical there's auto updates so you don't need to like do the testing we test for you and then we push the updates and it will be updated this saves about 72 hours of devops the of those work per year only on gas and prism for example um then there's like all sorts of nice beautiful things like a Webster Center that holds the keys for you etc etc and there's a huge community of thousands of validators um that are doing exactly the exact same thing as you and where you can just lay it relay on them ask for support Etc this is one of the things that we have done um this is what you need this is what you see this is the UI that you will use in order to set up a validator you need to choose your execution client choose your consensus client put the keys into the remote signer or use optionally Meb boost okay enough the thing that the solo Staker needs to know is that you are the key for the future of ethereum all right mov ing uh okay so Mev MV stands for maximal extractable value and the first thing that we need to know here is that the value is extracted from who from the user and people say like oh Mev um but they're doing nice things they do Arbitrage between dexes so we can like if I have a token my price will be the same everywhere yeah that's a good thing right but how about everything else you've got price execution in every trade that you do in a decks you got gas Wars and network congestion whenever there's like a juicy Mev opportunity you get the potential and the threat of chain reorgs if there's something really juicy and the conditions are right and the validators are incentivized to attack themselves so if I come after uh the a block where there's a really juicy Mev opportunity I mean incentivized to screw up the guy that comes before me so I can keep the Mev opportunity right okay so yes uh how to map all of these related to me beef so mainly for me and for most of us maybe it's not a feature it's a bug it has a lot of implications on the ethereum design because of that because it's something that is leading in a in the wrong direction so mainly PBS has formed to try to mitigate this situation PBS proposal block separation and we are going to talk about that later on uh so that is why the concept of the community and the referred here to try to mitigate as much as we can they may be and that is why we are starting to see new uh proposals like single slot finality uh single slot finality is a proposal to be able to have finality in just one uh Epoch and the idea is to to remove these opportunities from from the protocol itself but also the single secret leader election that is related to the validator anonymity is something that is also resetting right now and we are talking later on so mainly we are seeing how the student Foundation is trying to find uh ways to mitigate this situation at a protocol level but there are something that we cannot mitigate so far we have seen that it's really really hard to find a solution to Meb so that is why the PBS or maybe smoothing is a way to make this uh more fair and try to mitigate these situations all right so what do you need to know for Emily so so yeah so I mean maybe is a centralizing force it's a centralizing force um because I mean researchers will not give you as a solo Staker a juicy 10 million Mev opportunity because you as a solo sticker that has only 42 000 uh 32 each in this uh in your validator you would be you would be happy to take this 10 million shut down your validator and go live in the Bahamas for the rest of your life so it is a trustful system and as a solid sticker you cannot access Mev opportunities if you don't use Mev boost right now in the future PBS provides the same separation of powers and allows for easier Builder decentralization and remove the need to trust the the builder of the block but right now mov is a huge centralizing Force um that uh but yeah that's that basically um uh makes that us as solo stickers will only have um two sources of revenue which are block production so block reward and transaction fees and the big companies the big trusted companies that can sign agreements would have those two plus MAV opportunities so Mev boost is for now as solo stickers the only solution that we have to access this um this Revenue yeah and mainly the feeling that we are having with semi B is that we are putting the incentivation in the ground plates we are in centimeters people to extract this value from users so that is why we should try to find a way to remove these from the protocol okay DVT DVT is the next Hot Topic and it's distributed validators so right now there's uh there's this equality of uh one validator key one validator client which basically means that whoever runs the machine whoever runs the validator client also has access to that key and can do all sorts of bad things to this it can it can slash you it can Ransom you it can just exit you it can just shut the validator down so you get inactivity leak and DVT comes in so the the DVD comes in um so you can split the validator key in different key shares and distribute it over many validator clients this allows for high availability but because imagine these validator shares as a sort of like a multi-seek so if three of these Shares are online out of four so if one of them are offline we can still continue validating it also allows for different trust assumptions because you can distribute these shares to nobody with with one of these shares you can't do or you can't slash people you can't uh exit you can't do all of this stuff so actually we do not require so much we can afford to give these keys to other people and not require so much collateral right now rocket pool still requires a somebody to put 16 e huge amount of collateral because that's what they can get from That's how much damage they can do so um with DVT we get uh different trust assumption and uh the potential for lower collateral requirements moreover um those who run already run nodes and already have a validator setup they can monetize through DVT Technologies on top of their validator sets so it's a way to bump up your um your your rewards for having a validator okay so exactly that's that's exactly what you need to know about DVT you'll be able to monetize your machine by leveraging other protocols on top of it these Protocols are like SSV Network or opal or Diva and that people will be able to participate in validation even with less than 32 each because you can do a setup and then you can participate in this which is great for accessibility because we're making part of the benefits of running infrastructure to people that do not that are not rich people do not have 32 each so it's great for accessibility all right withdrawals yep with roles withdrawals that's what all we're waiting for right like we've got this 32 withdrawals are going to be a new system level operation which will have no gas cost and it will they will not even go to the evm they will increase the uh the balance of the withdrawal address automatically um it'll be a limited block per block just like right now um joining as a validator is also limited Blackboard there's a limited amount of uh of people that can join the validator set the same thing will happen with withdrawals and what we need to know is that we will be able to get our money if we want to now there's something more interesting to think about here which is what will happen when people are able to take this will um staking pools be uh will people take out of sticking pools and start solo staking that's what we're hoping or will the opposite happen so what's going to make it easier to convince people to take out of staking pools and centralized exchanges and um and start running instead of writing it themselves yeah all right so yeah now it's time to talk about brotherland charting and the future of of ethereum so mainly uh the the roadmap of Studio change uh completely at the moment that vitalik make these uh credit post so mainly we realized that if we facilitate prologue they have better scalability and potential that the previous execution starts so mainly everything changed at that moment we forget about having execution on the charts and we move to a way to provide data availability for other layer 2 applications that are going to happen during these years um so mainly mainly the thing that happened with the product and starting is that uh instead of providing more space for transactions we are we are going to provide more space for data that the layer 2 Solutions can use it in the future so the idea is mainly that the execution is going to happen on these uh ckvms and roll ups uh keeping the the execution part of trillion as it is um and mainly from the point of view validator um is just um a way to validate the data that is available so it's not going to the include the need of um validate this this data as in the state of ethereum um so yeah what do you what do you need to know about this um chain is going to store these new blocks and um the data is going to be stored it's going to be used by the roll apps so mainly the idea is that um you get a vertical tree approved of this data and you can use a break compiler smart contract in this video that validates this data allowing them to verify verify the state of this layer two solutions um yeah mainly mainly the idea behind this is like a solution like the Chicago VM uh like a polygons yesterday that uh are going to be able to have a proof of the state and take the security of the Syrian inside this layer two solutions so mainly its video is trying to provide these new tools for this kind of solutions making the scalability going in that direction so what do we need to know we need to know that those blobs those new Blobs of data will be stored in the beacon chain which will mean that our Beacon chains as validator service takers will grow will bloat but hey it will not grow indefinitely because this data will only be stored for about a month so that's great so we'll have the hour Beacon chains will not just continuously grow and grow and grow at least the part of the blobs but every month um we will will be deleting this data so it will grow but it will now grow indefinitely all right yeah next big topic yeah that's also a critical point of the network so yeah the thing is since we are using Brandon in the we can change to select the validator proposals it's possible to know beforehan who is going to be the next one and since we are using lip to be Network to communicate with this node it's also possible to get the IP of the nodes so mainly the thing is that uh since we have also myth in this situation um people want or could try to attack these nodes because they can get the minor extraction value of the maximum extraction value From the Block so at the end is the the same problem that before we are put in the integration to attack the network so we are making um yeah write Integrations for for the the solar stakers um but this is not just that the thing is um the secret single sector leader election is a protocol that is going to allow to hide who is going to be the next proposal and with that you can protect this kind of attacks and this is something that is already in the blending in the protocol and it will be very important to protect the privacy of the validators so what you what do you need to know about this um yeah because the list of proposal of the new ebook are known it's possible to be uh targeted by these attackers uh Disney protocol protects the privacy of the evaluators at the moment uh to propose the block but we need also new ways to hide the communication between nodes because that is still spouses so that is why private Solutions like Hopper or other can provide this kind of uh privacy protection at IP level right next Hot Topic statelessness and PBS yeah a good one so yeah this is how this has been a Hot Topic uh in the research part of the protocol from uh several days ago so mainly the thing that uh we have right now is that we need to have all the state of execution client to be able to be to be able to verify the next block so this is a problem because we are taking all the complexity all the historical data uh from ethereum and we are need to store this in in our devices to be a solo stickers so mainly the The Proposal is to try to remove this complexity uh with the idea to be able to verify a block without the need of having all the state so the big idea is just to have a goodness of the state at that moment uh and if you have this proof and it's written it you can validate that the transaction from one state to another one is is correct so mainly the good part of this is that we can remove all the state of ethereum and just to have a a very small proof of the current state and be able to verify a block so either you're telling me that we if we create a block through this um through this witness and through this proof we can prove the only the parts of the state that we need to prove that this block is valid and included in the block itself so a validator of the block will be able to look at the Block in itself and be able and it'll include this person you'll be able to tell if it's valid or not yeah exactly which means which means that we need to link this with okay so we're we're starting to separate who thus all of these proof production and who does the validator work so yeah PBS PBS is going to be also a very important part of the protocol uh because the the thing that Paul just mentioned so mainly the idea is that we are going to split the roles on the network we are going to have proposal and uh and block producers so my lead idea is that the block producer is the one that is going to create all of these to generate the equitness and and is the one that is going to take this uh High computation um uh we don't have too much time right okay um so yeah the idea is just to put all this computation in the block producers and the validators are going to be uh more or less the same so they only need to validate this proof in a short short way so what do we need to know yeah mainly mainly that the hardware government for holding the state disappears and that is really really good and also if we link with the blocked things it's like okay we are getting more space here and we are putting block there so more or less we are going to be the same uh is going to increase the pathways uh but not too much because we are going to move for from traditional medical trees to Medical trees that are more efficient ways to prove the state uh so mainly as a validator I think the result is going to be more or less same uh it has been always um a need that valuators needs to be running custom Hardware so we keep on that level okay I'm gonna take the Dan the Dank sharding and data availability sampling um okay so this is going to be the last thing and the key part to that solo stickers need to know right now about this is that we do not know which are the consequences that it will have so we cannot possibly know right now because there's not a specific implementation of the data availability sampling so datability example what it will allow us is to remember those Blobs of data that we have mentioned before so these Blobs of data will not necessarily be uh fully downloaded we will be able to just prove a sample of this to take a sample of this data and prove somehow that that this exists and this is valid and available for download but we do not know yet what's going to be for solo stickers because there's too many there's too many moving pieces and this is way too far away so for the moment for Solace takers what it matters is the protodank charting the existence of this data blobs Etc so to summarize very very quickly on the topics that we have spoken Mev it's a bug not a feature it's a centralizing force and it screws up our Center our censorship resistance for DBT we will be able to leverage our setups to earn extra rewards for the withdrawals pretty self-explanatory we'll be able to take our deposits Out product sharding our consensus layer will grow with these Blobs of data validator anonymity a single secret leader election will save us from the Mev extractors that come behind us and they wanna get us offline to get the Mev opportunities statelessness is that we will have less less Drive requirements but we will have more bandwidth and dunk sharding that we don't really know so in 25 minutes this is everything you needed to know about the next phase of ethereum thank you very much [Applause] thank you everyone great thank you okay yeah Brian nice to meet you good to meet you yeah I uh I've been using dap nodes since like day one man oh guys oh that's awesome which one Beast smokes yeah yeah wow okay wow it's so cool to put faces yeah very much it's very very complex yeah but luckily and I don't think people like understand how easy yeah are you thank you uh not really thank you we have more room here that's great foreign foreign on this side we have more seats on the left side of the room good gracias oh my gosh yeah I'll look at the screen I think it'll be 25 minutes but if I have time I would love to take questions but I have a lot of content so thank you should I just start okay hi everyone thank you so much for coming um my name is Christine Kim I'm a research associate at Galaxy and today I'm going to be talking about the distribution of eat supplies since the Network's Genesis this is going to be a two-part presentation first we're going to discuss how 60 of total e-supply today was generated all in one single block and how that very large sum of eth got distributed over time and then second we'll discuss total steak to eat Supply which is actually a very small percentage of total Supply but now it has an extremely outsized impact on network security and censorship resistance so before I dive into the data I want to elaborate a little bit on why I think this is such an important research topic for ethereum I started investigating this back in the summer because it was becoming clear that ethereum was soon going to transition to proof of stake after many years of delays and lots of uncertainty around whether this upgrade would happen and this would mean that soon and today now that the merge has happened eat the amount of eat that users hold can be directly translated into influence over ethereum's consensus and block building process so to understand how resilient ethereum is against attacks such as for example like a 51 attack what one of the key questions to ask is who controls stake eat Supply and how easy is it to seize control of safe deed Supply and the more concentrated that your Stakes eat Supply is the easier it is to disrupt Network consensus it's like a centralized point of failure but the less concentrated your steak eats this Supply is the harder those types of attacks are and the second reason is very closely related to security it's a it's a one that goes part and parcel with security and that's because the supply distribution of ethereum it matters more than ever also to the decentralization of ethereum and that relates to censorship resistance and credible neutrality uh because validators are now the block proposers um of ethereum they are the block proposers of a proof of stake blockchain and for those of us who are from the US this really does matter also from a regulatory point of view because for The Regulators like the SEC decentralization is a key criteria determining what type of financial asset each should be classified as and finally the third reason is because this topic helps to illustrate who the biggest winners are from proof of stake from aka the merge upgrade the biggest eat holders on ethereum are in the best position to profit now that the merge upgrade is complete and um the capital that they hold will now be able to generate more capital on the network so whoever holds a lot of Youth now stands to generate and and continue to to hold on to a lot more even this is a little different from proof of work mining whereas where miners were to some extent incentivized to sell off their eats do their due to their High operational costs so when you're mining Aid you sell it off once you've mined it because you have to pay a very high electricity bill but for validators that's not the case the operational costs are in comparison extremely negligible so I hope this has got you interested um so now on to the data um as of the beginning of October about 120 million eth has been generated on on ethereum since Genesis um this value there's actually quite a lot of dispute around the exact decimal points of the of the value but for that conversation around some of the nitpicky stuff of how we even know what total Supply is I encourage you to read the full report that I've written on This research topic at galaxy.com but more than mining or validating combined the majority of Supply was allocated before the network even launched so 60 million eth representing about 50 of total eats Supply today was distributed at the Network's Genesis to participants Who had who were involved in the initial coin offering so the Ico sale of ethereum basically sold off each to the general public anyone with an internet connection who had Bitcoin could participate in this fundraising effort for ethereum and that sale took place in 25 14 a year before ethereum even launched and it raised funds for about 42 days around 18 million dollars was raised at the time now the second part that I want to highlight is 12 million eth so roughly around 10 percent of ethereum's total Network Supply was also generated at Genesis and this eve went to early project contributors to ethereum and the ethereum foundation which is an organization that was set up to help Steward the development and the um the growth of the ethereum ecosystem which if you guys were there for the opening ceremonies I had a really good talk of what her vision for the EF is but for the 12 million eat that was generated it was basically split up between the foundation and a bunch of Founders so like some of those names big names are like metallic buterin Charles hoskinson mihilisi Gavin Woods Joe Lubin there's there's more but it's not clear the distribution of how much of that 12 million went to those contributors and we also don't know exactly what the full list of contributors were at the time there's sources to say that you know or it was split up around 85 early project Founders so a lot of critics of ethereum do note that the distribution of coins through processes that take place before the public launch of a cryptocurrency so before mining starts before validating starts this is called a pre-mine and it can be easily manipulated by a few select instriders and it's not a very transparent process to understand who got what and to some extent this is very true if there's two really great books that discuss a lot of the drama and the difficulties around figuring out how much of the this each should be distributed to early project contributors Laura shins cryptopians and Cami Russo's infinite machine are two books that discuss that history and when you think about the Ico there is on-chain data to show that you know that 60 million eat it was distributed across 8 800 different on-chain accounts which sounds really decentralized but the thing is we don't know how many of those accounts were actually owned by the same person it's a very difficult it's a it's a there's known videos explaining how you could actually participate in ethereum's Ico using multiple fake identities so there's no way to really double check how clean the Ico was and how according to the rules people were playing at the time so from Genesis it's very hard to know how decentralized eat the supply was and in some ways it does look like a bunch of insiders are getting a really big part of the pie so for the next few slides I really want to do a case study on some of the biggest holders from Genesis and explain and hopefully show you that we can see a lot of evidence to suggest that ethereum supply has distributed a lot over time so let's start with the ethereum foundation the biggest publicly labeled account on etherscan and you might be asking well what if ethereum Foundation has more accounts on chain that we don't know about well as of March 31st 2022 the ethereum foundation self-reported their financials they said hey everyone in the um in the in the spirit of transparency here's how much eth we control today and it you know they they've they've said and self-reported that they currently only control about 1.3 billion dollars worth of eth that's probably less now that Eve price has gone down a little bit since March but that represents 0.3 percent of total eat Supply so we went from 12 million to now 0.3 percent of total eat Supply and the EF has has sold off some of their ease to hold other assets and a lot of this analysis I will you know explain that it depends on self-reporting it depends on these individuals major individuals to self-report how much eat they still hold so vitalik has talked about this openly I've asked Joe Lubin on stage at coindesk consensus like how much East do you hold sir now and his answer was basically like less than 0.5 percent um but of course not everyone is super altruistic and not everyone is going to just like explain how much eat they hold um so it's worth also looking at some on-chain data who are the biggest Ico recipients well the top receiving addressed from the Ico received one million eth and over time outflows from that account reveals that the funds have been dispersed to several other accounts so this this one account that received one million Eve you can see that they sent some of that eats to centralized exchanges they you know invested in the Dow a very Infamous um token sale back in the day that caused the ethereum classic creation different smart contracts and a lot of these flows actually converge to One account tertiary account domain called fraternity eth and that account only currently holds about 800 Eads today shout out to breadcrumbs who was able to create this visualization and and be able to track the the flows out of that account over time and similarly if you do this same exercise for the second and the third top accounts that receive the Ico they received around 935 000 each and then 933 000 each that's the second and the third largest recipients 95 of the funds that they've received has since been transferred over to centralized exchanges so that basically means that funds have been moved off chain they can't be really traced without further supporting evidence but the movement of funds to exchanges generally suggests that the funds have either been sold or traded um and that's kind of like a case study of the three but if we take a little bit more of a broader look at at all of the where all of the eth has since flowed to this is data that uh was compiled from nansen but it sums up the first outgoing transaction between 2015 and 2018 from accounts that received eth from the Genesis plaque and it shows that the top 10 receiving entities it shows like the top 10 of like how much eat they receive and most of them are exchanges only 2.3 percent of ethereum's pre-mind Supply was held unmoved from 2015 to 2018. so this analysis does suggest that many investors that did it that did participate in ethereum's Ico likely sold off their eth within the first three years of the Network's launch an on-chain data of the known account balances of these early Ico investors and talking with self-reported figures from Project contributors many of them have not retained that large supply of over the years through Market fluctuations through the evolution of ethereum Staff ecosystem and of course it wasn't clear exactly what ethereum would transition over to proof of stake you know five years ago this has been a very long time coming so in the report that I have written on this topic I actually go into a lot more detail using other on-chain metrics like a bird's eye view of ethereum Supply holistically I use metrics like huddle waves Supply quality ratio Network distribution Factor so definitely be sure to check out that report if you want more supporting evidence for this idea that ethereum supply distribution has has changed over time and how the biggest winners of the proof of stake merge most likely aren't the Ico recipients and early Founders that report is on galaxy.com but because of limited time I now want to jump to showing you guys some data around total staked eat Supply and how we're seeing that data kind of evolve over time and the trends around State Supply that we're seeing over time great so in comparison to how much total eth Supply there is only roughly 12 percent has been staked on ethereum which is kind of small that's 18.5 billion dollars on ethereum and that's very surprising kind of to me because if you're not staking your eat you're essentially getting diluted and liquid staking Solutions basically means you don't have to make that trade-off of oh if I lock in my Eve then I can't use it for D5 applications um it's it's surprising that it's only at 12 but that's probably because number one you can actually withdraw your steak right now there is a big risk factor in that you know Shanghai we're not exactly sure which when Shanghai is going to be and up until very recently until last month it was very uncertain when the merge would actually happen and there were tons of risks associated with the merge that probably made people a little bit iffy about should I be staking my eath into the beacon chain so there were core like developments in the protocol that needed to happen in order to grow more confidence in staking your eat um and so I actually suspect this figure to start Rising now that the merge has happened and especially after Shanghai is complete um and and you can see that this trajectory like year over year it's getting higher and higher and if we're if we start to see more total supply of eth become staked it's important to ask the question who's holding that eat and how is that distribution changed over time so for the past since 2020 since when the beacon chain started you can see that initially independent stakers um basically stickers that were not associated with a staking provider it was pretty high it was around 70 percent of um of of the total steak eats the supply was controlled by independent stakers but over time we can see very quickly that we're starting to see more concentration see the the black to um staking providers like Lido and coinbase and of course take some of this data with a grain of salt because this requires on-chain address labeling which is not always an accurate science and shout out to Hill Dobby from who's like a dune analytics wizard because I basically took his dashboard um but so why why do we see this happen why do we see it going from from 70 to like smaller um well I think number one it's because it's a lot easier to stake with a staking provider than it is to run your own validator node especially after the merge with the execution layer client and the consensus layer client and making sure that those Communications happen um in the right Manner and not getting slashed it is much easier to just kind of offload that technical capability to somebody else and ask somebody else to run it and the second thing is you can't actually have liquid sinking if you're an independent staking provider there's a ton of benefits of going to Lido and then being able to re-hypothecate your steak eats and get additional yield um so I think a big a big plus of Lido is is this idea of liquid staking that you don't get as an independent um Staker and then finally this is a theoretical more theoretical benefit of joining us a large staking pool but theoretically if you join a staking pool that has control over more than one third of the eat or like key thresholds like one fit like one half of the eve then you also have this ability to theoretically achieve outsized profits by deploying um cross like multi-block multi-block Mev strategies and you're able to like manipulate block time times and do these fancy things that you can only do if you're a very large staking provider and in those ways like increase your reward um so left unchecked I really do think that this trend of of increasingly centralized players dominating the staked eth Arena I think that's a trend that we could start to see grow a lot stronger over time if we don't start talking about Solutions now so for the the last slide I wanted to talk about some of these Solutions um and I'm not going to go much into distributive validator technology because that was explained in much detail in the last presentation um so the first one it was proposed earlier this year by Justin Drake um and He suggests the creation of a liquid staking derivative token called LSD which is the name of drug but um it stands for liquid staking derivatives um yes and this would basically allow independent node operators running their own validators as opposed to other um to that of other users you'd be able to enjoy the benefits of basically re-hypothecating your assets without having to rely on a on a staking provider like Lido and the setup would really circumvent that need for um you to to trust in a smart contract that may contain like smart contract risks and bugs um but of course this would require a really heavy and major code change to ethereum consensus mechanism it's protocol and its design and as you saw in the last presentation with Dank striding statelessness all these other things in ethereum's roadmap it's kind of hard to think that liquid's solo validating is in ethereum's near future um but it is a solution or a potential proposal that has been discussed but I'm just saying that it would require a lot and there is a lot on ethereum's development roadmap um as you probably noticed from the last presentation the second one which is a more short-term solution that many ethereum community members have been advocating for is um basically just altruistic behavior from the top staking protocol so vitalik was tweeting earlier this summer about this idea that maybe staking pools should just altruistically start increasing fees for users if their share of the state to eat Supply goes above 15 or maybe you know the individuals like Lido should start imposing self-imposing like deposit caps into their smart contract so that their their portion of steak e Supply never goes above like 20 or 25 um and I think that this kind of Goodwill Behavior might seem very laughable at least but it's it's happened time and time again on ethereum's protocol for other for other issues so Mev is a really great example um where we saw a lot of altruistic behavior from from Key ecosystem players before ethereum merged there was ethermine which was the largest ethereum mining pool by hash power and they publicly tweeted about refraining from Mev opportunities that don't align with the ethos of the ethereum community out of support for the longevity of the protocol so they're basically leaving money on the table not interacting with certain memory strategies because it's just bad and they're not going to do that flashbots recently tweeted we're gonna start giving blocks to other relays because we just want to bootstrap other relays and we want to help out the ecosystem ethereum 2.0 client diversity exit consensus layer client diversity even though not all teams are like have the same resources and they have the same track record for performance they were was a huge Push by the community to just encourage minority clients to gain more user adoption so time and time again we're seeing a lot of altruistic Behavior encouraged and I actually hate this kind of solution of just like relying and encouraging the altruism of ecosystem players to keep ethereum safe but I put it on the slide because it's worked for other Solutions before and we've seen examples of it happening on ethereum and it was it was one of the proposals around this topic for how we want to see steak eth being more decentralized over time and then the final one is distributed validator technology I won't go too deeply into it because again it was talked about in the last slide but this I will also specify is a research an active research initiative opal and SSV are two of like the few projects in this ecosystem that's really trying to make DVT a reality and I didn't really in this presentation go much into how Mev boost is actually changing the Dynamics of how validators validator node operators are competing with one another but as with many aspects of research and many topics of research on ethereum once you research one topic and and propose Solutions it actually impacts and has many third order consequences to other areas of ethereum's development so as I close out my talk I'd just like to reiterate that the supply distribution of ethereum matters now more than ever because ethereum is a proof-of-stake blockchain and the solutions that I discussed on this slide are really far from perfect and I urge a lot of developers and stakeholders and people in this audience to think deeply about how Supply can become more decentralized and distributed over time because left in its current form there is this danger of it trending towards centralization so that rats off my talk happy to answer any questions email and Twitter's there and yes who got the Mike maybe they're ready but that much data amazing research Christine we have one minute come on guys any questions Hi how are you uh how do you imagine the role of Latin America uh in terms of decentralizing the the upper feet I mean or not the alphabet the staking of it sorry the what how do you imagine the role of us Latin America oh Latin regarding this problem Latin America regarding this no problem well I think many of the validator node operators are probably based out of North America um so I think the fact that we're having this conference here and the fact that we're talking more about ethereum in other areas of the world that maybe many developers haven't ever interacted with haven't ever come to visit and know like more of the population here and more of the ways in which yeah we can have more validator node operators independent staking node operators from Latin America I think that would contribute significantly to the security and the decentralization of ethereum so I think it's really great that we're talking about this here and that we have a great audience of of people who can bring other perspectives and other ideas so that it's not all from a perspective of like you know we were all educated from like uh universities out of like North America but many like different ideas so Yes actually I can answer that question there is a group in Argentina called Sensei node they are pushing for geographical decentralization so you should check it out then there you go thank you Christine big round of applause and people are going to stay in this room stay we have a really interesting talk next and there are ones please go for your next talk hi I'm trying to find your Twitter oh um you should do the kids him there's hi there is a foreign [Music] so we can do 20 minutes 19 something like that and then he can come up and then we can do questions together at the end does that works I do we don't care no are you cool with that break but then you won't get extra time then you won't be extra time if you're on the extra time you have to start early I think it's mostly the same audience but up to you he's gonna go do that so where the dogs are 3D connected so what like it will be a little over it's like there's 10 minutes we're doing the talks because there won't be enough questions to fill 10 minutes my impression is that the room is small enough that and the hard talks are connected enough there are much more demand than maybe we can do it no but it's going to be full it's very small room what I'm saying is there's not gonna be exchange of people like the people that are listening to me will also be wanting to listen to you so if it's full in my room okay like there's not gonna be room up to you [Music] I think like and it will be fun to do the questions together at the end but if I have to feel I can take questions after my talk so let me know you decide you to decide and let me a really hot topic so if you guys want to be here in the front row just like sit on the floor we want to maximize the room still be safe so and this is going to be interesting talk this is not Mev it's the title for this one and the next one is this is med so I will do a quick poll please raise your hand if you plan to stay for the next one whoa or do you like the other way who has another talk that they want to really attend and you're going to get outside just one so it's going to be full full room um yeah let's try to fit as much people as we can maybe here you can sit down and maybe super hot guys yeah and then we can take questions together here we have at least five seats in the floor so if anyone wants to come yeah sure just like five more if they want oh we can fix fit at least five one two three four and well which audience Alejo I remember we were talking in Buenos Aires you were doing that presentation where where this is Mev and now you're going to do this is not an EV so without further Ado please to the stage from flashbots hey hello I have the clicker can you hear me yes thank you test that out okay whoa the spider all right welcome thank you all for coming um a friend of mine recently shared this picture with me with the label Mev and sure enough right it looks it's very reminiscent of the member Wars between Searchers trying to snatch an opportunity right from each other and try to get early try to over beat the other one right but but is this a good metaphor for Mev is this actually Mev people in the community now are very miv aware and proof of that is that there's 18 talks in this Defcon around the topic of Mev there were zero in the last so that's quite a testament for this um despite this I would argue that we're not 100 sure of what mov even means and this is a poll from last year so which of the following is not Mev right there seems to be rough consensus around front running but much less so around transaction fees liquidation rewards and like all of these RMB it's fairly very evenly split this one is more recent right like the the last year from last year to this year there has been many developments as you all know this is a recent one from last month our block rewards a form of Mev this is pretty impressive it's almost half and half right so it's really a contentious concept right um this is a perhaps a more trolley one uh conference swag is a form of Mev I won't go through this chart it's a lot of fun I encourage you all to check it out and essentially there's two Dimensions that are taking into account here one is a value and one is extraction so depending on where you sit on each of these variables is uh yeah what you should consider Mev or not and but are these the only Dimensions that are relevant right so again it doesn't seem like there's a lot of consensus this is the ultimate one I hope nobody got robbed I really hope so uh but yeah so I think this meme illustrates is also my favorite meme form it's not mine by the way but I think it's a it illustrates what I'm trying to to get through to you and today right like so we've been calling MV a lot of things and um so in this talk so in my work in trying to formalize Mev I've been argued that there's no consensus on a formal definition of Meb and there's many around there and we're using different things and and it's hard to come up with a formula but in in doing work for this talk I realize that there's not even consensus on on the concept right on the intuition of what we want to call Mev so in this talk I want to go through different ideas and say why many of these are not a movie and and crucially this talk is tightly coupled together with my friend Shin stock next who will tell you what actually is I mean so encourage you to stay he's going to roast me and tell you why the things I tell you now are actually wrong so you should definitely stay you want to be a bit of a shorter talk and he's he's gonna give a longer talk and perhaps if DMC allows us we can do questions at the end so yeah so since you all said that you were going to stay to his for his dog all right let's get going so yeah oh I forgot I have like a cool animation transparency okay just a decision stock okay let's get going so um we're gonna start with like a trivial example right is Mev is the the are all the things that are maybe also and all the things that are value right this value the same as Mev right this is a trivial example we can easily argue that this is not the case or the small to Mev than to any value you can think of picking up a one dollar bill out of on the street right we wouldn't want to call that Mev hopefully you all agree but this is still value right so again this is a trivial example but just to set the stage of the type of argument I'm going to be doing and critically this is all intuitions there's no proofs here I'm not just trying to hone in a concept and it's up to all of us what we decide to call me right it's a matter of uh choice and there's no like again proofs here um okay so first non-trivial example is Mev equal to the set of value on the blockchain right um so if you you think of the definition the original definition in the flash floods 2.0 Paper and there was like value that can be extracted by miners by censoring reordering transactions so there's a lot of blockchain Concepts there right transactions miners Etc so so it might well be that okay what we're calling Mev is nothing else than value on the blockchain and sure enough there's things that are value on the blockchain that are also Mev arbs are one of them and I'm going to be using Arps like a canonical example of family Arts like talking about Arbitrage on a blockchain for instance right um but uh are there things that are value in a blockchain that are not Mev well here one could argue that okay if I do a simple if transfer right and then the miner has no way to extract that so we can call that value in the blockchain that it's not Mev although put a pin on this idea because we're going to come back to it because it's not as simple as it look even a simple if transfer can get trickier but in principle we can say okay there's some value in the blockchain that's actually not Mev um how about the other side right and let me also say that mostly for the question of this is not Mev we're going to be thinking on the right side of this slide slide the inclusion of the pink set on the in the in the white set but we're going to find interesting things along the way on the left hand side too right so we're gonna also comment a bit on those so in this case um is there Mev that's not a value on the blockchains this is again a matter of choice right but I would argue that we are striving for a more abstract General concept than value and that's strictly on the blockchain I don't see any anything special about blockchains in terms of value blockchains are certainly special in terms of uh coordinating devices but I don't see them as like again providing value a characteristic that's so special right so in general we would like to think of any via something more General and and here the canonical example you can think of is a centralized Exchange in a centralized exchange you have all the orders coming and the operator can decide to extract value from users like Robin Hood does that's the Robinhood business model right so we might want to call that mevn matter of definition you might not agree feel free to come and chat if you don't but in principle or whatever perhaps we want that one subtle Point here is that we might need this if we start quantifying uh centralized exchange versus the centralized exchange art right so if we have value flowing in and out of the blockchain then maybe when we start quantifying this this kind of Arbitrage and so on we might need to call that Mev if we want and like the the whole calculation to be sound right so um okay so value on the blockchain doesn't seem like it's the best uh candidate for our concept of Mev so let's move on to the next one is Mev the same as front running right okay we start with the intersection of these sets trivially arbs again as we saw I'm gonna use all results here and the first leg of a sandwich for instance you can think of it as an ARB this is clearly a movie this is clearly from running okay how we'll start with the left side here and also obvious Point there's clearly nav that's not from running you can think of back running trivially or reorgs other things okay so here are the tricky parties on the right side are all things that are from running Mev okay and thinking from running here is you learn some information uh from other parties and then you like are faster than the other in Catching or capturing that value is that anyway again the rugby example in the first and slide right so um here you can you can take two paths you can say okay let's look at the rugby example okay maybe I don't want to call that Mev even if it has a characteristic of like you know being faster than than the other person and and so there has to be something else for us to call uh being early I mean because being early again doesn't have that much to do with the structure of of the value itself and so here okay what's the missing part here perhaps we can think of a coordinator a coordinator that is doing the allocations of value right and and in the rugby there's no really meaningful coordinator you can think of I don't know gravity as a coordinator but it's a coordinator that cannot extract it's like a dumb coordinator so here if you have a smarter coordinator what happens is that the game theory gets more interesting right so the Mev concept becomes much richer so so here okay this is one path you can go down and you can say okay not all front running is Mev because for it to be Meb we need some extra player so this is perfectly fine until you start thinking and okay you can think of the example of the arbitrum chain right in arbitrum you have a first come first serve and centralized server and that cannot extract and then people are doing Arbitrage so if you go down this path considering that the coordinator there cannot extract you would be you would not be calling arbit room Arps as Mev right and this is something many people would frown upon right and in fact the Avalanche devs at some point were saying okay Arps are not Mev and the Searchers were laughing because they were saying okay well call it what you will we're making millions of dollars out of this so I think there's some consensus that okay these type of things are Mev so again tricky contentious point it's a matter of choice where we want to call that Mev or not um okay so this again question is the set of things are from running included in the set of things that are mov and we'll get back to this at the very okay next Set uh is Mev and the set of things that are maybe equal to a set of things that are permissionless value to your example in Center Arps right this is permissionless anybody can make an ARP and it's also Mev canonical example of Mev so that's fine how about the left side are all things around maybe permissionless so when I work with definitions and formalization of Mev I argued for the importance of permissionlessness in the in the definition because there were many definitions out there that included the notion of a player that can extract a value but this is very tricky and It's tricky because you can think of an example where you have an airdrop right you have an airdrop that's only entitled to you and when you are going to clean the airdrop The Miner cannot do anything right so there's no way that Miner can steal that value from you so I would say Okay permissionless looks like it's important in the in the concept of Mev although if you think of an artist to an example say you have an inner drop which you can only claim at a specific block height and say that the proposal of that block knows about this so then they can credibly extort you and tell you look if you don't give me a share of the airdrop I won't include your transaction right so then okay after all there might be some mov character toys this extortion capability of of the coordinator right and this might look like a very contorted example okay after all is there any airdrop that it's only valid for one block but if you think like a little bit deeper on this and if you use some numbers uh you can think of the earlier ether transfer and from the the the earlier slide and there if you have a collusion of say 10 of the validators they could in principle extort you for uh 0.4 for uh four percent of the value and shin has run these calculations right so 0.4 percent of the value is a lot right it's uh more or less the same as the fees that you have you pay like swapping on uni swap or whatever so actually this example and that looks contorted is not and could very well happen right so extortion is a real thing um okay that's again for the left side on the right side this is not too interesting we have the example I gave you earlier of the dollar bill you pick up a dollar bill that's permissionless value and that's arguably not Mev uh but okay that's an example that's outside of the blockchain so perhaps we want to consider permissionless value on the blockchain how this set of things okay the two examples I gave you for the intersection and for the Mev side are on the blockchain so we know this exists in principle so how about the other side are there things that are permissionless value on the blockchain that are not Mev this is a question for you actually I haven't found an example so if you can come up with an example again of things that are permissionless value on the blockchain that you wouldn't call Mev please let me know and we can sort out that set inclusion and there so this is a one candidate set to consider for characterizing or half characterizing it maybe if you will okay thanks for bearing with me we've been through a lot of like Venn diagrams this is the last one okay how about value extractable by a monopolistic coordinator again I've argued sorry I have argued for the importance of a coordinator and because it changes the game theory it makes it more fun so here again critically the coordinator needs to be able to extract for that game theory to be richer it has to be monopolistic because also for the extortion I showed you before if if it's on the monopolistic then this doesn't work so uh in the intersection we have the same example as before Arbitrage is an example of this monopolistic coordinator scam like naturally in blockchains like the proposers are that right um okay so how the left side are things that are Mev and that are not uh value extracted by a monopolistic coordinator and here it depends on your earlier choice on the arbit room example right the front running example um okay if you uh decided to call arbitrum arbs that type of front running Mev then this is an example of an element here right because it's not value extracted by a ballistic coordinator but you're still choosing to call it Mev again a choice um finally let's look at the RSI is there value extractable by a monopolistic coordinator that is not mov can you find examples of this I haven't so again a challenge to you all please come talk to me if you find an example in this set there and again we can sort out this this question here Okay so we've dealt with the concept of Mev we came up with three sets that look like might always be Mev this is of course not a full characterization just to sum up value extractor via monopolistic coordinator front running permissionless value on the blockchain uh this is quite an unfortunate picture I would argue right because there's these three disjoint sets and how are they related to each other this doesn't look like a unified theory of nav right one would ideally like to have a more concise idea of what Mev is right and these are only if at all partial characterizations so uh what come in the talk that comes next Sheen is going to share a little bit of that and try to come up with this was more like an outside in exploration of the idea of emulation he's going to share uh inside out a more constructive way to think cohesively about Mev and so again thank you so much for coming I appreciate you all being here and yeah I will pass it on to shin and then we can do questions together foreign we have a huge line over there so we have a problem I mean in terms of fairness I know I asked the only one was Mr Paladino it's the same movie can we solve this do we have volunteers to let some people to participate this is not a movie [Laughter] um let's try to feed at least eight more do you think we can make it maybe that's where we can do some sacrifice intensity in terms of comfort and let eight people to get in so Andres here let's mix it looks so bad yeah between people around no no I don't see him he's probably further down than I you can see speaker notes right foreign thank you so much thank you for sacrifice for the teams didn't know maybe two more you can fit up there um all right okay okay do I have uh yeah okay yeah oh the clicker no it's up there okay okay [Music] good no settings what let me show you okay okay all right big round of applause for our next speaker yeah so uh from the last talk we get we arrive at this slide and having a test for non-ammy v news but in this talk I'm done talk about you know sorry about this formulation of a movie is mid so specifically what it means uh why because it's like a party guy you know a guy at the corner of a party saying they don't know this is not me while the other people all of us are like yes we know and we don't care it's a good Meme and it's uh you know memes are important memes are more important than you know arguably uh many other scenes in our life and then but there is also another extreme in the community vouching for a formalization of family right so some common pitfalls on this uh on the world on the definition of the word and maybe is that we give up on the clarity of the notion we over formalize it such that we lose some memes right with it is no longer a mean term and it's lost in and we are getting lost in the detail of the real value of defining moves so in this talk I will give a clear definition of family that points to a solution two points clearly to the solution recipes that how we should solve Mev and uh I'm not gonna give a mid curve formalization nor am I abandoning our means so what is Mev so by the end of the talk you will see that Mev is Al Capone evil deity and Lewis the 16th so uh this is a maybe uh yeah so so to um start we see that so so why Al Capone's Mafia is Mev so because Mafia extractable value you know vcm arises from arises when one agent or Collision of Agents gains an asymmetric knowledge of another agent's private information so this condition sounds really exists on a symmetric sophistication between agents so very easy examples include sandwich internal as brown running or in traditional Finance we see that people trading one strategy is actually people trading on the limit other books imbalance so which is essentially a form of One agent gaining knowledge of another agent's utility or intent right when you see more bid than us on the books then you take the best us and you make the best bit um so the evil deities are more like why is it I mean so monologue is terrible value is a value that was surrendered to the malloc I on coordination within your mechanism your allocation mechanisms for people's preferences so one example of this is the negative externalities caused by any expressive mechanisms so for example suppose you have a random ordering then people spam the network and and that is the only way they can express their preferences and it is very one-dimensional way right so you have a kind of a shrink transaction quality trilemma and there are of course many other examples for so for example in the traditional high frequency trading arms race example people the mark the cost that market maker spends on arms race gaining latency advantages was channeled as charging higher spreads for users so the externality is transferred from sophisticated agents to unsophisticated TKD agents there are some other examples and so finally Louis xixteen Monarch why is him and maybe so Monarch his travel value arises from the fact that the coordinator so for example the sequencer or the validator has the ultimate power of deciding what the ordering or the allocation of specification on status so by specification on state I specifically mean which specification or property does the next day satisfy you can for those of you familiar with programming languages you can see that this directly links into the um you know formal verification you have a program and the specification that the next state must satisfy so there's some examples of this include that the validators currently you know in ethereum or other chains accrue value because they have the power of determining what content is in the block and many other examples for in in traffic such as collocation fees and cross-chain such as cross-doming market makers for swaps so then we can see that Mev arises from three distinct properties the Mafia the malloc and the Monarch so now a little bit more formalized suppose that m is the monarching our units versus or our game e and w is the social welfare function then we know that the monologue kick straddle value equals the welfare that is achievable by the best possible mechanism for our game to allocate specification on State minus welfare of the current Monarch and the monarchy V equals to the welfare of the current Monarch minus the welfare that that already existed you know in the original game in without our current Monarch has a coordinators you can see those uh closely tied to the idea of externalities right and then from our definition we know immediately that monarchy V plus monologue extractable value equals the welfare of the best possible mechanism in our uh in our game minus the welfare of the original game so so it equals the constant right so it is so Marlo QV plus monarchy V is innate to the game e and does not depend on our choice of the mechanism and um and finally uh defining a mafia EV is a little bit harder harder but the intuition in the mafia if it depends on the specific sophistication details or the power of agents that is existent in m so what this means is that how much exposed knowledge or last look One agent can have over other agents or their coalitions so then we can see that those three values have very have distinct sources and those sources of value are non-overlapping thus we can call them you know our new definition collectively three EV Mafia monologue Monarch extractable value you know it forms the sum type it's perfection um so then from what this implies is that the resolution recipe right it's futurist in our hands we know that a mafia plus model plus Monarch is 100 of the Mev and that monarchy V plus monarchy V equals to a constant depending only on the original game but the percentage of malloc versus Monarch depends on M our our choice of the mechanism so you can already see that there is a nice link with the notional price of Anarchy In traditional mechanism design here right although in traditional mechanism design of course like the you know there are theories you want bonds so they have and so they Define price of energy as like the division but now we are interested in values so you know I kind of Define it as difference um uh and then finally we can see that Mafia UV is also a constant depending our choice of M so since the sources are distinct we can adjust the percentage of the three variants of MAV by transforming one form of Mev into another but in our designing of a better mechanism app so I argue that ideally we should have zero percent Mafia zero percent monologue and 100 Monarch where the Monarch's profits are distributed so what this specifically means and why is this true is that because Mafia relies on the existence that there is one exposed knowledge and there's unsophistication or sophistication between agents right there is a symmetry and so specifically once you have this then the sophisticated agents are going to charge sort of unsophilication text on the other agents and thus this hurts long-term stability of the domain or long-term prosperity and then why we want zero percent monologue is because any value that or any welfare that is tributed to the monologue is forever lost it's not recoverable and nor is it redistributable so then uh and why 100 Monarch with redistribution is that if there is no redistribution to the Monarch then then the 100 Monarch EV on the erode the incentive for people to use your mechanism right because you're essentially creating reintroducing the value that they would have paid to the monologue by having them pay to the Monarch instead so there's a different you can see there's uh so users would be indifferent between paying to the monologue in the original game and paying to the monarchy in The Meta game so you know this kind of violates the individual rationality guarantees so then there are of course some caveats as to our choice of Monarch and our definition so as we can see that the welfare of the game without the mechanism depends on E right so now we assume that the mechanism represents a domain or a builder or some just some Coalition of Agents then we can give a kind of and have a notion of Internet domain correlation Factor K where k equals one if the mechanism is monopolistic across all domains so here we are kind of cheating a bit we are including time as another domain so K is kind of like and this content and dimensional preference curve and an example of the prismic curve you can see on the top right corner and then k equals zero if the mechanism is powerless so then what this implies is that by forming a larger Collision means the equation has a higher K and this enables them to do more credible extortions so what this means is that the Monarch extra value for your Collision of Agents you know forming the mechanism m equals to K multiplied by the original monarchy if M and minus and forms a grand Coalition so then uh of course this implies the users can also be the Monarch if they have a large enough K right and similar probability researchers or Builders you can imagine different mechanisms than what is currently being played in the Mev field so uh essentially the interdomain correlation Factor represents your collective bargaining power which determines how the Monarch is set up who we thrown as the king and how the Monarch is set up within the game so then however the okay so so there are some caveats to the choice you know how much coalitions can you have right so you can imagine this formalized as a corporate game where the core of the game might not exist if we have too many inter inter domain correlations so uh this kind of reminds us as the you know original notion of there exists anatomicity of coordination and in and efficiency and this also relates back to you know a notion I would like to call the incompleteness theorem of Meb ratio so you can see that the game e cannot continue if there is not enough competition what this means is that you can increase the coordination but it does not always increase if efficiency of the allocation in reality and even if you try to eliminate the efficiencies caused by your extra coordination by using some another credible commitment or coordination device in The Meta game then you're just transferring the monologue its credible value in the original game to the Monarch in the rapt game right so this kind of provides a ground for us to refill any you know uh previous ideas by Virgil Griffiths and his whole ethereum as game changing technology argument um so then the coming back to this the specific value of the correlation Factor K depends on how we set up the game we can throw out these from different monarchs ultimately we want to choose the best mechanism and start that is most incentive along with long-term prosperity and it is most capable of coordination so you can see there's a trade-off over here and of course like why do we want a manner why do we need this meme right why can't we just go the formalization route you know for formalization throwing Mass equations so the reason for this monarchy abstraction is because the outcome in contrary to traditional mechanisms and the outcome in Mev is not common knowledge and depends on each agent's private information which the other agent don't have priority don't have priority to the Mev time which is the allocation time or like block building time so it is hard to analyze the equivalence in this game especially when there is exists and a smear as symmetry in the sophistication of Agents so thus we reduce the guarantee of of our mechanism to just have some some bounce like some some loose bounds on the incentive compatibility and the individual rationale so then now to concretize things we provide some case studies so specifically we say that there's uh we know that there has it has been vanilla first come first serve and frequent batch auction style first come first where we increase the fairness granularity within the receive other fairness protocols so what it specifically means is that instead of reporting a strict ordering by the receive all the time of the transaction each individual node now reports a partial ordering to the leader of the ordering consensus protocol so what this concrete means is that you know you just take the smaller than to smaller or equal to and then after aggregating each individual knowledge preference the Monarch in this case the leader with consensus protocol gets a week ordering by first come first serve and then there's of course we know there there must exist some other batches in it which is caused both by the condorsal paradoxes and the initial partial has been reported by each individual node so now the Monarch tries to resolve the order of the on or the batches using auctions right so this is why it's free from bash auction and then in reality why is this model like let's speak into some datas we see that in reality is over 65 of the unit volume is comes from Arbitrage is you know maybe statistical and among the other 35 it's a big a few few market makers so what this means is that the Mev activity constitutes a huge amount of ethereum activity and the burst period on ethereum which arises from public information review so for example some price discoveries happen some binance or some people um some wells and unprotected transaction into the public member uh then uh once once this kind of event happens it takes around 1.2 seconds then and 75 of the conflict of preferences on ethereum conflict presence is meaning that there is a conflict within what specifications should the next day satisfy uh uh you know it happens less than four percent of the time and so this means that vanilla first come first serve compared with frequent batch auction first compressor will be bearing the extra negative externalities which cause worse ux higher fees for users or centralization in the nodes from 12x more conflict of preferences so you know bursts of periods for preferences are significant and just adding some partial ordering just covering that little four percent window you can mitigate most of the negative externalities on the domain you can take value back from the monologue right so if we use the three EV framework to compare those two protocols we can see that they have the same Mafia right uh and and for marlocks the the first the vanilla version has much more monologue because uh the vanilla version nobody can express their preferences in a short burst period which constitutes most of the activity right so so the monologue arises from the tribute to the monologue arises from on coordination and then Ultra simplify social Choice function right we have the social Choice function it's like I all or like I choose to preference by the other I receive them that does not coordinate any of the burst period Mev right and then burst period and maybe you know typical cases include like permission SMU price Discovery autom so uh and then so as you can see from the graph on the right right like we are transforming the mafia slowly into the model of course where the value is transferred to the user so if the users have the same payoff you know same bad payoff and then from the Monarch it's strictly worse right but better definition but also uh vanilla versions run the ROM on work right so in in latency games you pay more to AWS or Google Cloud because you know you need to play this latency games and SAS and the Monarch you know Google and Amazon are obviously nothing incentive aligned with crypto or like whichever domain you adopt your audience for the Quran and of course it's more centralized because comma is like fan um uh okay so now com some some concrete examples let's see you know transformation of three if it does really actually capture most of the uh existing and maybe Notions that we have so for transforming Mala to Monarch we see that one form of this is the spread charged charged by market maker Bridges from Monarch to Mafia we see that if in traditional if in previous ethereum profile work the miners were to go Rogue and still bundles they need to be you know they were the Monarch but they choose to gain an advantage using their estimation information the ability to act on that information wait what okay uh and then from Mafia to malloc the transformation so for example you go from a public member model to a vanilla first come first serve right you eliminated polymer so you don't have that information but you have that uh you know uh on coordination you have a a very bad allocation of preferences which increases monologue and then from malloc to Mafia you'll see that so for example if a malicious coordinator were to pocket all of the Surplus with that that it generates from optimizing the ordering or just existing you know from coordination so this case um you you you go from yeah and then what we can do to go from uh Mafia to Monarch is to have programmable privacy right so in this case for example SGS you can still do bundle merging or block building or preference aggregation despite that you don't have a Elementary symmetry in the um information and then finally come on the current model of Tau governance is a form of transforming the Monarch to the malloc which is not good right so uh so so what this means is that uh so Dao exists for coordination right but then but launching a dollar token and then allowing it to distribute under battle economics or like whatever you're you're creating a Ponzi which uh creates more monologue right you could have got that to a monarch stage but then through more decentralization you have recreated his monologue in The Meta game of the token game right so this reminds us of the previous example of the non-monatonic relation between decentralization and coordination and efficiency in the mechanism um so then some implications of really EV right concretize this idea what why is it useful so then the solution recipes how to achieve zero percent zero percent and distribute to 100 we can solve Mafia EV using program privacy which allows for expressivity and agents can control how the information is used along the path of the determination of the outcome buys among narc also this relates to the traditional mechanism designs idea of the definition of How It's what how expressive a mechanism is right and then concretely what this means is that you can devise a mechanism for discovering the unsophisticated users preferences and helping them to communicate this preference to the coordinator or through the mechanism and then we can solve model key spreadable value by just increasing memory efficiency right we can eliminate the price of energy while via refinement of society or I.E specialization of Labor so what you can see you know in in this example is like a contrary to the idea of monologue it has the idea of a slack right so slack is arises from coordination where it's basically you you allow somebody to have enough um modes or like period where they can grind on the higher payoffs um which and this is only allowed if you have a highly coordinated you know specialization of Labor in your society and then finally Monarch is readable value how do we division its value right so the value division we should division it in such a way such in that we maximize this welfare or the future returns so what this means is that you probably shouldn't focus on giving tiny Kickbacks to the existing one percent of users but instead focusing on onboarding the invisible 99 percent of users as as Monarch is readable value or like I mean in general grows super linearly with respect of uh compared with the number of other flows that's existed on your domain right so for example the ways you can do this is through investment into Wallace or some some idea like virtual active public goods funding and of course this was the original idea by Fair ordering as well right like the the idea is that you can uh there are 99 of users that would have come to your domain if you other things you know fairly but uh um yeah yeah so so it's it's been on as a narrative and then uh yeah and so so then specific implementations we know that 3ev was defined by the source of value at their distinct so the sink however the sink of those value are different so for example the mafia Extra Value sometimes sinks into into Monarch right so for example when there is a sandwich and then two very competent atomic structures in the values sinks to the Monarch which is the validators and then the think of value impacts the source of value so I argue that by controlling the sink of the value we are control we can already we can also impact on the source of the value where the magic of credible commitments so some example credible convenience I'm not going to expand where you can like hit me up later after this talk examples include Builders as roll-up or they you have a special Builder Innovation where you grind on the expressivity of the building language or you have a decentralization of building you use sgix tokens to align the incentives or like some more fancy things but all of those conditions on all of those Solutions can conditions are low enough interdomain correlation Factor right remember from before once you have too much correlation or too much coordination then you can't possibly you know have a good mechanism or or like it's very hard to do so so uh and that a low enough factor means that you have high enough competition which means the market is contestable so I claim that having more competition in the game by incentivizing having more competition in the game is Right curve behavior and optimizing the ordering by learning more about the preference microstructures and then grinding on the design of the mechanism is mid curve so contestibility is an important tool and it can only be realized if we design the initial Market in such a way that it is not centralizing what this means is that in reality what this means is that there should not like like we should definitely devise a mechanism that were exclusive or exclusive other flow wouldn't exist um so then finally I Pro I would like to provide some philosophical foundations for the previous talk right I said it's mid now it's time to you know show some real work for show some real like tests for non-emmy venis uh so then remember that uh Fraga and Russell was debating why you know whether the king of French was both right in the beginning of 20th century and they come up with the tests for presuppositions uh for utterances of sentences so for example the utterance of the sentence access Mev has a presupposition uh test that there must exist again e and then like allocation or other protocol uh M and that within M and E using the three UV definitions we can indeed see that um is constituted by a type or multiple types of the three EV so in so so in this sense the utterance of X is Mev has a presupposition of the existence condition of enm and X being indeed instead of 3v thus if there does not exist such a enm which you know translates into English is that is if that is absence of a monarch then the utterance of this sentence axis Mev is false and X is not Mev so then some concrete example imagine Kim and dar playing a prisoner's dilemma right so then they both choose to be trained now Suppose there isn't a coordinator okay so then somebody utters the sentence he says that the value that Kim and don't is extracting ABS in the Monarch I.E 1 1 is not Mev then then this value is indeed not that maybe bypassing the presupposition test right if we take a free game view um and so of course like there are other countries like Wittgenstein has this notion of a language game where the context depends on social scene so the utterance of actually some EV so this sentence might be true as the context of the authorency social and we might agree on some notion of the game so if the sentence is provided without context then the sentence is nonsense and has no choose value thus ultimately the test of Mev conditions on which philosophical interpretation of language you agree with if you are Wittgenstein you know you always switching and believes that the utterancy is within the context where it is socially agreeable that a monarchy exists so in the previous rugby case remember we often see that say that physics is the monarch and then over there is a value is indeed and maybe um okay so so now some takeaways let's change the language game are you tired about minor or Maximo where the grammar isn't even correct like like we say maximum Mev all the time and we should just say I'm EV and it conveniently represents a shorthand for some type of Mafia malloc monarchic straddle value right have you been saying I'm EV because you have poor imagination to come up with a replacement term for miners that keeps the m and makes sense you know is is that what we are doing you know so then the argument is that by changing this language game we have several benefits we have um you know this formulation gives you a distinct value which Origins from the source and then it is more formalizable and it is formalizable in the sense that you don't get lost in the details it is still keeps a meme and the formalization and the proof only services social process to help people to understand it and then of course the setup is a better Mev argument and the trade-off or the transformation between the three values of space is clear what this implies also this implies as clear solution recipes so some nurse sniping for you all that you said to research on how monarchy threadable value can be distributed and research on the program of privacy solutions for Mafia EV and then finally a pre-sabilization test and so to conclude I would like to hypnotize you 3v3 v33 um that's all you can connect well I think we all agree that was a fantastic talk a lot of like the two speakers we we said at the beginning that maybe we have time for questions so let's pick a couple of them over there it's going to be hard for me to get there so maybe you can chat out loud yeah good question so of fact censorship uh can be done implicitly using a terminal using a form of the um preference curves but Alejo Maybe um is it Monarch is it Mafia or is it uh molok mwv it is monarch yeah but as I said like what we want is to shift the structure of the game right remember the interdoming Coalition Factor you can unify the users by devising some mechanism to help them become sophisticated and have collective bargaining power so that is what we ultimately want to do yeah anyone else all right guys so big round of applause [Applause] okay and and I have more writings on this DM or talk to me thank you nice to meet you yeah it was pretty crazy foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] I guess water would be great if you have some thanks good to meet you Mike yeah um there's we don't really have a particular order so you can sit next to whoever you like the most or the least or you know up to you oh yeah yeah yeah [Music] what's up yes yeah we're gonna meet over here and walk on up so we have a microphone for you okay hello again I think we'd have a microphone yes [Music] there is room right here you want to sit down front row this is going to be 50 minutes panel we're going to start in about two minutes presentation is set so just like let's go to the stage all right is everybody ready okay [Music] please all right all right so we are what we are about to start this is going to be a panel 50 minutes are we going to have questions yes how do you want to lay down the dynamic uh so we will have first a couple questions for everybody to answer individually and then we're going to do some questions through more discussion questions and then hopefully we'll have some time at the end for audience questions perfect so please a big round of applause for our speakers hello everybody thank you for coming out um this is the in case you don't know where you are this is staking panel with all of the most prominent protocols on the ethereum network so we're gonna have a great conversation today I'm excited to talk about the state of ethereum staking right now and where we think we're going to go for the future so the topic for this panel is sort of loosely centered around the idea of promoting small and independent stakers and if you're asking yourself right now why do we care about that why don't we just let coinbase do everything well hopefully you already know the answer but I'll answer it anyway it's healthier for ethereum to have more people involved especially smaller and more independent actors so that we can all sort of participate in a healthy ethereum together so today one of the things that we want to find out is how we can promote more small and independent stakers on ethereum before we do that let's get into who each of these people are on stage hello everybody I'm Mike and you may know me as wander uh I have been part of the Journey of the node operator Association a community organization to promote professional node operators that's anyone on the ethereum network who Stakes for a living or especially those people who like to take outside investment into their staking operations our goal as an organization is to try and promote this nascent industry as much as possible I'm also the founder of one of those kinds of organizations of course bamboo Financial Technologies does staking on ethereum for our customers High net worth individuals and institutions looking to get involved with ethereum staking so let's meet our panelists first up we have Ariel sitting next to him is facility and next to him is oshin then we have Darren and Jordan so while we have you guys here on this panel for just a second on this slide would you do me a quick favor and introduce yourselves and your protocol um we'll go ahead and start with you Ariel hey everyone my name is Ariel I work at blocks which is the company which is the core developer of the project SSV Network and which provides a decentralized infrastructure for interior mistaking for those of you who doesn't know us SSB stands for secret shared validators it's an implementation of DVD distributed by their technology and it was built to be used as the building blocks for high performance secure and decentralized taking applications solitary thanks uh hey I'm receiving I'm from Lido it's all that builds liquids taking protocols uh the segment protocol is relied on the living room that currently operates about 6 billion dollars a bit more and like that's the most we do sweet hello everyone my name is ashing and I'm co-founder at overall labs and oval is building the oval Network and it is building distributed validator technology to allow um high uptime validators and validators run by multiple people collaboratively thanks so I'm Darren I work on rocketpool rocketpool is a decentralized liquid staking platform we have a liquid statement token called Ari um I guess what makes us kind of unique is that where we have a permissionless validator set so anyone can be a node operator in Rockefeller um hey everyone I'm Jordan Sutcliffe I'm the business development lead at stakewise uh statewise we're also a liquid staking pool not quite as big as Lido we've currently got about 80 000 each stake with us um and yeah we'll uh one of our our key goal is to help reduce the Barrister entry for people to stake on ethereum and there's also a pretty exciting Road marketplace to go commissions too which I'm sure will come up in a bit absolutely thanks so much guys appreciate it all right so now that we've heard a little bit from all of our panelists who know who we are um let's get to know the platforms they represent on a more detailed basis so the first questions like I mentioned before are going to be for each analyst to answer individually and then we'll get into some discussion questions after that that we can kind of uh go a little bit more free form so our first question here is um it's actually you know I've written three on here but you know that the top one is sort of the real question how does your protocol promote independent validators on ethereum so Ariel I'll start with you yeah so first of all as the infrastructure for first taking application the that's that's the way we support the next wave of those taking applications to attract more independent validators and operators and our platform is completely permissionless and so anyone can join and the requirement is only to to run a node and it comes along the standard nodes the execution and the consensus that you have to run and we have a lot of resources available a lot of guides we have a big developer Community we can help you out with anything you need and very easy and simple to set up yeah so uh at Lido we run a valid data set of professional operators that is regularly expanded at the current time we are working on a solution for us to allow us to onboard independent validators which is not quite as easy as uh it is for different models I've taken because we do a liquid taken token and we do it without requiring operators to have a bond for the risk we have to manage risk in different ways and it's very hard to do with a permissionless mode I think we'll get there but we have a day yet three and on the oval front um we're implemented maybe slightly differently than some of the existing pools you add our software into your stack and you run it with you know the other operators you want able you either run on your own or with like multiple other operators you want to run a validator with and but generally speaking it's permissionless and there's a launch pad that you can go on and set up your validator and create it with your counterparties you know as you wish and there's no restriction to get about so the answer to the question are we actively recruiting this is a resounding yes yes yes yes yes uh we have like a deposit pool full of eth that is waiting to be matched with new node operators uh and we are actually bringing on new new data operators very very quickly um but we we need more and more um so as I said uh rocketball is permissionless um we have about two percent of the ethereum stake at the moment um but we're growing very very fast and we've got it over about 1600 uh node operators so far and we're getting kind of you know more and more each day quite it's quite interesting seeing the stats it goes up quite quickly but yes yes we are inclusion uh so stakewise in its current form runs a validator set similar to how light it is where we have our Dow approved a set of node operators for the network um but we've just announced our plans to launch a fully permissionless platform in December this year where we um a couple of people have hinted on the the requirement for collateral collateral requirements when it operators So the plan for stakewise is to allow anybody to join the network in the fully permissionless fashion without any collateral requirements and so for this we've had to design a novel staking mechanism um that basically ensures that we can provide a liquid staking token that still has flashing protection despite the lack of collateral requirements from node operators um so are we are we recruiting new node operators we've done well being definitely will be in December excellent excellent it's great to hear um these are five of the most prominent ethereums taking protocols on top of the basic protocol and all of them are looking to move towards permissionlessness and onboard new operators so if anyone out there is thinking about running an ethereum validator you have lots of options so let's get into some of the costs and benefits of each individual model each of there's been some Illusions so far to the differences between each of these protocols each of them has a different um design for how they've decided to set up their protocol and there are some trade-offs and there are some advantages to each of these so I'll go ahead and read this slide I should have read the last one too but we'll go we'll go ahead um first what Revenue can node operators expect in your platform especially it would be really great to describe anything above and beyond the typical ethereum staking Revenue where that comes from especially would be really nice to know another one what are the risks on the other side of that the operating a node with this protocol entails so you know the audience is almost certainly going to be thinking in the back of their heads one of my risk adjusted best options here you know can I take on more risk to get more return how does that work and the final question here on the same topic why should node operators choose your platform ultimately at the end of the day you know and this is this is where we get a little bit of a competition going on so sorry guys um but we'll go ahead and as is tradition we'll start with you Ariel yeah so our network is choose their own fees and we are also non-custodial so that fee does not come from any words or of the office takers it comes in the in the form of SSV tokens that we pay on top of the basically on top of nothing just for the operation so the revenue they can expect is whatever they choose to to set to charge um what are the risks of operating a node I'll answer this differently the current risk that most staking providers have are highly mitigated through DVD because you have fault tolerance you have more security no one skips the the keys online you only have shares of it so there's no really single point of failure so a lot of the things you have to do around to mitigate or reduce the associated risk are very much lowered once you use a ddt-based solution um why should you choose us first and foremost because it's gonna help decentralize ethereum right and because of the mechanism which each validator in our system is distributed between a lot of different operators meaning for each sticker he has to choose multiple of them it kind of gives you a lot of more Revenue a new Revenue system right because there's a new channel channel to be chosen by others that need to to validate their operator to operate their validators um yeah I think that's about it thanks yeah so uh in Lido we have currently 28 not operators and we expand that number when we get more stake uh in a way that um no no you're not no non-operator lined up in Lido has like a big shy of stake we try to keep it like less than one percent of holiday mistakes but uh um no it's around like that it has numbers around one one point five percent or so um and they should have enough stake for for it to be a a good business to to work with vital uh so we're talking about like about southern operators of South South Valley data so uh which makes it uh like a good deal for for another operator to run in lighter uh that's uh the current setup and the selection is done by peer review so like we basically ask the not operator so either like 28 of them to rate the people who lived [Music] um who want to participate in lighter the risks of working light is mostly reputational like if you screw up like that's going to be very much known and you won't get more stake from from wider or like from many many other uh sources of stake potential see and on the over front rather than talking about what Revenue you can make on top of a base um I might instead look at where you might be able to save money as an operator um with overall and distributed validators the two ways you can do it is you can take part in some other distributed validator or you can you know control all of yourself in like four different availability zones or something but generally speaking if you've a fault tolerant validator and first off your devops risk is much lower because you're not waking them up in the middle of the night every time the server dies and they can you know deal with in office hours and separately on the hardware side most people keep a small amount of validator keys per machine because when you go offline there's very little you can do about it if you fall tolerance you can safely kind of start to lift those numbers um and then the last one is if you're running validators with a group and you don't have total custody of it you're staking or you're slashing Insurance costs come we're hoping to come way down because the worst case scenario here is if you're compromised you know the other three people have to go and like create a new key for you for the validators don't get slashed um you know the validation don't go offline so the risks are a bit different but hopefully you know lower like net net in with DBT uh so in terms of uh what with revenue and so each of each rocket pool node operator brings their own collateral with them um proof of stake is called proof of stake for a reason this has to be something at stake and so they bring collateral with them um now with in terms of Revenue they actually earn um the you know the base ethereum fee or for um for their 16 East um but then we match them with 16 East with liquid stickers and they actually earn an extra Commission on the 16 East that they stake for the pool so they get 15 of the rewards they generate for the pool so they get kind of more than you would if you if you were a solo sticker plus you need less ether because you're only 16 you don't need 32. um we're looking at lowering that um in in very in the very near future as well uh so in terms of risks um there's slight bit of smart contract risk with rocket pool because we're a decentralized protocol uh everything is trustless in the sense that node operators don't take custody of funds or anything like that from liquid stakers so we have to go use Smart contracts to do that um but we are we have been audited by the best in the business uh when I say audited I mean like tons of times it's like like four or five times uh so you know every release we do we get multiple audits uh and so we're very conscious of that um other risks in terms of like performance risk so if if uh if you're slashed it does come out of your bond not uh our Earth stakers um but uh but ethereum is actually a very forgiving protocol it's very unlikely that you get slashed and there's kind of pretty much one reason why you get slashed and clients consensus clients are actually built-in protections for that so um so if you're offline it doesn't actually matter that much you can be offline and you'll earn that money back very very quickly so um yeah so that's the that's the kind of the risks uh while you should choose us uh if you love ethereum uh you should probably come with rocketball um but also but also we have a fantastic Community um that's actually one of the things that I love about rockapool is that you come into our Discord and uh it's absolutely amazing a community of people who are passionate about securing the theory awesome I'm probably going to answer this in Reverse um so we designed stakewise V3 um to help decentralize ethereum and the key target audience well one of the key target audience for stakewise V3 are Solo stickers so what are the current issues with solo stakers these guys and girls are the like gold standard for decentralization on ethereum but their eth is locked away um they do not get the benefits of liquid staking and it's no surprise that the most popular platforms and the majority of inflows into staking over the past year have been with liquid staking providers you know you're allowed to unlock your Capital to use within defy you can unstake um all or at least a portion of your Capital instantly and this is something which solo stickers have missed out on and so with stakewise V3 solo stickers will be able to move their nodes over to stakewise and be able to Mint the liquid staking token off their notes so this gives you know solo stickers uh it's the idea here is just to make solo staking attractive again you guys can get um it basically solves the capital efficiency issue with for solo staking on top of that you'll also be able to accept each delegations from others from others um so for example maybe you've got enough to run one or two validators yourselves um but your your infrastructure your your PC you're running this these validated on could actually run hundreds and so with safewise V3 you will allow you'll you'll be able to get anybody depositing East into your mini staking pool um and you'll be able to spin up multiple validators and so not only will you get better Capital efficiency you can mint a liquid staking token from your own youth State you'll also be able to earn revenues from staking eat of others and maximize the potential from your infrastructure um so yeah touched on the revenues part there the plan is for 100 of the revenues on the eat stakes from other people to go to the node operators themselves so similar to your system um and I guess the risk so one of the risks if you're looking to ramp up your uh the amount of ease you're staking for yourself but also the people one of the biggest risks is that you're just not attractive to other people to stake with you and so we've designed a system we've designed like an operator scoring system where node operators which have high quality whether it's a proven on-chain uh historical performance whether they do purchase some collateral or do have some slashing Insurance in place whether they help contribute to the diversity of each staking in terms of geography and client diversity then these node operators will be rewarded by having a higher operator score which will attract further capitals so again we're trying to build this system which encourages decentralization and there's there's a couple of ways which we can control or push decentralization through the stakewise V3 infrastructure great thanks so much go go for it I missed one important Revenue they'll kill me if I okay um so the other uh Revenue stream that you get with rocketball is that you stake RPL which is our native token uh with the um with the eth uh and for doing that you also get RPL missions as well so RPO inflates by five percent per year and 70 of that goes back to node operators so node operators kind of get like this um this RPL kind of Interest as well got it thanks all right so now that we've got to know our ethereum staking protocol is a little bit better let's get into a little bit of a panel discussion about um the future of ethereum is taking and where they want to take the future of their protocols where they see ethereum going and how this whole thing is going to evolve in the long run one of the questions that I have as a node operator myself is what happens to my stake in five years what about 10 years what is my returns going to look like are they going to be lower who out there in the world is going to be staking on ethereum is it just me all these questions and more I'm sure are popping into the heads of the audience out there if you're a node operator um so these questions are going to be a little open-ended so anyone can answer if no one does I'll just pick somebody so that's your threat um but hopefully we'll get some interesting discussions going about the future of staking all right first up so the first questions we have is revolving around the distribution of staked ethereum what do you all think the future of staked eth looks like on the chain how much will be staked out of the overall and who will be doing that who wants to take this one yeah I can all right yeah yeah so like we we have actually uh like a very strong thesis around that around which we built Lido I think that like most of like about 60 70 percent of other will be staked and most of these will be staked in liquid staking and most of these stake liquid state will be in uh um you know protocol based liquid state and could not like not exchange base liquids taken or something like that uh the reason for that is just it's a better product for for a sticker and it's extremely useful in in defy and defy if defies out to outcompete the traditional Finance uh using the Lucas they can will grow with with it so and I believe it will all right anyone have any any thoughts on this I'm sure you do I'd also agree that I think the future of each state would be improved and that a very high amount would be staged the one thing I will say though is that I think most stake will be operated by groups I do think distributed validator technology has more upsides and downsides and I think you know even in your pools like Lido give one percent to one operator right now but I think they would prefer to like spread that risk across you know four operators rather than you know being exposed to like losing them in like solid chunks so I do believe that it will be improved but I do believe it'll be groups not single entities running stake yeah for sure yeah and I guess I'm talking about Distributing across pools is similar to um how you can distribute stake across protocols so I think it's important that there's not a monopoly or it's like it's not a winner takes all Market in which protocol controls the most uh liquid staking uh on ethereum essentially a couple of reasons one there's been risks about having Dows controlling a protocol which controls a significant share of the beacon chain that's been widely talked about but there's also a competition element as well like competition is healthy and it's important that we are all competing against each other um to to better each other and also improve the health of the ecosystem the more we compete the more we will innovate and the more we can improve the health of the ecosystem so and that's the interesting part that I think picture very much yeah I think the the market for safety is going to the water level will arise so much that I don't really I'm not that worried about competition because I know the the rise in the water level is going to be so high that um it's going to be there so at about 50 I'm I'm thinking is uh probably more uh in terms of estate uh it's kind of like a how much is is in long term versus short term short term you know you want to use it for gas although with accountant abstraction you could use a liquid staking token as as that so you know there's there's that sort of balance between those two things so yeah yeah so I don't think it's Luke it's so much different regarding the distribution I still think about 30 will still be and centralize the changes because it's very comfortable and a lot of people still trust them it's very easy regarding the other percent um I think it will be from pools and staking services but the market share of those will be very competitive right right now we have around 14 millimeter at stake this number is projected to grow to about 40 million 50 million in the upcoming years and that new reader that will come in will not only grow to the existing pools or Services we have right now right it's starting to be a big market and once it's a big Market there's a lot of competitiveness and we will see a lot of different news taking pools a lot of different Niche and a lot of different user user segments that are targeting um especially when you're taking to the fact that allowed a lot of the D5 will be involved in staking or the other way around [Music] um so yeah a lot a lot more a lot more competitive a lot no more new actors interesting so I'm hearing a few different things here um one thing that I'm thinking um everybody seems to agree that liquid staking derivatives are the future for staked ethereum and that most staked ethereum will somehow make its way back into liquidity again sounds pretty reasonable to me especially given the growth of lsds on chain right now yeah I just want to add a final point it's it's hard to put an exact percentage of what we staked but ultimately it's a risk reward so it's clear that linguistic and derivatives will be integrated in D5 and the utility of these derivatives tokens will continue to grow and so it gets to the point where unless you're paying for gas fees or doing something that's very specific to requiring eth it makes just complete sense to stake your ease you can you secure the network and you get to earn a yield there is always going to be an inherent risk on any of our protocols and it will be like in like traditional Finance sense it'll be like a risk return how much are people willing to take on whether it's a couple of percentage yield on their eth to take on the risk of owning liquid state and derivatives so yeah and there's a lot of capital that's coming that's going to be coming in like institutions is a big um focus market now for a lot of people in the space um so and everybody has different risk tolerance tolerances so if you're certainly interested to see how things how things grow in in the future um but yeah again I repeat I fully see LSD is being uh and the majority of what you see across across D5 at least yeah and another thing I heard from this was uh that you think well oh she mentioned it very succinctly there that groups will be uh much more aligned in the long run than individuals um with the ethereum stake it's makes sense to me as a node operator I would want to have backups and I want those backups to not be me because you know something happens to me I need a backup who's not me totally makes sense Ariel did I notice you're about to say something yeah also I think uh like the users the stakers will be less loyal because once you can exit there will be a lot of migration between the project right and competitiveness yeah but also with all the new technology that comes in especially DVD I think in the in the bottom line most of the stakers will be able to sleep better at night and knowing that they have more redundancies more more backups and more resilience infrastructure great point so speaking of the new technologies um I have another discussion question that revolves exactly around that so other than withdrawals which we all know are going to be the most important thing for ethereum staking um there's I I've been a part of a few conversations today at the um fantastic Devcon event that have revolved specifically around withdrawals and how quickly we can get them out or wait for something else or whatever but at the end of the day we all know withdrawals are really critical that's the one real piece missing from the crypto economic puzzle for ethereum staking at the moment so you can't use that sorry it's not allowed as your answer the question is other than withdrawals what is the most important upgrade for ethereum staking and so anyone can take this one vastly I'll skip you here you want to go Darren yeah I I I know that silly and I agree ocean as well so uh there are two important upgrades uh that rocketpool and I think most a lot of staking um uh kind of pools need um and that is uh there's a there's a EIP called 4788 4788 it means that um so at the moment um the beacon chain or the time the consensus layer and the execution layer are two separate things uh there's the the two separate Concepts they don't really talk to each other and so as a staking pool you kind of need these semi-trusted oracles Oracle information across the two uh there's this eip4788 which puts the beacon chain State Route uh accessible to Smart contracts uh that gets rid of all of that semi-trusted Oracle stuff and uh and it actually opens up a lot of innovation for I'm staking pools and others taking businesses so that's that one the other one is so currently there's this withdrawal credential called 0x01 and that is essentially when consensus rewards are withdrawn when they're when you exit a validator it goes to this 0x01 credential and now in staking pools a lot of times that's a smart contract that ends up Distributing it to all the parties that you know need that that Heath or should have access to the eighth uh but the uh and 0x01 is important because it facilitates this these protocols to be able to do non-custodial staking the unfortunate thing about Xerox zero one is it doesn't allow you to exit the validator you have to rely on the Node operator to do it so in a permissionless uh situation where you don't as a staking pool we don't control the validators with the the node operators our node operators are like 1600 individual node operators all over the world we don't have no control over them whatsoever uh you know we 0x01 enables a protocol to be able to initiate x's and that sort of thing so they are they're probably the two things from our point of view of my point of view uh that that we kind of that are important for upgrades getting a lot of agreement here a lot of shaking heads yes I want even like Shield EBT because I think that's obvious that I think it's an important upgrade mistaking but um yeah I also Echo we were talking about it literally outside is I think 4844 on the beacon State Route is super important because really the like biggest in my security hole in all of the like liquid sticking protocols so far are there oracles and it's yeah really one of the last things that we need to take out to kind of decentralize but they they kind of had to be there when the chains were totally separate and even now there is still no kind of communication but I think I won't feel super comfortable until those oracles are mostly taken out of the liquid staking protocols yeah to be spicy say that we're the only ones I don't think so no not necessarily I mean I'll give you a quick background um the way I got into ethereum was taking was actually through rocketpool I will um give a shout out to the I'll give a shout out to trading I'm sure some of you are watching out there um that's uh yeah right Darren was not lying a racquetball has a fantastic Community um I I have of course you know I try to be as neutral as possible up here I cannot chill rocket pool above the others they're all of these staking Protocols are fantastic and if you want to stake your eth doing it with any of these protocols is a great idea um I will say that one of the things that I learned about rocketpool really early on that disappointed me is what you're talking about this Oracle uh Dao concept is necessary for the running of of Rocket pool and I was very disappointed in that since it was a centralizing factor now I think that you know all of all five of your Protocols are trying to do the best you can to stay as far away from centralization as possible but um you know in order to truly get there we're going to need what was it eip4877 four seven eight four seven eight eight yeah oh okay yet yet yes yet yeah that's up to one of you to submit all right um anything else on this topic yeah I I want to throw a couple of curveballs like this but uh what is going to change the landscape but like in some in in some ways at least um one thing that comes to mind is like their own plans to scale involve a lot of a lot more of traffic and a lot of more storage space uh for the uh for the operators and that's going to increase the costs of running the the node so it will like it's not clear if it will one will not make it like less possible to take from home but it might so that's something that we need to keep in mind and the other thing that that is also a curveball uh is risk taken stuff that like for example again layer is working on basically when you can take your steak and idiom and expose it to the some other product calls as a stake that can get slashed if something happens it's not clear how much adoption it will get how much it will be used but if it will it will like be a combinatory explosion of how much risk you can take and how much rewards and which tokens etc etc which will make liquids taken over this combinator explosion much harder because like right now you know like either Miss on some of the Rewards or you take additional risks and you not clear like how much of the threads can in what combination you should have or you should take or you shouldn't so it's it's going like if it takes off really it's going to make the life of protocol developers much harder that's a great answer um I think that if I remember correctly someone from eigenlayer was supposed to be here today in the audience anyone know okay I'm very excited about that as well and maybe next year uh once they launch or get a little further in their roadmap we will have them as our sixth panelists you never know all right um so let's keep it rolling because I want to have time for audience questions um the next question here is uh we're gonna go back to some discussions about defy and lsds if you're unfamiliar with what LSD is it's this crazy drug that makes you see Fish I'm just kidding sorry uh no I mean ethereum staking liquid staking derivatives uh liquid sticking derivatives are the encapsulation the tokenization of uh staked ethereum to make it liquid again and you can do all sorts of crazy things in D5 with this you can collateralize it to make loans you can have those loans called and lose a bunch of money you can do all sorts of crazy things so um one of the things that I think that um you know lsds are are really changing in the world so far from what I can see is uh the defy ecosystem is starting to adopt lsds as an eth replacement in some ways mistaken staking eat staking has many times before been likened to treasury bonds for eth in that they are sort of a risk-free rate for the ethereum ecosystem it's not entirely risk-free but it's you know has has that some elements of that and so the tokenization of this you know and and adding that to defy has a lot of effects so um let's uh let's get to the question how will liquid staking derivatives lsds affect the defy ecosystem in the long term so we know today adoption is rising um do you think that this will Plateau will go down our LSD is going to replace eth in defy long run who wants to answer this one uh probably uh so as you said that you get you know a decent a decent yield on your on your Heath um and what we're already kind of seeing uh kind of protocols D5 protocols adjust slightly to the fact that these now exist and we're going to see probably a big shift in Innovation over the next like kind of year to two years in terms of how new D5 protocols come online to take advantage of the yield that's being generated from these um how it kind of breaks apart the principle and the yield and how you do kind of funky stuff with that so yeah there's a lot and even like um liquidity platforms that start you know um anyway the community platforms are kind of using these um these uh liquid staking derivatives um to uh to kind of yeah add add an element of here add some product value and and uh and stuff there to their products their protocols so we're already kind of seeing that um yeah I completely agree with Darren's points and there's a few things that I I think there's a few goals that we have to achieve in order for lsds to be a net positive for D5 so one of them is having slashing protection inbuilt within an LSD and you know DBT is going a great way towards uh helping with that and we talk about validation withdrawals being key um that is one of the key risks right now with an LSD is a deepegging due to lack of withdrawals and but even after withdrawals depending events can still exist if there's a match lasting Mass but you know what I'm trying to say last slashing event there we go yep um so that's one thing that I think we all need to be cognizant of the other thing is like figuring out how to provide sustainable deep liquidity and liquidity for probably all of us is probably the bone of Our Lives because it's super expensive and it's key to being a liquid staking protocol and again withdrawals will reduce the liquidity requirements but we still have situations where in um in a Black Swan event like the ones we saw earlier in this year there's there will be situations where you still need deep liquidity and so uh yeah that's that's something which we definitely need to figure out and the other thing is also making sure that again it comes down to having diversity of liquid staking derivatives if there's one um LSD that's the best that everyone that's like that's 90 of liquor staking uh within ethereum and it's the 90 of the uh uh used across D5 if there is ever a hack or an exploit in that protocol then that could be like catastrophic to the ecosystem and so again it's another argument for having multiple lsds integrated within D5 um to help protect some of the key systematic risks of the of the ecosystem see um there's one thing that wasn't mentioned here yet which is the like kind of Base rate of reward um I do think that it the heat sticking award will be a bit of a function like why not your ether an Ave instead of you know getting staked Ethan locking that an Ave and stuff there's no reason why people won't go for the four percent but at the same time how will lsds affect D5 I actually think that the high chance that he alluded to that lsds will wreck a lot of wrecked a lot of defy um we saw you know it's kind of calmed down the last few months but there was a lot of you know D5 protocols looking for some product Market fit and they were like how about you recursively leverage up your LSD like derivative and gain more yield like what would go wrong sounds great and then we saw on May there was um what did go wrong yeah what could go wrong and we didn't really see what could go wrong there was a lot of stuff behind the scenes that stepped in to prevent stuff going wrong that that was what went right really unfortunately but uh yeah I think Vasily passed a comment about I'm not sure what people really hypothecate I'm pretty sure yeah so um due to answer the original question like I recommend to that a bit later right uh to answer the original question I think that yes the stakehold like the Civil second token will be replacing either and the reason uh in indifi at least uh and I think most of C5 as well actually and the reason for that is like a three-fold actually um one is that with time we will have less uh source of yield in in defy like curve uh spring will come to an end eventually like people will stop like selling CRV or buying CRV or like um then it's going to dry up and like overall like there will be elastic which mining uh so the sticker Awards will be the most important and the largest source of uh yield in the ecosystem um that's one thing the other thing is with time protocol risks goes down because protocol becomes more proven that our best but better techniques better more experience etc etc people will trust more uh Governor street because it's also going down with time the protocol specifies itself and like defend against gun sculpture etc etc will also have that stories go down uh the yield becomes from from second rewards becomes more important to the ecosystem so like there is just no reason not to use ever uh stick that uh instead of feather um it's a very hard thing to overcome the um like the the most liquid uh token in the like except Bitcoin right in the in the crypto world um but it will happen on natural causes eventually like the creek is is very important but it can't compete with that um that's one thing the other to answer the question um I was like very much terrified this last like half half a year uh but it turns out that like was I was like like way more pessimistic about how the um how people actually I'm sorry my time's up to interrupt there you just have hello hello we just have five minutes more that's the way to okay like if we have if we want questions from the audience yeah it would be great to take some some questions from the audience um so so sorry vacillate it I'll give you a quick yeah can I just Express the minority voice over here and obviously lsds has been great and people thought in the in defy um especially before withdrawals are available and but there's also a lot of risks right there's the the liquidity the smart contracts they're depending and all of that and and it does come down basically to your to your risk tolerance right eat its king in that in this case when I give my intro to another protocol I give him my major and all the associate riches that come with it and I think the big players in the upcoming like the near years will still prefer to natively use either okay all right well thanks so much guys uh we're gonna move on to the audience q a session uh because we have just a very small amount of time left so I saw you shoot up your hand right real quickly right at the beginning so Hi how are you congrats and thank you my name is Pablo I'm the founder of Sensei no the first node operator in Latin America we are talking with all of you and I think something really important is not only geographically centralization but also less dependence on Amazon as most of the operators work with Amazon we try to work with local and Regional data centers my question is how do you distribute a Mev uh yeah thanks sure yeah I I cannot say that it's very simple the same way we do is taking rewards uh like rewards are the same as taken they go to stakers mostly they're not operators get the fee and later gets its fee but 98 of rewards go to stickers uh with rocketpool um you uh so obviously as I said 16th is node operators 16 is liquid stickers and so uh in terms of Mev and priority fees uh you it's a kind of equal split between node operators and uh and liquid stakers except that the node operators get their fee on the rewards so they get 15 of the of the commission on the on the rewards so they still get that kind of extra bit from the from the Mev and um nav and priority fees uh that's the usual case we've also got like a smoothing pool um where uh this is particularly important for small node operators that are running kind of a couple of validators um the way that block proposals work is very variable so you can have like two a year or ten a year um and that hits small node operators hard so if you join the smoothing pool everyone samples their proposals together which works particularly well for Mev because with Mev that's essentially a lottery block you may have end up with a lottery block that goes into the smoothing pool and then basically everyone gets a share of the smoothing pool so yeah that's what we do we have done for one last question for two one here I have a question about operator set so in the two cases here like Lighthouse stake wise more professional operators are involved rocket pool kind of a blend honestly of both would love to hear more about from Statewide and Lido like do you see a future where your pools include professional validators and at-home validators working together to achieve a common goal uh yeah yeah sure so that's uh what we're trying to design right now uh in in like we think that most of the stake uh should be managed by professional operators still um but we want uh we don't like what we want is to light up a bit pipeline from like a homesteaker to professional operator so you can kind of operate um as a like as a solar operator and Lido with small amount of stake and if you do it well and if you want to do it like as not as a hobby because like honestly most celebrators are not rational like they're not making a business out of it they uh does this for fun uh which is great right but if they want to do it for like for for their job they should have the ability to like earn the reputation earn the like the um their metrics required to get under into the like set of big boys and grow up because otherwise it will be it will lead to catalyzation like three year stops um and yeah completely so the way B3 is designed I I pointed out solo stickers as a key target market but essentially this this protocol will will satisfy yeah every single anybody who can run a node can run a node on on V3 and one of the uh from discussions with commercial node operators one of the key things for for these guys is coming over to just take away 3 so they can provide liquid staking with fun to their clients um and so mv3 every single node operator or group of node operators will have their own little mini staking pool and can then their users can then mint to liquid staking token so it offers liquids taking to everybody no matter whether you're solo sticker or commercial node operator so by proxy we're going to end up with basically like an Open Marketplace of of operators and groups of operators who are running various Technologies who are on the stage today um to compete for for stake and again that can be solar stickers and also commercial node operators as well great thanks hi there's only one of you there to estimate the amount of I mean the percent of sort of stickers that the network that the network will have in like five years I mean can be higher than now or lower than now great question because I mean lsds are great right uh you can use your stake position as collateral and you also average out the rewards right so why is solos taken you there's no point of that right some people will do it even for free but yeah what will happen in the next five years more sort of stickers on less or less almost takers thanks well if statewide's V3 works we'll hopefully have more um as I said the reason why and obviously touched on it it's it's almost non-economical to be a solo sticker you do it for fun or to because you're a decentralization maxi um and so you know our goal is to try and make it economical and let them let them get access to liquid staking which they have not been able to before so so we've rocketpool um it is pretty much no different to being a solo Staker um the you have autonomy over your node uh you bring collateral so you have a stake uh the only difference is you get paid more that's that's the that's the only real difference from it from an ethereum perspective and from a decentralization perspective uh you know it's exactly the same so yeah that's that's where we come from today yeah if I was to add to that I think um the question is there'll be a long tail of like solo stickers for sure the question is how much the stake will be on them um and that's where you know everyone up here is trying to figure out how can you let soul of stakers like have a bit of capital in someone else's Capital if there's a rocketpool scenario make them Bond you stakewise V3 you've let the like people take the risk and choose like a vault for like a certain risk and we hope that with distributed validators you can trust small stakers as if they were an Enterprise you're like yep for you guys and you're all credible and you're not one you know person you guys can have 99.99 uptime so we can you know trust putting stake on you you can't exit you can't even get flashed so we hope with DVT people like you know light on stakewise all of them can you know throw a lot more ether onto small stakers and make it you know make sense that he said not to just a last leading kind of Die Hard Hobby um yeah yeah on on our side like how we think about it is uh to have a lot of um so not operators um you need to like design system in a way that first uh does not require them to hold the bond because like most people who want to run and know they don't have this much money like most people like don't have this much money period right uh to to to to to to to run like even half of you know what a data like crying like lying around so like they have to be selected not on like unbonded and sound Bond way and that means uh on the other hand that in history manage risks and you need to manage the white labels like for example you uh if you want a lot of solo operators in the protocol and you want to syncy by that you need to understand that these are not like the one operator in these guys like in like in trench Court like this 100 nodes um uh this is like essential for not so for protocols that mostly manage risks instead of bond but even both the products will act like there is a lot of uh folks run the rocket pool with all notes for example um so these are hard problems to solve but I believe they are solvable so yeah I just want to add up to what the Austin said um imagine if you could use like DVD to pair yourself with with the repeatable top class operators or even to pair yourself with your friends which you trust to run it and so the technology advances that will come will reduce the barriers to do that in a still reliable way oh sorry uh another thing rocker Paul doing uh So currently it's 16th that you need uh so in our next release it'll be eight and then in potentially in our next release lower so that's how you get more node operators that's what we that's what we want is more individual node operators not necessarily more stake great all right well unfortunately we're out of time for uh new audience questions but I promise you all five of these folks are going to be wandering around the conference floor after this so if you have any questions for them or for me uh we would all be very happy to chat with you throughout the rest of the day and throughout the rest of the week thank you so much everybody for coming [Applause] all right I got it great job man that was great it was great thank you it was still here [Music] um come on [Music] are you missing anymore Andres Georgia hi guys [Music] thank you can I leave my bag here show this lighting chalk or anything that you want me to show detail to be honest oh no no no no is it is it good this one yeah do that there you go so this is a lighting talk which is going to be seven minutes and please a big round of applause for your ghost from Sigma foreign georgius I do product for Sigma and I'm gonna talk to you about how bridges can improve well to composibility um so let's look at some numbers about the L2 growth so at the moment there are more than 20 Roll-Ups on top of ethereum and all the total value locked which is a good proxy for user adoption is like around 6 billion which is around one-fifth of what minute is so that shows like that is going quite well um and two of the most important Roll-Ups like Arboretum and Optimus respectively they have more than 160 dabs on top right however there are some side effects so all these protocols and apps are silos across all these Road Labs so the liquidity is fragmented and the end user experience across using all these Roll-Ups is not so optimal so it looks like there is a trade-off between low fees and hydroelection throughput overcomposability so what is composability uh it's yeah in other words it's the money Lagos like it's what fueled ethereum growth all these years and yes we can simply see here is uh on L1 uh how our yield aggregator can use a decks or how um uh Landing protocol can use a standing protocol I can build on top right and as you can see here L1 is yeah the risk composibility another one and all these optimistic or ZK Road Labs different ones uh the there's also composability inside them but not across them right so that's uh the issue we just described um yeah so as an example these are four of the most popular protocols and we see that they are developed they are deployed on ethereum and the roll ups and yeah at least two of the road labs but all these deployments are separate from each other right they cannot communicate with each other there is no connection between them um so you can see the the L2 ecosystem is quite huge uh quite thriving with all these kind of apps like Dexys yield aggregators nft Marketplace synthetics but it's fragmented um and here's an example use case from from a user perspective right so a user has some liquidity on curve let's say on arbitrary they want to move it to optimism to do that they need at least 13 transactions like wallet confirmations and they need to wait uh seven days for exiting the roll up and of course they need to pay the exit and the entry fees right on mainnet um what has been the uh the role of the bridges so far um apart from the canonical Bridges there are at least 10 bridges for roll-up hopping or this second ladies no better okay um so we solved two of the problems so you don't have to wait seven days anymore and you don't have to pay the enter and exit fees but all these 2013 separate transactions still exist right right uh so what we propose is you know that the bridges should move away from uh just this year C20 token bridging and focus more on message passing right so how do you pass messages from an L2 to another L2 or to L1 and yeah the end game of that is yeah you can call them the cross roll up money Legos right so it's this is the same um diagram we showed before but now you can basically use a a decks on L1 to communicate with uh derivatives protocol on an L2 right and and all these kind of um synergies over there um so yeah the the benefits of these cross relapse composibility from for the end user would be that they don't uh have to manually Bridge anymore for any kind of cross or lab transaction like a token swap or moving the liquidity or any kind of government governance actions like voting or Market making or money market transactions like lending or borrowing not having to move the collateral or nft marketplaces they can Market the market the the nfts whatever they want in wherever and L2 they want so how this could look like [Music] um so this is uh yeah our proposal like a close roll-up composibility layer and you can see on top is one uh imagine like one roll up on top and another roll up uh below and in the middle is the relay so it's basically off chain uh relay Network and the main concept here is that you have a generic message passing smart contracts developed on both deployed on both roll ups and you have the so-called Adobe contract which will prepare and parse the necessary messages right so this the setup will help any smart controls for now from one up from one roll up to communicate with another roll up or even with uh layer one yeah so that was basically it let me talk um [Applause] [Music] yeah we can have some questions I don't know how much we have one just one question yeah in case here's a question sound here Sunny though Sony analysis hello hello foreign how does the relayer maintain uh L1 level of security like you mentioned so I didn't mention that it maintains little one security but yeah there's several kind of setups right so you can you can have a fully trusted setup you can have a trust minimize setup with um you know kind of optimistic model or a ZK model so yeah I mean if you're if you're talking for this specific proposal we're doing uh you know we're starting with a kind of controlled setup and we are exploring um like optimistically you know putting the state back on L1 or you know using ZK so this is something this still work in progress thank you so much big round of applause for jorgos in Sigma so we have our next light lighting talks so anyone wants to change room guys for people to fill the room these are just like seven minutes so if you are interested in get to your next next stop it's time to leave the room this has been intense guys hi hi presentation are you in trouble yes all right so is this just back and forth that's it that's all I need to know okay oh so big round of applause for final trouble truffle hi everyone as planning I write a thread every week on Twitter about what's going on in the layer 2 ecosystem focusing on protocol developments and educational materials so because of the work that I do and because of the threads that I write I feel like I'm in a very unique position to talk about the themes in the layer 2 ecosystem and the trends that I'm seeing so I'm hoping to give you a bit of a bird's eye view of the layer 2 ecosystem today and what I'm seeing in the themes so to start with off-chain data off-chain data and Roll-Ups is here to stay I think it's fair to say on the roll-up level we're seeing a push to give users the choice of off-chain data in ZK Roll-Ups that looks like validiums and volitions and for optimistic Roll-Ups that looks like arbitrum Nova and metastas optimistic data availability really the question you should be asking yourself when you're considering off-chain data for your dap is what does this mean for security what does it mean for my users funds uh and I think that there's a lot to consider there if we accept that off-chain data is here to stay then we should be thinking about ways to make those apps more secure despite the off-chain data some dapps don't need all of their data on chain and those that might need more security there are some solutions one thing that I thought was really interesting was an article that actually came out today by Paulina who's someone on Twitter that I follow you may have heard of them suggesting that we have split security data sharding on Roll-Ups this is literally an idea that came out today so as far as new trends I expect to see some implementations of this sometime in the near future but definitely not right now but that should help with some of the security concerns around off-chain data and roll-ups uh we're also going to continue to see progress and Innovation on the bridging Fund in front we just saw Georgia's talk about some really interesting ideas about how we can have composability uh but some of the things that I want to talk about are how popular layer 2 Bridges right now are centralized and they keep the fees rather than sharing them with their users that's not really a paradigm that we like in the ethereum world we don't really like centralized operators we don't really like middlemen so I'm expecting to see that Paradigm being challenged one thing that we already are seeing hot protocol has announced that they're going to be more Community Centric so that's just one early example of sort of that shift that I think we're going to see we're also seeing really interesting work around ZK proofs to improve Bridge architecture we can use ZK proofs to verify so Suez Bridge created a proposal called the slush proposal doing just that we can also use ZK proofs to create like clients with ZK snarks which is a relatively new idea succinct Bridge wants to do that so that's where you should look up if you're interested in that so I would definitely keep an eye on ZK proofs within Bridge architectures as a way to improve those architectures and also in case you missed it l2b announced last night the release of their Bridge dashboard which is really exciting because I think the more information that we give to users about the security of the bridges that they want to use the more we can push Bridge protocols to work to increase security and also we're giving users that data so they can make the informed decision about which bridge is right for them uh when it comes to optimistic Roll-Ups we're going to see these protocols Branch out and really dive into Innovative optimizations I've called them optimistic optimizations which I think is kind of fun arbitrum Nitro and optimism Bedrock are both huge steps forward for the ecosystem yesterday at the roll-up Day event vitalik actually proposed several possible ways that we could decentralize provers and also diversify approvers and luckily for us both are both arbitrum Nitro and optimism Bedrock are already architected in a way that should allow for multiple provers and different types of approvers and one of the cool things about both arbitrive Nitro and optimism Bedrock is that they're sort of Paving the way for allowing validity proofs within optimistic Roll-Ups which is really cool and something I would definitely keep an eye on uh Roll-Ups with layer 3 capabilities will honestly be able to eat up a lot of the market if they get off the ground with offerings like privacy daps permission dapps for institutions games and even creating space for alternative L1 chains to execute on top of the layer 2 and ultimately still settle on ethereum gaining ethereum security success here will depend largely on ecosystem support documentation and ease of use this is also kind of a new theme recursive proofs exist on starkanet now but they're still pretty new and I haven't seen any actual implementations of layer threes yet if you have let me know I'd love to take a look but I do think layer threes will be part of the discourse in the coming months and years as all of the ZK Roll-Ups especially mature and go to mainnet speaking of ZK Roll-Ups zke EVMS are likely to dominate the attention of the layer 2 space in the coming months ZK EVMS are really exciting and something a lot of us have been talking about for the past I don't even know how long honestly since layer 2 kind of became a thing and the reason they're exciting is because they are theoretically compatible with existing ethereum tooling making them much easier to use they allow for a shorter waiting time to exit to get finality and also because they use ZK proofs and we all love math uh well I do anyway and I think as these protocols enter mainnet the debate will turn to what counts as a true evm what is close enough what is evm compatibility and how much of it do we need for a zkevm to really operate the way that we expect it to we'll also be talking a lot more about the Innovative architectures and use cases that ZK EVMS allow ah so I'd say things are getting a little spicy in the cryptoverse around various Decay Roll-Ups that are entering the ecosystem I I posit that competition is good and I hope we can turn the spice into something constructive and eventually coalesce around some helpful standards I think we're sort of in that diverge converge area when it comes to ZK Roll-Ups and we're still on the diverge side but hopefully we'll get to converge soon and you know we're going to see a debate about how important zkevms are and that's also going to necessarily mean a discussion of how starknet's non-evm ecosystem Compares we'll see more comparison materials and discussions of how security decentralization Etc Compares between the two types of ZK roulette protocols there's no question in my mind that the ZK space is red hot right now and I expect ZK Roll-Ups to really take the stage going into 2023 if you had to pick one theme of anything that I've mentioned it's ZK Roll-Ups and probably zke EVMS in the near future oh sorry uh so it turns out seven minutes is not very long I'm literally being told right now my time is up uh so I did create a list of some more Trends to keep an eye on that I didn't really have time to dive into I'm particularly interested in the modular blockchain designs uh protocols like Celestia and how they will relate to how those learnings can be taken into the layer 2 ecosystem and maybe make changes there so you might be thinking how on Earth can I stay on top of all of these ecosystem developments and the space moves really quickly and that's a valid concern so I've provided you with a list of some of the some of the Twitter accounts that I follow that have some great educational content I really recommend following these people it's the best place to start and then from there you can kind of see who they follow and what they're posting and become as educated as you want to be about the layer two space and how the ecosystem is growing so in conclusion Layer Two is here it is changing fast and it's bringing some of the most exciting Innovations imaginable to the ethereum ecosystem and again my name is feyna thank you all for your time sorry for going over time and I hope that this top is educational thank you for now thank you so much so guys and girls that are here lighting talks I know like seven minutes you want to stay more so I beg you at least 20 people because we have a line and we are going to sum up till three lighting talks so after this is the last one we need to clean the room up so you're gonna stay for one more and to keep like the people moving ah okay I think this is next yep all right Belgium thing all right what up good all right cool hey what's up guys I'm Matt I lead product at arbitrum and off chain labs this is really cool there's lots of people here it's really exciting I'm actually really happy that the last two people covered you know kind of cross-chain messaging and bridging and Layer Two stuff because I'm going to talk a lot about about that but it's great to have context so again I'm Matt welcome to my TED Talk um so three things I'm going to try to cover here there's a lot of stuff going on in Layer Two there's a lot of stuff going on in crypto I'm gonna try to focus on three things last one and it was broad talk about bridging talk about compatibility and interop and I'm going to talk about some scalability issues that I think we're starting to coalesce around that we have been talking about for a while all right so bridging right you got to move funds from layer one to Layer Two at some point this shouldn't be something you have to think about right so we want it to be there we want there to be zero degrees of separation between the layers at some point in the end game right you Bridge right onto Layer Two so here's where we are today it's a state of bridging uh it continues to be really challenging and continues to be risky we see hacks all the time it's not great um but it's something we have to deal with ux reviews as tricky or even impossible depending on the asset right not all tokens are your 320s sometimes you can't Bridge sometimes you have to bridge in a different way so it becomes really challenging for someone trying to use any kind of crypto product in the beginning when you have to educate them on what bridging is and what that means is for developers not all token implementations are created equal on arbitrum we have standard versus custom bridging so when you're bridging an asset over for the first time we can deploy that contract for you on Layer Two and it'll Auto it'll Auto deploy but yeah if you have things like interest or or other things that are you know maybe more custom for implementation you have to work with us or you have to you know build your own custom solution so it's pretty complicated and I think you know we're not in a space where things are perfect but we're making a lot of progress and kind of at a higher level view this is our Bridge you know fantastic we're from the team but if you think about it bridging is really designed for power users right so it's not something that in the long term we want to have be kind of like the canonical thing you have to do on on the blockchain um so what's next right and again this is lightning talk I'm trying to go as fast as I can one thing that works well is fast withdrawal confirmation so on arbitrum Nova we have a data availability committee we can actually use that system to allow for withdrawals back to L1 to take less than a week be almost instantaneous it's not something that's live yet but something we're thinking about it'll make this a lot smoother um let's see yeah something that we're you know we'd like to see happen in the ecosystem is is more wallet integration you know deep while in integration I would say with fast bridging so when you're you know in a wallet you have an asset you can just use a fast Bridge from within there you don't have to go on the browser and actually sort through all these options and make trade-offs with your own independent research you can actually have that be like automated for you obviously that's going to require kind of community discussion um this is just something that goes without saying or something that we've done a lot of work on is within the bridge itself increasing discoverability of fast Bridges and making sure it's more performant right not all bridges are created equal there's lots of different options and so doing what we can from an agnostic perspective to make sure that we provide the best ux is something that we try to do all the time um and something I'd like to see long term is Bridge aggregation standard functionality right there's lots of trade-offs you have to make to find the best performance the best security between all the options that are out there having functionality built in and I talked about this with wallets before as kind of a standard functionality where you're given a bunch of options you can see the average cost and you can make a decision for yourself in the UI that would be great and making that standard across all options would be phenomenal so sorry I'm going really fast but the next thing I want to talk about is kind of compatibility right so we're in a good state right now in Arboretum on a lot of layer twos you know drop-in compatibility is standard so the good news is you know evm programs work out of the box it's something that you can rely on moving on to layer two as a developer is basically kind of like not a huge issue and the other thing is core infra that you kind of come to know and love on ethereum on other blockchains RPC providers price oracles you know graphs monitoring analytics it's all it's all there it's already ready for you on L2 so we've got a robust set of tooling and infrastructure if you want to deploy so we're in a pretty good State there um and you know sdks and Frameworks we have new things like Foundry coming up every day they're beginning to multiply you have lots of options you have lots of things that you can you know potentially use to make your development experience easier this is just a quick graphic with Nitro we're running gef at the core so in terms of compatibility we're you know reaching parity as much as we can um so what's next right uh you know you can keep pushing the envelope here but one thing that we want to think about right now contracts solidity as you think about Roll-Ups in the future uh we want to see broader language support for smart contract execution so this is something that you can imagine having you know different options to write your contract code in and compile down to something that'll still work with the evm it's a really exciting time um again right now on on arbitrum we have two dimensional gas we price uh L1 call data posting costs separate separately from L2 execution costs this is something that you know if you're if you're a developer of your project you're doing a lot of things estimating it and getting accurate pricing for the gas as time goes on especially with high volume is really difficult so making that better and working with wallets to have different standards with transaction types is something that we want to push for um again I mentioned before lots of these sdks popping up I think as more developers you know come into the space and this goes on to this next Point longer term having better rails for web 2 developers to come into this space space with canonical paths forward for any kind of applications and having Community consensus around what the best tooling to use is is something we need to all think about it's hard to make those trade-offs the last one I want to make here is there's a huge perception issue in kind of like major Tech I came from that industry before working here people are not super enthused about crypto development and we need to do something about that I don't know exactly what that is but it's something we all need to think about so kind of a philosophical point there um I think this next point is kind of on performance right like as as much as we can increase throughput and bandwidth and execution speed on the Chain more people will use it more developers will build so the good news is this is happening all the time uh you know we're doing this today we're at a conference talking about how we can all work together to make this possible so there's lots of stuff happening we ship Nitro a couple months ago we seven extra capacity we lowered speeds things are looking pretty good for Roll-Ups and the one thing here here to think about though is we focus on gas all the time remember Roll-Ups and and blockchains in general are not just about gas you have to have Security on the Chain so making performance for validators or for for nodes that are serving as validators you know making that more efficient making that more accessible is something that's going to continue to be more important as time goes on especially with you know State growing in the way that it is and this is just you know a quick reminder fees are low it you know they're not they're not arbitrarily low they're not tiny but we're getting better things are things are kind of improving um and so I'm not sure how much time I have left yeah yeah so stapload it's a problem you know we're going to try to continually you know optimize for for client performance and you know there are a couple things that we're experimenting with rentable storage we've talked a lot about statelessness there's still a lot of work to be done here I think we have a lot of progress to be made the one last point I want to end with is at a high level in order for staple to be a problem we need to get people to actually use blockchains outside of like the canonical use cases we're comfortable with today I personally would like to see a lot more use cases come to Market with lower barriers to entry right now most games in crypto in order to play you got to spend 500 on an asset that's not something that most people can actually do right and you're going to make a leverage long on some ass that you've never heard of most people as they go into the world and want to try to experiment with these things you need to make sure it's easy for them to get to get involved with we want to make sure things like you know onboarding into D5 having account abstraction being able to pay with different fees for for your transaction pay with different tokens for your transactions uh something that we want to see something that we want to encourage um and something I want to talk about just as the kind of a last point is we we have novel experimentation going on with insurance on chain we see a lot of hacks we see a lot of teams focusing on security focusing on audits focusing having the best talent in-house to make sure that things are secure that's not the only way to solve the problem you can kind of think about hedging in a different way so baking in Insurance into the core flows for Defy is something that I think there's a lot of potential and that we have lots more experimentation to do with so sorry for going really fast but yeah that's arbitrary and that's us thank you for the Sprint you did it so they're telling me that the queue is not that long but at least we need 10 people to move to the next talk um really appreciate it foreign talk like two people for seven minutes that's a challenge guys slides great okay so we're going to talk about a formal layer two standards working group which has been formed as an eea Community project managed by Oasis and we'll explain what that means but first I am Tosh Danish I work at the ethereum foundation on ecosystem support focusing on the Enterprise ecosystem so I work with the Enterprise ethereum Alliance chair the main interest group co-chair of the eea community projects got project governing board and this is Dan Shaw I'm Dan uh I've got a decade of kind of bringing together uh innovators and the Enterprise help bring node.js into the foundation uh been a a Founder done a lot of Open Source stuff and I am the co-chair of this and uh under Dr Andreas foreign is my co-chair and it was a storied background uh he's the spec lead on the Baseline protocol and uh as well as my co-chair assignment okay so uh yeah last talk really teed up why uh you know standards are are useful um you know to have a a space and a Clearinghouse for uh discussions and you know a neutral space right uh there's so much information that's happening that uh you know we need to come together and um you know our our perspective is uh in part the needs of the Enterprise and in order to sort of uh continue the the adoption that that we're seeing um Layer Two is essential uh you know so uh putting in into place those uh standards and specification to enable uh layer to thrive so why are we doing this as an eea Community project managed by Oasis and what does that mean so Oasis is a non-profit technical standards body that was formed in 1993 they've done things like xgml and XML and a lot of sort of technical software standards sort of along the lines of IEEE or w3c ritf so the ethereum community projects was formed three years ago as an oasis open project so under the Oasis standards bodies or umbrella what happened to my slots uh-oh okay here we go um by EF consensus and the eea so ethereum Community projects is a you know it's an oasis open project meaning it's open source Open Standards development and so it's we chose the waste because it's a pretty low bureaucracy and it's a flexible standards process unlike some of the other ones like the w3c and ietf did a lot more sort of bureaucratic encumbersome uh Oasis is kind of more ethereum friendly in that it's lower bureaucracy and flexible so uh some of the folks that are involved uh of course uh tashana and Andreas uh from the EF uh we have Accenture uh Boba matter Labs metis octane Labs uh optimism and polygon um and we'd love to have you so you know please come and join us um so what have we been working on there are lots of ideas for standards development topics in the layer 2 ecosystem the two that have gotten the most work done so far first is a canonical token list format which so the the issue is that most layer 2 projects have a list of tokens that exist on their layer twos and a wave that they map to in many cases a layer one token or a token on another layer or two and these lists are not maintained in any common standard format so standardizing the way that these token lists are stored it would be beneficial for interoperability uh another project is address aliasing so the uh the goal here is to be able to deterministically derive addresses of a digital asset or an externally owned account on an evm execution framework when it moves like when it moves across chains so if you know the origin chain of an asset you should be able to determine exactly derive the address of it on another chain um we have many ideas for potential future topics to work on layer 2 transaction fee structures layer 2 interface transaction transaction interface standards one idea that's gotten some discussion is about cross-chain bridging of digital assets with residuals so the issue there is that if you have a token like an nft representing a bond or something that gets royalties over time something that gets payments over time and you move that to another chain it breaks the connection between the payments and the asset so that's not a completely solved problem there's been some discussion about that we would love to have more ideas on that and if you have other ideas for topics I would love to hear them we'd love to have your involvement please get in touch so uh yeah thanks a lot we we meet uh bi-weekly um you can uh you know hit us up on our emails uh GitHub is uh github.com EA slash Oasis L2 and uh you know big big thank you and shout out to l2beat uh Dev connect um you know we were you know we've gotten this uh Initiative off the ground but uh you know thanks to LT beats uh event at uh devconnect you know we're really able to you know get a lot of the initiatives that you uh just saw uh you know set up and and really move forward so uh um you know we'd love to have you join us thanks thank you so much guys you did it the two of you were the fastest ones so once again I mean I know lighting talks are short by its own nature but we have people doing a queue so if you would like to sacrifice by the probably good of letting people be here we highly appreciate that let's wait a minute if people are wanting to go thank you that's it teach I hope I'm pronouncing properly your name sorry it's butchering it's but it's completely fine it stays taste okay so this is your seven minutes thank you all right so let's talk a little bit about my favorite topics uh which is Fiat on-ramps and layer twos um I'm dies I'm the founder and CEO of unramper and you can imagine my interest now let's go through some Basics what is on-ramp so an on-ramper is not a body like coinbase coinbase is broker as a wallet as an exchange we will Define fiat on-ramp here as a third party that offers a API or widget for wallets and exchanges so their users can then buy crypto so that's parties like the ones you see here there's about 12 of the biggest in space moonpay probably being market leader and each of these on-ramps is good in different things right you might recognize some names samples great southeast Asia transact this local payment methods as well Moon Bay tries really well and does really well and quite a lot and credit cards us now the question is how do you judge Fiat on-ramps so there's three main components here number one is fees quite obvious quite intuitive one dial too much into now the second one reach reaches how many countries there's a Fiat on-ramp sport how many Fiat currencies how many cryptocurrencies how many payment methods and the third one which is sadly overlooked a lot is success rate a lot of Fiat on-rem transactions actually fail so you need to have the right field on ramp that will actually make a transaction work in the right region now I'm from one member we are a Fiat on-ramp aggregator that means that we work with these parties we aggregate them all we put them all in a single API in a single widget and then we offer that to dabs wallets exchanges Etc um you see the interface there this is the widget now in that users can select amount of crypto they're buying fiat currency cryptocurrency payment method we figure out who is actually cheapest right here you see it's transact but you can see that the fees actually can differ quite a lot right when it comes to reach or actually if I go back a slide so this is choosing the on-ramp based on fees that I just said success rate is also really important right so we've actually just built an intelligent routing engine that can predict the success rate with each on-ramp for a specific user in order to optimize for completion rate um yeah then reach and really the gist of the talk here now if we look at the support for ethereum on different Fiat on-ramps then you can see immediately an unwrapple if you type ethereum you will get ethereum on different chains right so why is this important well we just heard two talks ago about we need to make it easier to get to Layer Two is easier to use depths on layer twos now one way is bridging but we've also heard the risks thereof and the ux issues so another way is making sure that you can actually buy it directly on Layer Two use layer 2 with credit card preferably so here's the landscape um I won't dive into zero knowledge versus optimistic because there's been enough about that already I guess but we see the range of layer twos out there and in the bottom if you can read it how many on-ramps actually support assets on that layer too so right now the one with the most support is polygon which arguably there too or not um and after that arbitrim we just heard from as well as then optimism CK sync and some of the other ones notably some of these layer twos don't even have Fiat on-ramps yet right so for users the only way to actually get there is buy crypto somewhere else and then Bridge which we discussed is not a great way to do it so some conclusions and Portugal the most popular layer 2 for on-ramps this is a multiple metrics that we track obviously as aggregator we get a lot of data and across all of these on-ramps across all of the people that integrate on ramper so they're most popular in transaction volumes number of on-ramps and supported assets because one thing is a on-ramp actually supporting the buying of has its own layer 2 but then second question is which assets how many assets and you see even with the biggest ones we see a very low range of assets being supported so it's really early days now it's miles better still than a year ago but we're not there so what then and what is on-ramper's role within it now we care about improving this because the simple reason for that is this is usually the first thing a retail user has to do right and often sadly these transactions fail often these tokens are not supported so in any way we can help out we want to help out so when it's about the support of tokens there's multiple ways um that we actually do help out layer twos and projects built on top of layer twos one is obviously we have the relationships with all of these different field on-ramps so we can help in improving the support for their two base assets whether that's you know the more regular ones ethereum use DC Etc or more specific assets however that is per project right that's not very quick in that sense not very scalable because it requires our human effort to work with you together of course we're willing to do that but we've also built a better way now this better way is essentially taking this concept of hey you still have to buy cryptocurrency with Fiat first with credit cards or local payment methods and then you still have to bridge it but what if we make this into a single flow and sure if we can buy crypto let's say ethereum on a main layer and then Bridge it over to layer two then still we only have one asset so what if you can then instantly also in the same flow merge the swap on the decks so that's what we've built that is what it looks like I see that my time is up um you can wrap up in 30 seconds right so that's what it looks like it's a flow that allows the user to go from Fiat to any acid on layer 2 if we want to make that work even through a bridge and a um the X transaction now the bridge is hidden on the back end here's an overview of the bridges and exchanges the access that we already support now we haven't been able to aggregate all of this ourselves this is made possible by the beautiful and great people at Levi um and yeah if there's anything that we can help you out as layer 2 as project only layer 2 as Dex on layer 2 to make buying any asset possible with cryptocurrency then yeah reach out at dice owneremper.com or Twitter or Telegram Applause [Applause] to do so would you like to wrap up when I show you foreign let's give 30 seconds more we are about to start guys already up in the front if you want to keep talking you can continue conversation outside thank you so much Dr Joshi his whole year is the stage seven minutes yeah thanks for everyone being late for this sort of talk so I'm yaochi the founder of earlier so earlier we are basically building the runtime execution and the elastic scaling layer for ethereum so before we dive into like earlier we want to know like what kind of fundamental problems we want to solve right so right now we know like ethereum pulse emerged and later on we also have this product sharding and lots of like scaling Solutions will be applied like sort of ethereum at the same time we have a bunch of l1s can achieve some sort of had through food with low latency but at the same time as we can see right for the past two years there are more and more popular applications like x infinity d y d x and also upcoming more and more games which already have like millions of users and have to handle like sort of tons of meeting requests every day so in that case is as you can see right um like for the past two years we encounter a lot of network injection gas War even for some iot like social means like one example on ethereum is this other deed that I have to me right so basically people probably pay more gas fees than the mid fees um it's not just um like sort of the scenario on ethereum but also on some highly scalable blockchains like a polygon we had these sort of sunflower game right but at the same time just like so many transactions and the congestion in the network same issue to Arbitron basically we had a very successful campaign to onboard more user but at the same time it's just like so popular and at the same time the network was so congested and then they have to pause until the Arbitron natural came out so they can resume such campaign so how we solve this kind of network congestion problems for general purpose are once so one like sort of a thing we observe and basically on our side we want to propose is uh about this application tailored out to execution layers that's something like when we feel like there will be some Network congestion for for the applications so the application probably can just spend off a dedicated layer for them to handle these transactions and in that case all the transactions and requests can be handled on dedicated layer and later we can roll up all the states back to the l1s and that's all we call it like either we call this elastic layer 2 or we can call L3 so some Matrix as you can see right earlier we can really provide a very high throughput like sort of execution environment with very low like sort of transaction fees we very fast finality um like right now some metrics with some updated and basically we can really achieve a sub-second block time and we even with like tons of thousand transactions per second I mean we are also support both evm and also wazan so there are two products we would like to provide the first one is like sort of short-lived application dedicated your lab and we call flash layers and later I will just share with you why we want to have this short-lived flash layers I mean well there's a persistent rule of solutions quite similar to the other like existing optimistic Road labs and the idea to have the flash layers is quite straightforward for a lot of Demands and requirements from the applications because we can see right for a lot of empty projects one of the biggest like sort of campaigns is the empty means and also sometimes it's airdrop right for this short-lived campaign right typically only lasts for a few seconds or a few minutes in that case they can just like sort of click a bunch of buttons via our dashboard and protocol will automatically teaspoon of a dedicated layer to handle the millions of requests for the empty mint the user can just do the empty mint and everything will be handled properly within a few seconds or minutes after that protocol will automatically roll up all the states I have to use back to ethereum without sort of any like third-party interaction like at the same time right apart from the FD means we also want to provide very smooth user experience in that case there will be like sort of first car for the serve and also a bunch of add-ons to make sure like it can relatively easy to onboard empty projects and also for some game projects beyond that as you know right for a lot of games or even some derived exchanges they want a dedicated layer not just for short leave your time a short period of time right also for a long time for months or even years in that case we will have this typical optimistic roller for it either like our platform right the performance is quite good at the same time it's both evm equivalent and also was I'm compatible beyond that we also have a bunch of implementation for the like clients for example in the future users or developers can just run the like client or the verifiers in their browsers in that case you don't need to wait for the confirmation from the L2 Network so they can quickly verify the latest transaction or the latest block themselves in that case it can further shorten the sort of challenge period and plus with some Hardware hardened the sort of warfares as the challengers so we can further like sort of really reduce the verification or even the challenge period beyond that right as we all know there are a bunch of state of Art and new ZK libraries and also a bunch of game and metaverse sdks which are not solid compatible in that case we still want to support these libraries so we have this wazam compatibility so we can allow the developers to deploy these libraries and literally can use the solid contract to call these libraries to really have a versatile execution environment for the applications um beyond that I write we also did a bunch of like sort of campaigns and use cases ourselves to show up like sort of the capabilities of all year one night we did one of these OG badge mint like two months ago we got like over 12 000 people participate in this campaign and all the ifts minted within 18 seconds on the dedicated like sort of flash layer as I mentioned right so after the empty mint minted like within minutes so the protocol can automatically roll up the activities back to ethereum so right now everyone can just treat the isotherm empty around for price of 0.6 liter or something and another like sort of example is is about game and we hosted this um like Community round for that Forest like three weeks ago and we attracted like uh tons of 100 players to play the game and and basically precise around 100 000 transaction per day the feedback we got from the players that basically they didn't really notice is a full launching game so the performance and also experience are quite good and in that case right as you can see apart from this good performance and also seamless experience we can definitely support both nft and also game projects yeah and right now like uh last week we launched the evm equivalent test night so everyone can just try out the like sort of the product for both of the systems and beyond that soon we will just connect to more air ones especially the evm compatible ones and just try to provide much better solution for both rft and the game and also derivatives exchange applications yeah that's sort of like all about the earlier and if you want to find more information just feel free to DM me on Twitter yeah thank you very much thank you so much big round of applause and we are heading to our last lighting chalk after that we have continuous Defcon so there's going to be drinks and food outside at the Shiva Shield out place so we have our next speaker on stage hello hello is this working let me check there's some empty seats over there if you don't want to like be there one second they're fixing the slides no hurries [Music] okay hello everybody how's it going my name is Martin I work at Urban Zeppelin and today we're going to be talking about the construction and why um it's uh probably the future of crypto ux I'm probably security tube let's begin so let's first Define what a kind of traction is and to better understand this it's better to speak about smart accounts you might be familiar with them already smart accounts are basically smart contracts that behaviors accounts they verify transactions they hold assets privileges roles like owner they can also call other contacts which is very important some known examples of this is a very popular nose is safe and multisig Arjun wallet that has social recovery and Instagram now a counter fraction is basically a smart account can also pay for its own transactions that's pretty much it uh what can we do with them well uh basically we can have custom validation schemes this means you can use ethereum signatures victim signatures whatever signature you want uh multi-signature or any other criteria or logic you want to implement for example this is only valid on Wednesdays you can Implement key rotation in case picture the scenario in which you lose your you compromise your keys instead of migrating all of your assets and roles and whatnot you simply rotate the keys and you're done you uh are safe um we can also have Origins social gory which is a very good feature and session Keys think of session Keys as basically um for example a Json web token or a set of pre of permissions you uh grant for example a website a web application so you sign once a set of permissions uh defined by some policy or something and then that website that can uh can um act on your behalf without you having to sign each transaction every time which basically gives us web 2 uh experience on web3 so how does it look today on starnet this is basically the interface of an account we are going to focus on the last four ones which are execute validate value declare and value deploy uh we can think of this in a two-step execution flow first evaluate step the valid step uh you can Define arbitrary logic to determine whether a transaction is valid or not there's there's a few um limits here for example you cannot read other contracts storage this is to prevent spam picture the scenario in which uh there's many transactions that depend on the storage of another contract that contract changes that storage and then invalids lots of transactions that could be a Spam so uh that's a prohibited um so this valid function is used by sequencers to know in advance whether a transaction is valid or not because uh instead of an eoa in which you can only you simply verify the signature you can only you cannot do that uh assembly in here because you need to execute some code and let's execute step does what you would expect finally since accounts are contracts you need to deploy them and you need to pay for deployments so how do you do this well basically we can do counter factor deployments which is you calculate the address of your contract before you send funds to that address that has no contract yet then there's this validated deploy function that the protocol uses to validate whether the funds on this address can be used to pay for this transaction or not and then basically you deploy your smart account well account abstraction and uh finally uh in starnet you can use open sampling contracts for Cairo in which we have an account or a regular account which is the stagnet signatures game we have an ethergent which is a theme signatures and an account library that you can use to build your own custom um accounts and I hope that by now you you got the idea that it means a huge Improvement in onboarding user experience and security that's it Oh Martin that was fast sorry one last thing there's a pop-up for this uh talk yeah you can just ask me right now I mean since this was the last talk you have the chance to get some okay questions from the audience of course we still have time over there you go um so in the ethereum version of account abstraction you'll have a separate mempool and the boundaries and stuff so I guess in um stock net this role will be replaced by the sequencer itself good I didn't get the last part oh so like in the so in ethereum LED in order to execute account abstraction you get a separate mempool and a boundary system so what would be the equivalent for stocknet right so I mean you mean eap4337 that's right right uh and you're asking about the pay masters no we're talking about how like is there an alternative impul that actually relays like better transactions or how does it happen concretely on starknet uh the use of account abstraction uh so basically you send a transaction uh and the sequencer picks that transaction validates this valid function um if it's okay then it's inserted into the block I'm not sure I got the question right uh so account abstraction is actually built in right sorry oh that was it yes there's native account fraction on the system there's no EOS so they're completely replaced by them how do we ensure that in the validation process the validation result will be the same in the actual execution um well what do you mean for example for example if one transaction depends on the Block timestamp uh okay sorry yeah so uh that's part of the limitations so you cannot read any external uh information from the contract that includes like blocked timestamp other contract storage so you're gonna use anything that depends on anything else that the very same contract so doesn't mean that every wallet address on stocknet cannot use those functions no no they done but not on the validate step they can on the execution step but the validation step has these constraints to prevent spam probably thanks yeah so thanks for the great talk and one question could you just have a lot of execution code in the validate step and only at the end find out that it's not validate not not a valid transaction and thereby spam those notes immediately definitely so uh but there's a smaller chances uh so you for some other reasons the so you could you're saying that you could invalidate the transaction on the executions part not the valuation I mean in the validate function put a lot of stuff in there complex stuff like it takes a long time to compute only the end there's a gas limit okay how much is the gas limit for the validate ah I gotta know okay well that's dedicated solution yeah all right thank you so much this was the end of day one and thank you don't forget to go downstairs to the Shiva Lounge also the hacker basement and thank you so much [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
