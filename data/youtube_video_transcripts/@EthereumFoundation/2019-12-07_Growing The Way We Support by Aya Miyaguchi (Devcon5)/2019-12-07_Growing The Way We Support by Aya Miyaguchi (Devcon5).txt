hello everyone welcome to them come five and welcome to Japan only tremulous are your possible gone by where [Applause] and to be honest when we were deciding on the location of Def Con this year I wasn't really sure about bringing this to Japan I know many of the community members worried like whoa that's to be in Japan but so fishery I thought that that it you know you mean extra pressure because I am from here but now that we are all here I am excited our community members are here if you have meaning meaningful conversations and showcase but you have built this year and also discuss the future of ECM so today the topic of my talk is about growing the way we sport related to what we have been communicating so for those who have heard my talks or we know that we often talked about this subtraction mindset it's the idea that normally the typical organizations they tend to take take and also extend but um tries to share its inference and also resources so that everyone can go and I introduced this beauty in subtraction last year calm but there is more to this subtraction just it's it's beyond just positive feelings or just a philosophy it is a discipline subtraction does not mean EF is doing less nor working less than before subtraction is about disciplined action that is why it is different from minimalism we are subtracting our power in the mindful way long-term benefit of lithium like artisan or artwork the work requires has to be precise and once we overdo it even if the decision is not bad it's hard to fix it later this work requires Queen keen intuition and thoughtfulness but we still want to take some risk and also encourage innovations so with all these we actually have to work more to subtract our power he's a key inside of idiom that guides how he approached the word that stands out in my mind is support we have to give flexible support to support this very unique ecosystem and going the ways we support is our main focuses this year and many of you know that EF sports through grants this is a list of grantees this year 2019 and congratulations to all of the grantees that are on the list [Applause] well we don't just support bipods by looking at project with sometimes we give support for the entire domain such as how do we support multiple teams that are working on the interim to Porton clients or say channels and so on and in the middle I listed security because that's also deserved to be one of the domains and of course without core infrastructure Ethernet we cannot work and there are teams that are working so hard to maintain and also improve it and going further as part of being festival we sometimes support like incubating some project - for them to be kicked off and and also support many communities and help ETM be chain and I like to maintain one as an example it's here dog is run by multiple community members working very very hard every day and I hope you are enjoying weekly updates that are happening now and also they just implemented 10 extra translation or 10 languages that translated by all the community members globally that volunteer to do this and that is really I think very beautiful about this area member system so really congratulation to the team of so as you can see there are many types of support to increase our flexibility our Grants Program has gone into an ecosystem support program now we continue to provide financial support for those who deserve it but we try to think about like other ways to support by thinking what are the things that only the a thin foundation can do so this is the website of the ecosystem support program please check it up and so far I just showed what we have been doing but it also matters why we have been doing this way and if you want to listen to the vetos alga is going to give a talk 5 p.m. tomorrow so please come and join us tomorrow and I just talk about what EF is doing and as we will continue to make these efforts with other community members we see big e TM news coming in every day but the gloss is happening here are some chart that you can easily show that goes with numbers and every day we hear like different news happening especially lately sometimes from big enterprise side but it's been exciting despite the price of the crypto and release all these girls I still think it comes down to why we are doing the we were working on the team and it is important for us to keep talking about this and there is my personal story that led to my own vision of a team outside of my career this is this is my dad and me as a baby I was born and raised in Japan and my dad was a little stubborn difficult he was successful in his career but unlike many other Japanese he never trusted those who has a title as experts so he told me just because someone has a title as a doctor that doesn't mean what they're saying is right so I learn from him that you know to to question everything and to do your own research before making any decision and also also things were not equal for women here but still not unfortunately and I did not think many things were not fair but were fair to everyone so I became more sensitive to unfairness in justice and in balance my core values will remain the same today stunning here and I would like to see the world that where we have less unfairness in balance and justice and I believe boxing can't help that and that's the vision we do not want to forget and one of the important purposes of this step cone is to share our vision your own vision and also inspiration and and discuss why we're working on it same with that this year we welcome 52 scholars from 25 countries the list is here [Applause] and also supported by consensus consensus and UNICEF innovation so thank you so much and there was an application process and criteria was whether they represent the gender ethnicity or region that are normally under represented in tech and also the needs of financial support for their learning and of course their passion in learning I am the passion of these members is very inspiring I heard story about a scholar from Egypt she wanted to learn about 8:00 a.m. but it's it was very hard for her to know where to start as a Muslim woman and so coming here is really a big deal for her as their learning process and also there was another person who is obliphica from sillier living in berlin he wants to learned about ATM to find a way to empower other refugees and also for them to come all the way to Japan wasn't really easy like like you know compared to many of you or even but of course me being being Japanese some some scholars from Afghanistan they couldn't get a visa at their local place and they had to apply all the way to Dubai and wait there for days for the visa to come and and we had to keep supporting them by by wiring here wearing my name is Western Union which is kind of a shoulder for the problem of the we have in this society but but it is really it was really hard for them to come here but their passion shows that are they this is real life-changing opportunity for them so I really encourage you to find them to talk to them they are supposed to have orange wristband and the reason why we we do this is not just to help them and I think the more importantly I want them to inspire us and eventually we can learn from them the real interesting use cases of the team are happening in the areas were solving problems in problem would change their life immediately so we are not only doing this to help them I believe actually they will help us to find ways to use it and more and last but not least speaking of our vision today we have a big great big news to tell you from the community actually but so just today UNICEF announced crypto denominated fund to support open source technology benefiting children and the future of the children and EF is supporting this initiative as a first partner [Applause] I think that this this is something new that we are doing of course we have many other priorities we do not forget that but this this is really important for us to show our share our vision and and the UNICEF innovation team has been working so hard I was receiving update every single day last couple months especially and I was just exhausted by hearing that but you you can imagine how hard it is to when I heard about this idea you know imagine doing this that one big organization at the United Nations which is now very very conservative so they they did lessen teaching how to first starting with what it's crypto and then how to use for it and to to really advocate and what's great is they really they really believe in the power of crypto cooktop not just blockchain not just as a currency so this is viruses crypto denominated fund which is I think very very revolutional so how it works is for example we provide it and they they provide either as either to support these startups they are supporting those startups ordered the start of that working on their own problems in their own regions using blockchain thus crypto is the one that is doing like a digital prescription using box chain solution and in their other other projects when money's you top picture is working on towel sort of towel solution and the last one is working on the funding solution using box chain and oh sorry so what what is exciting about this party is it's a small start you know the donation we actually yes we successfully sent a my it's supposed to be able to say this there are many things I'm not supposed to say because they're big organization but we were supposed to be able to successfully sand under Eve to UNICEF funds warhead and then they distributed to the headquarter and then the recorder distributed this all this project already that happened last night it is work and then clearly congratulations to the team Chris Berman Christina and the other units of innovation team which in working on this territory and then thank you for letting us be part of this and I think this was a perfect they just kick off they've come lastly we are not just in Japan we are in Osaka who are here for the first time so I don't know how many of you have recognized Osaka is a very unique city in Japan and actually it is a city known for comedians this city produced most number of comedians so if you talk to random stranger on the street they are supposed to say something funny so try that for anyway there are many many interesting that you can try here many interesting food okonomiyaki takoyaki which I'll add and and also I'd like to thank send big thank you to the city of Osaka that provides us this opportunity but also that just gave us this beautiful drum performance this morning and thank you very much sir Cassini [Applause] okay that is all for me and hope you enjoy Epcon and hope to talk to you [Applause]
