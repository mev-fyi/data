hey hi my name is Joey Kanani and I'm a founder and CEO at matok basically we are building a lair to scalability solutions for aetherium and we use plasma forever to secure our valuable assets and we use proof of stake for work incisors mechanism to validate and keep the chain running so basically today I'm here to talk about mostly how we at matok thought differently than other layer 2 solutions and created a way to create a solution adoptions for dabs and users we are going to share this story with how we did our tag and the usability part of it with mattock and so yeah so this so basically in general in the blockchain ecosystem what we all want right these are ultimate questions right now do we do we need scalability do we need more apps no basically what do we need is users more and more users and in any industry if you if you take taken notice of outside decentralized systems decentralized market you will see growth is very important for any any industry right and what we are targeting is just users right someone said like when you think about the problem you think about you think a backward and work forward so in here also we are when we think about the problems we think about users and how we get more users and what backward like we how we get like more DAP developers to build on the block chains and how they can actually get more and more users so it works both ways you need users and for that you need more and more dabs and for that you need scalability so that how we like that's how we walk like backward think bigger and walk forward so we start with a scalability in how it it actually affects and more most apps in general so so for for that what we are doing is that we scale we provide scalability as a layer to using plasma and predicates we also use side chains right side chains is a simple because there are multiple layer two solutions like straight channels other other other solutions but the problem with other solutions are there like there is a trade-off between the amount you need to settle your so settle your transactions and make your transactions on the on the side on the layer to what we use is the simple side chains using plasmas and prop stake and we hide all other complexities underneath and just provide DAP developers what they need so here so just for developers if you if you if you see the what DEP developers need we just provide easy onboarding for all the DAP developers we provide their valuable assets using the using plasma and for them we need also provide as easy migrations so once Joey Krug said if someone comes to me and asked for let's say if I can scale your dabs in next six months we gonna we're not going to do it because it takes huge amount of efforts and time and money to migrate from one solution to other solutions just to scale your dabs instead people want to focus on the dabs instead of focusing on the scalability right so what we do is that we just provide simple and easy migrations and testing for developers most of the times on the app developers need different kind of three models three models right in this area if you if you want to make a transaction you need each areum or maybe you need to integrate meta transactions but here we actually provides those kind of solutions in build on Matic so that paper just can use directly on the platform and just run that apps easily there is another problem in the whole ecosystem is a UX problem right so if we think about if you are scaling any theory amande simple providing a platform for developers you also need to make sure you provide a pest UX in the industry so people can just move to the next platform right if you see that the previous markets and before the decentralization movement wave one and wave to each iteration makes your users your applications very user friendly right if you use currently if you are using uber before they you are using it axis right see the difference between the user experience throughout the web involve when wave 1 wave 2 came right so when we talk about web 3 we should think about how we can gonna provide better user experience for our users better experience for our developers and for that we also have multiple development tools as well as which people can see directly integrate and know provide kind of no seamless experience for the users so now if you think about the what we as a Matic provide to developers is that we use plasma so basically plus in our plasma model we use more VP there are multiple flavors of plasma and currently but we use more VP plus we actually use EVM which with plasma right so some of you know that it is not viable to create a plasma which is general computation for Center computations but for now we are using yessuh - we have like kind of solutions where you can use es a 20s a 71 indirectly and directly on on a VM so basically what we did is like we changed a RC 20 our standard a little bit and added receipts extra receipt to make sure like input output input 1 input out output 1 input to output 2 some kind of no simple account accounting on the receipts and it it actually helped us to create a floor proofs when you exit from the plasma framework so those kind of little bit tricks and tweaks we made on our plasma model to create a seamless AVM compatible plasma is a 20 and in 71 computations and if you think about simple a RC 20 and 21 it's just a simple computation plus or minus let's say if I am sending it then it died to someone else it just subtract the amount from my account and add so the opponent account write the other person's account but if you think about a little bit of complex complex a little complex state you may want to write your predicates so predicates basically just say ok hey let's say if you are using multi-sig wallet right when you when you move your state from the from the sidechain to a serum chain you need to make sure only only owners of the multi-sig wallet only can no withdraw your with tokens or exit your tokens from which theorem sidechain to each same chain right so those kind of state competition you can write using predicates predicates systems right now on medic but for us a 20 and most of the standards we actually provide directly in build support for predicates right there is a there's also some kind of problems in in plasma where you exceed your tokens from the precise chain to same chain it takes seven days or more because you need to make sure you you don't create a fraud on the side chain and it's exit instantly so plasma framework provides you a way to create No have a like priority queue when you exceed so it takes kind of seven days for exit but what we do is that we actually sell your exit in directly to know where the buyer and you get the X exit instantly but you pay some fees for it and you know it's kind of security with which kind of you know with with probability using just other person can just prove okay hey your exit is valid you can exit but you have to pay let's say point a point zero nine die for one die if you if you don't want to wait for like seven days so those kind of marketplace we are a building for faster exceeds on our system as we said as we said like we also provide multiple SDKs in development tools to just to onboard more and more tap developers directly on the directly on our systems the main thing is that we are not the app specific size change so we have like one public side chains which actually provides you composability and the network effect if you if you are building on layer two so basically let's say if you have an app specific side chain and you want to interact with multiple multiple DAP multiple contracts like defy systems you need to make a transactions on the different shard or different a different chain to make this work but here we provide like composability out-of-the-box and these systems actually works pretty well because it derives the security from the etherium if something goes wrong right so for security hmm is there and we just provide a partial partial confirmation directly and after after after five minutes or so you get this simple finality after after plasma checkpoints goes and the theorem chain so those kind of tweaks Antiques help us know make it the whole system smooth and for for of course our our our users and developers so in this whole whole system what about end users right how and users actually interact with multiple change so as a layer two we have a problem with interacting with multiple chains in one one one screen right so if you use kind of you know use meta mask you need to change your networks or your user has to change your networks very frequently so let us say if I want to move my tokens from the ATM to layer two I need to deposit I make a deposit I need to make a deposit transaction etherium and then after that I can make transaction on the layer two right but here let's say if you are using meta maths or something like that you need to make sure you know you have to change your networks once you make a deposit but for that what we are doing is we are we are actually integrating wallet connect protocol which helped us to was which help us our users to interact with multiple chains directly so people users don't have to worry about multiple chains multiple deposits or exit anything right also when we talk about simple public side chain or public one public chain people can actually use enters multiple multiple contracts when they want if you use a simple simple app specifics change you have to your user help to move one chain to second of the chain to test your test your applications but here your user can anytime trade or interact with multiple contracts it also helped post able coins on the chain too so for users and apps can use use stable coins in payments in disinterred exchanges and you know multiple at multiple ways so those those kind of mechanism we are we are providing for our end users so also we are working on multiple widgets who developers can directly integrate for the users so so again they don't have to make deposits and exceeds transactions on the on the layer to so mostly of a system like if such kind of system can make users and developers life easy and for that developers can actually build new markets and kind of defy games new kind of defy which actually works multiple works with multiple contracts games who can integrate its say eunice web or multiple decks ease or simple other other games as well other games contract as well and so yeah those zones get rid of market and existing market we can actually target on when we have such kind of system so so yeah yeah and that's it thank you you
