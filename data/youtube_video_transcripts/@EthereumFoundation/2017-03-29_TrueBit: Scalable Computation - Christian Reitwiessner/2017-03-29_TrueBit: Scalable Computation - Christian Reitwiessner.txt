hey so I will try to explain to you what true but it's all about why we need it and what can be first I thought I wanna talk about becoming a pain ability this is a chart of Bitcoin transactions per day and it starts in January 2009 as in 50 now it's a linear scale and you can already see that yes so growing Deborah so much in the last month but yes and it's similar chart for a theorem this is yeah that is per day also starting in July August 2015 and I would also say kind of glory and yes so the question is um yes so we both of you might have heard that lock change do not scale currently and one of the main debate in the Bitcoin community but what does it mean what is this game to put it simply something scales if it performs equally well as it grows and currently for this coin there is empirical evidence that this is not the case because so it gained more and more popularity over time and now it's harder and harder to get Rebecca's accepted and they also get more expensive and of course this problem existed exactly the same way for appearing and perhaps even worse since the next any more complicated but currently if you did not hit this limit and what is the reason that are locked in stone scale the simple answer to that is that every people now has to process everything for next verify every single direction and of course this does not really work well because you have a suit you have the thickest block time the time between two blocks and inside in this time if the system grows which means it has more and more transactions than every node would have to process room or more transactions in the same time interval in scale of a scalable database systems for example you have the property that if is the usage increases of something of the database system then you can just add more servers and it will balance that out so if you add more note then you can cope with with high a man and that is not talking with block chains because of this property that every photo has to produce every single block and of course you have this property because of trust is if we redistribute transactions just across some noise then those nodes slightly able to cheat because yeah not all other nodes to verify the connection and so as our defense capability is also exactly the same problem in athyrium and the difference between here and bitcoin is that we were very well aware of that from start which does not mean that we knew that the solution for very start or that we had some way to two already yes prepare for skin ability but we at least knew that we will have to do at least one artwork to cope with the schedule is a problem and there are at least three proposals how to yes scale the aphelion block chain and the first one is the capital research program so Casper is not just about proof of stake but also about trying to save the blockchain and the adherent Casper is that he is yeah it comes across hardness more or less the same a concept that is used obviously these scalable this should be detonated their the idea is that yeah you just send transactions to just circle notes so verifying but Casper makes it secure again by rotating these very famous in regular intervals then there is a rate which is the etherium analogy of the likely network which is a pic online network and there the idea is that you can scale transactions by grouping them in a certain way you move them off trains you don't process them in the blushing so deeper still in a in a different network and then at the end you group them we proved mouth and protection to assume your transaction and just put that transaction on the rope chain in very very little words so you can get more turn you can get more yeah transactions and clothes into a single action title boxing at that hard case and true bit is the third way and there the idea is to yes state computations I will explain more later how about an action means and way to scale it is using interactive verification that you want to go to detail later yeah and also a nice thing to note is that only only Hospital requires an actual fork because the other two ways to skin can be directly implemented on the small country Magnus okay why use the scale computation so yeah if you don't have smart contracts between computations running on the blockchain but they are limited in complexity limited and resource usage because of the fact that every photo has a chance has to process every transaction and with true bit you can get smart contracts which do not have an estimate essentially they can be written any programming languages the music that is so if you don't have a gas limit you can just take a program written in Python and then just put the Python interpreter on the blockchain and randomizing program to that it seems smart contracts can be driven by neural networks so then we can have artificial intelligence on the blockchain and you need to have 5000 texts in for contracts which means you you have a smart contract then an access that terrifies big file and weak to single chunk in there or even computes a big sum over all the entries in this gigantic pile of course these smart contracts will not run directly on the blockchain we know that gate such the the trust promise will be the same as if they would run on the auction so this was a bit abstract some more specific practically saddled through but you can link Martin to block train so there's this does call you through your bridge project which tries to create a bridge not only from no time to eat hearing but also from a theorem conosco and the idea is that you can detain can take those those cart and move into the field blockchain where it will be a independent token you can move it around and they talkin there and then also will be back destroying the token and yeah releasing or generating new needle under fire for that you basically need a light client for the other network in the one network in the other network and the light client for those coins running on the theory oh well yeah and as I said so if you don't have any guesstimate you can just live in anything and verify for those coin lock train on ethereal another public is the golden golden is a project to ya pay for other people to do your computations and they're right they convention to be to actually and verify that these computations were done correctly and not a problem is life here they are they want to create a video streaming platform where people are paid to encode the videos and they want to use true bit to verify that employee must incur okay ah another very nice property of children i want to mention is that it has the code unanimous consensus this means that ok perhaps i should first explain the general framework so trim it works the way where you have the computation we have a program to run someone runs the program of chain and puts the result of it and then people can rewrite the same computation check that was done correctly if they want and the idea so this is similar to a blockchain we have Martin miners who process or collection and then verify each other and on a blockchain if you have a disagreement there and you can't work and if you can convince over fifty percent of the hash power that your version is the correct one then you basically convince the whole network now exactly like that but rocky and what room it is different because you have to convince every single person so as long as there is a knowledge there is a singer honest person checks the computation and post on the block chain that he or she disagrees and the person is actually right than this this it will appeal to so the first of all get the result yeah there's only one connecting for fresh emotions maybe not on every complication i have to project in connection to stop only then on the question and one I a bit another person sorry I wanna a connection and maintain that was common 114 and then how many different actors and all of it is no vaccine unique everything 15 then dramatically yes yes the only the fate of oxygen yes and the location probably it is how that done at your simply nerd will get it yeah so I took some of you have been here in variant on about the same topic and this first line was already in the first talk but the second line is actually knew so the months ago we sent okay is singing or singing on a clarifier surprises that nobody can cheat but it turned out that this scene honest verified not always there but yeah we added an economic incentive mechanism to actually ensure that this thing an honest process is also always there and so there are other projects which do similar things like stolen my exit and reform but the difference to those project is that they focus mainly on performing the computations or outsourcing the computations but not on the fact that they are done correctly and true bit on the other hand is yeah it's focusing mainly on correctness and not on yahoo to see the costs or something that's the truth is really about scaling up what can be done inside a single transaction if you don't have gas minute how you solve the halting problem I know where all the program okay then so it's with you in smart contracts but with an extremely with very much higher destiny of your right so some have some concept of gas but it's much more relaxed than you do okay um so yes this was a non-technical function we are one here suspension yeah helping stood there all Nintendo so how do we give them yeah there is that the main problem why we can't stand complications because everyone has to compete anything so the solution is obviously Villa system where not everyone has to complete everything soon I have a computation a task force in the blockchain and two or three people take it all and perform the computation and then post the result of the blockchain and the main point here is not we just take the the majority auditor but the main point is if we had any disagreement here then these people go to court and port here means blockchain so we have the smart contract judge which who finds out without error who gave the wrong answer and yet again the simple solution regime would be that the smart contract just rewrote the full computation but that again doesn't stay until the checking who was an error has to be magnitude faster than actually learning a constant he how do we do that we use a concept called the verification game so and the the key term is here is not something but binary search and we'll see how that works in a minute so a computation in a same communication model always consists of some kind of steps so we have a complication which start at step one and ends at step 1 billion and every single step is quite small easy to follow and we have a proposer with a win challenger with the same input but at the end they come up with two different options that's their their disagreement and what they do is they rerun the whole computation while taking a snapshot of memory and every single step computing Merkel trillion of that snapshot and storing the motor route they do not submit the mocha rules they do not submit all the local roots is watching when waiver this book and this means yeah then the motor who is the beginning of the same because they started with the same in a very fixed setting and will be different in the end eqs their memory content they're all for instance and then smart contract the judge will come and say with picture of the middle the second is a year and ask them for the local root of their state at that point in height and they might use the same answer this means so this means that a ten point here is the second half there has to be a single step at least one single step where we go from agreement to disagreements so those parties were in agreement here but the artists in the disagreement here so at some point along the line a year there you have they have to move from agree multi-discipline and that's just the point is we use research using values and we 25 years of an research so the smart contract are for the center position here and the parties again with mind here they get a different reply so we continued to search in this area this goes on and some point because they're the size of this time interval always half at some point we will reach a situation where we have one step where both parties are in agreement the next step were the artisan our disagreement and the good thing about that is that it's not contract n so if Mark contest can just take Sasha Fierce a situation to you in his step and just recompute any single step and text which is the correct result because yeah a single step is easy to compute we have you have some computation power on the blockchain but it's very limited and yeah it's almost as easily fits into it okay so this takes 20 rounds which is quite long I would say I mean it's still a tiny compared to 1 million percent what I said has to be magnitude faster unchanged and actually running the for computation but still um yeah the good news is that Miss Rogers rounds can be further reduced and so the more the chief correspondent certainly there's no is we are no way to get around that and but because of that if you if you try to cheat you already know you will lose in that game if someone watch it then why would you want to play the game so why do you want to cheat so as long as you know that someone watches you will probably not cheap which means that this verification game is actually never played it has to be there and it has to be encode and correct so this whole like it might be suitable yes so so if there are someone watches sell the verification game will not be played but still anything back up and the holidays so everything works works perfectly all people nobody cheats everything works fine there's one on us verify and verifies everything and but so how the game works is that first dissolve deposit base to all participants for the deposit on chain and if they are guilty of cheating then therefore deposit is destroyed and the people who discovered that sack they get a reversible so the verifier will get a reward if they if they find an error but if everything works works fine then yeah they never find narrow so they will never get a reward and this is actually a variable is no problem because how do you as a verify how do you prove to a system that you check the computation you can you can at the end you can say oh yes yeah seven that's that's also the reason I got but yeah I mean you knew the result performance how can you yeah you can just just have copy that so yeah over time the verifier will lose interest because they are not paying in any way but have to do act exactly the same work as the main trauma solvers so they will stop looking and as soon as the solvers notice that no one's looking anymore then they can cheat and the whole system itself so we need a way to pay verifiers for the work and solution to that is something called force errors and the way it works is you baby inject an error into this whole process which can then be detected by the verifier and then hit they can pay for that so so reserve it oh there's a cape perhaps I should explain the whole telling a bit more sorry about that so if you want the truth system to solve it out for you you have to pay for that so you have to pay yep a AP and missy is in part payout to the person who post solution to the task and in part is saved in a in a counterculture pot and if such a 40 acres and a verifier find the error then the very sorry has paid from that ipod and so yeah it is quantum is different the solder cannot be punished because of that had to inject the water it's a pseudo-random but it's a monistic process and the solver cannot kind of choose to include or not including al is that clear are the words of Jesus wait for a critical temperature so it has yeah it helps enhance law because whatever you want to move on again so true reminisce does not exist on blockchain that's why we need to sue remembers and it's kind of there are multiple factors that that going and it's just a a process that can be verified by a smart contract took the village voice will be waiting yep so the bestest there is the hook now and took the hole so that the proposal keeps the top then the solver was also doesn't prevent amazon parameters don't know that you implement man so if some deterministic function taking into account i think the the block cash and perhaps also the hash of the solution so so that and the idea is that the solver knows that this just happened okay let's not stop sippin x like we're another problem so this whole vanilla that this happens that so the solvent is forced to inject a force narrow and this addition is also verifiable by smart contracts on chain and if the solvent is not to inject the error then he or she will be punished and the problem is now everyone who texts this error gets the reward and now the solver can of course notify verifiers about the fact that we have that support arijit happen so the the idea what the sober injects the arrow but does not tell anyone about that because we want the verifier to actually reacts acute everything so right s'okay press yes these four errors so that the wall to find the first element of course not vote for Sarah we pay the verifier reward as first error because that's where we can pay them but the action ideas that we want to verify to verify our other connections too it's just so they they have to verify everything because such a fourth error might happen in every single task and you only know that it happens after this activity and so as a verifying as to acquire that that information that it forced ever happened and the way we want the very pious acquire information is by just reacted cheating the top okay and there's a second way that they can acquire this information and that's by asking the favor right because the sort of knows that the error happens because they have to inject the error and of course honest on a small cottage blockchain you have all sorts of weird bribery's things which are possible so yeah quite trivial to just add a mechanism where solvers are paid by verifier to tell this to get information and the question is how do we yep make the inner pirate on the announce Nerva that we were vibrant so hitting the very violent chaos but he acted as other yes is not about that we use a little patience correct department or I refer I need a square now you can't verify and there's no way to prove that you rear end that they understood where I don't really see it happened that at random more or less regular intervals of random the strong earth is very horrifying yes mine exactly can compare mining we just a payout yeah not remember another block what you want something or injected arable use people are anymore but next to take those HC and it might increase organizations you are sure to have everything yeah as a verifier since you can only pay for forced errors or four errors you want to only verify these house but there's no way to find out whether it so I mean the only way to find out are there are two ways to find it out and wanted rerun interpretation and the others getting that information from so when the other way around me to lend me a people for changing his identification is going on if we did it so whoever we don't care who actually runs the verification as long as some of them it's like a search shot you have to put it faith reward to keep you interested in is crazy where I increase it i mean i DNT senior but made for the wrong location 31 I just under that it's also possible to increase in the creation for the things they say the project when they believe you have been running a rippling 25 / the rewards the arable for errors and it's exactly the same thing to do whether you just very high so yeah how do you prevent this over from telling the verifies that so yeah she's very funny Emily oh so now I mean I like how much information we validate that is a true how come on Aussie yeah I mean so what a blockchain you never know I would love to never that on the blockchain nobody knows that your fridge so you don't have a reputation system attached to the solvers and yeah it's difficult and also I mean so we want this to be to be tight also again kind of arbitrary bribery smart contract that's why just something the solvers is not not revolutionary here then we'll be changing their when it is a random change in this orbit yeah no not in here saying red wine something else perhaps instead carriers that anyone can be verified and also you can from us you can you can step in and and challenging a computation from outside at any time you're not so that's another model when you say you have to verify the computation but if you do that then you have to punish people when they did not verify the computation that's kind of a tricky thing to do here except what we come up with a solution computation I have to get a doctor Andrew and we all web with all the information about a whole lot we don't want to select so this is meant for large communication yes and the whole process takes model collection okay occasional reproduction so it's the episode it takes a constant amount of transactions in a good case where we don't have to run the verification game but the length of the computation can we increase pirating work at work or whatever if I am more than that I let you only lot yes perfect tribute enough gave the number of possession gave the amount of computation on connection will be very much but ok I'm good okay this is how you prevent the silver from sharing the information about the fourth error with the verifier and so so we don't prevent the photo from also challenging their own computation cases for third of the good thing to just solder just get another revenge and we can factor that in with the regular world so that's fine but the idea is that the reward will decrease dramatically the more challenges there are so he's not actually be improved but that's how it was a decision in the white paper so i will say like that so if we only have one challenge this is usually just the solver challenging challenging yourself the solvent will get a reward of 100 inches some memory and if there is another challenge then the two challenges will both get 25 and in some  so if the Sauber shares that information with someone the soldiers reward would decrease from 100 to 25 so that's not something you want like to do and also if you are a verifier and acquired that information by we're on the computation yourself you also don't want to share it because then yeah it shows you as it's over it's over found that out then your rewards trees from 25 to a point so yeah that's the way i can solve this information sharing problem only good babies and against whatever the computations work right so it removes a lot of money with my team or like whip it okay so so for so yes they attend this or rather the blockchain and even the the blockchain has an upper limit of how much what you want to do on a block chamber what we value the National what to do so if you if you put something on a block chain which is worth more than the whole block chain then attacker can just attack before the block chain and get this thing so and to purchase it and the second is not really exactly but it is not problem for policemen another and connect either they're very high of 23 wait until someone challenges and then only rugged individualism is because I'm quite sure that the edges problems in digital is a creation then it all involve without great I hands yes very good question um that especially relevant foot sulfur because the solvent immediately knows there is a force error so you could just watch is the solver challenges or not and because of that you have to randomly make something called take challenges so it has to be some coming for real mechanism where you first post something to the to the block chain which look like challenge but then in the end turns out about another problem you just be and bring down some random yes right Patera agrees and compared to them and each occasion and require while of work order and von solo and so what you really would like to do is just for tank without he normally body having a group health computing Sutherland or Ella and so working Pazuzu would say hey I edit and share information anyway is oh geez whatever I don't get any money because you know I share information network and challengers also I don't get any money for their 405 and save all the money for the for us that should not have to run I hope using data because I always share the information on post ever go on to Emma and look at my other complications because when otherwise did share it makes it all about their own they want a narrow so no one will charge any other communication to none right so if there between another human plan on the corner of and money you can pay by not getting around the other mutation be so this is the reward the very landscape or so if you do it every ten tasks we were more than glad about every 100 talks but so this is the only board the very highest get for verifying all the connections over the top until now for Sarah and the amount of work they put in it the same amount of work that the solar to do and so this is the mountain pain out here is extremely large so it's comparable to the sum of all the computations fees paid for the tasks until the last you're talking about ready arbitration already so my time of any prizes Nigel daughters and a pretty and but instead of a good time your talk you into a double example for yes there was beneath on gene illusions or injecting the air as well as for the composition of the last that degree the right results tomorrow work and so but we might require that the ontogenetic ask you on anyway I prototype a so we're planning to implement this single step verification for a process for architecture called lanai which is developed by google for some networking processor and this architecture is questionable and Google wrote a and L of the unpack and for that architecture so you can compile C C++ and rust code into that into that back end and i'm not sure what I forward in whatever I will no longer yeah so yeah anything you can wear you have so if you have a yeah if you have something that sounds on llvm then you can do it and even if you have an interpreter written in c or c++ then you want to do agree how about a reaction to react XD night tumblr ass like I don't have to be happy yeah I mean it's not part of block so it is fitting that clock sense it's just so also this is file search that only works for virtual functions so you have to include with the full state and input and output you can work on on swarm files I like that but that requires that you actually have a proof that the file is available which is popular this works at least in the fire working and that's why you can so you can basically put the hash of the swarm file as an input and then you can read it here in the person so I all right I need to say and I came out to any value if you want to you say it has the party but it's fine you can take the the whole block chain of input and run a single block under there always was the farmers on it every product composition on one conversation so yeah that is something that we still have to work out in experiments but it's yeah I depends on the relevant liability but perhaps one or two you to wait one another some of a competing all right and get there without resetting the same result of your version okay sorry don't yet you know he works with so this is longer company only once against one once also because the task and then a solver commit to the task runs the task and constitution and yell at a very high selectivity and toxic wonder you said affirm the Senate panel my materials editor and the two metal corrosion and then I know Saoirse or contamination solution how I was done when there's only one for Vermont and a business over and a verifier who are different back there another question room you're visually see one hit refined tastes like didn't ago I guess or not it is really technical white paper after that it register feel like they are but another fact that I and I will comment after and in principle we would have a situation where and there will be so much always be very tight that's what we want so and in the end is everyone dressed or error they won't be the only one challenge because the suburban will challenge and an important two three four five six El Paso well and champion and it's someone who originally because it as many very well no they won't enter anything to deserve this and increases and they want their learning English underwear some kind of equal to let's say the solution is jealous of that free everyone just the body would you then make sense for the soldiers will just create account and always some it's for service is his term that we have a service to everyone looking at that these are they are already mastered as it does make sense for me to join in and then f of the sequel yeah that's called the scaring of lawrence meyers attack so yeah they were giving the solution to that and the ids that you always had multiple common tasks and verify us choose when we between diese so it is it's a bit difficult but it's sending my favorite by the way what is the robot overall where you know so yes we don't have a useful roadmap yes but we're actually planning on implementing that and we look for for both funding and developers to do that the except specifics are not clear yet um yes the bus so yeah I explained how to fix gave trusted computations with analogous contestants so as the only requirement is a working trusted execution environment with limited capacities so in block chain and it can be scared to me more or less unlimited capacity ads at unanimous consent the website is too narrow and the taking of white paper and they hope they get link which can also be harmless hey thank you that's one person per game in terms of scalability like is that in either world Aereo can you have this x cubed it run simultaneously as gonna propose solutions yes and it doesn't require hard work it's just another smart contract on TPP and it also the whole system does not require etherium specifically but just some swap contracts drop changes from trusted execution [Applause]
