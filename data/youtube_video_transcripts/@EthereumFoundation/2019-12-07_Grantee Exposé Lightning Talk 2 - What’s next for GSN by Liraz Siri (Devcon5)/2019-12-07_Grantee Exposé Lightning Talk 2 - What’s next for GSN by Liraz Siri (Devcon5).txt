my talk will be about what's next for the gas-station Network and I am livadas Siri the CEO of Tabuk II and the problems that we're working on are removing roadblocks to the mass adoption of decentralized finance and the gas station network is an important part of that so when do we get to mass adoption we think that we're going to have to figure out how do we create the type of familiar experiences that provide the ease of use of web 2 if we're going to be putting life savings of people at risk then we also have to make it secure and it's best if we figure out how to do that in a way that doesn't compromise on the decentralized security of web 3 so we want to get the web free but with an experience that's very familiar and it's sort of a don't really have to know what's going on behind the scenes so the next step is clearing the path to mass adoption and we have like three three phases for this the first one creating the gas station Network essentially allows users to interact with the etherion blockchain without needing to to worry about having to pay gas for transactions we abstract that away so it's like we're creating this toll free road for aetherium and this is something we deployed live on may not but it right now requires support GSN the support of the like the GSN where logic inside the contract that's it wants to benefit from the GSN so the next step which hopefully I'll have time to demo quickly here is the GSN sponsor model that allows us to extend this toll-free Road so it can interact with any contract and including contracts that have already been deployed which which are you know the big contracts right now that are getting some usage like the maker tower contracts otherwise if we don't figure out how to do this then adoption for this new standard would be dramatically slowed down because we would have to wait until everybody redeploys their contracts now what's interesting is that we figured out how to extend the GSN to existing contracts in a way that also allows us to solve the one of the cybersecurity issues that are also roadblock to mass adoption so right now if you want to benefit from decentralization you need to deal with the complications of not only having to pay for gas but also understanding key management and worrying about the security of your devices and we think it's possible to create a new standard where that is not a concern and we have we have this as a working POC right now that's going through security validation and the goal is to established like a wide wide alliance of support so everyone can benefit from this and you don't have to be like a crypto nerd or a cyber security expert to use all this stuff so essentially you know the the gap the users in in the system were creating they're interacting directly with a gas station network and then they're being routed their gas fees are being paid for through GSN sponsors this could be infrastructure providers like in Europe that now get to monetize all the traffic it could be a wallet providers or it could be smart contract protocols like maker Dell and the demo I'll be showing will be a collaboration that we have with maker Dow that allows gas to be paid and died and this would work in principle with any Koken than has a unit swap eath if trading pair so then well like you're routing through the GSN and then the the sponsors were paying for the gas and you they they might be charging you and fiat and to get this to work you have to represent the user on change somehow this is where the sponsored user vehicles come in essentially we're putting like everybody on this toll free road by creating this proxy account for them that they interact they interact with everything else every other contract there's an opportunity there to introduce to some some neat features so the gas station network is done and the sponsor used vehicles are something that we're working on so just a quick recap DAP onboarding was was a mess before the gas station network I mean it took us a month the KYC link our bank account to an exchange and get a teeth to pay for the first transaction and many users that would be a good fit for the ecosystem don't even have a bank account or if we're talking about unlike banking the unbanked that's a major roadblock many parts of the world people don't have access to bank accounts so it would be hard for them to get eath so the gas station network it's it's very direct essentially it's a web could be a web to experience you don't even if you don't need if you don't need a wallet and this is something that is now working live on may net and our partners have helped us get to that point so the theorem foundation consensus maker Dow provided grants opens upland done security auditing Porter's have done a lot of the UX work and we have these great demos with with burner of wallet thanks to Austin Griffith so quickly running out of time here so with the gas station network instead of interacting directly with the theory mu would be interacting with relays that then routes to GSN aware contracts but then that limits you only to contracts that have support for this so the next step is baking all of the the logic for working with the GS n into a separate GSN sponsor contract and then this contract can route your request to any contract but because the user is not actually represented on chain at the other way like they don't necessarily even have a wallet then you need to create a non chain representation for them which is the the user vehicle that I've been speaking with just to keep with the road metaphor and there are an N there that's that's an opportunity so the GS n sponsor it allows us to create business models for wallets and infrastructure providers that are currently maybe are trying to figure out their options and essentially this is a way of allowing wallets to charge a small transaction fee in a way that actually adds value so you could do something like sell your users five dollars worth of gas for like six dollars right and you don't even have the KYC and AML them because you're not sending them me if you're just paying for their gas behind the scenes so that should make it a lot a lot easier and the gaps can decide to subsidize their users as part of the on boarding cost so that's also an option and what's nice is it also solves a key problem in getting decentralized privacy mixers to work and you know you have the problem how do you withdraw from a decentralized privacy mixer if you don't have any so looks like we have time for a quick demo and this is a collaboration with maker Dow and essentially changing the makers our contracts is too hard but if we bake all the logic for for paying for the gas in and not in eat in die for example we don't have to change the contracts so you know you want you might want to do this because it's inconvenient to have to maintain a separate balance in an E if you already have died and you have unit swap support for it why not just figure out a way to take care of that which is what we've done so essentially you have this specialized die sponsor and you're committing to paying for your gas in in in dye and it takes your dye and it swaps it out for eat it faces the transaction and gives you the remainder and I think I have exactly time to do a demo hopefully this works it's just not not a given all right so this is an ether 'less wallet demo it is right now I'm gonna be doing this on rinkeby because it's gonna be very hard to do this on maenette right now with Adam and on Shane so there there's no eath here there's no no tokens it's just a signing account and we wouldn't necessarily even need metamath to do the signing we could bake the logic into some other part of the application but this is convenient for demo purposes and then I'm going to be transferring to this other wallet so which also doesn't have E and I'm gonna be transferring one but one basic attention token okay so one bat and the fees will be paid for and I so this is a real transaction right now on the rinkeby test net meta masks asks me to sign the transaction I don't have any so it's just a signing function already ran out of time and I won't wait for this to mine I'll show you what this looks like when it is mined so essentially the transaction is not coming from the user because user is no it doesn't even necessarily have anything on Shane it's actually coming from one of the GSN relays and then that's being routed to another part of the the real a hub contract which is part of the GSN then if you see down below here then the user is paying for the for the gas like sending the GS and I sponsor one point four dollars as a maximum gas prepayment and we actually transfer the bots and then it turns out the transaction was a lot cheaper just cost nine cents so we have a charge a transaction fee we give the user one point twenty nine dollars back and we swap out fifteen cents for each to pay all the participants in the system and that's it like it just it just works maybe yeah the transfer was complete we have a transaction and the transaction no each was involved everything was paid for and I and imagine we could just do this from a browser so yeah thank you you
