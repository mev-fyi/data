[Applause] all right thanks for being here let's not go building you guys for a theory a 2.0 briefly my name is Mark this is my dog public meeting pack for this trip and most recently I have been working on a private cul-de-sac in grid is a desktop application it helps you discover download configure and run various their clients and tools in this example plane we've got a gift running here a couple clicks to configure it and click to start it in the case of a client you can see some sinking status out there and if you further extended the platform to include great apps so that you can use some curated interfaces to get more insight into these tools so here we've got a simple RPC tester that you can hit your actual client with RBC commands and see what the results are so my thesis here today is that grid is a powerful platform for developer onboarding and and education and there's no reason that we can't 2.0 clients into this mix so there's a few unique user experience challenges I'm gonna consider adding these platforms are adding these clients to our platform the first of course is onboarding an education users now have a new batch of questions that they are going to be asking that is what is speaking this group of stick how do I do it how do I get paid what happens if I'm penalized today in this feature where it was a stinking comes in one flavor and this 32 either so a there's no reason that you I can't properly scale this this experience if you so have the funds to do so I think 2.0 clients have broken into two binaries so you have a you can node and a validator client at you I can't help users mix and match these these pieces these pieces you can turn one off turn on the other one using the same elevator client and we'll take a look at that second so regarding the prototype stage within the grid file but here's a look at some of our ideas so far as again example any plugins as we call them can be turned on with the toggle of a switch here we've got a validator that represents a cluster and that's just lips rating your operating system essentially grid lives in your tool bar there and if you're eating note for example has some instability it's as easy as a couple clicks to switch to another one and we're going to take away here is that the developer does not have to install an entire new developer environment to switch over from one client to another run through a whole new batch of documentation and so these are some earlier ideas some takeaways we don't have a relationship with the 2.0 client teams if you're representing any of those teams here today we would love to talk to you again sort of your wish list for what a UI could look like otherwise try out grid and come say hello I've got stickers of magnets to hand it up and chill thanks very much [Applause]
