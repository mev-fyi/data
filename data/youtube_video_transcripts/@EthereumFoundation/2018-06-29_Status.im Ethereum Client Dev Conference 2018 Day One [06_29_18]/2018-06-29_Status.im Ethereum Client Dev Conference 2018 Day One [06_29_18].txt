and then I name one participant adds one bit and adds one elliptic curve addition an elliptic curve addition is like one over several thousand about Mary so what this means is that you can basically get a signature that contains an entire committee and listing issue that contains an attack committee is only going to be in a few times more expensive than a signature was before right and there's several different ways to do this so one name is BLS signatures in the end there's even research posts about that another is that you can if you want something purely cash base that you can do us darhk's on top of all employed signatures yeah that's anymore that's a likely more walk longer term sort of broke down yeah like aside from there was three doors theoretically other elections as well right so what this gives us is it basically gives us you it reduces the marginal cost of having more validators and so maybe by a factor of something like 100 right so what that means is that we can have more elevators and one will think to be more efficient and we can not have a minimum validator size layout 1532 even along with a bunch of the second thing he had said because a lot of the medical forehead and math is solved in with this dealing with these signatures and processing large numbers of elevators basically involves kind of shuffling big fields around again like doing a bunch of like or sex or whatever into what into big big fields and that involves a lot of integer manipulations all over the place and so this is the sort of thing that you can do what I think we really fast if you optimize going on an implementation and C++ or whatever or even if you build an implementation Python and just sort of like or use a bit operation too much but it's not the sort of thing that's particularly fast in the EDM right so basically there is a bunch of factors together with the facts that we've read more and more progress on looking at what provokes both real estate would actually look like that's basically drive a decision to Ward not going with this roadmap of building layer to bake on top of the existing chain but instead having this structure where basically you have a I mean you maintain and have a river snake chain that kind of piggybacks on top of the river war chin and this brewery state chain and theoretically the design that we have current orderly function has a kind of non scalable for our state system right but it's here it's fairly easy like basically to over us a lot of the messages as also being as a stations for walks inside of charts and so we get a bunch of short story and how many shards can we get well because we you can now mastectomy signatures we get even more choice [Music] so I guess that like one of the challenges here at is that you like at first I think we kind of thought that in our community that the number of sharks could go up or down but that's actually a pretty bad idea because what that means is that if I have a contractile charm Network 500 is no need to reinvent a bunch of people drop out and then my shower like the process for five years or whatever so the approach that this is one of those not fully the side of things but the approach I'm favoring is we are a set of number of sharks and leverage artists hi so at 4096 but then the idea is that as the number of elevators participating in printer snake goes down then the gas limit of the Sharks what basically drops a lot lower than what the maximum value would be right so if for example it has a limit of a shard if literally everyone with would be like 20 million that if only 10% of people are validating the guests over the limit of a short goes down to 2 million and because we have one-tenth as many validators each validator would on average be responsible for 10 times as many shorts but each shard has one set the capacity so about so it balances out right so it's 4,000 shorts but in expectation maybe 300 400 shards or the capacity but once again [Music] [Music] [Music] is through custody so the lot of is and we validated voting on the availability of gloss and what we have had in the past assumption is the policy of function that that state equals to presently network is dishonest when they make their vote and so if we stand and on committees affects honest and materiality but I guess we managed to straighten that basically the idea is that when you make the boat we have two options one and this is one that of flexibility is going to be your customers and the customers and the validator is the bit that can only complete it if one you have custody of the data and so if for some reason you don't have to take out them it's really not to advantage to make of those because in the future you will have to reveal the secrets and if the bits you choose at random that the coin toss Swinton's at very high level we have kind of three components we have the main chain and the main chain is pretty much abused for only one test which is to see the deposits so validates is making first to eat the deposits and there's some initial like initialization like it was there for example in the decison you rent out amendments and technicality because pls images and then once you make it and you validated for everything validated as a Casper validator as a beacon chain proposal and a tester as a sharp proposal and the Charlotte Hester and also as a military and so you'll be coliform and the randomized basis to perform for almost all these tasks and like one of the designs were considering basically is similar at the little chain a blow at the shop where you have predominantly two types of participants we have the proposals who will extend the chains and then you have the testers which configures kind of code proposals which together with the proposal will attest to the fact that the proposal is building for hundreds facilitator so that creates the friction for a month traditionally is the monopoly proposal we can just propose whether he wants [Music] you have infrastructure - which is the glue between the shots and in the D key chain and these are the other notes remain so note the function is basically to go within the shots and without to the fact that some checkpoints all the data between some checkpoint and the previously readers checkpoint is is available and then once once the there's a curve which is reached on an honest checkpoint the and so what that creates is basically so is a traditional so revisiting when interposer was alone to decide you two things one is that the the reports are actually multiple walk on the head that's you is that the block is valid and the music of life is available available available available available available [Music] and I suppose you could consider doing like crazy stuff like having the ancestress be less likely to confirm up watch of etcetera transactions but there's a whole bunch of so in terms of like stuff that I've written down here this and this is basically the kind of approximate simple form of custody on earth so the general way from your custody worse is that you're attesting to when you are testing to a blog you're attesting to your blog header and you can think of a blog header and very simplified version PS being at work over in the world over it has a bunch of under like data and your custom is basically teaching you ever like data that explore again this some particular seed into every week and then you calculate the root of that and then using of that Ian's the idea is that someone can submit this group custody event later on other people can challenge and they can basically have to look the idea would be that at some point in time you would be required to reveal what your seat is and once they do that then other people can discover what your what your a committed bid should have been and if they discover that the bank you committed to of the bet they calculate that are different then they can play this game where they basically challenge you on particular and this is if you're required to respond from local branches and after a blog and steps they can another zero and all the specific place where I calculated your progress that you're relying at which point do you get /tha that they get a better protection and one things you mentioned we could have made [Music] another thing another thing that is that there is also an information theoretic argument which is that if every distinctive alligator provides their own distinct custody then the amount of information you have to throw out to the chain is basically 32 bytes times the number of elevators rest here the information were throwing on is basically two bits plans the number of elevators and yesterday left technically it can be one point five three bits or whatever Chris but like it's extremely small right so this is part of why we can say that you can have a signature that represents an entire committee which doesn't take that much more it without a weight letting the custody is or verifying data availability of sharps you know this is a bit of a simplified diagram because like when you're attesting to across with your intestines not just what you like but an entire Tina Bloch blackjack central previous cross-linked but like there is still there are different ways to do that right like you can have like some high for bay like we're a vertical structure here you could potentially come up with someone like watching structure where that more naturally to some ephemeral trio there's solutions one thing might be worth pointing out or listening is all the services the beating chain does so you can think of it as the system training the manager team does all the nitty-gritty stuff that manages the shots the shots themselves extremely clean mostly just data so just a word on that in terms of road map we have phase one experiment which is a spread shopping but the shopping part is only really solving the the data availability coming to consensus as to what data is being pumped into the charts and then face class is basically the EVM - at the Indiana State emotional transaction and so in terms of the various services that the do contain provides the hobby and random generator so we had this global clock assumption that all the validators know what time it is right now and then every five seconds this a new random number which is outfits and another service that the be contained provides is all the accounting or the basis so every time an action that is incentivized to the and that includes ample the selection conditions another thing is that the beacon chain is where all the tasks of rules gets it aggregated so like the design that we really nicely couples savage and Kahn Castro so in terms of biggest infrastructure FF this chart is where the individual girls are made and so we're reusing messages we're really using gossip channels and we're also using the aggregation that each individual shark has and then is very small and efficient to verify messages which change so you can think of every strong kind of as a staking pool itself the reason why is if we had a shot actually [Music] trust me metaphase 0 1 there would be data accumulated about our insurance that there would be attested to but there you know what is this he centralized her messages basically like until the until Teresa Imel where you can run whatever you have some topic you basically have two options right one of the things that you use the watching I think I have high high cost a very high availability data store and the other one is that you basically come up with a custom execution engine and you like basically have some application where you sort of go for me the opportunity that some particular function calculated on the entire chain is something that you care about and then that could be like that makes sense for a lot of non-financial applications and then it's more actually calculated you could have got me like music so you know like Nexus 6 groups or whatever so I think the most simple company example that web authentication engine is actually true it so very cheaply also the problem is they're agreeing on the input and on the program to run is very expensive because that the megabytes go and so traditionally there's been this program about how how do we agree on the inputs because if that has available then the very first data and so you can work very distasteful shouting before phase two is as the file storage lennier for trivets so we will be able to put tens of hundreds of megabytes programs and then some about blockchain the legacy chain going on sabbatical you can have a lifetime access to these drugs and say hey this data is available because it's in the charts so as far as I understand the HD folk the validators you will be asked to might be asked about their different shots right so what I'm thinking about is that if the so if I'm an elevator and I think Abedini sure number three and now I'm going to start to build a Dana five shard number five I have to somehow find my future peers ahead of time and those other peers have to find me so the network has to completely reform between the equals do you think about how this is going to be done so I guess first of all like there are going to be a lot of static peers that just be on the same chart right like users probably will be it there might there's going to be no ones that just run every shard also yeah our current spec suggests daya has sharks they don't match period or something like a month or more so like the network it's definitely not the case that like literally the entire network for us was Brad but it definitely is the case that there will be I as far as handling churn the one thing that we can offer as a mitigation so far is that you can know where you'll be allocated to some amount of some amount of time lost a few minutes in advance so basically you'll have a lot more time as with sharks that got substantially more seconds to recharge that it not only takes like a get that we already know it today that what you want to diet an interconnected network but we won't be better than the thoughts I'd like to get here that I walk to my sister because it is something that people started thinking about so in terms of commonly shop these each better day to this sign that's when you give me printed time what they take exactitude so you're exactly 2 1 plus y 2 divided by the percentage signs to the shot for a fairly long period of time and the reason is that if you want to make good proposals as a proposal we need to have knowledge of the states so that you can protect reductions on the other hand the when you're assigned to a shop as a military the the shuffling happens much faster so it happens every 10 minutes and it's okay to shop walk very fast because the the main thing that we not to be has to do is download data and sign off and the only data they have to download is from the very recent past [Music] [Music] yeah so there is and this is kind partially question mark territory but she under ally with every use lots of what every new like with every new period of five seconds it becomes possible for a set of elevators to vote on something offensive on a new cross link on some particular short though the specific set of validators and the specific short don't be going on will be picked a few minutes in advance probably one probably with what the TV box it appeals and you do need an you do need that to be the case because for them to be able to blow on the cross leg need to have enough time to be able to validate the portion of that short since the previous cross-links Guinea the requirements of validator would be to have the change that happened King be able around one to two fish starts also syncs the maintain maintain technically do one of new ways you can yell like if you clarify it a little bit above the basis based wine versus face - are they more research milestones to be completed or is the intention agents usually yeah so they do represent milestones of like what becomes possible in terms of capability was so like roughly its phase one is basically the ash are the yep you can chain with the shards active data shorts possibly face 0 or C is 1 minus epsilon or whatever you call it is just to begin as a proof state change without without charts these two is the shards with people with computation and then leader faces like basically bring in I crossed our communication but more more levels of functionality and then eventually kind of bringing in the existing I mean of the existing main change that I've gotten into the chart and you for the charting system but my question is early is that amount intended as research milestones or is it more is it actually production deployment you know this will go by first base one goes by without any execution engine or is it possible that the execution engine will be developed you know in parallel architecture layer so that phase one phase two go live at the same time and that's possible too though being realistic we face do what happened after phase one because like these two is what is something EE need to be a moment it is okay it is theoretically Boston it is theoretically possible that so much progress will look good they don't face do and also there's like another dimension he is I guess the level of maturity of the shorting plants in general because I feel like like there is obviously a question of a lot he is faced one with no data with data annual execution way to go live as they quote mean that with like people sneaking really fur on it and I mean I can my personal opinion is that if all of the different shorty plants like Christmas respect says and so forth were more stable and like good single and well tested and the diversions at this one mnsure but if the level of the clients themselves has a little maturity during phase one and then phase one should obviously be just a test done and then what say yes I kind of higher levels of stability that I mean one could be students perceive we tastier has enough attachments to Seoul so it's about seconded by foundations so what we know so far is probably one's assembly which means we may want to defer to execution like execution models that facilitate sharing witnesses across transactions friendly mr. where here is that various privacy your knowledge schemes which is kind of the same as the witnesses and also we favor synchronous not like if a really cool synchronicity [Music] so like someone watched in March the number that's in my head is like one SWAT every five seconds at 100 so watch is an epochal so apply five three seconds in the audience so you know average time infidelity 1000 seconds though there are ways to optimistically reduce that to life they'll endure [Music] so every you have and the trees which are just science with this is the step up and they are all controlled on the act of making a strategy vote with the act of and then once you have this aggregated message the contain composure is going to be incentivized to to take it and once has run this beacon team block which contains the checkpoint and the shop becomes finds so here's my ID here here's my July on the dependency graph so the thing in the middle is the beacon chain and what don't imagine this as queue short shards chain surrounded think of this as being kind of like the middle of a hollow cylinder and imagine the char chains being like the edge of the hollow cylinder and imagine surrounding the beacon chain so the Itchy it's barely a chain and the char chains are grille with chains the ante notice there's two kinds of the links that are going between them right so one clinically is that there is a link going we are short blocks depend on beacon blocks in this happens kind of implicitly because it's the beacon team that controls the randomness and it's the randomness that determines which validators are a lot of this or what creed in the test of walk separately towards 144 towards a particular times right the second kind of a link over here is the link where the beacon change and become dependent on the block of charge in now because the short chain by in selling individual charging blocks could always grew up and the in the beacon chain by itself has no ability to fully validate all the locks on all charts because there's way too much data so in order for the beeping chain box to become dependent on a chair and watch it basically has to go through the structure where there is a medium to community bill under there once the stupid evokes London and the doors all get included then this or just a kind of dependency length where like basically from the point of view over this board choice this is now recognized as the leading shard book and if these short walks are invalid then the speaking whoa it's shorter at that as well the now sometimes cross links can get an impartial range with later and that might have it because let's say this let's say for example this proposer is somewhat faulty is just like having really terrible dental conductivity only saw a porter across links and then of the cosmic messages that bunch of other cosmic messages may today's here so then over here this this is you does have across when this computer's having a dependency on this so I basically think of it as like the guys sort of like a kind of a structured day where you have chains that you have those interconnections between chains except interconnections that are that make the center dependence on an edge or for sensitive it so they require this confirmation structure to become binding so one of the things we're looking into right now is how can we maximally decouple the beacon chain from the shots so if the beacon chain is kind of locally 14 we still want the shots to power on so I guess the shots to respect the finalize checkpoints because it's finalized and so we're considering having only this dependency in this direction so this our only point towards finalized and blocks in terms of bringing cross links in the cross links don't have to be put in at a specific height or deserve there may be some constraints but maybe they were still hungry child there's this vaccine with the amount of traffic will grow to the capacity right so you can expect today almost of all accuracy in the ecosystem and definitely all actors in consensus basically only needs to have like processed stuff for these things right they need to process the beginning then they needs to maintain my client access to the charts but like technically we didn't we didn't have to do that because the big achieve these aims like client access to the Sharks and they need to meet Ain full clients validation on this tiny subset of sharks that they're assigned to which we can say is too because if it's going to be 20 then it'll be 20 shots operating on whatever capacity might be good Junior providing access to basically the ideas that the beacon change state contains the across website so the most recent prospect that was published perception on trade and so what that means is that the ethan chain contains us a recent favorite of the shark and so it became he has a light client of ever chart yeah so i basically in terms of the low and right like the goal is that running them you can change should be process should take like maximum you know half the effort whatever acceptable computation claudius and then like still like see over to do it and then this one right here we take another cor to and that's basically what wonderfully whenever movie so in surrey ends the world over here it is proportional to the number is proportional to the number of nodes and the number of charts and well the capacity of the charts solar capacity the shots proportional to lipophilic so it's kind of the same thing so in total you can get this value like oil base equated something like C squared over to capacity but like in every new consensus like my personal goal is actually is closer to so when the country is been expecting to relocate to a new sharp they will as you said that they will be required to download to the current state thank you not a notary when I proposed it so the posters get relocated slowly until they get a lot of time at the on the stage but notary tsunami but I thought notaries E and a stainless leader of like okay as I was going to suggest that instead of a basically everything happens on the on the certainly for everybody or the certain time you can actually sort of do it gradually you just drop one person or Domini you muttering other than other graduates so there's no like a huge network traffic spikes I mean one of the em gains of the design is to be panting Sakura and to places where we would not be secured potentially as much is another one that the investigators go back there is the but basically all of the feminists we're using a purely hash-based ultimate ultimate what-ifs wash away the where it's needed slash related upgrades do it but like there are also a kind of more perform performance purchased of work [Music] [Music] so basically that would mean approach that we have for that is an asynchronous ball so basically the engineer is that step one you would have say a function called have it over here and this would like create ATM receipt then step two with this love you would wait for this to get cross-linked that's the video over here the short chain over here would be aware of the nicotine here therefore awareness linear for a we are visitor for are we ever cross me and so at this point you would be able to send a second transaction which basically takes that takes that group plus eight a record that that crossed with episode or receive wasn't conceived conceived yet and then tells whatever the credit operation is on the other side so doesn't about posting to get ready but it's the court oh if it's a call anyone on the answer then yeah you too so I posters yes now this is if you wants to kind of rely on the base chain right like there is also this clip to economic alternative we are basically a shard over here just ourselves or yeah what you do is like basically a chart over here upsets that's my particular state over to your insisted over that short because someone's have basically militias applauds that says I am read over some amount of money that's not true and then individual contracts to get her to economic security balance and they given the answer is potentially this could all be done between like two or three boys depending on how much risk people are willing to take now of the third alternative by the way is you can do an alternative execution engine which basically kind of optimistically if the process is brought sharp cross contract calls with only one block of agency and the idea is that in case there are any mistakes there is a kind of slow rate gadget that runs a relative behind the main execution and diving south of mistakes and so if you're a client was aware of a mistake that you can unlike what will we predict what the execution executable correctly to write this automation approach is quite nice you might the reason is that we have this spectrum of confirmation so this is [Music] so one possible way to imagine these execution engines like a very simple example consider UWT exosystem where my transaction could just go on a chart and specify any v2x those at once and then the state of each arm is basically a list of PT exo's city where h TTX know also how does a kind of always covenants and income permits are at a list of duty air shows that have to be proven correct before that we have to get moving correct and so you basically have this dependency graph that's going to count as part of the state of every story and then you have the a delayed execution that kid that gets executed basically a one or two cross links behind that keeps on - I have to say like this VTX old you have no peace ETF service altogether and then it keeps on propagating upward about going through all the different dependencies over time in terms of [Music] [Music] it could change by default think of my people think of sharks as just being universes and or more meaning like city using and when they build something you choose what city you go together right so now the one you know there is such a thing as cross Charlie yanking so this is so this is basically a generalization of like atomic transaction liking techniques that I came up with that works for men absolving traded hotel problems so the idea what the meaning is basically that imagine if you have one contract operator which is for booking trades and one contract over here which is for watching hotels and he wants to book the train in the hotel atomically because like there's no point in working the Train if the hotels are all sold out and they handed out a vice versa so like in if you can do it in a purely asynchronous setup but it's fairly inefficient so what you do instead is you basically step one you send a transaction and the district actually does is first of all it reserves if it splits up the train booking contract into two contracts so what they can take one is we country booking screens to Maude contract factory and another is a training what makes watch so now you have a training to logical check which represents the ability to both one particular train ticket then what you do is they send the transaction that basically says on once they give this train take this contracts to discharge so what you do is we do the seed dance thing you did over here step one you basically kind of like you up basically consuming on this contract then you can take over here and then tonight you caught the train swatch contract into existence then over here you have also a hotel select lecture which is already on the shark so now those two are on the same chart and so you can basically have tonically do you know I step one book step to book and if you do it will be held at the world everything and so we booked the two atomic way and then if you want okay move the Train salon contract back to the other though like beer in a lot of cases in up there is no necessarily for [Music] [Music] Miss Elizabeth absolutely do that what particularly good Saints it or like God is someone somehow figured out like putting equal emphasis on one chain and they like kind of holding across stage when you see all the addresses would be the hold another is on one chair yeah so like first of all obviously in most kind of standard security waleska that's difficult that you unless you actually have more than forty percent or whatever at the start State but suppose either you do or suppose that we're operating in some model where you can act like whoever's whatever specific person treated by others because a person who wants that's fun basically if what happens then is that the this basically gets up the cross looked in the first portion right the crossing people can include it and basically the as soon as this gets discovered by the rest of the team whatever portion of the beacon team is that is including and after that cross link would have to be started you know later revisions we do have things like fraud proofs and data availability proofs which basically allows you to do a bunch of proxy checks for validity of a char chain where if anything here is invalid that to be able to text back even though you know like 70% of the state very good 90% mistake on one chart is saying that it is valid like Indian walk so in the short-term future that would probably be the encounter region from Indian availability stuff of rock groups in the long term your music we have buck starts and like you don't even need my interactive magic do this this is like you know long-term you'll get you just have a start over here that basically says here is the data start this is valid a means by which tree is valid and this is a pointer to all of the data in this chain again all of its recent history and indeed as a region coded need to grant always and you can randomly sample it severe climate is available and so what many clients can do basically download like a couple of megabytes of data and verify that it will Tigershark house mm but that's like [Music] [Music] so if you want like so first of all what you would realistically do right is when you make your first transaction here along with this call you would include some of the user and then that ability to release for the available respective what we need to consume the receive of this chart now I mean this is kind of this is kind of imperfect because you would realize that we have to over be a good to make sure you can pay whatever the gas prices but like no it's sign of that there are in the future [Music] it's probably also worth noting that realistically that will be likely to each kind of unwinding now that's floating around all done with this as well so you could like like if you need a table computer at some particular points that user vision we just like do some decentralized short rashard exchange and just like swap but this is definitely yeah I think I might have said this on the internet but like I'm like I'm knocking so I think we can see like they hear him change would survive in the long term without significant actually in the reason is first of all especially with the efficiency games that we get from signature aggregation like even EE and celebrate 4096 charts multiplied by each norm doing say 5 attention inductions per second that already gets me to you know 40 counsel transactions and with Moore's law on the status every time that capacity the computer plus the efficiency of the small pair of doubles the system increases by factor of four of the softwood now with the theory of 3.0 we're like everything is stark look up at everything else that then making an exponential does become easier but that's their Rd but though there are dangers to going active and going exponentially no in fact it's basically because you're creating a dependency that largest set of nodes would be online [Music] so this is a question work one idea I have is that like basically the main chain will continue existing for a while and then eventually it can either become a site either become a side chain of the of the shortest system or I mean basically you can have a smart contract the Miche become a smart contract on the on some shorted system or the like basically one of the one of those three possibilities so I or the mediator we've got some fancy Z it's there on switching on top of our system so basically it should be possible to set it up so that the main chain like the main chain with its illogic kind of continues existing forever and but it doesn't add consensus complexity to it again that you look at you really which is I think that we do want to go for but we don't like to do or sort of grandfather and you happen to be immune to the show up if you're into one dose and we have to deal with to be two virtual machines forever but fortunately wasn't as fast enough that you can just do to be on the side of one [Music] [Music] legacy chain will get indirect finality because the be pinched in the beating points to the legacy chain and so they've even added even carries finality so it would implicitly finalize the legacy Shaymin that is it is an A for to a school about lions yeah like it definitely it like - it's like it definitely does make sense I think to reduce report rewards especially when a lot more and more as the stages progressed like basically because it at the point where on 80% of users who migrated Somali ursery system there's no point in paying I think at one point it was mentioned that shots would basically develop a different speed like one shot kind of changed the rules so this design is that when would you get started and me like I personally am in favor of homogeneous charting if not this efficient I'm lucky individual sharks being experimentation zones basically because once you start going in that direction that starts massive evolving consensus complexity and it's like I think like something like a plasma clots much a narrow side chain is probably the experimentation I think when we calculated it was something like the first step first half of next year what you should check to see if any good if the difficulty is going off now I know that the difficulty has been stalling your feet really but then mainland there are also up it means eight-six to look forward to [Music] let's see Network difficulty three three ninety wow it's been staying at this stuff 3000 mobile for very low it's been like flatline one basically plot lighting for a lot of time to annex a hat should be aligned now right now where I want to be point five out of action is difficult [Music] to go back to the idea of experimentation I still think there is an extra experiment with the application [Music] [Music] yeah so like one thing that you can do right is you can come up with your own separate medical article that basically says any trans out of any times actually to be part of my how to protocol has to take itself and what you just need to do the first five bit like whites equal some particular value and then you can have a seat gets darker to manage and whatever that basically says oh like here we have some gadget that basically calculated that didn't eventually interactively somehow calculate the result of processing all the what all the transactions in the blockchain that have that particular texture graduated and you could even have any like particular to this mark contract and so that [Music] distinguishing between world data which because with us and transactions which are blocked a tentative idea and when you think right now you have a gas even if you would like that one bites back and so I think it's not as easy to move a way to completely bypass Olivia so that we only pick the beta and that will make it very cheap [Music] like most other one 1/4 of inhibition the what the extent like rewards are still won onto an issue and I know like I have my license to use them like people like not that's perfect yeah but like I definitely think that weakens you I'm very like a very confident that we can beat you with less than 1 million evening here in reward sans like this you know like for reference I think transaction fee is by themselves are already doing about 500 ether a day which is something like nineteen eighty thousand you know right so if we can do say that through our stable in 13 times more that's another culprit sometimes our micro rewards and penalties with a chocolate scheme so everyone will have any plus one - what you teach me that workshop what the things that will have this all the penalties will be aggregated the reason is that if your balance becomes true though as the deposits to know that we want as in the shots so yeah so this is the sort of stuff that tends to that we did covered by a partial swatching mechanism so the idea basically is that if you're the only one at subcommittee who screwed up in your penalty to be lower but if you screw up at the same time as many other people screw up then that's more likely to be an attack and so you get the I mean one thing to mention is that it's a proof of custody at the time of signing is not a proof of storage that we have in future so if you have signing and you did make the right custody then it's quite likely the know one more time because no man is worth noting that from this that it is possible to recover the original data set and so in order to hear anything they need to respond to challenges elsewhere so if there is whether or not then there is this retrieve ability mechanism in charge mechanism we cover of malicious louvers that decide what particular the end-all Portman on the leading the same data though like if you really will st we could probably like that without was already going spent like that's later stage yes so I'm wondering if you could talk for a second about what synchrony is also required for the BLS signature evaluation and how that relates to I guess targeted censorship sure so first of all like the fact that the signatures are pls aggregated does not look crummy from a perspective of level of like the pattern in which things move through the network it's exactly the same as it would be if you give the blocks were just figuring it takes a pile of the signatures like the BLS segregation in this case is not a multi-step procedure it's just taking signatures and literally adding them together so like basically wonder what it looks like he has well this kind of graph where between two blocks like these ones like as publish them within that time a bunch of people would need to assign signatures and the blog 20 and a blog put it through their signatures so if you want to change oh I gotta run smoothly you basically want this line to be a bigger than twice the network the way that's expected to expect it to be the case of those circumstances and if network delay and ends up temporarily going about that then I mean obviously the chain could stall though the underlying caste refugee mechanism does provide safety is so I could give to eight cans Charlie and each other go like Casper guarantee its safety and really pretty but not like descender asynchrony because that's how like dfdl rhythms of that entire category work we're looking at did not answer your question were you looking at like other network itches right um like probably a few hundred it is a you definitely can calculate the maximum right so the maximum is basically the maximum theoretical possible number of validators divided by the population plug so if you want to calculate it that would basically need four billion divided by a hundred which gives 40,000 and 40,000 signatures times the obvious 64 bytes basically give us a couple of megabytes what do you mean by passed a minimum yeah so this basically depends on the it depends on the total number of elevators participating right so like if literally everyone is speaking then at least with the current numbers it would work out to forty thousand if 10% of people are speaking or work out to four thousand though the like it is also worth keeping in mind that like you could potentially have sort of multiple tiers of aggregation right where like one though it basically passed a lot of signature that says I can take this entire class I like all of the indices I know whether this stuff set so you can like basically if the if you it is possible to create second layer Network protocols that kind of short the application process have to be de piel era then you can knock down each no its panels requirements collect a square root of the expense of an extra round of people talking to each other and what yes obviously if during the test nets we decided that doing all this in five or six seconds is with all the teachers that will push that up so you know that in the original spec for ethereal and right now and media few words about the princess okay so this allows the possibility for water every every height you have if the post versions to reveal his next man that elephant and what is about to reveal history has one bit of attack surface but it turns out that because of the the recursive nature of the construction where the randomness right now basically strategically abroad in order to have more facilitation in the chain position which thing with the language which I don't like too much is that it we would probably have need the Sharks to closely listen to what is being revealed the containers for example if you wanted to pose a man because she has nice to award then the whole shopping system freezes for five seconds which is obviously almost liable so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this is my kind of work of the major mechanisms for getting into their various magnetic weaknesses so right now is basically again what heating interactiveness by having participants provide a house pre images of the enemy already - yeah basically has people submit submit commitments and that later on anyone in the calculate yes even calculate NDS tie and then there was like various kind of like collaborative like to be teased to be these dreadful speeds that base used some fancy procedurally era at the end of the procedure you have a scenario where like let's say any fifty of a group of a hundred people can reveal data and whatever cookie it is a vertical and the same data so in terms of the manipulation of properties on the rand outside like basically could manipulate the randomness by one bit like choosing difficulty reward on the PDF side if you have an attacker that has an ASIC which is fast enough to basically calculate calculate the EFC to the so quickly that he goes the answer a DFC before he has to make the decision about whether another sub NC then you can break it though I will save an elephant easier way of using the yeah but basically to use a PDF well we can design a system where even if this happens integrates just being erect out so the other and the other direction of some crazy attacker arduous you could basically give the system used to a high level of difficulty and then suddenly disappear and if the super asic how attacker has a very quiet manage that the rest of the network would just like to really slow down for some time to little jealous and then for the event over to oh then you can't really manipulate that unless you have half but it has other issues one of them is that it can survive over 50% online and the other is it requires like complex acidity generation set up a public review so like out of these against like I purposely an apples point they are taking this kind of EDF with a with a backstop we are if the PDF it's broken by a sigma t grace
