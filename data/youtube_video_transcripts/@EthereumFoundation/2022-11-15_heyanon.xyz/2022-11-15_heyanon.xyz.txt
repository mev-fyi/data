foreign [Music] I'm Vivek I go by Viv Boop on like Social Media stuff I'm here presenting Persona on behalf of our hand on behalf of persona in Xerox Park uh before I go into what hand on actually is I want to talk about a little motivation So currently online We have basically two ways of presenting ourselves you can use your entire real-life identity like me I'm Vivek I'm from Boston I grew up there I work at your ex park now and you know this includes also like your social graph your hometown like all the random tweets you said and then the other basic option is to be fully pseudonymous it's an account that's unlinked from everything else and if you bring in a reputation from your real life identity into your pseudonymous account it can it it can be really easy to sort of dox you and so what hand on is is attempting to be an open source app to allow users to attach a subset of their identity and reputation to speech online so they can choose selectively what they actually want to kind of attach with everything they say it uses zero knowledge produce to prove membership in both off-chain and on-chain groups without revealing your exact identity uh right now we have deployed for ecdsa groups which just includes like various groups on ethereum like nft owners or get coin donors as well some semaphore groups um including like the task group from PSC and we also had a group at SBC also using some before um for all these apps like the proof is completely generated client-side it's stored on ipps ipfs and then anywhere where this like message is posted we also attach like um dislike proof and also like a little panel to like verify the proof as well how do you use it so here at Devcon um as the PSC folks mentioned like you can just go to the Tas booth and pick up a little card and if you navigate to The Hang On section on the experience Pages you'll be able to post a tweet to this Devcon in on feed continue to use this account you still have access to it and you can still reply as an attendee of Defcon uh to other people's tweets or to just say whatever you want and we're going to add more sort of General ethereum groups that more people can post to very soon in addition we recently shipped a version of an admin panel where people can suggest their own groups this can be stuff that's actually like you know nft owners or like some sort of like new actually existing thing or you can even just make a group with your friends and just post on behalf of like your little friend group if you want uh there's a V1 at this link and we're gonna sort of like clean it up and then add it to the hand-on website very soon another sort of goal of hang on is that just overall like zika terminology is super technical and in my opinion very boring every developer in ZK will tell you that what they're doing just like feels magical like it doesn't make sense that you can get verifiability succinctness and privacy all in one tool but it all sort of just works and I think using terms like proving verifying zero knowledge like all this stuff sort of like magical this is to like an end user and I think like to really convince people how big of a paradigm shift we're making from like you know centralized servers owning all of your data to you owning all of your data and then proving stuff about that we're going to need some like new vocabulary new product new branding work so heavily inspired by conversations with Justin who's actually here we've attempted to use magical terminology for all parts of the ZK stack so instead of a symbol for identity this is your wand with your wand you cast spells and instead of proving like downloading a proven key you use magical equipment to make all this work and so we'll get to see this in action so um hopefully the internet doesn't ruin this but I will demo you good um demo tasks or demo the task group from my phone so this is a tabs website if you navigate down to here to Hannah you can just click on this and it'll take you to the page I've preloaded it because I don't want to wait for the internet and so there's a few options so first off you can view the feed you can post or you can apply I'll just go through each of them oops um well now uh okay so here's the feed this is the this is the feed of all the different posts that people have made not a lot of like interesting stuff just random people saying random stuff but if you join you can add some spice to the feed and then if we go back to the main app we can now post anything we want so I'm going to say you should presenting next posting this no one can verify this so I'm just going to say it um and then you know it'll generate the proof this is all with semaphore which is all fast enough that it can be around your phone um nice so here if you actually want you can look at the Olympic curve points that make up your proof for most people that doesn't mean anything so we can submit and then boom there it is uh here it is so here's the here's the sort of like uh tweet itself and then if you click on this link it'll take you to a page where you can let's see if this is going to work nice or you can verify this proof in browser I'm just using like the semaphore V key okay so let's go back so vitalik he posted this funny little funny little little tweet about um Bogota and so I'm gonna reply to it as this as a spot actually so if we go back to this um I can just paste in the Tweet link that I want to reply to funny pun Mr ethereum Man I can't type okay and then again it'll do its little thing come on buddy what's going on let's try that again um it might just be some internet thing or like nice um cool submit it and then nice I've now replied to vitalik as an anonymous devkin attendee so yeah that's sort of how this works um and so yeah I just want to go through like a lot of our sort of future directions with this right now everything is very Twitter based but as I said in the introduction like this is really just a mechanism to attach reputation to your speech online and so we want to basically have like um first off like a lot more different groups not just ethereum and some four groups uh ZK email which is going to be presented next by ayushu is not here uh is gonna give us access to a lot of interesting groups one thing is just like organizations like you can verify that like this person owns like a twitter.com email or like a facebook.com email you can prove you're a top fan of an artist by looking at some Spotify wrapped emails you can prove that you own some amount of stocks with a Robin Hood email so email really opens the gates up to like a bunch of really interesting Twitter groups in addition like GitHub users like if you go to your like username and then type dot Keys it'll store all your public like RSA keys or EDSA keys that you use to do SSH and so from there we can make GitHub groups and then sort of as Jason was getting to I don't know if he's here uh we can also have groups that are like gated with ML models so we can do some sort of like primitive like kyc or like face ID you can even imagine like some sort of thing where it's like if there's some treasure hunt of some item and like you find the item you can take a picture of it and then you can post it some Twitter feed basically or kind of get a get a zkp of that uh in addition like we're working on just in general like improving the ecdsa proving process like right now it still takes like five minutes and can only be done on a computer but we have a lot of exciting work that's making that better uh there's one repo like under the Persona Labs GitHub that is working on basically doing a lot of the signature verification outside of the snark in a way that doesn't actually remove privacy in any way um in addition we're trying to move from circum to Halo 2 we're in the process of taking the Halo 2 ECC circuits from Axiom and getting them to work in browser and also we're interested in potentially trying to get some collaborative ZK stocks working which is where like end different provers work together to produce a proof over like some shared like or secret shared witness and if one of those end users is actually the like you yourself then sort of privacy is preserved by like the one of n um NPC assumptions and for the product yeah as I was mentioning like uh this isn't supposed to just be Twitter um we want to put this everywhere so this is just going to take like just like writing a bunch of different like like just just posting mechanisms and then one thing I'm really excited about is like for for Reddit for example and also this this this works for like just like Discord and like telegram event is like you can really tune specific like groups to like specific like subreddits or like specific like group chats or channels and so it'll basically just like allow for sort of more fine-grained interesting groups whereas on Twitter it's sort of like this massive public feed and like you you know if you have too many groups of people it can get a bit overwhelming and then sort of asukino was getting at like moderation is really important for all this stuff uh every every sort of good use case of of you know being able to talk pseudonymously like for example if you're in an oppressive regime and you want to speak up against your government but not sort of you know have like get attacked like you can use something like this to say what you want but at the same time like uh let's say you're a very powerful person and and you're in like sort of an anonymous group with other powerful people you can just use this to say really really shitty things without any sort of um like sort of uh like negative feedback coming back to you because you know you're protected by this Veil anonymity so it's gonna be really important that uh there's some sort of moderation built in I think the the most like sort of standard way to do this is just like within your group you either have some admins that approve all your posts similar to like a Facebook group or even potentially just like um any any three people in the group need to approve some posts before it's posted publicly for other people um yeah help us out we uh we have so many projects and stuff to do we really want to release all this stuff is just as open source because we think that users should be able to like store their own parts of their identity without also you know Builders should be able to build on top of all this stuff and um there's also a lot of really cool ways to put this on the real world like uh chance from PSC had this really cool idea of basically like arming uh people are trying to unionize against like a you know some some big corporation like Amazon uh basically handing out little semaphore keys to different people so that they could post to a Twitter feed as a verified sort of Amazon employee but sort of not you know face any consequences for for saying what they want to say yeah thank you that's all and this is a link to our repo it's kind of messy because it's just been me hacking but uh we're gonna clean it up soon and uh we want to onboard more people so thank you [Applause] I think our second mic died but we have a few minutes are there any questions I'll just I'll just run it back and forth if I figure that's better uh wait you haven't asked one yet you should have time can we do some kind of voting in the semo4 group to make sure that we can add more people for example if like 10 out of 10 will vote for create another like proof yes can we do voting inside that protocol because you can also like do voting outside the protocol but then what's the purpose of using the protocol um we don't have that built out but yeah that could be added um I don't see no reason why I can't cool thank you um we had one over here so if somebody posts something that causes that Twitter account to get banned uh is it possible to like make a new group without knowing who they are but that they're not in it um it depends I think so if you have nullifiers for every single address um then I think you can basically ban like the sort of like like bad nullifier from like the second group um the point you're making though about Twitter Banning groups is very accurate like Twitter Cadets at any point shut down this entire operation so that is part of the reason why building on these centralized platforms is is tough and why building stuff like zkitter is so important for the for this sort of stuff any other questions now I have two microphones if that's useful for anyone um okay oh one more pass it down have you uh considered tying this into LinkedIn because I think that's an environment where people really have to uphold like their professional identity right and not able to like share information that they actually would like to share with their colleagues or people in their Community Glassdoor is a good example but you cannot really verify if people work at some place like in the setting like that wait what was your question oh yeah yeah for sure I think um once we have like ZK emails sort of working um it'll be really easy to sort of bootstrap these groups of like for example like employees of a company um Gloucester and blind like works pretty well for this stuff but um again like you're trusting laughter and blind to not reveal this information I think there's some like lawsuit in New Zealand or something where like last year I got sued to like release some of their information so you know this stuff does break down at some level but um yeah we could we could just have a more sort of secure version of that for sure
