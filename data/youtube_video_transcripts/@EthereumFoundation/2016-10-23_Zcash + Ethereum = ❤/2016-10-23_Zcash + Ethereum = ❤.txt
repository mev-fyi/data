you you next up we have Zuko Wilcox of Z cash come on up Zuko oh I need the clicker this is it I'll try clicking now I need to make that thing full screen and display it aha Thanks okay thank you all for being here wow what a crowd I'm really happy to be here a little bit intimidated by all you folks my name is Zuko and I'm the founder of the Z cash project and the first half of this talk is about what Z cash is and the second half is about ways to connect Z cash with aetherium Z cash first of all it's a science discovery that has been made over the past four or so years by a set of cryptographers and I'll tell you what the science discovery is in a few minutes and the cryptographers who are responsible for that are all part of the Z cash team now and second of all it's a technology that the Z cash team has been implementing and making efficient and useful and practical next it's a blockchain and there is currently a test net blockchain which you can totally go attack and please explain how you did so thanks and then on October 28th it'll be a real main net like permanent blockchain with a store value on it so it'll be a cryptocurrency the Z cash cryptocurrency is intended to be useful for as like a store value in a medium of exchange starting on October 28th and then lastly it's a community because there's a whole bunch of people spread out around the world who like me think that privacy is a really critical value in our society and this is a critical moment and that we have the opportunity to change the course of history for the better and that's the that's the ZK the Z cash community and the main reason I came here to Def Con was to try to establish more contacts between the Z cash in the etherium community okay so what is cool about blockchain technology is a the append-only property which we call immutability and the single source of truth effect and you all appreciate this pretty well but this is really new this was just recently discovered and we're only at the very beginnings of figuring out what you can do with those two properties and this conference is really the cutting edge of experimenting with what you can do given a append-only in canonicity and then the encryption modern-day encryption is like 4000 years old and so it's better understood and pretty much everyone understands the privacy property that encryption gives you which is that if two people want to communicate and there's some third party who has some position of power with respect to those two people the two can use encryption in order to prevent the the other third person in the middle from spying on or changing the contents of what they're saying to each other that's privacy and slightly less widely appreciated is the selective disclosure property of encryption and this is just a property of this is just an outcome of mathematics is that if you're using encryption to control read access to your data then that means there's some secret some decryption key that is knowledge of that secret is necessary and sufficient to get read access to the data right but that implies that if you know that secret you could choose to share that decryption key with someone else and if you did so that would give them the ability to see that data so Z cache is the first time we've had all four of these properties together a combination of the blockchain and the encryption and that means so so that means it's in order to really understand what you might be able to do with Z cache what kind of like products or programs you could build on top of it you've got to up  the selector disclosure part because people often who are more familiar with the privacy consequence of encryption they think of Z cache as being like the opposite of Bitcoin and aetherium or Bitcoin 80 theorem are all transparent all the time and so they think of Z cache as being like all opaque all the time it's all dark all the time but that's not true at all with Z cash you can append data to the blockchain and that data is encrypted so that so by appending it to the blockchain you're not revealing it to everyone in the world but if you selectively reveal it to a certain person that person gets to see that data in the single source of truth in the canonical blockchain so you can't you get you get the append only in canonicity properties you can't change your story later and you can't tell one story to one person and a different story to a different person but at the same time you have control over who sees the data so that's really interesting and we're even more at the beginnings of experimenting with what you could do by leveraging these properties I really have no idea I still haven't figured out what we're going to do with Bitcoin and ethereal much less with this ok but hold on back up why would I do this what why are we doing this so I think that privacy is a fundamental human right and I think that privacy is necessary for people to exercise their unique moral choices and I also think the privacy is a social value I think that the kind of privacy that we all were born into and the kind of privacy that all of our societies evolved around is healthy and then it strengthens and protects societies and it makes them more resilient and more humane but I also have discovered the privacy is a business requirement so I started I decided to devote years of my life to this project because I really cared about the other three bullet points the individual value social value and fungibility but then when I got started I was pleasantly surprised that businesses are really strongly demanding this kind of data security for their applications and this is true both of industrial blockchain businesses like banking and trade finance and insurance and healthcare and Internet of Things and so on there's a whole conference on this topic after this conference at which I'm also speaking and those kinds of applications where they want to use blockchain technology for one of those applications every single one of them requires improved privacy before they can use blockchain technology for that as it turns out in an edition people who want to use open crypto currencies like Bitcoin and aetherium just to transact and to find more customers for more countries and stuff like that they also require privacy so that their contracts and transactions are not exposed to enemies and competitors and one of our supporters Jeff garsik says if Samsung and Apple can see each other's transactions then that prevents them from doing business we need a neutral playing field where people can connect with their partners and customers at the same time as having privacy from competitors or criminals or hackers or whatever so that turns out to be really important and widely demanded by businesses which I've learned in the last two years when I started talking to them after I started this working on this and lastly fungibility fungibility is the property that to 101 notes are worth exactly a hundred each one is worth exactly 101 it's not that some notes are worth a little more in some notes are worth a little less and that's really important because you want commerce to be frictionless and easy you have enough problems already getting you know getting business done and so you don't want people hesitating and calculating about which particular note they're going to use for which purpose or anything like that fungibility is really important and in the modern blockchain era we need better privacy in order to keep having funds ability in my opinion all right the way we do privacy like I already alluded to encryption so there's a lot of privacy techniques that have been developed for Bitcoin I don't know if they've been applied to etherium yet I'd be interested to hear from you all about that and those ones are basically obfuscation in the sense of taking a transaction and hiding it in a bundle of other transactions so that it's so there's a few different transactions that it could have been a part of or something like that and what we're doing in Z cache is kind of a different approach which is using encryption which is a well understood modern technology and we encrypt all of the parts of the transaction before posting it to the blockchain so the cinder address the recipient address the amount any other metadata that is part of the transaction that all gets encrypted and then only the ciphertext is posted to the blockchain okay that clearly has a very strong privacy consequence but there's also a major problem with it like why didn't Satoshi do that years ago with Bitcoin is that if you encrypt all the transactions then how do the validators know how to discriminate how to filter out bogus transactions and include only legitimate transactions in the blockchain so that was the unsolved problem until about three years ago when the scientists that I mentioned that was the breakthrough and it's called ZK snarks which Vitalik mentioned in his talk today about as a future a potential future improvement to aetherium ZK sinorix are really efficient zero knowledge proof and a zero knowledge proof is a pretty mind-boggling thing but the effect of it is you can make a cryptographic a string a proof and the validators can inspect this and they can say to themselves nobody could have come up with this cryptographic string if they did not a secret key which signed a transaction which was valid according to all the rules of like not double spending and preserving all the invariants and that transaction is what's inside this ciphertext so the validators can use the zero knowledge proof to persuade themselves cryptographically that there must be a valid transaction signed by the person who owned the private key inside this encrypted transaction but they don't learn anything that's called ZK is short for zero knowledge because they don't learn anything else about the transaction they don't learn anything about the amount the other what kind of contract is involved or anything like that so that's the science breakthrough that has just come out recently so for the rest of this talk different ways that aetherium and z cash can connect with each other the first way so etherium is reason for existence is programmability and z cash is reason for existence is privacy and so we want to we're wondering we easy cashiers have been because we love you theorem we've always loved aetherium since the moment I heard about it just slightly before the first public announcement of it and so we're going to try to figure out how do you how can you combine programmability and privacy so the first way is add privacy into e theorem and there's this this hack that we did called Baby Zoe and it's called baby because it's just a baby step it's just a proof of concept and Zoe is short for Z Kashani theorem some Z cashiers went to a hack fest and Vitalik was there and helped them and some people from Cornell we're helping them and what that does is add a Z case norik pre-compile into aetherium and then implement kind of a minimal simplified version of z cash as an ethereal contract that's pretty awesome that that were and that's hopefully the basis of the coming ZK snark precompile that should be added into theorem proper and the second thing you can do is add programmability into Z cache we don't have any results to talk about yet but some of our scientists spend some of their spare time in the lab poking at different kinds of programmability or smart contracting the would fit into the Z cache engine and still preserve all of the security properties of Z cache and then the third way is get the Z cache any theory on block chains to connect because whatever happens for the for the next few years at least both of these block chains are going to be active entities with a user base and developers around them and I want the developer communities to be easily able to work together that's what we call project alchemy is to make the Z cache and any Theory Emblaze interoperate so that there's a seamless ability to move between the two and the way we want to do that is just by cloning BTC relay BTC relay is an etherium script that Joseph Chow and others have written which makes basically a Bitcoin light client inside a theory amande so our project is to change that to make a Z cache light client inside of a theory own and JD hess from consensus has helped with this already and uh sorry I keep hitting just nervously clicking the what and I'm not trying to change my slides so once you have that once you have an ethereal script that can that can see transactions from the other blockchain then it's possible to write an aetherium contract that can do a trustless swap of Z cash for ether right because the the etherium contract can say I will pay out 40 ether to the first Z cash address which sin or to the first address of your choice which sends a certain amount like 5z cash to a certain d'caché address and then once it's posted that offer a Z cash program or user can fulfill that and then the etherium contract will fulfill its ID right so there was never an opportunity for either side to take off with the other side's tokens and there's just a little bunch of complicated like game theoretic problems that arise from that which Joseph Chow has thought a lot about I hope I mean he seems to have and hopefully we can just benefit from all of that research and also I think the Raiden design also tries to solve the same problem so maybe we could use that or its solutions instead but the end result of that is two things if you get if you get that if we get that working we get two things out of it and this is the one I'm most excited about out of the three ways these are all cool and we're contributing to all of them but the one that I'm most excited about is number three because that's the one that can be deployed and people could start using it and building on it the soonest I think so if we get this deployed the first thing is a decentralized currency exchange right there so if all the currency exchanges have failed or if you live in a country where you can't use a currency exchange or something like that but you still have aetherium and z cash blockchains you can use this to swap ether for z cash with no third party and nova more extravagant and you know if that were to get bootstrapped and become widely used then it's one of those unshut downa Balcon of things it's a general purpose utility for everyone to rely on after that maybe I love the idea but the other thing is if that gets going if you have those contracts on the ethereum blockchain then that means aetherium contracts gain a new power this is the awesome thing about a few in which I don't understand very well but the exciting thing about it is that every time someone adds a new contract to the ethereum blockchain this gives all the other contracts the possibility to do something new without without as much coordination and planning between the different coders so if we succeed at getting this done then all the other aetherium contracts gain the ability to send and receive Z cash basically because you can always you can always post a claim saying as in e theory on tracked you can always post an offer saying I will pay you if you send Z cash there or whatever and if if your aetherium contract receives Z cash then if it were sent encrypted on the Z cash blockchain no one can tell where it came from but they can always see who has control of it now because the etherium contracts don't have any secrets right so everyone can see one interfering contract knows and what it decides so if it decides to send Z cash everyone can see to what address it intended to send it so it could potentially have privacy on the incoming transaction and not on the outgoing transaction but that's ok because privacy is a social system wide network property anyway it's not an atomic property of individual transactions so much so basically it seems like it might make if your name contracts able to send and receive more or less privately well we haven't been making much progress on this project in the last couple of months because October 28th is our launch date for Z cash and it's coming up fast like five weeks or something from now so hopefully we'll make more progress on the project alchemy and the other two after that and in the meantime other people have been making some progress contributing to it so you should if you find this interesting at all well you should just reach out and you should definitely find me after this talk or because I'm going to be around at the conference the whole time and I think it's all I have to say about that Thanks
