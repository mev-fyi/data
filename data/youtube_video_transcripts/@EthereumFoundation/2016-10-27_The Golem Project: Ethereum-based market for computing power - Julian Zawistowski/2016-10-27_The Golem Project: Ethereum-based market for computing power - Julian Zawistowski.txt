I'm happy to be here to update you on our progress with the government project so I think gulden project is with etherium almost from the beginning in fact we thought about golden project shortly after learning about the cerium because I believe that it's cerium is the technology that makes the concept possible so as this is our third DEFCON already I will only describe the concept the basic concept very shortly so Gollum is to be a market for computing power where anyone can like set an offer to sell the time of Machine of the computing and anyone else can use the advantage of that and by this this this time by computing a heavy computing task on the provider machine so there are two very important parts of this equation there are hardware providers and task requesters or or requesters that's how we call them but there is also the third very important element that we have a little bit over script in the communication presently who are software developers and we thought that as we are on a DEFCON after all maybe we should tell you more how we plan to integrate software developers into the equation so like with like with every like we do every complex system with many players you need to have some features and some incentives which makes players to use the features and in our case we have feature as the Golem is a flexible platform to deploy and monetize software that's for software developers of course and also Gollum is a tool to sell the hardware time or bar by hardware time if you are in need of some so this is the basic concept we have made actually quite a good progress since the previews DEFCON DEFCON one Oriana presented our probabilistic nano payment scheme we have a live public alpha version at the moment running on our test net so you're welcome to try it to see the code on on on a github and yes and there is one great thing you will be a valid 100 eater if you join but this our our test net eater so they're worth nothing but still you can like to do some rendering with that because what we have integrated so far is a blender blender is open source rendering software so you can render yourself a picture or a movie and you know pay that with that with our test net eaters so so those are the basis so now worries worries where is the big story for today for the big story I would like to tell you a little bit about no no not that way a little bit about history so 80s were great time lemo fancy haircuts but also like the beginning of the personal computers era as we know it now so what happened in in the early 90s in early 80s IBM created the facto standard for personal computers standard that exists to this day this standard was eventually reversed engineered by IBM competitors and Crick hardware market as we know it now emerged and the the biggest winner of this hardware wars was a software company Microsoft our our era sponsor today and and the truth is that the Microsoft was able to take advantage of that because standard for hurdler emerged so in fact hardware alone doesn't matter like it doesn't matter at all Hardware is worth as much as software running running on this hardware and if there is a standard for hardware sastra can take advantage of it like it happens with the personal computers and and then Microsoft so like I don't want to say that we are like creating standard for using every machine because there are many standards for that many protocols but what we are trying to do we try to connect all the standards on the one platform with a one standard way of exchanging value using a tearoom network for software and for computing power and if this is simple for some computing power you can ask how it is possible to integrate any software with the centralized system and this is what I want to show you very shortly today so we need great software like beautiful software built by engineers by social developers like you to take off to make our golden Network great and to make it hearing great and to do that we will need to concept which is volume application registry and column transaction framework so application registry is a very simple concept in fact that you register untain your integration like you identify yourself your your application some basic information that enables user to find the application and to install the application to run it and anyone can certify that anyone can say that this code is good or can it anyone can say that this code is that that is malicious and blacklist it and this is up to the user who to trust so this is like the centralized trust non trust network in fact and this is how we want to make it possible to any developer deploy software for gollum what is more there are very many different possible integrations with many different reward schemes if you think about how software companies are licensing the software this there's like any possible scheme you can imagine like per user per computer per hour per year anything is possible so we are not going to implement in our transaction framework any solution possible we will provide of course for our integration examples that can be done for every party but in fact we think it should be possible for developers to integrate any reward scheme which is which is compatible with some general standards and I think those standards can be some are summarized in in in just saying that it should be measurable it should be four it should not enable you to do and think dangerous due to other parties so and of course over time I think that the coming integrations will create a kind of set of templates that will create in fact this transaction framework that any one creator we couldn't use later and in fact this is those both concepts are very very powerful because this will enable you not only to deploy your application on ghullam network but also use other parties integrations in your integrations following the reward scheme so this is like again one more place where all the puzzles will meet together and I think this is what will make both the theorem and Golden's trunk because as I can see on this conference everything we build here is build of many different puzzles I will update you that we are another company that is using IP FS for example maybe not in the integration which is life at the moment but definitely we we are going to integrate with ipfs quite soon and as as we as curiam community can benefit from using each other integrations and solutions and software I think the same is true for applications running on the Gullah network and of course like Gollum is not for every application at least at the beginning its for heavy computing mostly but I think that over time we we will make it possible to run more and more very interesting things very interesting integrations so what is the plan I I see I have still some time left so I will tell you what what we plan next as I said a month ago we released our first alpha which is working but still a lot of work to be done we hope to eventually advance that release drawing that it's hard to promise but I hope this will be not yours but quaters rather maybe months and this will be that the first living golden Network focused on on rendering because we believe that computer graphic rendering alone is like major industry that is very interesting use case itself and then we will focus on providing Q that developers with tools to integrate with with go limp and and deploying any any application that can take advantage of golden men and curium f as soon as possible so if you want to know more about the project we we have our github open that that's obvious that's that's actually that obvious that I don't have that on the slide but you can also visit our web page our slack or our blog where we update on the progress of the of the project thank you very much
