[Applause] we here to talk about rich so they differ in is to bring you closer to your grievances we always wanted to have you have like always present to have introduced your computer so as much as you have yes services single server as an interpreter display from everywhere indeed over the system in taxes so we'd like to have this part here so our interpretation of this designed it and elevated would develop residence this is how we should you know just turn on a few wonder this should be just happy voices so yeah guys business critic Peter right and this volume so you start with a menu application and there to this research start death and then you don't have a double it or a tumble connect using the like plan so if you click it you you go to straight to the parties in speech here we got links are conditioned community version list you can upgrade number five just for the colliculus provinces which is referring here you can use this form to configure know that that resource I mean some flags to that they've got some sensible clothes and innocent and stuff like a recess for a mask so you can you know just edit your flags to go beyond now this puppy start to just flip it like just like that on their face and then you take you straight to the terminal you know the regular outlet we also provide some know the information so you can have sync status and of course so when I think that survey to highlight this hungry can serve as a human export a tooling and launch pad as well so App Store about today usually do they help with app discovery and purely installing something it's like you're all next door to like it's great so here we have users finding well with your notes and tools and apps we'll talk more about this later and we handle all the installation of in my integrity is Pearson cosign and launch pad which is how easy it is to configure it and zero friction to run so you know the assistant has you know 10 folder name at least a number of clients we have like this way and then you know I was just pretty smart so here now this is what you get out of the box with the grid and we call these plugins which could be either area and three notes client via an ally but ipfs this have a storage tool so plugins from there we can find lots of feats that they are all the vitamins in the file so we can have things like this which is not globally by default but we can that we can just you know provide this preset so what what has it what does get putting out we got the releases feet so we pull download directly from gas horse and not gonna make package manager' forgot we put the different flags we put some accessibility poles communication protocol it is all define it all the plug-in itself so great doesn't have anything hard-coded the gathering of migrants which is good for extensibility because we can integrate it you know virtually any other client settings for their condition related apps so this all goes in a single file and as such we can have several others including yes so what aren't written apps so the these are stuff South package modifications are applying they are impacting very qualities are all and you know I'm going to give those ups and anyone can use it so we'll talk about this detail later so we can be really is before awarding developers in a different approach so whatever the develop the start today is pate ladies you know some other tools they're like yeah you don't want to flag without standing for using real notes for development you can just start to look for the rubber flap changing their computer and then it started involved with it so yeah your nose are not for minors developers can also use it so I should just do this and as well I would do the note we can have things like this so sorry people with it then we could start anyway waffle is Sir about later being at some shards of it and then we can have lots of others then we swap weakened and then you know keep signing so yeah written help to Panera makes me through - there are more inclusive providing tools you like - is very one sharpening the feedback look of these developments hopefully speaking in iterations of course we are already talking to us or developers on this verse and very cross implementations which is really important for this stage of the projects and using written apps to manage state whatever by the leaders and because so thank you so as we learned it already comes out of the works and there's many more clients that will probably be integrated into churches and you can really cover it is decentralized package manager all these different clients already have their own lease management they all have their own formats that they provide some have aquifers some so by buying these maybe not all headphones and some need to run this group before they can be started this was the first challenge for us to have this type of communication with your client provide us how we can be find good standards the other the other big challenge for us of course they all have different hosting so need to talk to a bunch of eggheads and these are probably the most like permanent and rather than beckons but they all very centralized and maybe in the future someone decides they aren't you plus my values and ideas or maybe something we don't know yet and we wanted to not restrict but we wanted to allow all these projects to keep their release management strategy and we would give that up to it and he needed to engineer it anyways thanks for the photo and this brought us very quickly to the big challenge how can we make sure that if we don't know the origin or don't know the connection with from the project anthology how can we make sure that the clients that the users ability that they are that the relative to their sale and we came up with that with our own package signing scheme and we have a table format specification or reference implementation that Celia I too would end in the IP draft and this all goes under the name of the Kunsan technical and I will briefly describe why we are at this point reinventing to be they're not just feeling like you're signing that is all about so they're signing is that is the critical piece of grid and as basically just two steps by design of mecca's you're very lightly in traditional called signing usually you you want to have a hardware device that it stores it by the keys or a certificate and these devices are usually purchased as a description and you pay up to $1,500 per year this is difficult for open source because not everyone has the Eastman's [Music] for you sign languages you can use your existing not with your eyes instead so you're probably well such as you of it but you don't even need to basin you can also use to assign a mess to sign negative sign and then tell the verifications that sign paper says that sign languages have really nice properties such as authentication integrity of our reputation and you get the same good into use confusing images but this is not all that goes into it they give you the authentication set and you want to know like who's the author of the package that under I don't know it you usually very dated against an identity or certificate and this is also part of the sign up is that if I can get the device you need to register their certificate alrighty the certificate and they do some background checks one when you get you need to provide them with a lot of data and this data is part of the package information with yields and packages if you do the verification step you get in a few minutes make public others and this is true for two main reasons one is you can immediately send money to be able to be on top of the package so now we can incentivize developers to actually sign languages and receive donations holders it's not just that they have to do more they actually benefit from it that's the main main big step the other thing is you can define your identity so you can use some of these emerging identity contracts to just specify it relevant information that's needed to make sure that people can trust you and you can provide information in such as your guitar handler instead of your company's data for your own personal about that that this was really cool and we didn't just want to use it for the binary management and we also started to sign our own software visit our user interface with the web UI independently of the binary so that updates the smaller we signed these updates to make sure that it's secure every thought hey maybe we can also like his other applications like remix so we made made a test the next year all uploaded remix to idea of s and downloaded it and started it in bridge and this brought us to the next evolution which is good s before if we can the secure way guarantee that these applications can be lured we can also extend a new application that I'm not just provided by a few foundation teams but also islands and this is a new mess accurate of free tips okay so it consists of two main parts right person the first are plugins the second dollar a person so what it's it's lighter than that but it's not dude so a napkin can have a related client associated client package URL client settings and local your element so what does that mean you can have dependence and relies on that state get a graphical that's all I knew things for again we have an amicus and it's specified on in that part is get to be started you know and he has the address in part of it and of course some settings so this is like a manifest file to define a how should that little pisser behave but then this all goes into single file and this is graphing so here we have the Apps section of grid you can have you can click mulch and then if you get is not started it would prompt to you saying okay the application rat problem I request to start legal spikes and then press a key to all this time so it now it works with the specific clients but it can also work with plan types so it could be storage right to you okay so we need to run this after the storage plant so you can just you know its target going to your favorite storage such as this form so step back detect when a location that women why you probably read this life right so we're mentioning that written have a certain time adapts so they years to provide a lower level access to those flights so you can have dashboards and to have money to written systems didn't even connect to several plants at once using some special anatomy provide so you can very clients and providers who still another example we've made a UI for the cleft the wreath you signer and this is how it works so we have here to the less side and cyborg would have a clutch plan so just open it you will prompt you if he has two requirements one is collected self the other yep somebody started is actively propably ready to download those plans if you don't have them installed so there's lots of things out and then you can just approve and sign messages or transactions using this another example is the RPC passer app this one makes you test RPC pods for several clients gentle together but you know every plant that we have today with so it's a really nice way to test you know sorry all right it's Tesla's methods and it's get returned this is like a little postman for eight years and this is a small app so we made it out of pump and another possess and then you know people can do their own so rid I discovered a loan update knows but just one click they can even detect requirements just such as I knew he's a be soon runs Java so we tended you know just do our own magic to make sure that you have it if you don't even try to you know go get it or you know try to sell it easily configure your note 17 sensible defaults in mathematics presets and registries that are all put a party plugins gratias and that means you could have such as a stream of plugins that are specific to your company these work for my enterprise and then only your employees can see instead of having you know that's that pretty set that we have made and have to do your own custom stream of coordinates so you do have the portals of things that you can do it accomplished with rip use the link have fun [Music] so you can use madam as you have a fully decentralized way in that tutorial we explained how to start gap in the Lifeline moment and then connected using madam SP set and you know graphed well I did fast so yeah if you have to sort of launch pad all boardies helpers and to point out of course thank you for your time [Music] happen if you're on who else and they have conflicting requirements for the blacks or you're trying to start what okay we will try to start getting twice [Music] it [Applause]
