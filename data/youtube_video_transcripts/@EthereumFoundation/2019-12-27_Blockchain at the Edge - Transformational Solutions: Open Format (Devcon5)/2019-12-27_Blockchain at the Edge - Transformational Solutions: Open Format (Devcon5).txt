[Applause] ten minutes oriented top at you and we will stop talking at you and break out into groups and do some work we'll spend about 30 minutes in idea and problem based groups thinking about solutions building off solutions and the ways those have been thinking about it all week and then we're going to take our last 15 minutes and come back together as a group and debrief what is it what does it mean to think about solutions at the edge and moving them to the center right what does it mean for the ideas of we are coming up with and where where could they go things like that so let me orient me quickly to a snapshot of where we ended yesterday and then we're going to talk about the topic groups we're going to break down and do some work so we're thinking about the work in kind of four ways you're welcome to come closer if you want but I will share them out with you some of the big ideas that folks landed on as of yesterday some we had some big ideas about having a co-op at three coops in one to handle different areas of business and in order to ensure that there are no big players or no middlemen right we own every aspect of the means of production and that co-ownership means co-prophet another big idea was like thinking about well there's a role that Federal Reserve plays right um as an al you ater for exchange how do we recreate that in a way that is equally owned and that we can participate in we also thought about what's what's done with identity data to prove who identity is to improve what identity is and and some questions Matt asked around well do people really want formal ID right or is there an assumption that ID that's government issue this is a good thing great questions here that identity focuses on the user with the creation that identity currently focuses on governments is that how we want to think about it some other big learnings about rating systems that needs shared understanding right kind of going back to this leg if we replace the Federal Reserve want to replace it with the problems as we see them so if we got like some big heavy stuff it's 900 8:00 in the morning and we're already in shared clemency right like oh my god but don't worry you all will be able to dive in some of the problems as we see them now right financial control what works at a small scale will it also work at larger scales will we replicate systems of domination right we've had lack of coordination and incentive alignment and lack of transparency these are both technical coordination problems and long-term social issues right that come together big problems who say they'll get people to care about the security and sovereignty of ID right like making the value proposition of thinking about ID meaningful folks scaling something that work small might not work bigger right so classic technology and engineering problem and how can we abstract value to increase financial access and liquidity in a scalable way without recreating our old financial system the age-old question I ask myself every morning frankly okay so we're trying to snapshot just some of what thinking is as it's been developing over the week which has been fascinating but let's get you all talking and thinking we have three main thinking area so we've been building out there is one that is around financial control and like some of the like financial ownership and currency issues the problem statement that's being worked on here is people in developing markets need more secure ways of storing their money because the current way a strong yet or under the bed promotes loss right so if you want to think about that problem statement if you want to improve that problem statement if you want to work on finances you're going to go over here and hang out in this group this group will be talking about ID which is a big gnarly problem the problem statement that's going to be worked on over here it's communities without their ability to own IDs such as children elders or folks who are mentally ill I mean the ability to determine and who's responsible for and able to action on behalf of their ID because these people are most vulnerable so if you want to think about identity of vulnerable populations and creating autonomy or folks you are going to come to the screen third option this group that here is thinking about cooperatives governance making businesses out stable right creating business models that resist the big middlemen as you will so if you want to think about that think about how you might enable that you're going to go over there so we're going to break in just two minutes here you get more information in your group on what is this topic area you're going to improve it you're gonna think about how you might your own words we're not limited to the framing notes here even though it's what we're starting and what we're going to work on in the next 30 minutes is some solutions and ideas that we have we're going to generate ideas if we don't have them so your facilitator for your group is either going to lead you specifically through through an exercise and if you're not sure there's two exercises that you can try here to take an idea and kind of walk through it or come up with some ideas and share them as a group so each group will determine how they want to move forward so with those instructions you'll have 30 minutes to think about some ideas and solutions the problem you're working on talk about it together we'll come back together and share back and have a discussion the discussion yesterday was really starting to get interesting a mole lands the plane as it were talking about well why why why does it matter for us to think about moving from the edge to the center what does it mean to think about centering peoples whose experiences and needs are traditionally called emergency so with that financial institution identity businesses I'm gonna invite you to break out to these areas [Applause]
