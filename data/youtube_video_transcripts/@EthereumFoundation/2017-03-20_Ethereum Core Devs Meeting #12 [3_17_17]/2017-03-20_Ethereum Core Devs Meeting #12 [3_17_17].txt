my cat is a core developer specifically with creating a implementation of the etherium client in the esoteric programming language brainfuck so I guess you know about that one yeah yeah so that that's what my cats up to oh that would be a good luck with that yes there's some good start over making this up anyway definitely I woke up with 15 minutes to spare nice i woke up an extra hour 20 minutes early because I thought that 1400 GMT was 8 a.m. my time it was actually 90 there's things on the Internet to make that really clear at heart even Google you type in 1400 UTC it will tell you like what the right time is in your time zone unless you have your ID twilio my kids in the way trim but that is very true let's see so let me attach the agenda so that's compute the furtive stuff so I just put the agenda and get her and on internal chat here so we'll wait just another second then start on that yep different than yesterday's agenda there's been just a couple of updates from yo Ichi and I'm in the process of editing the accepted II IPS because we forgot one from one of our discussions on metropolis okay so we have parity CPP ebm Ruby pi cerium go and i think that's it so high android which a development team or us it's supposed influences oh hi nice to meet you okay yeah I think I saw you on Scott yeah cattails I have dog barks a little yeah and with that from Greg will kick off this meeting so the first agenda item is a eip signaling and voting system update so me and casey casey and i talked to some people from the carbon vote and boardroom and meta mass teams and where we formed a group to create a voting system on blockchain that also connects to github in order to show support it by individuals by group for certainty IPS so yep that's in progress and some of the first looks at that are pretty good and then Casey do you want to talk about the overall idea of your page that shows the implementations and which clients implement on um I guess not not too much to say really if you've already seen the table [Music] it's not mandating that and you know that client maintain errs implement any particular RPC method both foreign RPC message you know approves or adds a change in RPC method mandate that a maintainer of a client or core dev you know has to follow that that specification it just means that there will be a red mark in the table is all ok cool so yeah it's so that's about it cool yeah it's kind of like a what's the other what's that kind of based off of kc it's the who else uses that was it a javascript i guess yeah the es the ESX compatibility table it's linked in the in the eip and the issue ok great i'll put that in the notes post-meeting great so next is going to be VIP 225 this is the cliq proof of authority protocol and a rink be proof of authority testament so a Peter you can take it away on that going to latex was wondering just so basically done it kind of cemented the solution for our constant personal problems that's time we so obviously rocks and blew up we all know why it blocks and I'm a kind of agree that maybe we should try to somehow revive it but that allows go so smoothly as we expected and the problem is that even a even if you do try to somehow incentivize you rising wroxham if it will always be attackable if somebody really wants to attempt maybe if we start up and review is can sustain I'm attack but if somebody wants to break it in can break it and the problem is that's kind of everybody was the entire community blew up on the rocks and run down because that developers kind of rely on it to be able to test their so we even though it's not too far so the most of the developers don't care what concerns and justice that's one down as long as they can depend on it many people kind of started rolling their own private sector so come on up here than others it's a bit messy and then the entire was suggestion behind the DC IP is that we can wear my suggestion is relaunching intestinal based on a very very simplified source of authority protocol now the Food Authority protocol that's that I kind of called the click is kind of so the the basic design principle behind the folks who was that we reuse as much as possible from the existing consensus basically she be able to integrate in existing clients with as little hassle and possible and yet again it should it should play along with all current technologies life clients fasting work think it should not require client developers kind of update their entire code base just to support this and well I won't go over the entire spec but the idea is that the head protect the entire central purpose which is implemented its as part of the header field and there's a small voting mechanism so that signers can both that new signers of the graphic designer and the only feels that is significantly changed extra bacon but that guilt come in that field is dynamic in the original specs I mean in our current protocol if we can do whatever we want to death those doesn't break any who any networking group serialization let cetera and the protocol is kind of I won't go over the entire thing you can read it it's basically just a very simple elegance of assorted protocol that display sighs do to deserve with everything and just to point out it is also an implantation and go and we kind of I'm really proud that it's extremely self contained to the whole consensus engine is extremely comment that is 500 lines of code and the whole voting mechanisms again extremely commented with some other stuff is 200 lines of code and basically this is two files that can be plugged into the existing systems and it kind of just work and this was one of the our core my core requirement that it should be something that's that's trivial to ask duo chi and because otherwise if clients require a lot of work and in scientific implementers annex to beat the purpose of running it as assessment so that's the ER dr ok cool so is there any comments from other client dev specifically if anyone has you know just initial thoughts on potentially implementing that into their client and also if they're if there's any concerns with this ok some party here so yeah it looks for a living on alpha will probably end up intrumental paris proposal I know from maintaining a role on contract based content to tangent proposal authority at for the time frame have to tell this point couple weeks maybe okay thanks arcady um i guess thats go yeah and then I owe the talekar you back hey vitalik can you hear us yeah I can hear you guys just feel better in that connection Oh perfect okay great and then on Jan what are your thoughts on this hi I think once a once a feminist is catalyzed it is settled that Cochise is better use of Internet mmm I saw Nalu be okay excellent so yeah what we'll do is Peter's already written a really very well written eip will transfer or I'll work with other transfer that into a PR and we'll do a final check over and pretty much considered accepted and Christian just to make sure CPP is on board with this I thought I saw something in like a getter chap that y'all were good yeah sure so we'll probably take longer than Paris here but because of chocolate low but yeah no problem alright great so that one is accepted we can move on to the next item which is eip 214 so this I believe this is kind of shortening to static Hall versus peer called where should static ulch do a state changing operation and actually throw or just be reverted so this was discussed a little bit on the channel by Nick or Martin so I don't think I see Nick in here Martin could you elaborate on this and give your point of view yeah well I guess it's basically and since is we have rebirth is possible to do a kind of synthetic pure call by having one of the having an initial bouncing to the city area burton operation which you return to return value in the reverse so in doing that kind of coal will allow you to make your calls but we will not be hindered safe so it's kind of an ugly back door into pure call hold on deviant Pyrrha color statical i'm not sure we tell me okay so static call can read by can't write your collagen either can't write it and also can't read yeah so this was the limit to read it wouldn't they are able to through their kind of able to write but anything they're right to be resorted but wait hold on her legs and otherwise sorry so how do you get the information out but still do the river but you'll revert anything that was written again yeah because the fun thing with the reverse is the juror able to get the return you can pass the return value as well eventually defined they're all like a minute i interested in box to revert and the effect you can have it if you can call stuff and it's the stuff can storage to media values during the calculation or whatever and it can access to space it can return and then you revert the return value instead of returning so that's not a people in different functionality right because in back on a situation the state could still change in the middle of the call and so we can still have what we are pre entrance the attack for that yeah well no because it won't yes goo idea like what do you know what I mean like I tax where let's say a like a Cosby and that was supposed to be a static all but then because a and then a caused B and then that doesn't see changes and like basically then what we get the intercom make substation just in that influence of the other call yeah but if it's the only local calls is going to regard anyway well know what the point basically is that the outer complet so let's say the outer call is so beat so unlike SB has some stage and the process of calling the function starts changing some stage then let's say at some point out then after that it calls a and then a calls be again and then that changes a bunch of state then after that they once the execution goes back to be like the execution of V is going to continue but the state will have been changed in the middle so it's like a revert is the reentrant the attack that's like one level deeper in and I'm not sure I follow you but so the point the point I was making is that as soon as we implement the rebirth of code and licks fingers are also then it will be possible to kind of abuse their birth functionality in order to obtain a side-effect free fall and yeah do we want all these different kind of mechanisms right Nicky ok hmm you'll think about it it might not even like to actually not be an issue no it might not be a it's just an open question on the work for dev channel right now actually and if I can't think of any problem for that and they're definitely does seem much an interesting way of doing a static of doing static call I think there are two reasons against it and one of them is you will end up with two coats so essentially the proposal here was that the in your contract if you're trying to call something with static call and to another contract first you will call yourself another function on your contract which does the call end of the river and and the second reason is if we have the actual an actual static code then with setec analyzers you could you could be sure that it will be a static all right otherwise I mean a quality so the thing that you would do with static analyzers here is you as you a call as a new and you and a source that says that the results of the calls us the value that was popped onto the stacks by the static off code basically says that a call reverted so one thing that does concern me though is that you would be if you is starting using it in that way then you can't really distinct what if the revert opcode pushes a zero on to the stack then you can't distinguish between successful reverse and exceptions inside of the inside of the call so like it would almost seem better to push it to onto the stack or something else or as well Roberta pheasants at the insert the for water right and the forwarder always succeed and the fact that the internal call succeeded or not will be part of the return data of the rivers kind of but like give it there's still going to be cases where you can't really distinguish basically if any the eternal call fails right then it's good the olin year you can't really tell the difference between that and it returning zero data yes there was a separate the proposal to change the return value of coal to have three states yeah okay i am not only door that yes I support that so I always fully fix this issue but that's not something we have planned for metro right I think we're is formatted for call I mean it's something that would be trivial implement if we agree on it yeah but it would be and I separately not backwards compatible well hold on so the revert off code right now doesn't exist right so it's almost all know I thought we're talking about what call returns yes what call returns is not that easy to change and because of all the existing solidity contracts right but I mean what if we have zero representing an actual an actual throw one representing and and a correct output and then the number two representing the river top coat then should that solve it in a totally backwards compatible way Colonel still in sync section on zero yes so let's fun because like if there's unless oh I see it because I'm silver failure right so the i guess the challenge here is that the throw-up code has to use cases where one of them is the signal of failure and one of them would be to abuse it in this way to return a static value so so if we have if we have a solo que estar from further back so revert with return data only make sense if we have at least return data size and perhaps even return date a copy why because this the success type the further the success data type and the failure data type these are two different things and they can have different sizes so we need dynamic return sure although um and we still do it was I mean we can establish a for most use cases the failure return data type to just being 32 bytes should be enough right wait cases that require the failure return to be like variable size seem limited but then you need okay but okay assuming we have returned at a time then when we can use that to distinguish throw from the work true throw over a profit data and refer to or I mean revert without data is facing the same as it's just a true right so what was it what would the assert the after are called and what it's a return like what is check the stock value for one and then a or the and then or that was the return data size or so what's what fix a question so like how would high-level programming languages implementers work with all of these things I not talking about the skeptical of work around or other solution or kind of both at the same time so at the static called work around use case and the use case of using to actually signal an error so the regular thrills work mechanism and that has nothing worked out correctly how to give the idea basically and I level language basically I guess for failure and in the case of failing is just access further in terms of in that goes into some kind of exception options listed as Miss unfortunates of walnuts yeah so is this all just just for me to kind of keep up with that is this all relating to eip 214 or is this a culmination of e IPS that build on each other it's like a combination okay sounds good so um okay so yeah 214 is the new opcode static call and it sounds like based on that other things might need to change would someone be able to cross-reference these e IPS and the repository and what I mean by that is either tag them across each other or give an outline more or less of what was disgusted it today I think we didn't discuss more than it's already within the issues me oh yeah that's think I haven't looked through all these VIPs uh yeah potentially so what we can do is we can bring this up in the next all core dev meeting but this I think someone mention this isn't something that's going in the metro right I know I think it is it's not bouncing out so the question is the proposal was to not include static Hall because it can be simulated by other mechanisms which will press the make their way into metropolis you know so one kind of side question are we also interested in impure call and when your cause is fundamentally different because it's rich it's a leader concert of address right but I mean it's beautiful it's all right yeah i mean like it does require some of the machinery because like in the case of static all you have to do something to either disabled or throw on any write operation and in the case of pure call you have to be the same thing for both writes and reads for but although I guess doing just one is definitely simpler than doing both so okay so like I i personally definitely feel a bit a bit more comfortable with return data size if it means that if we can kind of stimulii static all without action without actually doing statical um like so I think what to get to to code up a specific example of how to do that exactly sure yeah yeah that sounds like a good idea would that have to be across multiple clients or just one example everybody could by co-opting me and michael is an implementation inside of it areum code or doing me and like an implementation of how that gets used in high-level code then I always thinking about an assembly implementation oh yeah i mean its own a case they'll be done in like serpents are solidity assembly RL or whatever yeah so there's a high level thing i think that that leads to discuss them pretty good it's a bit the main problem here is that when you look at solidity you can't really distinguish internal from an external call and the mechanism of course different for internal and external culture that's much a bit complicated but yeah we're okay sounds good so to give a summary Casey and Alex and the chat put some of the ones that cross reference this issue a little bit and Christian would you all be able to talk about do that implementation you were talking about and just kind of touched that across the e IPS and maybe the Gator channels all right great Casey just had a comment yeah we can move it into the under consideration table that's that's a good idea so that they can all be in there and then we can concatenate any that we need to so any other comments on this cool um and then Alex you typed in chat something did you have a comment well now it's just Casey said if maybe we should move pure static corey burton and data size in to enter concentrations for metropolis but i think revert itself is a standalone yeah exactly what Roberta's seems very uncontroversial and it's useful we can have come some of the other stuff gets implemented okay sounds good but if it is appended on return data size yeah i thought christian said that revert isn't very useful without return data size and return data copy at least a pentacle yeah it's much more useful when you also have these other two okay so let's keep it as accepted then okay sounds good yeah so it's useful with other things but it can also stand on its own even without those okay sounds good cool I think that's all the comments for this so the next item is eip 161 I believe that's kind of already dealt with more or less yuuichi do you want to just do a brief summary of what you commented on in the agenda page and how that's being resolved oh yeah sure so they studies about the head of paper stated about metro police think the good but there are other but good news first go metro bodies side created the two requests for most metro police he IDs except elliptic curves and i visited getting low fees on within my discuss metal for his years and now it's clear to me what he most what he doesn't want okie think good things look good yeah ah I have to go head to head up here because the yellow paper on the master branch currently is we are committed to even before spear dragon the PDF poke I once submitted the prius dragon berry trees have been merged it but he reverted the changes and he says he won't come clean up first and giving said I understand he and I should meet more frequently so we will be in victory working on the yellow paper together and a background to all these is the yellow paper is not under an open source license or creative commons one no license so it's just having total [ __ ] under some other contributors copyrights so um so I need to keep working with him I will be participant about that okay sounds good I saw that as one of this is a garnet we heard there's no consumables EAP 161 know that that's exactly what I was going to bring up yeah I was going to get years comment and get her but go ahead architect okay well yes if you want this one allows to delete empty account but it doesn't clearly specified if a pre-compiled compact account can be completely empty of any storage and from my interpretation is that it cannot because it contains our native code and this is not an issue for the main video network currently because call up the pre compile Rembrandt currently there but it might damage the for future network in New Testament the private network fordyce and we need to clarify that and by providing the old papers well I can explain the yellow paper data are in my previous dragon pull request I specified that the precompiled can be emptied their code is empty and they can be removed and then I believe that what other implementations currently okay well about this proposal and it's very easy in the yellow paper to implement this particular proposal so that pre-compiled cannot be empty so a tourist head of the Europa based content with a very fine if content is king okay and my question related to us I'm assuming that they won't be this thing in the state's try though right so the cold that the native code this thing will not be in the state try on your right so the way to distinguish that is actually so there then there must be an impractical mechanism to distinguish precompile unknown pre-compiled otherwise otherwise we cannot distinguish empty usual account or empty precompile so we need mechanisms to specify which address from pain compile well if all the implementations are letting go is that they can be emptied my peers in the literature typically de facto standard what I would like to confirm that this is really the case so I look at the gopuram code in this thing so yeah so good got that was the case before the the Dragonheart fault and I think I don't see the issue with keeping it although like implementation has to consider like having empty contact action actually returned from some data in course but that was the case before the hard fork and I don't really see the reason for the change now what is the reason for today you can go no I just wanted to say that I so I'm not I hadn't checked that part of the crew for a long time ago is here but I think so there was a at a given point there was a mini-14 may not one gets hurt you went to different directions and I fell doubt that both the client has some bugs and the first line of the issue was that the etherium did not delete something because it has a rule that precum past cannot be deleted was parity deleted it so I'm not sure whether we delete it or not but I kind of agree with Arkady that if this is kind of a weird corner case and it could be not specified especially if you want to play nicely on on on main network are more precisely this consensus issue was about out of gas happening during the compiled execution so the 3 s's of dragons contains equity account removal thing empty accounts were removed when they were published and the question was when a contract was being regular cuties but i would get happened if ok the question is if this contract please touch or not touched when the other gets happened and usually when a bogus happens everything should be reverted so state removal Jim happen and the account would not touch but what we compiled it was different and that now so we currently has an exceptional people files that is even if out of gas happens during the compile the contract execution they attached under their space might be cleared I have a question about how can this I don't understand how how this can be a problem on files network since we don't create an account but as I'm essence of umbrella was amazing I know this is only a problem if people start creating a new network with home state route for instance and then create empty accounts and then the cleanup if people start with access chris brogan Buddhist then I mean they will never see an empty account right the relic we implement this this will be part of the hard fork so I may we can't retro actively influences other brilliant self and people can start private network with three 3s dragon rules hundreds of empty accounts the only cake yeah but yeah so and personally I think I take that over like over time we should be deprecating support for old rules that's more and more red so like I don't see much human need for supporting people making hard courts with pre spurious dragon rules or sorry perfect people making private angels pretty story straight in rules we even okay so it sounds like then that would just be a clarification at the yellow paper level and an assurance that all the clients are now incompatibility which I believe was fixed during the hard fork around november i guess thanksgiving time I think there was a pre-compiled that was deleted on main that is that correct yeah yeah okay yes a question though uh regarding private network should it be assumed that this the hard fork are dependent on each other I mean it if only her fears dragoness is specified from blocked 0 should assume that all the previous part force also are applied a tough loss and we had a discussion about exact assists with Japan Felix a few days ago is reworking our Genesis handling and what just proposed a lot that's how it will be so awesome as people to the could turn on and off individual soft work but in my opinion the problem that this is that this will open up a huge kind of formed if there's some unforeseen dependency between parts work it could really matter I always open if the information implementation C++ is also assuming strictly ascending cod folks yeah we have a good just something fun it's not critical but it'd be good if some general is not that Oh italic did you meet oh sorry woman okay so it sounds like I don't think this is requiring of an EIP because this was more or less dealt with and the one of the last hard fork so yeah I think everyone my right to say that pretty much everyone's an agreement of how the changes are going to go and it's more I guess at this point if we're all trying to figure out if it's worth it to do backwards compatibility for this if someone wants to pick and choose what previous hard fork previous hard fork changes they want to put in their private network so we kind of more or less saying we don't really want to go that path because it overcomplicates future improvements I'm not a client developer I've been hearing what theater and italic self-love and Chris rather yeah I guess it doesn't matter that much but it would still be nice to clarify that in the yellow paper John updated to the current data okay the implementation okay great title yeah it sounds like the spec is important to be updated out go ahead Peter now as a service so that the only thing I so if we do specify that they can only occur incremental e and you can't cherry pick whatever you want I think the the benefit assess would be easier reasonably being about security of the entire chain okay sounds good so yeah we'll do the update to the yellow paper is there any other comments on this otherwise I think it's pretty much resolved so I will clearly find that in the spear dragon pretty great I'm trying again I think he cut out there at the naegi repeat that one more time ah ok so i will gratify this point in my career dragon pretty quick that i'm trying to hide again oh great ok sounds good the next item is ok that was 45 is the metropolis updates and finding a central location to document eip is going in the metro so in the Gator channel i will repost this but i posted three links and then Casey added a fourth for we're VIPs should go and let me get the fourth one real quick so basically there is a list from parity with in there github PR systems or issue system there's a list from death I believe it's a pull request and then there is a page on the PM repo that has kind of a it was a really old list of all of them so that's an accurate I'll be updating it and then I feel like the one that is the most updated is the blink Casey posted which was the VIPs page accepted a ip's plan for adoption so if everyone can go there it has a list of VIPs ready or that are planned for adoption and are in the process of being implemented so looking at this across the other across the other clients that are implementing this it's mostly the same list does anybody see one that's missing or any comments about the ones that are added I think they've all been accepted in previous calls but we may have to check on that and clarify that in future calls yeah because it looks like I think at least in the case of parity 86 and 96 are not in their list for the Metro release so i was wondering about that if you could comment arcady i'm pretty sure they are you need to the numbers in brackets not yep yep I see ya I because yeah the numbering is weird okay thank you I see ya and then let me just look at gets real quick just to make sure that all of those are correctly and there as well so we have 1 98 one 4098 the pairing precompile returned data okay think they had all of them go ahead kb maybe we'll just add a column to that table with that contains short link state you know to each client full request you know where the the implementation is taking place okay great I guess lastly Jan I think you have a PR or a issue that lists all this right maybe I saw that for something else sorry a setup for what for the metropolis changes so I just the e IPS and their level of implementation per client I don't think so I have no key i set up for you mean Ruby crime uh yeah all right that or Python I just hadn't looked at them know that that's no one's in a zone set up for metropolis I think okay no problem I was just going to check so we could add that link or not okay it's cool any other comments on the list of accepted I peas plan for adoption yeah I was going to mention that you know it helps to use descriptive title in the you know in the co request that people open you know um that specifies the eip because then that title whatever title is used in the in the IP then you know it then goes into the the table and so where the titles were two shorter on the script of like like EFE 86 I took some liberty and and inserted you know Oh what I thought was a more descriptive title okay great yeah like that's a good idea so everyone is doing some of the eip PRS but that's a good tip to help them be a little bit more clear I believe there's so I didn't actually add this to the agenda because I just realized this is still something that needs to be brought up but the there's a list of VIPs under consideration so on a 211 which was the return data size and returned at a copy is still you know being discussed but II ip5 gas usage for return and call what's the status of that Christian and that I guess I forgot if we've talked about it in a previous call or if there is a status on it so my preference would be to replace that by [ __ ] a copy and return to the size but yeah okay so it's not even really ecstatic voice for different opinion love anything ah got it yeah any updates on your opinion metallic or was that kind of related to the previous discussion we had in this meeting my opinion on West Lubbock whether or not so on the eip is under consideration on the readme that 211 is what we discussed earlier another one is e ip5 gas usage for return and call and you I think right away I'm saying that yeah you were more money I mean I I still feel like five is the simpler and more ideal than not been to 11 i mean i'd be willing to go with 211 if it also means that we get rid of static although i think there might also be an even cleaner way to do it five and accomplish the same goal with data call in some other way look basically my main concern now says we should be trying to like minimize off code information as much as possible okay sounds good okay so that's going to still be under discussion then let's try to think a little bit more on that and next I'll cord devs call start to come to a resolution I would recommend just because of the timing for the metropolis things speaking of great yes speaking of which I believe Oh Greg did you have a comment yeah I don't care about opcode inflation per se but I don't have the feeling that this little collection of opcodes is sort of a logically consistent and minimal little phrase yet yeah like it is for me personally off code inflation is maybe not the right word like I can handle off codes but the thing that may be uneasy about return data size is that as also another data structure into the computational space so i just also that that kind of like another sort of you need to mention their complexity in some ways yeah but it can simplify other things right yeah I am I can see that but we have to pull it all together it's something they're sort of unrelated proposals that hasn't been pulled together right yes maybe we need to kind of come up with a few ticks competing alternatives for like how all of these things match with each other and there's clearly interdependence is what it makes sense to have a concentrated call on these issues come home at some point um best seem sensible like a kind of research linking or whatever I mean we could even just have an ongoing in skype chat over in the next two weeks yep yeah that definitely sounds reasonable on another thing so you have an ongoing text discussion and then someone starting calls if needed the other thing is it sounds like part of the way to alleviate the confusion is to start coming up with like a couple of paragraphs of different I kind of see it as you know II I peacebuilding off each other and proposals building off each others so making sure that's all understood a lot of the time when we're talking about these things we're saying you know it's dependent on the rest of these either being implemented or the way we're going to implement some of these other things so getting a clear understanding of that I'm not sure the best way to do that i guess the ongoings skype chat is probably the easiest cool okay so yeah what will do is I will send out a link on git er about the ongoing skype chat related to this I'll just go ahead and set that up between Chris Greg and metallic and then anyone else who wants to conjoin based on that Gator link great there was 0 Vitalik you had mentioned somewhere online that because of those either the price increase or something else I guess we have a little bit more time until the block times are adjusted not actually like again probably run through the math right now again because it changes a literally day by day so the most recent difficulty as you stats us being below i'm not even sure why i'm using these fads I didn't even think east steps was oh yeah he steps is kind of wonky right now I think hold on I'll just use my yellow and node okay 195 trillion so that's even higher than the last time I did this okay and 195 trillion so that means our hash power is 14 trillion then block numbers 3368 795 on page plus percent as such the current line scam and the grip sing again yeah so by the end of june the the walk time is only going to be around nineteen point five seconds by at the end of august it's only going to be able 28.5 seconds so like I think we still have like it's still but basically if we get it out before the end of to you and it's even better and if we get it out before the end of August that's still look less bad okay so what my rep mom my recommendation is probably still like end of June as a kind of normal case target an end of August mr. Ward case bed wine but like basically the conditions that your users would have to go would the end of us living through either case or continue to get better and better okay cool and is that in any way dependent on the price increase or yes okay so in general the difficulty of a block chain is a kind of cereal aging moving average of the price so i would i would say first of all in any the chant the probability is probably look less than ten percent that difficulty will ever go down again like it's almost certainly going to be above 200 so then the question is is is this the top and if they're going to crash back down this twenty eight twenty to thirty in which case I Cassie difficulties topping off and maybe this to get like the 300 range is it going to stay the same as it is now in which case we could see difficulty being in the four to five hundred range is going to still keep going up and potentially like if in the kind of sky-high scenario where at the ram takes over bitcoin entire way we could literally see this such a wait until I've shown you see what let me see what happens if i just multiply a shower the factor of 10 oh yeah so in that extreme case as the end of June the blocks I'm is still 15 seconds and at the end of August it goes up twenty one and only as the end of the year it goes up to those 43 so we basically the better the better we do the more the more time we have i would say in the more kind of in my personal estimation of the kind of 5050 case i can probably run through that right now so that would be difficulty in babies topping off at five hundred billion in maybe middle of the summer or so that would or even just to be fair once they work it for 20 billion that would get us to also 19 seconds at the end of june but then the 19 seconds would keep on going all the way up until the up until the middle of july maybe we should switch our efforts from implementing the vips to pumping the price okay let's get one of your results for exponential work on the related note no there you go does this thinking i think i was just wondering whether or not cause the idea watching her own watch and installing down the block time will also help but think that might be it mmm weird maybe mice it basically looks like the practical thing to do I think it's just like keep our heads down and meet you and see if we can finish this fighting attitude yeah yeah I mean we can always try but one thing i would like to dimension to all other people who are implementing these eat because when you do that defined education system you think about education in there Dave and make test cases police but if they're documented so we can to make sure that they become consensus tests in the actual variants us to foster also who have a good test coverage of this because a lot of changes yeah it's difficult for the military to keep up with all the changes so listening to be a concerted effort that's it right Zulu Hudson oh can you hear me now yeah no yeah my microphone went on mute so no I was saying so Martin when you were talking about that did you mean people should write their aips very specifically in mention edge cases or just no no mms but we need to make sure whenever whenever we reason would during the process of implementing these feet developers need to make sure that all these weird as cases but they come up with that they're submitted so that they become test cases so that all the stuff we learn while implementing it they can benefit the other clients and we don't have any concerns with issues because they make sure they want won't wind up and they're very intensive ostrich okay excellent what is there a formal process or even just an informal process best way to get these to Dimitri or to whoever needs it I don't think there's a formal process the infamous could just sing him or me or anyone and we there's a star channel latarian Delta's there's just more accordance with Florrick also or wind to Vega on Twitter okay yeah I'll talk to him about getting a more concerted effort Peter this is the best that that's no I think one of the problems with this it's a really noble cause one of the problems that I see for kind developers is that for example and modifying or people getting previous works but only made a modification and I found out that we couldn't think that because something we change something but the change the error wasn't kept quote by the virus taxes and then obviously the the no-brainer would have been to just submit a new tax perspective but the problem is that it's so complicated and messy to create a new such as nobody with others so yeah probably a long term solution or long term suggestion from my part would be if we could somehow create small tool that allows a simple way to make that so that I know that this is my corner case so that I can somehow transform that imp yourself easily without having to manually create everything Baltimore schools yeah you're totally right bitter end up as that's something that should be but in the meantime I mean you I wasn't meaning that everyone needs to submit the actual test cases just documents the scenarios or the correct cases and reprieve from the last hard work I think we set up one of those particles we just type the cases of this type of time nessa just something like that short description verbal description so then Demetria or someone else to take it over and make an actual education out of it that's one [ __ ] look okay sounds good yep and I think over time they'll be more like a more clean process like the kind Peters referring to so yeah I'm sure Dimitri would be very happy with that suggestion okay so any other comments on that just a short comment exok already relatives that I call by revert solution it's a comment on the younger protocol oh yeah and it's also a github gist and in this chat in this chat room we're currently in damn Alex you work fast okay so yeah I think that's actually all the agenda items let me just double check but was there anything else from anybody yeah no I think this is good what we'll do is for the yeah the last item i guess was just where we're going to put all the metropolis stuff where it will use the readme page on AI pee so if you just go to the e ip's repo it's the first page on there so it'll say under consideration or accepted and that's what we'll go with for now and yeah I'm just a reminder if you all have any IPS you want to throw in please add them to the agenda I usually try to set that up at least a week before I'll start doing it right after meetings so and I'll release the audience some notes on this sometime later today hopefully so yep good meeting everybody I see y'all next time zoom zoom like there's your role all right
