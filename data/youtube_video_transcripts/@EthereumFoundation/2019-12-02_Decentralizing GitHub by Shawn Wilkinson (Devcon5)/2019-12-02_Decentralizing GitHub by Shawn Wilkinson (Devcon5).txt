[Applause] all right hello everybody my name is Shawn founder of storage and we're talking today about decentralizing github so how many people raise your hand you get up it's raised me right okay great great tool great platform now imagine one day you wake up you have a nice cup of tea or coffee and you log in and your account has been banned get help you can't access any of your repositories you can't download any of your code it's this all gone and there's nothing you can do this is not a hypothetical situation for some people in 2019 people in Korea Syria and Iran developers just half their accounts pop as you know github got acquired by Microsoft I got some some lawyers got bored they figure what are we gonna do today we can't work you know commercially with these countries due to sanction will cause and they interpret that okay let's ban all these users in these countries so such a great not that great there's other examples of this I 2014 Russia and I posted something on get out of that Russian and lack so biggest family site obviously they brought back but for a week or so people worked at developers weren't able to access give up we have many other examples 2015-16 2017 2018 2019 where for whatever reason or whatever problem happen get help goes down for hours today so this sounds like the familiar problem in the industry that we're trying to deal with centralization right and you know github just has a lot of control over the spot form that we use and we really depend on to build out these next gen applications and that's nothing again there's a lot of concerns by many people like intimidated that you know Microsoft will do what they did with LinkedIn and one day you will wake up and we have paid Walter to get out so I think we really this is a problem like first this happens to somebody else but it can happen to any of us and so we need to act now we need to do something about this we need to decentralize get not so how should we go about that what I think we should go about it this way since not all of you all in its entire entirety download all the repositories and sick it in a decentralized platform it decentralized and slow so that it get up goes down or they decide to our maternity blog accounts and accounts at least you can get your cup and take it somewhere else I get so I know this process last couple of months we found there's a cool product called get get archive or which essentially catches all the public metadata and actions that people probably do whenever so from there you can kind of get a list of pretty much any with anyone who's been active on github since 2015 and then you can hopefully get huh baby I to get all the public repositories and we can download them and to maybe centralized data stored about quantum storage and then we can make this accessible to many people to get in the case that people lose access to their repositories on github or by Walkman or github goes down we can get access to that's the same so the manimals like get backup or all you do is you put in your genome username you hit sync and you will back it up and swear it on storage and then make that accessible both through our platform and then we're also looking at making it accessible through things like IP address so this website has never been still I get to do so this day is way today today we got only about 300,000 repositories we're storing about 30 terabytes of it and we're talking about 50,000 users so this is just how much day we've dominated pretty much this week so the pace at which we're accelerating and that money game is growing at an increasing pace overall yup and these two million users download already in the year so I encourage you to jump on your phone or your laptop then try it out just all you have to do is when you're getting up username and it sink and we'll back that up for you next time github decides to do something like man users arbitrarily and not give them access to their code at least now we have a backup option so thanks for listening [Applause]
