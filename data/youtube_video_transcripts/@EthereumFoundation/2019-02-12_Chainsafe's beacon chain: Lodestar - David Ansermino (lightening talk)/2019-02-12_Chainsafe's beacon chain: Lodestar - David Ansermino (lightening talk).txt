so it's called on the start it is an invitation of the beacon chain at this point ultimately we're looking at building like potentially a light note a full moon so to use the backgrounds we have one team member who was particularly interested in taking part in the whole like hearing 2.0 revolution advancement whatever and so she had just kind of like started this on the side and had some friends helping her and we quickly realized that this was going to be a huge thing and hopped on it and would be trying to put some more development hours until we get more people involved get some funding and make this real project so let's start with JavaScript why can't the script so I don't if you guys know what etherion JSP M is it's essentially a JavaScript application of the EPM and it's very interesting because it's not a production level implication but it's arguably one of the more frequently used by developers if you're running like ganache or even remix or something like that like you're still interact with JavaScript and ultimately it's the JavaScript VMs running the background so the whole kind of aetherium javascript world is largely focused on development to it and so we're hoping to kind of be that iteration of the B key chain so we're comprised a few components here we've got the main lodestar libo kind of where the main chain lies either if you guys looked at the easy to prospect but there's kind of a few elements to it so also started implementing sitting serialize which is just a serialization library and that's pretty much good to go one thing to know is the spec is constantly changing so we're like constantly playing catch-up so we were up-to-date and now I think we'll fall behind we're also implementing Els signatures javascript and some gossip pops up so I mentioned JavaScript really what we're trying to do actually we're kind of like torn on this is to a typescript recommendation so for those of you who are familiar typescript is essentially a transpiler that allows you to add types to JavaScript so basically take what you write converts it down to regular javascript of all your type checks and other useful things so we've been playing around with it I think ultimately for the main implementation it makes sense obviously with types you've got a little bit of security guarantees but one of the big things that we're kind of I'm personally having a lot of eternal levels around is in the spec sheet they're very specific about integer sizing so in 8 and 16 etc and some really bizarre ones like in 20 I think and you know does typescript actually makes sense to enforce those types that's one thing that would be kind of playing around with if anybody here is god and typescript I'd love to talk to you but this library here the fixed size number of typescript is kind of our first attempt at maybe looking at what benefits that could provide us ultimately the texture key just aren't really doing type validation so you you don't really get all the normal games you wouldn't language like rust or C or whatever so yeah definitely been read in a sensitive please come talk to me this is also an open call for contribution we are very driven to make this an open community source project so if anybody is interested in taking part we are very happy to onboard you we have the getter channel where you can chat with us and ultimately like we're just looking making this any fun but successful price so if anybody has an interest please do chip that's pretty much all I have to say we're still very much in development phases we recently got some large funding from a angel investor I guess you call them so yeah any questions
