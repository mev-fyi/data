[Applause] today topic how do we make well as secure as much change so before I go into application let's remind will be hundred and end up here how many security web apps and connect web and what energy so what was very pretty much talking as far as much progress so we spend on JavaScript context okay so then you can access it was Polina stop well every time and then continue from there we have me confused interceptions functional pattern user don't know there sighing so what we do right here says if you're following us a transaction is kind of comprehendible and then with a lot of variation of this wonders what we do we like for us now we have the tokens that are more complicated than traditionally are see we have competitive they actually have color the usual eyes I saw a high special and it's what we do it hard code them into the browser so this is how we ended up here so this is what I call this process everything the property and solving immediately within the most ready solution voice recording the design space so it's like there's somewhere a merest accident somewhere else it is our topic is hearing the better way which is an outward probably learn how to solve so the problem what test people wants to because Webster is a centralized blockchain connected and people wants to see the truth he wants to see which bit of information on what is actually under my cot witness they have been to trust the way the other thing is operability it's quite important because traditionally whether what system is a giant and nobody help you centralize components but users expectation is to buy one serving a level of service that can be provided by the Hollywood is decentralized components work together and then we have the policy that fewer users are always active expecting that Westar is a new product but something that the user is able to catch when they want to do without giving away their parasites haha and then finally you have security which means you know together we have only the custodian of their asset because to know what they are doing with their pet the Sun concession there's a new transaction which we have any other questions detective they are not attending to be giving away now given this is that werster is going to solve I was nervous to analyze how well it's a public assault this is one example I imagined it is called teaching in the garden what it does is it draws property if you have a property at any point then he was to a garden network that's all still on it as a tokenized version of hello world they need to see a family in some complex now traditionally earning money this region this is hard to awakes use request data and web service JavaScript and America and these tiles finish name and our end users browser search access in general get information on the total SS in smartphones that functions getting the color 50 painting is not hat and roll it a really nice now let's look at trusting opportunity promising security so stick it was first how does you know that the Kentucky team is actually rendered using the data but this quantity all whether or not the the web server is doing that in JavaScript to inquire get information and not the balance of the entire contract for another and then we offer ability so if in this case it has is duty to they're the new one is sometimes that players flying events so I suppose could be keeping a daily functions like this you get is that they made a function of X it is here is if you have a them then how do you know this moving part of the centralized components how do we know if the website has updated our code to do this functions that's it all fertility and then we have privacy so apparently in charge and what's that gets the data from the blockchain and rendered on web but what is there is a now another arrow coming from this website which things back that have to do a self so the user doesn't know how much what serves what says what I can learn as well and then we have the final the security issue issues influence and transaction essentially transaction is assembled by a call you don't know who wrote of an amount of trust so in fact it was this open area that this model is move on this model user request data from the web server what somebody's newsletters about JavaScript I'm sure the best users in here address user human then gives the him address to the server and certain can go look at the kitten data results there's no need for the users and have had access to be very watchable if user doesn't have access to learn about channel how does user know any informations true in fact you can produce this in with just the picture a screenshot of the kitten sitting on the family pattern and the user but have no way to know if this is his kitchen table not so the solution would be in this very simple example is to build a long time nothing is an area secured area in an open space that it's used however but independent on the web so officially anomaly I probably look like this so normally just look like it in front of others so if user move mouse over this type which shows that there's our wine Enclave on the web then this clicking is highlighted so you don't know this palette omission is an outlier this is salt from watching truth so with this boundary construct the partner will be like this the website request through healthy team this time the what does not wasn't enough provide direct instructions that have got this information is in that meditative hold resonance secure complain and secure college from patrons dream sign code provided by retro huge of trustees forces that a cutie privacy is protected here because he does not ask for anything so asking you the truth which pretty much familiar to know whatever no need to know now you haven't you and what is the color that was haven't they asked doesn't even talk bankrupt and the kitchen the clean side Nicole reading the security unveiled provide information then recover and this week post with a security company so that's really listening exit game first so the user access parity it doesn't sacrifice anything so user knows insecure today because participated so that we've got trust and then then it opportunity if the Kentucky team is also a very sleek is okay and we can update their zone very cold to manage security none table was happy medium because what's that only care about what we regard as what's up hours or keeping garden and then get pretty as I demonstrated like you are sparking as you give you names idea to tell you locality security Ontario has interprets protect me forever and then we will get security said if any transaction has to be signed it is started for me but asking certain things to be done and that action is performed in gunplay as actually following the route is permissible so this will separate into a common web now if you ran this technology you need a way to deliver clean signed code to the security company and that's the technology we have been working on in spirit what it does is it has tokenization like many positions and things what you are seeing doesn't come home Allegra attributes like how to get colors eye color already tea and then in their transactions that what transactions are possibility anything comment can and secured rezoning like what kind of information is accept and secure Enclave which website whether or not attestations will help under Montana can be forwarded to the cyber security and then we have permits so we have cars cars a visual renderable pattern so if I have a key card much too short in email and then we have very actions actions other things that perceptions users can compile for this program and understand believes this actions might not entirely provided our killer for example if you send them somewhere my dear let's clarify history and provided better addition contractor product by DIRECTV then you has a collateralizing contract author can provide an action that is apply word to use its best actually but finally you have the signatures the reason I put water person shows up here is because your might need it there might be multiple source of trust in it so just as I was explained the kitty is drawn in with code assignment by echo to hit him but collateralization of Nikita as an action that can be done in teams that might be signed by someone else so this will be basically a file structure top expert so given we have a brief understanding of what we could solve the problem I'd like to move forward to show you a little word open house workers will be applied that's going to be more complicated as two days and same to me imagine with me that you a token that represents Ankara will show you get the token to my car I'd imagine that you have insured part which is another fulfillment you get when you pay the insurance together the department and here on this interface there are multiple tokens of highlighted ones the trust fund is messed up but it really sure about equity and religion they don't make them perfect this is the character how did it end up later well let's imagine with this new insurance token what you can do with it imagine a business or car next door actually there's actually a similarly if that allows you to enter car be rented by strangers and you just get a dollar a day when you come into your pocket automatically when a car is modified sell for you that's that's that idea and in order to do this service you need to have is we need a shortcut so the insurance token would be the enabler of this new shake country style and when you use the insurance token for this new chain economy we had a rental car list important which which is the source of revenue that comes to you from time to time I represent is that you have salsify if you want to live to a secure Anatomy it's not a story we'll just imagine that this is possible to have a static for car got stolen with other students so the process will look at this first this is serious business what time you say do actually only insurance now the work that was to learn something and the Conclave has to paly say that okay actually I can do a witness Commission this is my policy destination and then once that goes to the back of the website and ask me if you know if this policy as a cover or own virus which is condition and it's not conscious and every list this is one of the infusion where the user behind security Enclave and the website using there's their own own establish trust between each other so you know we don't previously in the car kitchen garden the website that we may need to access the third option is alive about having that kitten is and to this point behind is that visual trust and the website was an information okay send send a transaction to get your car distant and here kiss telescope this telescope is a new one this telescope is issued by connects polish a company company and it contains the rules how to get a transaction of the sample transaction to get your rental car disdainfully so what we have now is in the security unplayed the environment in which evolutionary signatures good is usually from time next or bottom and many we acquired didn't know that actually is the total missionary from comfort zone that were in toast is talking spiritual and the sermon that will come magazine distance will be genuine and not devote as awkward and the user will get this which is a transaction losers in the same sense that we're talking I'm going to lose by transaction we're talking about would use intersection characteristics dependency and what kind of again which is car rental when a car is Tito and it's green great color because doesn't exist yet it's created on the moment accessible transaction so this is what generated from the security on trade and not by website what has me to say that leads to changes a transaction and what I'm telling you and hello word here we had beautiful team here in the security vampire we have insurance I totally this is Hollywood so yeah what do you say security on a place that's on a physical device without software I should use itself that concept okay so where is that software running is in the users browser so they are never this much relevant because we will have a 1 in it even when it isn't money power will it to have this thing but normally you mean a new kind of processor maybe yeah so this is the focus so arts you create a browser that competes with brain it's a new browser it's got a security Enclave running in software how do you trust the hardware so this is a different level I think we may be great to the security on the play actually events in the rules that he was model is that we validate but I think this is them something we can progress to our good friend so actually this is hot oven script boost all security on their own web decentralized web 3 so we have more time for question and we got a bunch of questions the other question has not occurred and the usual has user no right as so they're kind of talk of you assumptions being five years so for example most contributors computer movie a was based on idea that we don't have physical advice and I should personally store it what if you have version windows that show you everything so the assumption is the user have capacity to security advice but even with the suction that like this and relaxed assumption own security models do not help so we need new security token script I still with the same license agreement yes token script open source ok this is some token scooped up always hungry it's Paschal icing and there's a tech knowledge that is being standardized by if M information and we're in the process sometimes is are submitting each other to since then there is this oasis in our nation we should producers produced open document format in order of office so tell me something anything I hope I get guests and vice versa the second question what's the current status or like can we already start using it yes a director Cory was also discouraged odd however so though the script works in with a concept for a context so let's say the token mean look differently it is no.18 what if it's a better or token that's the current okay you look differently if you are the poor in many different contexts result token vendor differently by dream logic so currently they are anyways haulage company and open source of what has been helpful but it only worked with one context which is for wallet context so to make it really hard welcome to a secure Enclave in the browser this is something looking at promoting progress as a context based concept concept because we have one major cat good question okay assume of the public or private key pairs and you are specific does it have to be like a JSON blob or can be a Harvard wallet or that kind of interact with the keys or is it just better mousetrap okay so if you want to kind of find another layer behind open script let's say every time the transaction is going to be signed assigning doesn't happen means in so I kept thoroughly at device that's something a little different here different layout yeah the Thomas put that we take care of this layer could be careful about this layer alright so yeah thank you very much [Applause]
