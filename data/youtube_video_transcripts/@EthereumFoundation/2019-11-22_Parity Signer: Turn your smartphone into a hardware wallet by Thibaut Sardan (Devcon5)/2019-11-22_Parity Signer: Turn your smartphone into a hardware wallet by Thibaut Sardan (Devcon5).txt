[Applause] until oh and I were preparing technologies and today I'll talk about great designer it's super quick at the beginning of the presentation because these are things you probably know and are finished all right here so this whole to the basics talk about the basics are gonna come from a message to an executed transaction on a rope chain so you have a message very transaction you sign it with your private key and then you send it somehow to the growth chain this private key is the point right if you lose it of someone gets access to it that's game over so what do people store their private Kim most of the time or sometimes I suspect in the days it was securely encrypted on adjacent for instance we are a password you could use it on my order for instance but the thing is you have to give kind of quality because they prove this is Jason and then you give sorry your password so a problem is if my echo what it get higher because it's a website it's actually a large security threat well then game or what you could do is and that's much better because metal mask is not exactly a software on your secure and it's not exactly a website use minimis and Indian that's kind of the same right you can give you private key to minimize and minimis or some reason gets hot QT she gets night because the extension can be you know they are just updated automatically or we were talking about the dependency of meta muskies is happening basically you came over again so what you can do again is used for instance my crypto are pretty better which is a desktop application but in the end you can also give you priority to those those softwares and even if this is on desktop and it's maybe a bit harder to get half on your desktop if the whole let's say Windows or Linux or Mac gets hacked and you're getting over again so what people do to have like kind of the highest security today a one that is security why being able to use it when they keep this high security is just you know take your name on it and put it somewhere it's super super safe it's just you cannot use it more at so it doesn't make sense so people use for instance a treasurer and they use it together with an online application so in the middle of the expander and you create a transaction online with this online software you sending to the what else you sign it on to other work and then send it to the regime that verifies the signature so this guy gets hacked it will eventually send a transaction but you can check it right on the treasure and or words and I swear stinks just all which could eventually happen is that the transaction that I sent perfectly okay you're gonna just you know silence and then they somehow try to trick or change the message as you probably know this stuff work right because you cannot change the message that hasn't been signed without the go changin rejected so the mochi is this piece of hardware will have the key will sign and this is the key part break you want to get these guys super super safe so we thought wouldn't it be cool if there was enough that we turn an old smartphone into a harbor worth it because everybody on many people have an old smartphone right that is laying around they're not using it and why the whole point is you wanna have you know world war it's aria it's off right and you want a way to sign you to sign your transaction okay we should use a opponents I'm quite close to that so that's why you created already signer so this is how it looks like and what does it do you can create accounts can recover accounts you can sign transaction you can sign messages all right so this is supposed to be offering all the time so it's mainly not the way the Samsung is going to your form read but it's the same you should not use you're not one that use every day you should actually said that you should encrypt it you should turn airplane mode and never turn it on again and never to a computer so I always work a little demo on the right our header on the left are very designer with an upright board so what I do is I create an account for instance on ethereum and so yeah I can choose from yeah if it comes I can choose from different I have to come that's pretty fun that's how I look well here there's one that looks like a little pasta that's pretty corn when I pick this one and I'm going to give it a name it cetera on the right again this is on on the right there's a sink water that is offline and ready to send some transactions so on the Left I gave you know I paid account so I'm demonic I put a pin of course because you want to you know secure it somehow someone gets all of your phone that is all right and on the right what I'm going to do is I'm going to import this account that has been created okay so I can just connect the left i'ma show this 1202 my pc basically to the right hand of the pc just give the name right no need to assign to to put any any password whatever because anyway it's it's only four days of life now stand already stone is some money to this account and I'm just going to show you how we gonna send money from the account so now from this account that is offline I will send money to another account so I'm going to show you how to sign a transaction so from there and that is all crying just gonna say stand in this on the right is the transaction that needs to be signed right it's right move inside so on the left on the off Brian we will expand this transaction from my PC then I'm going to review it on a nice screen that is a smartphone screen right so it pretty nice I can see everything I can just sign it by typing my my pin and then I'm going to show the sign transactions on the net it's the same transaction that have addressed economy when super quick but just understand with my with my webcam and that's right so behind the scene which we didn't create me that we have a graphic libraries which in universe everything's makes work offline so you will not never get online with your phone the priority number is close to the just to be super clear millions of euros just confuse this what's next want to use biometric encryption dynamic network we can talk about it you can get on the App Store on the average or we have an educated 90k on nuclear energy [Applause] you
