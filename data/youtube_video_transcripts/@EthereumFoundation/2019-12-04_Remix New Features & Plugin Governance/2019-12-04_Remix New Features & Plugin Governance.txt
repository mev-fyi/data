[Applause] so we have the special session today and coming to this water so basically I think that could also want times for us to explain to you and share with you people we met him and which projects basically two updates and the six that last year we met kind of lots of people we are this release planning initiative in this been available as it was goods the possibilities to just make me the proper and walk with routines so this is kind of this workshop is kind of for used to the bit on the release begin but we also worked a lot with to do it him for having like a desktop application and we are also some nice talk Christian which is just so they're so that I work with he runs a widow with kitchen today so well to first quick introduction [Music] so we go run just a quick introduction on the remix but I guess some of you didn't know it's all legit so with who here or he used it's dangerous yeah because that good sweat so then Miami's here is possible to reach him and basically we work with religion for exist text of app and it was a good opportunity to see how we can integrate these degrees so for a bit like a better death of the elements so we talked about that then is not here so I think you might have already talked about this in the previous workshop everything is about publishing data and source code to AP offense and then the design needs so person we talk about how we plant of this beautiful artists confronted a fire I think that's be steps that we have to reach work then yeah yeah the famous how to believe it in five years exact no fun so basically it's kind of it's very easy now to do but billions and then I want to share with you how to do that and how now easy to develop and test equipment [Music] so moving towards the plugins of a walk would like to present to you too princess whatever ping with with developers so we have the sofa test begins matter what you know about Socrates it's basic music is not on each other and we have now revealed that death can use for writing so cut as code and for testing needs and for the bring needs and for basically doing work and then when since four months we are also not working on workshops and we have now cooking which can be used for trading and for doing work for so this award will explain us it means what is he speaking and then how this plug-in can be kind of integrated insight or the educational staff that we are doing good so and then we have wisdom session with nice people that are here now thanks for coming of stooping gently I understand Felipe's lung and soon economy s : sunspot is on the fear and yoga I also basically we are disproving initiative the walk which is called subsidized not so we are decided in which people can get in and which couldn't get out and we are positing the cold and basically we are maintaining everything and we don't want to do that for long so we want to find a way to centralize this so the question is should we keep it social I should summarize it and how all the food and takes a bunch of questions in to answer that so yeah we try to save us maybe one monsters day - thanks so 22 the first box yes oh who does not know babies at all okay sweetie thanks - lets into super important and yeah so is reading [Music] [Music] everyone here whoa yes jack hey everyone so my name is Ryan I'm probably the grid team create as a new project this year we were working on Mist and Critias kind of an evolution and the developer experience so we like to think of grid as bringing a dream to your OS and what we wanted to do is with all these kind of CLI based apps build on a unified us that offers rely on to run with their name tools and nodes that make things a little easier I think we've all experienced between running together and Perry you like lies are different it was out to turn or the documentation so this is kind of hobbies yeah suppose that so when you start grid it starts as a menu bar app if you don't have installed any of the plugins when you turn on there's a one-click start that deadlines the release this is what grid looks like the about page starts with links to documentation and information about the plugin we have a virgin list that were really excited about that helps you kind of switch between different versions that we quickly can we turn it around to speaker maybe turn around rather extreme back the whole good I scan somewhere else yeah I could talk to a better planet so so with grid we tried to build like sensible defaults some kind of the settings page that we went through it helps you kind of understand the kind of range of the features and functionality and when you turn it on this is the terminal console output all in place and then the top we have a note indicator that kind of tells you where your note is the singing status with walk garage can be like a visualization of where app so I'd like to think of grid kind of that makes between like an app store and a launch pad meaning app stores around discovery securely and installing their way where things come from a co-chair checks on deserve or proper launch pad easy to configure is your friend shouldn't run all that get one place in one home the ecosystems evolve a lot you know we started with just a few different types of nodes and clients and now there's bus and bus so group is based around the plugins as a plugin architecture and you know is there something but as a pre do kind of these are all the types of things that we are trying to bring into one unified interface it's make kind of the developer experience easier more inviting these are some of the plugins we have now and now I'll do a little demonstration of how Corinne can make working with remix a lot easier so we actually initially developed remix as a grid map but then when they want to develop their own your neck standalone app without a really great way to kind of show they drop ability so Ingrid down here for this demo we're using the flag's dev to connect remix to a created again Devin since opening the RPC API and then also opening up the with this here working up the debug set of n points so we can step through it and see turn on death we're also going to turn on ifs because the best innovations secured its ready so our both grid was to you know just click mean switches is a lot easier than going to the terminal and remembering kind of preoccupation remembering all the things you have to configure with grid everything's kind of saved so on your previous stages opening back up in your your that your app so this is the remix that's not that it's you know electron bass and it's really a great time to remix kind of in a format where you open on your desktop so first I'll show deploying this contract the example ballot contract to the developer instance of gap that we started in grid [Music] [Music] they're coming [Music] [Music] sorry [Music] yes great [Music] [Music] great Wow so now I'll show how you can so we started get one of the settings head was to open up the RPC API so there we went three provider to connect to the default port a level five I'm connected and then if we were to deploy contract here I've went through as we go back to grid in the terminal here so I might've walk with that transaction [Music] and show the debug delegate but down the bottom here so here you can see remix miss debugging mode never taught me to get and you can walk through the code and see the test reach that's exciting and then kind of as a last step if you wanted to publish your contract details on I'd get us here lisanna confess right now the way the app is set up is a totally change the impurity gateways the IP of the server held at the Berlin office and also if you're running a local node it'll closer to so now if we go to show that it's now being hosted on my local note that I've started with grid [Music] so what this shows here is that in your local references of your hashes it has the contracting us so yep that's great who takes so much time in so now we take a look at how this complex of a fire can not really yeah long enough just yes you just use the publisher on this one right the things it's a tiny button but it's part of the big mission the big mission is to military's happy because because almost four years ago he the first thing he did in the air space was developing a feature for this ability compiler that nobody sees and I want to change that I'll switch [Music] that browser so this is a condensed version of a longer talk I [Music] they're all there what specialty eleven skip some stuff here and so when do you are using meta mascar anew to confirm a transaction Society means action it shows a screen like that it's terrible it has been planned from the very beginning to show something very different here but as I said this happened so you know whatever I started right don't you think it's terrible because these are the reasons why it's terrible [Music] okay and so the way to change this is if I could be to date and this is one of the things that are published in remix when you click on this publish activist publish unsworn and it has been a feature acidity since here for seven and it's mostly unused as I said and so if you take a look at the contract bytecode and the end of the deployment I could always contains this mutant attached it's not at the end here because that's not the point right now that's the created by product which also contains the and with you so this is a saucy board encoded data and if you decode it because it to disappear so so it contains a swarm hash and the word of the solidity compiler by underneath word kind of bite encoded to first by this tomato where the second participant minor version the third byte is the patch version so only looking at the back code you already know what the solidity version used to compile this once but more important is the this swarm hash we have here in the future this will also be an IVFs hash but currently we're using spoon and if you follow this hash to define it hashes from you get the so-called metadata and it's the forward of the compiler the language used it contains the full ABI of the contract it contains the developer documentation and it called and contains the user documentation also known as if you natural language specification that spec and this is an example where ya contrivance ownership I think it's from from Mina's and the documentation says renouncing to ownership will leave the forest without so it tells you what the function does if you call it and that is the string that has to be shown to the user when they and the a/b is also there allows you to decode so to take this long X string and decode into values that make sense to you or they see more namely all the things you need to have to recompile the small contract all the settings that we are going to go into the compiler but it was run and also hashes to responsibly so the educast swarm hash and the idea and and I so the problem is that we have all this data it is cross-linked but the problem is it is not a greater than people who do not publish it and even if they publish it for example using this lovely remix tops to small published effectiveness it will not stay there because Forman IVFs are not there yet to keep quiet and because of that I want to start an initiative to create a service that just keeps those files yeah one IP is s so all the source codes that are correspond to deploy contract on the pool and once you have that service and once this data is available you can run this tiny script here and you don't see that as good as tiny bilities and when it runs you give it the address of a small contract that's the first text string and the second text string are the parameters that are for example nice and then in it goes it first retrieves the byte code from the byte code it retrieves this metadata hash then it retrieves the actual we delete a file from swarm and in that file there are ivf essence form links to the source code it retrieves the source code and then it downloads the matching compiler that was used when this conflict was compiled and recompile everything checks that it results in exactly the same byte code and then it takes a look at the data that is present as the second string here and looks up the function that is caught in the knots back at the API and tells your one and yeah so this is the service fully unrelated to everything will be fun and I hope we can get to a situation where for example me Tomas and of course all other wallets to look like the one on the left here but rather on the right for you when you see which function you're calling and what we do well I have some so this needs the cooperation between people who are writing different tools people who are working on wallets and people are working on projects powers and if you look at somewhere else if you want to help working on this service that publishes stuff because I have a question which is what the information that so let's stop talking about saving summer eggs with the new interface so I hope you like me on Facebook yes and you have a preview of the new logo of permits by the web with released desktop service crowded right you and today of food here on Gilligan's routine remix already great so for those buttons I just want to take 5 minutes to show you how easy it is to actually get openings I will permit so I just want to be sure to user me again yeah perfect right so I want to account to show you I'm doing it the right way so local storage ok there are actually everything here in my browser you ok have a clean workspace ok notice your files I will stop ruining the clock and after 5 minutes of running the computer ok so just letting you last time and if I fail only okay okay let's go so clicking on remix work inside nine friends so basically what you need is in indexof and at index that HTML file so let's create it and you can try to do it at the same fast as you want I just created a techno - team member because I just to calibrate so what I'm going to do now I'm going to go on and it'll turn from green explaining which is the library we built to interact with minutes so we have an NPM package but for the sex of the most sake of the demonstration I'm going to use a CDN so here we'll pass the CDN or create a strict and come back to the documentation and from here it's say that I need to create what we call clients basically class is going to call to talk from the a friend to release ie so I'm doing that yeah and then I'll pay to create a call say hello so my opinion is basically going to get rich by system and display hello world because that's the easiest way to do so for that I'm going to look at the documentation again so if you're not everything that you need to know this and show you all the native plugins FX possible so here we start approach should I use to write something come on that is wedding else find a job okay let's go so I go there and you have all the methods that are exposed I will ask you this time so first I need to wait that the client is actually loaded and then I will do clients the call this is to call the client manager and then here I'll keep the method which is set file file is going to be inside brother / parent attend that person so the held of texting is going to say hello world and then I'm going to do the same and just change the file so we can see right switch pile you know perfect and now I just need a button to trigger the function and by default to inject and inject disrupt so just for you to know you don't even know need to because not every place to look the same so just say say hello so now I will run and Jake's life server go back to remix here inside five manager I can connect to local plugin guy to the name of the plug-in cavities say hello this is the display name sale yeah that's right isn't right and I say hello with a boost right seem a click here ask me because it spices that you don't want to give access to everything here I want to accept it tells me and accept it down but it is yeah oh sorry yeah yeah yeah now I have something firm that this one I was working on it because that's time okay so I really wanted to show you how easy it is to connect this of course this is a hello world okay you can use whatever friend or if you want we have example with react view and Ronnie tournament whatever you want for example you can enjoy some for you to show you about how it works and also with this plug-in you can call so this is like all documentation but all those are exposed by default and we also have a new way which is like external API is for example we have these three bucks plugins he'll diarrhea and expose all the free box interface directly inside image so even your plugins can extend the reliefs API in this kind of way and I want to talk a little bit about this project so everything about this learning engine that we are building and you say that it's actually a layer of chocolate eet so this is how it works right now your brain excit that front side and then you can click implement two months into that type of things but what we really want to do that's anyone in the project that's want to build decentralized petition on id plain' use actually this plug-in engine and we made everything possible so that any projects that add a web view because it's your iPhone's can create integrate Rama's engine and we want to make a phone call to anyone that wants to try to use this plug-in engine please come to us so like that if you get applicants it not going to work onion rings it's going to work on all the applications that are running this plug-in engine but cheaper so that was the first step I'm application layer but we want also to be able to align it make it a layer because if if you have what is there like a lot right so what we want to do is we don't want the plugin develop products that I just want to nitrogen to work with with a mask or two with this wallet and specific remove them just to say that I want to work with out when it and then it's up to the user to choose which one they want to use and that we are working on a common a API in common interface so that it's it should be like totally agnostic for the user when they are parallel plugins if they want to integrate but what I think that's so yeah year that you can of course use mathematics but you produce also whatever or extra ones and this is our next step and we really appreciate any project of standardization of interfaces because we won't be able to accept a lot of France plugins and try to make it as a interoperable as possible so thank you and now I think this is supported cooking so please [Music] [Music] hi guys zippy and are not happy with the worship part later on today the idea is the showcase over this plugin this amazing guys to help create the surface of limitation and so and we brought it to remix so you can have a play with it basically the idea is to make this and creation and the verification part as easy as possible so you as submitted them or that is a familiar physique is not seen that can use this tested on the remix plugin so basically willing to take a look at the user perspective here you wrote what do you do and you actually write high level code you can follow that code and what you get is a set of condition sort of like okay next we can have two steps either set up a computer goodness but in this demo we're going towards setup we generate the screw and a rotation key and then from the verification key you get the verification smart contract that we are going to deploy jóska p.m. or inside the remix and on the other side we can create the witness from classic dope and so on but I'll show you that also for those who want to track just open remix so you can we can test together [Music] it's really hard I'm Trent okay so basically what we are going to do going into Act two or three plugins first one is a catalyst the second one is Samantha Kampala and the third one is annoyed so now when we activate this plugin we are going to show you a simple example so we are going to click on example one except old three response from us so basically I probably give up my kidney wait I thought it's okay so if you we have an example of what this code does is actually pretty pretty simple you see this code okay from us so we have two fields right field a and public field E private the public will be important later on we will say what that means but basically the result is if a times a equals B then it's one else is zero so basically Y squared is equal to B and we'll see if that is true or not or that is zero or so basically the first step as we mentioned before is the compilation so from this high level well set of conditions against use the compile you can tense which we can compete up a table or download it if you want to use it offline this version is also compatible to see see a lot too you can take this is what you generator here and and move it to the CLI once we did this compilation we got this this plugin code what will soon as next is the setup I won't get into too much details master because I just want to show high overview that we can later talk about what each said that what is that I would say that will create its two keys verification and probing keep going to that run that path and here we can see that we gained two keys that is proving a verification that we are going to use later on so on this center part we have generated that and the next step in this if I'm going to find just up beyond so it's really just just to that and on the next part we are going to generate the submit the contract from this very Park I'm going to use a diversion to because it's the latest version and server this is moving towards that so we are going to use that and we are going to do the export must be just that here is will create that select the contract that we can employ and then very quietly this is an average contract and what we are going to talk about now is this variable transaction because it's important so basically here we've generated that a contract of magnitude to deploy and we are going to send approved and to you ends to that folder so input parameters and proof itself so let's deploy that doesn't suit us personal pilot of course I did and while it is one of the records employed inside Joseph's media is this the fuss where your is this okay so basically we are going to take this contract verified and deploy it here so here we have just one punch to verify from section where we are going to input some stuff that we are going to generate in the next step so basically just recap quickly we have this high level code which we compile we run the setup which generated porygon a verification key and from verification key with expert verified we gain the smart contract which we deployed in our JavaScript premium and now we are going to do this spot on the gun so basically on this path compute witness does but what it does is basically from this input arguments it generate as the field that you can input values inside here and as we can see is a private field so prideful a is private and that would be important because of the privacy feature of the CGS times that in the next step we'll see we'll see how so basically we'll say can someone give me an example of which number square is some other number 460 and we are going to generate the proof no that's we are going to use there but first let's open up that proof here and we get we get something like this so Zeke is nice works that that way that this is three points are elliptic curve points or zs9 em these are the Indians inside as we have seen of the computed witness here okay this may be a bug itself also so basic equipment we can see in the inputs what we have here is only them which is 16 this be part and we have one which is the result of the function but we don't have 4 anywhere why because it's a private privacy feature over this of the zk stops so basically we don't have a show the private fields in this proof to be able to verify the producer so basically that's it and now we are going to take the general proof copy those parameters here we go down there to because people and it's as true so we managed to verify so basically that's the short flow at high overview over what would happen if for example if we did this so 4 times 4 times 4 is 16 but what we say what will be said that is 9 what will happen we can compute witness we can generate the proof let's then again copy the parameters and let's verify that no sanctions let's wait a bit to show you here on this yeah it takes a lot of time but basically now we will again verify that it's true but what is actually true we're very fine as we pick it up in this excel determine the four times four and nine as result is not so basically we again verify that we know the private so basically even if it doesn't satisfy even if four times four isn't nine if we say that it's invalid then we verified is so basically you don't need to have you know it's not just arguments that that satisfy this condition are true that are one but those are those that satisfied zero as a result can also be variation so basically that's it for sure you have any questions or should I go into some detail some spark furniture like a city or they keep there will be an error in the socratis panel itself yeah yeah we can make it ever that's what's with the suit like this what's my that's the completion again and this that's Paris office at the time and stuff like that we can do something else but basically a you again the line where where it's here so basically does a little bit yeah any other questions yeah does this running inside remixed or or inactivation yes or completely sublimates it weighs base so it's all the surveillance and so yeah that's right there is one version that the city is fully present and CBI using version and this is basically this is the slower but it's more user-friendly and or this kind of testing is tacticals the engine yeah sixta 7,000 Soviet agree yeah that's okay and in fact it's going to be much better after you stumble so we see basically the third if you have any more questions feel free to ask and mm can switch to the wisdom session where we talked about how to create lists [Music] [Music] [Music] time [Music] [Music] I'm going to show you something we did an ethylene but due to various technical issues alpha software so one thing one thing one thing we're going to try to do with the foundation on the planet over the next between here and next they've come is a lot more focus on education and onboarding and documentation probably for a lot of people in this room is may or may not be so important but but if we want to do whatever little describers and makes a million dips in a very important so one thing I've always been a big fan of is documentation when people can also interact with it and that's kind of what the workshop plug-in lets you do so somewhat limited right now but there is this new workshop plug-in you can activate from the homepage too and we will start adding curate these workshops to this but also you can create your own we see the internet is you can either manually create them by adding steps and then linking to files and I'll show you the structure of that in a minute but that's a little bit of tedious so one of the other steps now is to import right from github and follow us and that's what I'll quickly show you so in the solidity documentation is this introduction to smart contracts example and one thing they tried to do is recreate this as a workshop focus if you ever use any kind of interactive education tool before and you have things like I'll show you very quickly description they coat to play around with and then you test what you've done and if it's correct you go to the next step if it's rhomin tells you what's wrong you fix it etc etc this is currently using the error handling feature of acidity things like a revert honest requirement so we can't test at the moment but transport promised me we will look at other ways to figure out how to test some of that stuff for example in this smart contract example it tells you about a fragment version we need to figure out a way to test that free month but and it basically looks like something like this is it's too slow switched or I will copy each step is defined in a folder and the file name is important especially if you want to import from github because then it will just match all the files it needs from that file name and if I jump into a comment that is a little bit more everything in there you'll see a demo file which contains the text the text you just saw could you please increase a little bit their size but it's so tiny that has the explanation and one thing I will say anyone who's interested in this writing converting the normal documentation to something like this that's very byte size it's actually really really hard so actually possibly the hardest bit of this is figuring out how to explain in very few words of concepts in that side panel and I wouldn't say this is this is not a lot it probably needs a bit more work it's actually quite difficult and then you have the basic solidity file don't forget this should be the soliciting file without a thing that in what we so it's kind of its current state and then here is the test and at the moment we have a little bit of we need to figure out how the test is probably because the explanation may be introducing some concepts so you have something to test because you need something to test which isn't always what you have written to China educate so this is zero but but if you have done any kind of error ending to this season this is recently familiar and you know the import the top is a headed by dreaming so if you're using an anything you'll keep it Araceli but it will get any attention and that's pretty much it so actually just creating the content is probably the most complicated part of the whole thing and then you get an interface much like you saw with the steps that people could work their way through and later course I'll complete a small workshop and we have text ignition Robert is gonna run a workshop using this in Paris in about a month as well so we tried it and it works so if you have tutorials you would love to again please do and let us know or you can enter yourself and just run them and this sort of fits into a lot of other things we're trying to do and I don't know if any of you saw in is keynote there was a little thing about junior coming soon that's actually a similar product to to remix called that was built by a team in Spain superblocks and that has the ability to also test things like HTML and web 3js javascript to build a full stack gear but the nice thing is both of them are using mark town and spark context then HTML and JavaScript in the case of super box so you can actually share content between as well and with the plug-in infrastructure the eventual aim in the long run will be to hopefully kind of make one plugins of others sort of things so it's basically the same tool with extras on top so yeah that's just some of the things were working on in terms of some interactive education tools and hopefully in the future we might also better make this edible somehow so you can actually be directly in the documentation too so yeah please give it a go and we know there are some limitations right now but it's certainly something to try and experiment with and figure out how to teach people the wonderful stupidity program thank you so now let's move the Red Sox assured me you'd be so easy now who want to discuss and I think each would be like to this exchange and sharing and the room starting fourth position is about begins and you see whether and how realities and what we do [Music] [Music] [Music] so then I ain't with the question man why why why does it leave governance in the beginning right better just to have in the beginning so we have cynics intravenous can walk now and which means that any developer can propose proteins and the proteins that the case of eg for Johannesburg in another case of Exxon Jim and so we know that's fine it's fine for for us to of feelings to observer again in centuries but if that it's beautiful to tour like coming and saying okay we won't also swap the spooky and we have and the most welcome to Phoenix and we're doing all this push to have McCarran to a plugin but are you doing the good plugin or is it just a silly one or is it a malicious one or the question so like it's remix eating its own plug-in dog food like the solidity compiler is that would be nice or are you using this yeah so a bunch of cookies made by us and we make spoons I would just so just by Elise's question I mean getting that some early stages you want to find lists or plugins that actually work the last thing that you want is a long list of things that do not work and that's then we can decide what to use we definitely need new day one I would say government's just like with the fear you can just sections I do have a technical question it's not the normal system well one thing we're trying to add our plugin is a field so we have a get point and deaf-blind from the transaction access another field beyond was did one in the regular transaction format that you have so prone to we added an extra note that gets stripped out before so is there a way to create walking that allows us to do that right now - no because I think something that's done to read inside Linux source code this one thing that we try to do is forest engine we want to be sure that Walt spending time in that and marking it is because into it but as you say where most of the claims are fake plugins right now because they're just like the fight system for example status is directly inside the code friends and we need time to remove it and try to improve this kind of thing but it's going to be possible but right now it's it's nothing but Socrates now it's like no open XML plug-in that allows me to customize the list of fields are being rescued but rather the relatives actually still make it and we should probably extract this out so yeah yeah I think this a conversation we're having is really interesting it shows you that people actually want more API no how do you govern that yeah that's a good question this and something that we're doing right now come on API that we have right now our goal I'll explain it's like come on AP is and this actually more difficult that I call that community because there are already some a lot of softwares the only standard API that you know right now in fact what free provider which is the only thing on file system because but everything else is like super difficult you know Anita walking groups of people from the industry to talk about that but still we have just told me to produce something because you have this kind of issues so the way we are doing right now is just taking the current API fairness and supposing it respect that and but I think it needs to be curated at some point so what weight is saying from our concept and then we try to make it stand out as much as possible with all the people so prepare of course with just even though there is others that might want to ask for api's I prefer to send the news at the same second section but customize the fields that can be best food because that makes it compatible with all the other clients and IDs and we need to eat something customs which we have also to stare like it guy that's using it or other applications that we don't have to pay them yeah but I guess it would be nice to have you know to define that so that was the reason I want to extend that idea yeah so what kind of like something that's like inside that checked in this way so the mental model of a next person is will be the same question how do you do it internally in your team when you propose new API or new changes like for another's entire plug-in system how did did you create a proposal and then discuss it you know no I mean communicate this okay I want to be able to get its rights when you live the eyes or gaze from the trace so we just say okay so we can just it's more like if one day forgive that one we just see okay very social place I know it's centralized but you when your project management incredible subject matter and how do you summarize what you want to do it's not that formal equality what we need okay right now are you gonna be able to do this if you open it up like if you open it up to the more community center and then we're gonna sit there and communicate with you're gonna be in chat with them all the time emails and then you're gonna make processes or are you gonna get it becomes an organized about particles like make a proposal we'd like this be able to comment modify the proposal you have to create more process like the creating wrong from there kind of whatever yeah [Music] we are talking about dance also is very into long and I think we reached the point that now ready to know because right now humans value plug-in you need to do for requests on release I keep trying to switch to something more thanks mo from us so now we can just request another repository it isn't that out good so it's like first thing to extract from burning psyche but at some point we needs to finally after two days how do we do that you can use it in that register so other published one you guys Indian ovens my elbows with the buggy or no sanity logo certain that's like whether it's called propose because [Music] what is it like a lot of people know what's using way we react but yeah I've been in Sweden huge huge huge context so it's worth the whole forest management each time there is a new update me to review again because we don't want like mutates will bring some new every time yeah impossible to make the ideally the way that the packets are sitting in a separate repository then either going to enter stop capture a mix and then just install the plugins but then you have you don't need to maintain any plugins it's that that detection they're just like to have a premise someone gets up liking there is a package repositories and you don't need even to govern anything so people are just like a willingly chosen Authority like this but they want to install those things are going away so do you expect to expect people to go to the registry and look at the code and say okay just a good cop so I mean I don't expect them to do that I expect to just have a look into this like if it's like a highly valued or whatever the team has 20 that they trusted keep these articles like what is going to use this buggy to decide so basically there is no like a single point of deciding she was excellent it was obvious like two weeks for validation of the blue jeans Durrell's and pretty and then using his mobility and how can so how can happen if I want to be powerful on television I'm not an experiment of yours but I think it's good idea to do this last meeting of reviewers the reviewers are money when they [Music] to this question so I see what is the trend model right but if you chew types of that looking like the first one it's just applying the brakes remains it doesn't work and exercise they compare to its low monthly it's just a bad thing and only affects me the second tomorrow in the vending it actually changes a source code of the contract when it's deployed but then you would argue that like you should not use in public you like the final thing that you should trust is a contract that is on the watch it should go there and verify there right if that's matters by the point if you're using if you make a contract publish it on the publish it on the blockchain then you should verify the source code they are not in your readings like I see there like somebody's have access file system and for example you don't exact well plug in and change some that I can't access the power system I can be malicious computer and other big pros but then you can test because you hit that source code of pocket it has how integration with other pockets with malicious stuff like that that's that's hard that's again integral in this area see what we're still not clear about which it guys were gaining but watch what the features were in some of the early stages so before restarting the correct model that we protect against all the teachers at least a good number in chapter 7 let's start building and then we get started protect against just one performance connection access the benefits limited is going to be more and more because even things like the wallet but makes sense to expose it because that might be some plugins that do need access to it [Music] and the truck model operating worries me is is what we see like things like that which is there's a plumbing that gets really really popular and someone just goes through the wall or a lot of captions is I wanna play it and it won't just transfers and then in the next update there's like a dozen 101 where a certain I think this is the kind of thing that it's not really about Buddhists you know thousands of buttons if it's like 50 or it's already a lot to us to be able to reveal that they're a reality check [Music] yeah so it's basically now wheels so before you can just replace as you want because were just on the skin so now we are traditional Swan so we have done them so that if s so we have - which time your taste is nemesis a new heart so I guess we can know that Robin is different that's just words [Music] as such possible already now women yeah I mean this is a nice frame right you can do it your mom's right is just that we don't say can use it you can't even get a source code about you [Music] I will read up that you can help us make better on yeah that's why we're on for this discussion today because is something that Chris I think speaking with the community and know what to expect and I really value your point but anymore you on what we're going to do made it more organized it's organized by three insect parts do you think the point about make it more organized just help us to figure out what the what's important plug-in to put in the list or is that just I think it's yes it's to create structure to the process then you can start to create rules for the process it's just too much of an open blooood conversation about what people want you know different communications campaign for that so you look at say the EIP process really good you know I'm not sure how they for example like Apple Store there's all these really formal steps pipelines processes you might learn from that from an outsider because I'm not inside your team I don't know and also that's a place of both API and you know when people send in requests to your project I like what principles are you using to evaluate for API changes and then plugin purchase participation in such an amount is and to reach the point where we know to be the society only and for me as I kind of think I think it's a good thing but I sometime you throw down everything then we have to wait and we humans nice good time to build like a walking group some few people outside of readings we can start having what should be added of the roadmap of this kind of beam we can Morgan district restore III this place where we can offer key tabs on every developer now the course yeah right now and also attract discussion like every two weeks or something like that and hope to know where we are going and this kind of thing I know that work wasn't the the guys from Microsoft today and they're really wants to do that also because they want they they might want to use this inside yes good so if you wants to be part of this  that gross that we do to build this Commons just so we can organize this working group is to meet like we all sorting to two measures very nice but focus on the focus on on these subjects and maybe you better explain that me what's this like amount of people to manage it at the very early stage it's it's difficult with working groups because people might enthusiastic at first and then they might move on to other projects the team really needs like a good organizer to constantly look after it and keep it going and constantly team members and have phone calls or conference calls and chat as you know like a you know it's your community of people or even looking back you need an organizer what do you see I mean p.m. I can't stop zone so we have like a federated approach streets of bottle where everyone maintains their own auto industry so there's only one central registry says trust I need someone to review it and someone needs to review it you're right I considered that your retina value zone like there are people using your tool to deploy family assets corporate assets people are going well yeah users don't we're putting a huge value on this stuff you have to assume the user doesn't isn't a little expert because they can just open up your total copy paste something and put a multi-state the whole family well then you're like a warning or something that yes we have like yes yeah exactly for the begin well touches a combination of what we have now and what what probation we were suggesting so there could be many two buckets like one bucket is the trusted plugins for now and then the other bucket would be like go and experiment on your own risk maybe even two three of them I don't know with the time but still at also to be changing the subject slightly to the last couple minutes also have a session of coming up with ideas from plugins you know puppet sidekick there's a 12-hour experience in the right side the right side right now you can position them but what are the other how [Music] [Music] in some way that can be configured and then home team is just using the like I'm mostly using as if I need to experiment on something we are not able to completely development because of like now like having a collaboration platform ID which includes some basic [Music] thing that this was used like and just use it for just can use like a plug-in and then have a configuration file on my like this distillation plant vanships definitely you can have a cure plug-in and then you can immediately see the next year exactly yeah that's what I mean by complicated like a setup going to the remix be together it would be access to the PI system but again there's issues [Music] [Music] then you go to gift up you change there six months that she won't break thanks you should service the issue itself is three years [Applause] you [Music]
