[Applause] so for 12 days and we review its last day of that carbon and its fishing that over the house is for all the very tired so we all appreciate your coming some like my top is a about licenses so let's talk about so it's gonna be just a very quick overview and bring a snapshot of the oldest versus blotchy products and which licenses they've chosen to work with in office so he's telling this story of how I took they definitely said buttocks I think it means together two men involved so first of all I started just building like my own list of open source projects out there you know magnet and then I thought I could crowdsource that that we shouldn't and I lists are growing then I was too pointed to the sentiment API which is actually great because um thanks to them I got a database of basically more than a thousand at that time in the mountain marketing projects and so that made it much much much easier for me because plus the fact that the github API has a license end point made so that I can just basically are this [Music] so sound simple um so the end I basically got a list of 150 hundred projects and your than ten thousand Rico so we taught it has multiple readings inside of it and someone's interested because it actually gives us some data to analyze and so this is kind of what the data looks like on the graph itself is very useful because the sides of the triangle here and just as a side note so we have a third year in orangish and I think it's the second place in terms of the amount of repose first place goes to so this is where we got more interesting data so most of our repose in the boxing space don't penalize the saturated so 51 percent of them are licensed and I'll get back to the non licensed products right before that if we take those out you can see that most of those projects most projects went to high places choose MIT license so did you five percent of money use MIT license followed by a patch but 50% then UTP or you would have gotten all that followed by a diverse mix of DP on tight licences and then others interesting licenses on Leslie unlicensed and do whatever you want I don't know how scientific this is probably is incredible but I did find a personal relationship between the number of words and license and the popularity so actually does make much sense because if we want to really read the license and even understand what's in it personally I would choose a 100 to be two word places than almost 6,000 i grossed bet that maybe 1 1 2 3 5 percent of people who actually use the CTL 3 laces have read those five thousand six hundred million words so you know anyways like that I think that's an interesting this is a chart of the 2015 long study and in fact if we compared to today's parties it's at least we see some tendencies MIT team is more gaining some space so detail until losing some in my opinion probably loses some to gplv3 you know some people incorrectly so in the gplv3 years and is is an evolution of the GP opportunities in case I'm going to go into those details you want to speak about that scene at the top and I'm agitating some specific so lastly just to go back to that none license the products so we have 51% if we compare that to the same stuff young github repo study we set for your tendency to not license narcotics time which is basically not a big shame because we don't - our product it has a default like copyright advances to be and also this last 2015 we're basically at least ahead in terms of that overall 2015 stat entity you know we're at 51% and it's a big number and you should probably try to reduce time so that's all I got if you want to talk more about the types of licenses of white choose one over another is only if ideas I don't have time for that but if you want we could talk about later that later although I do work I'll be talking about Pegasus I could let you know why each or without that you need to that's all [Applause]
