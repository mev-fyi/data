foreign [Music] generative and interactive Commons and a lot of this will be informed by a group that that I am part of called kernel and I guess just for just to start can we have a show of hands for people here who know about kernel cool yeah it's good to see a lot of the colonel fellows here as well and for those of you who don't know what Colonel is Colonel is a web free Fellowship uh it started out around uh June July 2020 I started by Vivek and Andy and uh the initial uh format of Kernel was it was 100 builders in the webpage space discussing um discussing what we need to build in web3 a lot of web 2 we feel has been has been largely influenced by the technology and not the I guess not the Arts not not the sciences and the philosophy so Colonel tries to get a lot of people to discuss what it is we really need to build and um and today we're the hope is we we get together and discuss what does it mean to build a more regenerative and interactive Commons and a lot of how we do it in kernel is through discussion through workshops like this one that we hope you guys will be able to uh to take fully part of it's uh it's gonna be a format that we call ajunto wherein we get groups of people to discuss uh sub subjects that are relevant to crypto but uh pretty deep I would say and not focused on a lot of what we're mostly used to talking about in a very very crypto focused conference so maybe I can start with uh what was listed down there in the workshop agenda the concept of comments is not that the resource a comments comes from a different way of being in the world where it is not production which counts but bodily use established by Customs so the hope today is we kind of explore those ideas and we'll be using some guide questions that uh that will hopefully guide the discussions and yeah looking forward to having a fruitful discussion with you all but before we start uh some of the kernel fellows are here and uh we need to be able to I guess form a good group among each of the tables so maybe I can request uh you guys to form uh groups of three to four for each table so the hope is the Hope also maybe for the next Slide the hope more so than discussing this is also Colonel is really all about making relationships and learning more with friends here in Korea here in web3 so let's form groups of three and four some of the guides will help facilitate and um and if you can try form groups I guess with people that yeah that you don't know yet because uh the hope is we we get to get introduced to more people so so yeah so maybe we can take a few minutes to to organize ourselves try to convince someone to join you or get up and join another and if anyone needs help cool all right it's taking some a few seconds to look around cool all right looks good maybe take a few seconds to just get to know the folks that are in your table and for those that are just joining we're we're forming groups of three and four uh so do find the table which seems like there's like there's more space for discussions all right looks good so hope you are getting comfortable with the folks on your table try to introduce yourselves to each other because we're gonna be talking about some I got some pretty deep topics in the context of web3 and again I want to remind everyone that in these 15 minutes we hope the hope is we have fun uh make a friend one of the core principles of Colonel is to is to be subversive to subvert the status quo and have fun so so yeah just and and and just to go back it's a playful art together and you'll find in kernel a lot of the discussions are around what do words mean and and playing around with with words and changing the format of how we look at the words we commonly see in our day-to-day lives all right so the hope for today is we're gonna have um perhaps two juntos a junto is as I mentioned a group discussion where we try to discuss a topic in web 3 or a topic that is kind of similar or I guess a topic that is adjacent to that tree and in our case the first June toe that we'll be holding is about trust so in kernel this is kind of how we introduce Colonel fellows trust is something that we hear about a lot in blockchain it's about trustless systems it's about building transactions and building trust around these transactions but one thing we can kind of try and explore is what does trust mean in the context outside of crypto so what is trust what what would a world without trust be would it be richer or poorer and so this leads to I guess our first junto and the hope is we get all of you guys to to think about trust and in groups of three and four tell a story not related to crypto about a moment where trust grew in your world so um a lot of us spend a lot of time talking about trust in the concept of blockchain transaction so let's try to flip that a little bit um who do you trust and why and then tell a story about a moment where trust grew in your world so some of the colonel fellows are part of your group so they'll be facilitating some of these discussions and so yeah so let's get started I love the laughter all right thank you everyone so let's keep the discussions moving what I hope like that that this exploration of trust for for everyone is kind of given you uh like some other threats to pull around trust when we talk about trust in web3 a lot of it as I mentioned is informed about the blockchain about trustless protocols um but if we're gonna be building an interactive and regenerative governments I think there's gonna be more to that than just the technology it's going to be about conversations it's going to be about the communities that we're building these for and I want to spend a little bit of time around this game by Nikki case um if just do a search for the game of trust by Nicki case and this is one I would say one very very wonderful internet artifact to kind of get you to understand more about trust and what happens in that game is you play the game and you you realize that a trust is it has many facets like sometimes the story there is that uh during the world during World War One there is an event where where a ceasefire happened and that was mostly because because people were already in close proximity with each with each other even though they were like on different sides of the war and and that kind of gives you a different look into how distrust less or trustful systems are built um so and within Nikki cases uh video or a game essay he says that what what or she says that what builds trust is repeat interactions possible win wins and low miscommunication so uh so when we think of trust in the context of web3 is there any space for what we're building to do this as well uh are there are other communities that were building these systems for and kind of making sure that we're making pro-social systems to be able to build better trust around the Commerce in the communities that we're building all right so let's continue on I think uh now that we got a hang of how to do these juntos let's do one more um and the next one is more around Customs around community and Commons I know when we talk about comments it's a term that has I guess a lot of different meanings as well aside from trust and in kernel one thing that we also think of is we feel that web3 and the technology that is given to us by ethereum and all these other uh protocols is we're able to build new communities or a rather old communities in future form so a lot of communities have Customs a lot of comments have rituals that with you and that kind of defines how these comments and how these communities form and how we design the systems that that we do unintended outcome for so the discussion for the next for the next junto is what are your favorite Customs or rituals and what customers might have noticed here in Bogota for that last few days you've been here or if you're a local tell tell all of us what Customs are are nice in Bogota so this may be religious secular cultural or otherwise a custom it's just something that we do we take for granted might be something very simple right but something that that all of us do as part of a community and yeah please please start the discussion all right I'm sorry I have to stop the conversations but we we need to move on and I hope you were able to know more about some customs that you don't know about um some different perspectives on how to build communities and how communities are built around these customs and I want to take a few seconds to talk about this as well so I mentioned Colonel a lot of the thinking in kernel is not just on the technological side we we also look in with at a lot of uh I guess the Arts and the social sciences some of the some of the people we I guess the some of the the good writers and people that we learn from are people like Ivan Ilitch where he says in tools for conviviality institutions are functional when they promote a delicate balance between what people can do for themselves and what tools at the service of anonymous institutions can do for them so a lot of these comments sometimes we feel like we're just building them right now but a lot of the great sociologists a lot of the people like James cars who talks about infinite games we hear about um some other things also like ecosystems by EO Wilson so there's so much knowledge that we can take from from what people have been building there's a lot of knowledge in the Indigenous systems as well for example that that we frankly don't take the time to take a look at the complementary opposite of scarcity for example is abundance it's not abundance rather it is reciprocity when we and scarcity is is something that a lot of us really focus around in web 3 like virtual scarcity artificial scarcity so think of that term think of what that means in the context of not just crypto but in the things that we're building then we might get a more complete I guess understanding of the the Commerce that we aspire to build um so a Commerce is a space which is established by custom we must consider the reciprocity based custom we might create in our new web3 contexts so we have around 10 to 13 minutes and I want I guess I want us to spend a little bit of time and try to do this last junto we have just a quick amount of time but maybe we can rush through it and this is also one of the topics that we discuss very deeply in kernel is it's about gifts and gifting a lot of the indigenous economies I mentioned earlier a lot of them have gift economies where it's not about scarcity but about abundance so maybe it's worth exploring what that term means to all of us what is a gift so so in our groups discuss what is the best gift you've ever given or one that you've ever received um and yeah so this is our last YouTube and I have a few more slides after this but please discuss we have around 10 minutes to do so so yeah all right and sorry for cutting the conversations but we're almost at time but uh I I hope that you guys have been able to connect with the folks in your group and maybe maybe just take a little bit of time also to thank everyone to who participated in the conversations and I'll spend a few more slides just to close everything out but we mentioned earlier about reciprocity and gifting I think that's something that's not covered at all in a lot of the a lot of the conversations that you'll probably hear in crypto conferences giving and receiving well are features of a healthy human and Upstream a healthy ecosystem so we can kind of think about the commas that we're building and kind of look at it from that lens right it's gifting a part of the ecosystems that you are building or that you are part of and what would it mean to kind of give freely and the one one story I remember from vitalik was the the reason that he got into ethereum was he he wrote something on bitcoin and someone gifted him uh Bitcoin and that was kind of what spurred ethereum and that's why we're all here so gifting might be the spark that leads to something really really wonderful and and yeah and just to recap we talked about trust about comments and gifting giving and receiving will and um it was all just a long-winded way I guess to to hope that you guys make friends uh in the last 50 minutes maybe someone to go around Bogota weather while you're here and um and yeah and I guess I just also want to end with a quote that I just recently knew of because of the people talking in Colonel and this was by um by EO Wilson EO Wilson just recently passed this December and um before then he was I guess one of the Giants in Social biology and someone asked him like how in in just a few sentences how would you describe what sociobiology is and he says is selfishness beats altruism within groups altruistic groups beat selfish groups everything else is commentary and he kind of got that from Rabbi hillel's interpretation when he was asked what the meaning of the Torah was which was what is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor neighbor everything else is commentary so I guess it's worth thinking of that at the Golden Rule right um for some first principles are sometimes things that we forgot forget in our past moving life so the hope is this slow down this conversation with other people has given you a glimpse into what it would be what would it look like we had an inter more interactive and more regenerative comments and yeah and I want to take all of the kernel guides as well thank you for helping facilitate and if you want to know more about Colonel just reach out to me so thank you everyone thank you
