so I'm Connor Spencer mrs. viola kirilov we I'm the founder of a company called blk dot IO and we also maintain and created web 3j the Java library for integrating with aetherium clients so web 3j was initially launched just before DEFCON 2 so it's been around for a couple of years now it provides started offers just being that into an implementation of the JSON RPC API but then when we started thinking in terms of smart contracts and you know taking below the surface of it we added in things like the you know the transaction signing capabilities and then bindings creation of bindings in Java so that you can base city once you've got your smart contract ready and you can do everything else within the actual JVM it works as well nicely with truffle - so who uses contract ABI metadata files whether they're come out of solidity or truffle we can use that to generate the smart contract bindings it's a reactive functional API which basically means it's easy to compose streams as per our xjv to operate on events that are taking place on the blockchain as they happen and it's provides full TNS support as well which was added last year although now pass over to a viola who's gonna have to say a couple of things yes the word 3G ecosystems it's got many components with it the core web three.js run in Java so it's compatible with Colleen's scholar and Android as well we've got build tools maven and Gradle so you can generate your small contract wrappers within your hope within your build pipeline we support the quorum client parity and get clients as well and the recently announced Pantheon client from consensus man we've got some framework integrations with spring tees you create RESTful API is an apache camel for your enterprise applications and yeah we released works Vijay 4.0 really excited about some of the main things that we've updated is now we're using rx Java to the flowable API we have hedged you Wallace support bit that good 32 and BIP 44 standards were implemented and another main thing is we go snapshot releases are now available to can stay more current with what we're doing we're gonna keep this brief it's a lightning talk and yeah just to give you a few metrics as well about the library so we've had 75 different contributors now who've actually contributed to it it gets over 20,000 downloads a month as well so you know all-in if you can all the different components it's over a hundred thousand downloads but the actual core library itself so there's a very significant user base globally for it and projects about over 2000 github stars a few months ago as well we received funding from the etherion Community Fund which we're very grateful for because this has enabled us to actually have someone working on the library full-time we really want to continue supporting the the JVM ecosystem for working with the theorem and just improve on it so you know our plan is very much so to grow the actual team and the the amount of work that we're doing here we're also to the the get coin well get coin of being group great too in terms of offering a spawn C's to and will continue to for smaller issues as well so that's you know we can and well just get more people involved in also continue just to maintain and just you know make it even easier for a wider number of people to work with the library as well we wanted to say comes if you don't have a check I'm say I've got stickers and you know all the usual swag things as well if them yeah you want any face thank you you
