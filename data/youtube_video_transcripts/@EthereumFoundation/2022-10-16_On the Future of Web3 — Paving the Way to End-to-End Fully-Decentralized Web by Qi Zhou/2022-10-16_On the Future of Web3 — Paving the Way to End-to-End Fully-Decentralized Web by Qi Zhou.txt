foreign [Music] I'm the founder of Easter storage today I will going to present our talk on the future of battery Paving the way to the fully Android and fully decentral as well so what is the current status of the central as well so we have a decentralized access protocol like ipfs and we also have a mature P2P Network layer and which we are able to retrieve the data and we also have the incentivized storage layer that helps to keep the data consistency however there are still great limitation of current uh decentralized Storage Solutions first those storage solution has a great limits on the semantics in many Workforce static files which means that it's very inefficient to update and delete those existing files even just a single bias that is changed and further there's no way to compose this data in a centralized a decentralized way so sometimes we have to rely on centralized server second is that all these projects they have their ecosystem which means that users has to use their wallets tokens and addresses in order to be able to upload those files to their systems so with these problems we are projecting what the features that we need in the future but three first we need a Rich Storage semantics in a decentralized storage which can support great update delete blobs for very large large amount potentially petabytes further it can be programmable by smart conscious so that can easily compose us data with the larger on of the smart contracts running on ethereum and second is that we want to simplify the user or body which means that the user just using the user wallet pay ethereum and is able to upload and basically store a large amount of data on top of the who is your network and lastly we need to have a nil access particle that is able to render those Dynamic data from uh front end to the blockchain and storage without any centralized identity so what's the solution um thanks to the latest development of the ethernet Technologies we believe that we are now at a position that we can achieve these goals in the near future first of all we have data availability disability thanks to Thanksgiving which greatly increase the data upload speed using Advanced cryptography Primitives and second is that we are able to build external data retention Network so that we only store corresponding metadata on ethereum and be able to store large amount of data in this layer 2 Network and we just periodically submit the proof of storage into the ethernet so it tells that everybody can check the actual data the latest data is keep in the network with high replication and lastly we also developed our website access protocol which is able to decentralizedly access those web objects caused by smart contracts so this is a website access protocol which is defined by erc4804 which is a way to render rapid objects hosted by smart contra is very similar to http so that it can inherit all the good benefits of HTTP while we are able to identify a resource that hosts by smart culture and further access the underlying storage layer that we built and the user storage is a layer 2 solutions that aims to scale ethereum storage rather than computation and so here is a quick comparison of what is storage can do versus biocoin orig and the default storage solutions of ethereum and with this infrastructure we believe that we are able to enable a lot of new applications for example just the website hosting like unit swap curve or dynamic nft which we are able to change the presentation of image dynamically and we also be able to build decentralized social networks such as essential Twitter Media or even decentralized Dropbox so here I will give a demo um let me see okay this is my Firefox browser that supports the 3vml so now it's time to go to URL uh that may register a UNS standpoints channel uh the smart contract that holds our performance so all the images HTML CSS JavaScript now uh hosting by the smart contract are returned by this website access support code so there are also a couple of uh interesting examples for example design trans Dropbox so this is also a whole digital return on Smart contract another small culture and we can see I can see them all the list like all the print files have been uploaded before and in order to upload a new file what I should do is just check the file and then it will ask me to sign a transaction via mask so during the whole procedure you do not need to require any additional uh two such as Cellar CLI and once the transaction is confirmed a network I can access the file also via web3 access protocol um so has been uploaded so we are able to access so it's still giving but we can still using website access protocol and the corresponding violence is also updated according to it thanks to Smart contract so this is an example for this centralized Dropbox there are also a couple of other examples like web streaming deception report Dynamic guarantee Etc so welcome to play to yeah yeah um so there are a lot of more details of our technology that are built so we have after party in this afternoon and in the nearby Hilton Hotel and 550 Camp I'm happy to answer any questions yes you you listed four you've made comparison with four systems but you forgot to mention swarm yeah actually I talked to Swan people a few days ago so Swan actually has a similar architecture as ffs which is using a Content addressing to basically a locating a file and also it has a way to basically call Dynamic hash to able to locate the latest version of file but at the same time right now I don't think it has the programmability with the Smart Launcher which is able to modify and able to compose all the data purely on chain and there's something we really want to enable and second is that or who the design is using easier so basically the data providers will be paid by the user and also the users will pay the user to storage those content so it's a highly coupled with the ethereum with the basically native support
