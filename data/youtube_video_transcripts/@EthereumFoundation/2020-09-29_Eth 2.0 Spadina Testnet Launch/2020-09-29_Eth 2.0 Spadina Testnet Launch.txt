[Music] [Music] so [Music] the spadina ethereum 2 uh phase 0 beacon chain test net launch that's the longest sentence i've ever said in my life hi my name is hank you know me online at superfiz i work with the east staker community to promote access to staking on the ethereum 2 network today's call is going to last a little over an hour probably an hour and 15 minutes the first 30 minutes are going to be what i'd like to call setup we're going to talk about where the network is how we got where we are today and um kind of the overall plan for ethereum 2 scaling the second half of this call actually at the top of the coming hour is going to be the genesis block of the ethereum 2 test net named spadina it is a short-lived test net we expect it to run about 72 hours we're here today as a formal dress rehearsal we want to make one final practice of all of the tooling for ethereum to launch so when we go live on mainnet everything goes smoothly so this testnet will begin this morning we'll run for about 72 hours just to make sure that everything runs great um and then we'll look forward to what's coming up in the future of the test net or ethereum so um i'd like to talk about some of the people who are with us today my crew is the east acre crew and we are housed at reddit.com r eatstaker and at our discord which is linked from eathstaker and we also tweet on eth2scc now the primary focus of our of our group is to onboard solo stakers and support solo stakers so that people can be active participants in the eth2 network we also have on our discord a really well-trained group of educators who can answer any question related to ethereum 2 or get you to the right answer um so these stickers do you guys have anything uh anything you'd like to say would you like to introduce yourselves real quickly hi nolan yes you covered you um we are delivering po-ops on this call um we all different people from all around the world made the ethereum community having a nft that represents that you being part of this historic moment can be a nice piece of pride for the future so if you want to have the token that troops that you've been part of this launch you just have to go to our discord on the po up channel and post a message with the link of the live stream and you get delivered the link automatically and we have big plans for po-op on the upcoming month so so i suggest you to get this token because it might give you a special access to some very cool and exciting features so go get it and stay tuned for for the call thank you thanks um i i love to go on and on about poep um the proof of attendance protocol uh it's an erc721 token that's actually migrating to the xdi network um as a layer two solution uh which brings us to ethereum two scaling the reason that um ethereum two is a necessary development in ethereum uh is to improve the scaling capacity of the ethereum network when ethereum two is fully live we'll have 64 times the the base capacity um as as a single ethereum node does now uh so that's going to be a tremendous improvement today's test is uh for phase zero which is the first of several phases i'm looking forward to hearing danny tell us a little more about those later um speaking of which so we have um danny hello danny welcome uh dan is is the the organizer i guess of ethereum two do you wanna uh tell us a little about what you've got going on um yeah i don't know exactly what i am but um i work with the ethereum foundation on the research team and help push a lot of this forward my main job is to make sure that everyone else can do the hard work and a lot of those people that do incredibly difficult work and help make this reality are on this call and a lot of them are if they're not on this call they may be sleeping or they're anxiously at their terminal um clicking uh clicking away thanks i'm sorry danny ryan is a humble hero and i'm i'm gonna i'm looking forward to hearing more from him later uh he is regardless of of how he promotes himself he is the guy that pulls all of this together um and ethereum two has been a five year research project in progress and this phase zero beacon chain launch is the culmination of so much work uh in research and then two years of implementation by um a lot of client teams and so launching today with us we have the prism team uh well let me clarify we have the prism client lighthouse teku and nimbus um we'll all be launching on the beacon chain uh is that is that an accurate list i believe so there might be some lodestar experimentation um but those are the four primary we're looking at today great um and so if you're if you're watching from youtube or the discord i'm sorry the zoom chat the best place to follow this call is going to be um at spadina dot beacon chain and that is s p a d i n a dot b e a c b e a c o n c h a dot i n uh and that is a uh a launch browser brought to us by bitfly they offered to hey uh they offered to work with us to have uh a one-stop portal for viewing the launch um which is some one of the things we had difficulty when the within the past was knowing what where are we at how are things going um and bitfly brought that to us brought that together for us all in one place let's talk about the client teams because they're they're really the group you know that there's there was three years of research that that precipitated the beacon chain implementation um and since then we've had seven eight nine client teams working to develop clients to get onto uh the beacon chain and today we have four that are very successful um are any of you all here that you'd like to introduce your client for us prism are you here yep i guess star my name is terence and i think i have nishan here with me as well and i'm hoping raul or president can join us later so we are um the e2 client written in go and uh yeah super happy to be here and uh thanks for having us so glad to have you looking forward to the launch um lighthouse are you all with us today yeah hey i'm adrian or age for short i think medi is also on this call um same as terence we're glad to be here everything's kind of looking stable we've just released a 12 point 2.13 so if you're running lighthouse i recommend updating to that first patina great uh taku are you around hi everyone this is jem from taco um yep happy to be here great and nimbus did you make it yes hi it's uh me from uh nimbus and uh also glad to make it great uh we're so happy to have the client teams with us here today um very excited about the launch and as i was introducing the east acre team um i i missed the most important member um hello eon how are you i'm fine we are still working on the metric kind of maybe we are going to push something but i'm not sure um i hope it works um just one thing before the launch happens make sure to refresh the website okay so uh budo does so much great work as as a go-between between the eaststaker community um and bitfly uh that that synergy has been so beneficial to both communities and it's really the kind of the thing that brought us uh this uh this launch portal today um it looks like we have based on the portal 20 minutes left until launch yeah if something goes wrong i will flip my camera to the guy who coded it is he here stefan here yeah he's in front of me oh hello stefan so the beacon chain phase zero launch has happened as a series of a lot of um so implementers calls for about two years um and then uh offered joined with the the test nets and we began with the schlesi test net the woody test net altona madasha um and today spadina um afri would you would you like to give us some background about how these test nets work and and how spadina fits into the big picture of the test nets sure i mean how much time do you have uh i mean long story short when i when i joined the east 2 uh testing efforts in in early early early spring this year the clients were all very busy with implementing and testing their own uh implementation and there was some kind of p piece of the puzzle missing to make them uh talk together work together and uh this is basically what all these test nets are up to their rare uh efforts previously but was was sleazy we had the first time actually two different clients engaging in consensus on the same test net and this was just extended with each iteration of the testnets with witties was three it was i told it was four uh and finally on medusa we we tried to have five um i think it didn't work out uh as planned for lodestar but now we have spadina and uh just as a fun fact um spadina is i think trump stop in in toronto in canada which is uh where the shane save offices are so um i'm happy they are somehow involved anyways and uh i'm i'm really curious to see uh how spatina launched will uh work out today i'm actually right now on on my way to my notes to check the status and i will hope i will make it in next 20 minutes great great thank you we also have uh camila rusla with us camilla are you with us hi hi everyone hey um oh my god so excited to be here um um yeah i've never been to one of these uh lunch parties so yeah happy to see how how everything goes down and and to learn from all of you great thank you so camila is the the offer of the infinite machine um can you tell us from a a thousand yard view like you're you know this is your your first eth2 call but how do you see this fitting into the big picture of ethereum i mean obviously this has been a moment that's been kind of awaited uh from the community for i don't know the very early days of ethereum right the the this uh transition um to proof of stake to sharding to a more scalable ethereum so um watching all these test nets come alive with so many people participating with validators with stakers like all of the community coming together to make this happen is super important and and exciting so um yeah i guess that's the thousand-year view great thank you um so for people who are just getting started i guess with ethereum or ethereum too just zooming out like ethereum began as as this wonderful experiment to um to bring smart contracts to the blockchain platform um and it's it's been so successful that now we're moving into this new um sorry i was trying to formulate my question i i got a little hung up um well tell us about your book oh sure um yeah so my book the infinite machine sitting behind me um is a book on the history of ethereum um at least from kind of from the the reporting i i was able to do i know everyone has their own history of ethereum but you know so the idea to write it came from when i was reporting on crypto for bloomberg news in 2017 um i had already written about bitcoin in 2013 when when i was in argentina um i saw how people were using bitcoin to kind of protect against inflation and currency controls and since then i was always really interested in this kind of independent and parallel money because i was living kind of the issues with argentina's poorly managed monetary system myself like i was earning in our design vessels so it was just mind-blowing to me to discover wow like bitcoin and lousy to uh protect against this and so since then i always kind of kept track of of crypto and then 2017 came and i was in new york and had the chance to cover it day to day and then by the end of 2017 um you know i i had always wanted to write a book and was kind of on the lookout for a good story that could make a book and so i thought you know there has to be a good story here in crypto and so i started thinking what's the best story to tell that hasn't really been told and um that's how it came to the idea of writing a story on ethereum i thought there wasn't you know there wasn't really um one book that captured the kind of foundation story of ethereum for kind of non-technical uh people and there's there was obviously technical documentation on it online and different pieces of the story online but i thought it would be cool to have kind of one place where people could read up on how this was created so i had you know an amazing time um reporting it like i i really tried to follow the dream community wherever they went um so i went to different hackathons to conferences i tried to interview everyone involved obviously spoke with vitalik and all the kind of early co-founders team members um along the way and you know it was just a really um i learned a lot from from the interviews but also from kind of [Music] immersing myself in in the community for for like two years and i guess i i haven't really left uh since um and yeah it just gave me a really nice sense of of how like um an actually uh decentralized uh network and community works because it was very unlike um writing about kind of financial markets for uh for bloomberg news where there was kind of one uh story like one official story that you could go to kind of um a press person or or or like there was a website for the company and you could find kind of the story there with ethereum it's it's obviously very different and so it was really interesting to live that firsthand as i was reporting and trying to get like stories from all these different people from like different parts of the world different different experiences um so yeah that's how the book came about i'm i'm i've been really happy with kind of the the uh reception and and response to it so i i hope you you all get a chance to read it yeah it is a fantastic book and something you said really got me um that people it's hard to find one place for canonical information about ethereum because it's it's spread all the all around it's not a business where you can just go to their landing page and get all of the information um one of the questions people always ask me is well where do i go to get started in ethereum and i'm like ah it's tough but that's right now we can point them to your book and they can get a great primer yay so i have a programming note about the poeps this is the proof of attendance protocol token that um everyone can claim for participating in this call we do have a bot that's running on the e-staker discord if you go to the poep channel and if you go to that channel is it um let me switch to it really quickly if you go to po app and paste the link for this youtube stream you will get a response from the bot and it didn't start until a few minutes ago so i know a couple of us posted early if you're viewing from youtube this is the place you want to go if you're regardless of how you're seeing this as long as you're within the viewing window um for about the next 45 minutes you'll be able to claim this poep um so danny got his so we are all set to go um let me switch back to my notes real quickly um i wanted to check in with proto-lambda um so proto what uh what are the big research advancements that we've had in the past few weeks and months regarding uh eth2 well so there are two things right there's uh there's research developments and then just here are like this implementation work towards zero launch i think for this call and for the spadina lines this implementation work is really important and then for research like there's many things to look forward to after the launch think of phase one phase one and a half and then maybe somewhere in between you know things like the secret shared feather that work i think duncan is on the car so these kind of things are also really exciting to see and hopefully come to fruition for a minute lunch um yeah and so with implementers work i think leading up to spadina and then soon men at lunch really polishing our editing clients lots of review um the story i'm mostly working on right now i'm not as involved with this by dynaline itself i think the community can really now started the net by themselves uh monitor and get a successful launch it's not as as a developers anymore that run these networks which is really exciting and uh yeah looking forward to this great thank you uh so we have about eight minutes before launch and in that time um i'd like to look to two of the people who um who have so much invested in this vitalik has been working um with ethereum since 2014 um so i guess the past six years of your life um i imagine you're pretty excited to see this launch taking off i am yeah and it's def well it's probably if you include the white paper it's going to be seven years in about a month or so uh so definitely really excited to see um youth two coming and to see the uh the scaling dream and the prostate dream of finally becoming a reality after all this time yeah so you you made a notable push a few i guess it was a couple months ago now that you really felt like it was time to get phase zero out do you feel like that paid off i think so i think okay it's like at some point um you know the the tires have to hit the road i guess um and we do and the thing is right that there's a limit to the extents to which you can kind of understand these systems in theory land and even understand these systems on test nets right like proof of stake sharding and so forth are they're not just technical upgrades they're also economic upgrades and they're like they are pretty deep changes to the security model and so i think that you know the approach we took where you know we don't i think in a lot of ways it's like even more responsible than the alternatives right because like the usual alternative is basically you have a test and it's like zero risk and then it goes all the way up to 100 risk and our approach is like much more you know zero percent risk then go up to 25 then 50 then 75 and then 100 and like each step up teaches you things that um the the steps below it don't right and so like three months each and each of these stages is worth more than you know 50 years and the first stage in zero and zero time in all the other stages and so now i think we've learned a lot already from the test nets for example about the speaking experience and over the next year i think we're going to learn a lot about how speakers behave in a context where it actually does matter and there's a lot of economic uh incentives in play um and then the eth2 chain is just going to kind of gradually add more functionality and become more important to the hearing ecosystem over time and i think each step of that is going to be a big and interesting part of the journey oh great uh you know offeree tweeted this morning that uh ethereum two phase zero is is the incentivized test net for eth2 um i thought that was i felt like it was on on target did you have a perspective on that it becomes an interesting discussion what is a test and what isn't the testnet right because like there's a lot of different points on the roadmap at which the eth2 network could actually become relevant to applications uh so one example of this would be if we add the white client protocol then potentially you could use the proof of big chain as a kind of hook to get a block of the proof of work chain and then you can get a light client for the brew fork chain right and that's super valuable and you know we need better light clients for the proof of work chain and we need uh better security models for the proof of work chain potentially um and so that is something that could potentially happen you know even before phase one if we wanted um and i guess that would count as uh as east to being main netting one other thing i've talked about is phase one and uh with phase one you have the shards the shards have data on them you can use the data for rollups and roll-ups are already starting to become a really significant thing and i think they're going to become huge over the next year or so so you know if your eth2 network is already a base layer for all the roll-up data then i'd argue it's a main net um so i think um like it's like phase zero is definitely uh or at least the beginning of it and it's still the stage where you know it is an economic test to a large extent but i think uh the time when the e2 network starts having real relevance to things in uh broader ethereum land is uh much sooner than people think great yeah i i've really seen uh layer two is exploding this month um so it's fantastic to see so much of the traffic being shifted and you know we could argue that some of it was necessitated by high gas prices um but it's great that it's happening and i really look forward to shards coming online to even increase that capacity further um buddha if i can get you i'm sorry did you have something can we uh yeah um yeah buddha if i can get you to walk through uh maybe screen share and walk through the launch portal with dan explaining metrics i prefer not sharing my screen right now but i can go um one moment he's going to bring his laptop and set it in front of the camera something something worth stating is um because this is a test net because we saw we actually saw this in madasha we saw um a little bit of technical difficulty at the beginning of the test that we also saw some people just not coming online uh because of the nature of the test net maybe people not uh taking it so seriously i'm i don't really expect technical difficulty today but i am curious uh if those how many validators do we have at genesis [Music] um i'm curious to see the participation rate um you know this could be a ideally we see you know above 80 above 90 percent but there's a chance that we have a a you know a um i think there are like five thousand validators tonight right now okay so hopefully before the 4 000 of them online nolan could you do me a favor and switch to dark mode how do i do that at the bottom nice so the idea is that the blocks we are at is going to be displayed and the uh if a block is proposed it will turn green and if it's if it's missed it will be red and if it's orphaned it will be blue and yeah we have the checklist at the bottom the idea is that the first block that is proposed is very early otherwise that will be a bad thing but we are not really showing if it's going to be a bad thing um what you will see is a check mark next to the first block proposed um title at the bottom and yeah if you reach participation rate above 80 percent that will be a nice thing otherwise you will start sweating yeah and then um because of the way finalities handled in the at the beginning um we even if we see high participation at the zeros and first epoch we won't actually see anything um justified on chain but once we get to that second epoch we can actually see that ideally we can see the justification of epoch 1 and um at the end of epoch 2 simultaneous finalization of uh sorry the justification of epoch 1 and 2 at the same time in the finalization of epoch one um and so in the ideal case we'll see all these box boxes get checked and feel pretty good uh about you know 20 minutes into this into this thing um each epoch is 6.4 minutes each slot is 12 seconds oh my god 10 seconds yeah here we go here we go yeah but we also have zero slot we don't see anything because we have the genesis and then 12 seconds into this thing is when we can see the first block so yeah we also only have one prism node so if our node is on the wrong end it won't display the correct thing so don't take everything for granted okay so it now iterated to the third block nice the first block was proposed good seems like people are seeing attestations and things yeah and the zoom chat give some shout outs if you're seeing stuff uh those who are staking i think there's a few people in here doing that yeah so i got a problem with my tackle client it's just flooding with arrows and my attackers also fallen over nice okay now now that we get the data the blocks are updating the first one was missed so everything is delayed on the front page because we'll get the data first and then update it on the front page are you guys hearing stefan on the other side just a little bit oh god relatively sparse proposal not not great not terrible all right i'm seeing lighthouse validators going prism validators going strong youtube chatter saying there's attestation submitted they're pretty excited got away teku is running well well so many misplugs here gotta track back who does who those validators were and slash them in real life yeah i could imagine that people just deposited just to troll well i we we described this as a launch dress rehearsal and i know that a lot of users are concerned with the deposit prog process they want to make sure that they can create keys and submit deposits and i i feel like some of those users are less focused right now on the chain and more focused on their end user experience of creating keys and submitting deposits they may not be aware of the bigger picture yeah i mean that was definitely that's definitely a major component of why we did this was so people can run through that process hopefully they take it all the way yeah our lighthouse so that's not the best case scenario i don't think we'll hit 80 percent uh patricio there was a question about how long people are able to redeem their poe apps is it just during the call um so once you have your link it doesn't expire and what's important is that you get the link during the call because they won't be delivered afterwards okay so you need to if you are wanting a poe app definitely join the east staker discord if you go into the description in um uh the description of this video there's a link to an uh reddit eath staker post and i believe in the sidebar there's a link to the discord so you can join that join the poep channel paste the url of this video and you'll get an automated message to your discord that has the links to activate your po app and make sure you post that before the end of this video call hey then cred like the error that you just like reported it was fixed last night so if you update it you're not going to see that issue oh okay right it's working now after i restarted it just a slot calculation editor uh pre-genesis but yeah after genesis you should it should be fine i have a lighthouse node and i can't publish messages because of a low pay account do you have your reports forwarded i have 50 pairs right now with nimbus where do you see where the participation is like how close to 80 is it usually the amount of blocks being proposed for epoch is representative of the amount of attestations you'll see um because that's kind of a sample of the larger so protestation's low i mean if you look at that we're in the you know probably 30 40 which is not amazing um well applications can be late as well and then still included yeah for sure and what does it mean when like blocks are missed like there weren't enough validators to confirm them or why does that happen there's a single proposer assigned to each slot um and so if that proposer is offline or having some sort of technical difficulties then they will not propose um so we're at 33 percent i can just confirm that nimbus is proposing box as well we'll go to iran cool so i suppose as long as somebody's having technical difficulties uh i guess thank you had a minor one um generally pleased but i would love to see people come online if we are building a chain and everyone that's running nodes is seeing adequate participation from their own validators then that's that's what i want [Music] yeah it looks like we're going to see the same thing in the future well so i have a feeling we're going to build a relatively uh sparse chain for the next few days unless people decide to come online and this is um this is so much the thing that we wanted to remedy from madasha uh this is uh and it's it's not the end of the world but it is a slow starting chain um is this the result should we just let the inactivity leak to leak everyone by half within a few a few hours the what well i mean the first question is is it actually like people forgetting to start their validators or do we still have issues with the clients right like most like there's not much incentive to be like very prompt about um having you know running when the thing launches like i'm sure there's people who don't even realize that starting your note before the network launches is even a thing you can do uh so all right communicate yeah i mean we'll spend today like the primary thing we want to figure out today is uh do people have technical difficulties and if so we will resolve them or we're people just not online and if that's the case [Music] and there's going to be economic incentive to be live during the actual uh launch of eth2 phase zero is that right danny is that a good thing to kind of yes yeah if you um if you fail to participate uh you lose money um sorry you some of your ethos can noise um and especially if the chain is not finalizing which we're not going to see that in the first few epochs um the amount of capital that you can lose accelerates mariano just proposed slot 43. [Music] very good glad you're online um is anyone on this call seeing any technical difficulties on their own yeah i i am i'm running prison and i i hit genesis time but nothing after that my validators are testing but beacon node doesn't seem to be doing anything um that's interesting um let me dm you and uh we can walk through it no technical difficulty on the taco side but i was the one who registered our first 256 elevators then i registered another set of 256 and with the first 256 validators it's totally on my personal mistake i lost a password so oh my god yeah like this participation is like a bit due to that not all of it just uh giving you a guardian yep wow can't do that on main that bro yeah our lighthouse validation i don't have that there's um i don't have that much anyway i've seen other people that aren't doing portfolios having difficulty finding peers though um which is probably because we've got combined you have to scroll through it to find spadina nodes why why don't we have upnp enabled by default on the clients number size pnp yeah we have an open pl for it um it's yeah we've got it coming because i mean that that's that seems like an obvious issue we're gonna have a lot like so many people are gonna forget this don't think so on the real network to be honest i mean when you're setting up a node you probably want to secure your network a little bit as well um a european p is a little bit too automatic for putting ten thousand dollars on i'd say um like it's fine for following a network when you're just connecting as a read-only node but if you're going to be running a validator do you really want to uh and trust your stake with how is a different technology based on http well what happens is that it sends basically an unencrypted http message to your router and your rather kind of randomly opens that port and and hopefully it works right unless some other application like a game on the same network or whatever is is opening that port at that moment so i'd like in a real network if you're going to be staking i'd really recommend that you do something a lot more stable than you can see right i would still bet that a lot of people forget this it's just one somewhat non-trivial thing to do i'm not port forwarding and i have nine p's on my lighthouse node um but as age said it just takes some time to go through the hc and spot the right nodes that you want to connect to so hopefully justin you uh managed to get some peers so i think this is a good time to summarize and wrap up where we are um so this is the spadina test net launch for the ethereum ii beacon chain phase zero launch of uh of the scaled ethereum solution um this is a dress rehearsal for the launch tooling and what we're seeing is the launch tooling was very effective but we're having the same kind of issue that we had with madasha that is deposits that were submitted are not backed up by by running validators and we're missing block proposals because uh deposited validators are not submitting proposals the the best solution for this is to um so what we have is a nothing at stake problem um these proposers have nothing at stake they're not losing anything by failing to propose this is why non-incentivized networks don't work um we're so we're a perfect case study but um we're going to need to uh review this uh everything from the development side appears to be working perfectly um especially this this dashboard by bitfly is wonderful but where the rubber hits the road is users who submitted deposits don't seem to have been running validators uh to back up those deposits yeah i think we got about 90 of what we wanted out of this we gave users a chance to run through everything we gave ourselves the chance to run through everything we're going to spend some time circling back and seeing what some of those technical difficulties were because i imagine some people didn't turn their nodes on and some people maybe had some technical difficulties whether that be just ux problems trying to figure things out or whether it be port forwarding or any sort of other error so we'll circle back on that but again 90 of what we wanted to see today great thanks danny um i'd like to thank everyone for coming out to the spadina launch party um we're still making progress we have a lot to look forward to we are so close to the phase zero launch um what what we can't do is let a lack of non-incentivized behavior to predict the actual incentivized behavior on phase zero so we'll continue moving ahead um thanks everyone for coming out and we'll look forward to see how this unfolds thanks for your time [Music] [Music] you [Music]
