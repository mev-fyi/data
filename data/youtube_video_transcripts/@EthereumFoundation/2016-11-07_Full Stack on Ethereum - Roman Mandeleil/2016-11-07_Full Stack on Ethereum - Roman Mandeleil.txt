so yep hi guys it's absolutely pleasure to be here in our annual festival et room festival we have it once a year and it's great it's it's total joy and then and yeah I have 20 minutes I have 20 minutes to tell you what eather cam have been done doing this year and what we're planning for you for next month but you're going to see a lot of stuff I'm go briefly and if you want more details you always welcome to come and chat with us but but I want to start with really say thank you I want to start with say thank you because if we thinking about roadmaps planing features a building strategy we are very simple that we just have you and you tell us what to do so if you are not yet on our slack please join this it's either camp and asked us to build something or integrate something and we really will do it for you let's talk about our products and the most famous products is absolutely tedium studio we promised it next last year last year a year ago we actually promised to you this product if we promise to put one button on the website you click it and you get a desktop experience very easy with built-in ET room sandbox all the features of material you can build projects you can do get up you can do come online you can do everything and special tent for our friends in Microsoft Azure who provides us with servers and let us to bring all this experience for you for free so what is the future of this product first of all this year was amazing for me like I had chance to travel the wall and actually see a classrooms of people hackathons and Academy conferences out a both actually doing ET room visit e room studio and I have to say like there is nothing more satisfying in this business then actually see developers working with used to like it's better than everything and if it works it's great like you actually see people using this and building something it's total joy and I have to say like we have absolutely great response from Academy to using ET room and using this tool and we so close with so close to see them including ET room into into real computer science program right for now they just doing workshops and playing with this and we doing with students and I really enjoyed this but they really want to see smart contract solidity go into the real program and they are preparing for this so hopefully wait for announcement soon and by the way special temps for validity labs which are great educational in Europe and if you looking for great educator about the Tea Room just Google validity labs they are really awesome and they will go and do courses for you so this is our first features that we are going to release in week or so it's a full functional debugger I think there is no such a thing as debugger for solidity been asked by all our community like people thought analysis for all this year you should build it and and you're going to have it you're going to see transparency on all the variables call stack function parameters the whole thing so I hope it will like make your development shorter maybe ninety percent right it's the real thing and it was my main focus at last month's we really took everything out and focused on this thing and it's almost ready to be polishing this it's going to be for you in the same studio using today let's talk a little bit about a continuous integration continuous integration in the tearoom is not just like a usual software it's not just something that keep a bugs out of your code no it's it's a real contract it's something that actually says what this smart contract does and and sometimes it can cost money the it can mean a lot of money like for example you know 150 million dollars this is why we spend also some time to figure out how it should be done properly and what we done we actually took a sandbox of etherium studio took it out what what program is called headless right without a UI and we provided it as a sandbox for a command line so you basically a very a very regular javascript javascript testing tools you can have a very nice and very clear a testing continuous integration environments and basically what I believe is going to happen it kind of go in this direction that all the white papers around smart contracts all the meaningful white papers that the deuce is money and real contracts they are going to to have links to real unit async of of solidity because this is the way this is the only way to prove that what you put in your white paper and then in the code actually do the same thing right because and people are going to watch this it's going to be as common as wallpapers and people in enterprise was asking us to use integral studio it's kind of hard for them to use live network so we work is Microsoft and it's already radio on a marketplace it's going to be on marketplace in probably a couple of days right if we tested it and they validated that everything work properly you're going to have the et room studio inside your companies that running Microsoft Azure and you hope you're going to have it inside the marketplace ok next one ET room J theorem jada infrastructure that we run into roomies together with go and rust this is what running our life network right this is what we have so the community around the tearoom j has very nice a very nice way to go different directions and it was pleasure to support them in all different ways i go very fast on what we have seen with this people working on a song on different levels sometimes formally sometimes not formally and doing really great things because we really provide this library for customization and like take it and do whatever you want on the tea room with the tea room behind the tea room so what we had and this is not all of them but actually fraction of them but is the guys that i can tell about right so Deloitte really announced grated identity project in New York couple of months ago they've been really busy showing everybody about this identity project very very interesting because the law it really knows how a tentative works and they took our a Java and build identity project on top of this and you you should check it you should check it if you looking for good a blockchain based identity project you probably read about Claire Maddox they're doing something very cool they they doing settlements between banks they took the Java and customize this to the private change and they doing this communication between finance institution for settlement for for settlement a settlement cones gemini gemini they exchange for in New York a big legal exchange compliant and and doing deuterium trading with all the other currencies with dollars also it's a bank they running a tearoom j four different connection and have very nice a cold storage solution also using the same library a triple ur global is a customizing stuff they doing different projects a globally a day also in good connection with us and customize the library according to the according to the to the order some time they're great guys so in a minute I will tell you what we're doing with something there and why are they here rootstock smart contracts on bitcoin you probably heard about this what is rootstock it's nice a start-up in Argentina and they really want they day is so excited about smart contracts on a tea room and they want to bring it to Bitcoin just to Bitcoin that we know and what they have they have the Bitcoin block chain as we know it and they took out a java implementation as it is is a transitory room and they run it as a side chain to the Bitcoin blockchain so they have talking inside this and basically they can run it's the same virtual machine for now they have some plans and we talking to them about how they're going to develop in the future but now they just running the same material as a sign chain so what it gives us it gives us really great opportunity you can take the same materials to do the same smart contracts that you have today and basically have them in Bitcoin environment it should be cool right thank you ok some guys don't understad appreciate thank you thank you guys thank you a very very soon they are going to open their a test environment for everybody and they asked us basically to announce about this and we are looking for the same a good developers that we have only tea room environment to actually try it on a bitcoin environment we have been trying this ourselves but it I think it is an opportunity here for people for who looking for a adventures let's go next theorem harmony we announced this like about a week ago it's our way to use it in room Jake or because people want I was asking us for good tools like just provide us with better tools on all the networks private consortium public and we've been like okay you're asking for two good tools we will give you good tools because we also the users of the block chain and we also need a better tools so ET room harmonium is going to be your a private peer that basically provides you with a very nice view on the blockchain no matter which theorem block chain your onion you going to see to use harmony and you you're going to see what's going on to the blockchain you're going to see what's going on with your peers just google for a tearoom harmon you will see video you will see all the nice features that we have there from the first release and this is the least i will run with it I'm I have like eight minutes left and I promise to me i'm not going to hell with the time this time yes I I watching the time okay hey next one okay so let's talk about the Banco de Santander and they are here and we are happy to see them sponsoring this event together with us and more cool companies and these guys asked us to build something really cool because we believe in live network we believe in life launching much more than in any other block chain and I will show it to you first okay i will show it to so think about the idea that you have just plain regular bank account in bank code isn't on there and then suddenly you have this nice button you have this this nice button on your account and you can click it and you can generate a signature which is basically your private key okay and boom you have a PT room account attached to your bank account in banco de Santander thank you it sounds good and you like it right okay let's go next and then you can take part of your money and sign it with the signature and basically get some improvement process inside the bank and get this money tokenize on smart contract lining running on life it didn't block chain so now you have two accounts you have one account that is your money and another account that has tokens which are backed by a real money in reserve inside band one isn't on there and these tokens are fast and support all the standards of the theorem tokens right so this gives us the agility to build really really cool features on top of it like this we can have a widget on any blog on any website and basically ask you to pay very small fractions of a dollar and of a euro a even smaller than this right we can go five cents or maybe a fraction of a cent if this is the value of the visual product and you do it very easy you just give your brain wallet signature which is a private key and you approve it and you basically pay with this balance that you tokenize and what good in this tokenization you can go back you basically can go back in any time you can take these tokens and you turn them into real a euro sir doors inside the bank we have this system running now on a tearoom a more than network which is the tearoom test official network it's it it's running there all the time this is the smart contract that you can check this I don't show you the name you can find it easily but it runs about a month checking scalability and different options to a work with this so a what's going to be next with this project we have this it's not a prototype it's much more than the prototype it's a working system of the test Network we are going to take it life like I didn't see a bank guys a so determined to take it life to solve all the regulation problems this is what we're doing in these days we solving real real a regulation problem to make it happen and we are very very excited about make it make it work on real Network we are going to open the sandbox for people who want to build applications like one that I just shown to you on top of this idea so even if even before kasia th going live you can go and build your own products on top of it and oh 10 yeah this is this is cool if you want more details come and chat with us come and chat with guys from sandton there we are here it's very easy to find us on the on distance and let's talk about our list and cool a staff that they are doing very cool we opened hack either came for registration a couple of weeks ago what we got for this virtual hackathon we got almost thousand Hawkins registered now and more than phonecalls people like not developers like observers we already see long long list of ideas like more than 200 ideas that people actually trying to implement in trying to go in implement during this event what we didn't told tell you this is going to be much more than a hackathon and this is why we call it a virtual accelerator because what we're trying to do we trying to find the right place in the right stage for capital and startups to meet and kind of solve all the problems that they have in real life before they take off as a real business and we really want real businesses to come out of these five weeks a event five weeks hackathon and we built a great social interaction experience event a system system that you call a we're going to be able to use it's going to be open as the event or going to be open so all the startups are go to have this a option to show what they're doing to show their team to show how they build not just what they build because it's also important for the investors and we got awesome team of judges to check and we call it value it by experience to give their opinion by votes to these startups and actually to pick the best of them by voting voting on the blockchain rather don't know better way to do transparency we're going to have much more we're going to allow these startups to initiate talking talking backed by their idea backed by their projects and and give to the free market give to the free market also the way to evaluate what is the worth of this idea what is the value of this project so I'm going to have to system evaluation one actually voting by experience and one valuating by market very soon we are going to publish the white paper so stay tuned stay register then we are going to let you know about the wiper that going to actually formalize all the process and you're going to see how it all eventually going to work and the startup that will stay here on the first row at the end of the competition is going to get a fifty thousand dollars from us in crypto currency but we believe as I say we are going to see much much more winners because this is the stage for startups to take their idea as fast as possible to be a real company and continue build more and more a feature around this okay I have one more minute it's more than enough mean is watching me closely Mike now okay guys burrows burrows is nice nice nice bar like five minutes from here like just across just across the bridge and we have it for tonight and we want to invite you to come and chat with us let us buy you drink and let's continue this dialogue about what I just described about blockchains about the future was broken before because we know we know exactly where we are going but a be still figuring out the next steps right so the future really has not been written yet so let's write it together thank you you
