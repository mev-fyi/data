hey so we're gonna wait one or two more minutes give people a chance to join and then we'll kick things off give everyone a chance to select the right virtual background they prefer the most I feel really lame for it not knowing how you do that right now okay I think a lot of people have gone to this learning curve in the last couple weeks if you go to settings there's a virtual background tab and then you can use one of their presets or you can insert your own image I've been yeah I've been using this one sometimes why is that not nifty areumdawo org background check well actually i you just gave me an idea give me a two seconds here and then we'll be ready here we go I can't see much folks I'm in the way of it okay all right I think we're probably ready get started thank you everyone for joining I'll share my screen so we can kind of work through this document together and I also posted a link in the chat which you should have already seen to like the notion page for this so that's what kind of be using for the agenda so to kick things off yeah thank you for taking the time to join I really appreciate it I know people are busy I know there's a lot else going on in the world right now we really appreciate the chance to get feedback from you and hear your ideas so I guess first of all who are we my name is Josh my colleague Sam is also on the call and we are two people that work on theory ugh there's many more people that contribute I show up somewhat the tail is the call who manages the translation program which is broader than just aetherium org but is the program that we've kind of used to translate lots of the site over the last several months so there's many other people as well to contribute to the theory of new org we're not the only ones but we'll be the kind of ones you know on the call today so what is the purpose of the call the basic idea is that you know we want to make sure that we are finding ways to involve people that we are you know gathering feedback that we are sharing our ideas and getting responses to them so every month or two we're holding holding these community calls this is the second one we've ever done we're continuing to iterate on them just a reminder I mentioned this earlier we are recording this call and the recording will be posted to YouTube afterwards so make sure you're okay with that this was something that people requested when we got on the call last time so that is kind of my introduction we're gonna go through a couple things you know both salmontail and have a bit of kind of like updates to give about recent changes and additions to the site and then we'll kind of open it up for discussion we have one thing and particularly we want to get some feedback on but if there's other things that you want to talk about suggestions you want to make you know problems you want to point out we'll turn over to you for mostly call so quickly to follow-ups from the last call one is the recordings already mentioned that the second is we talked last time about kind of sharing more of the research we did to define the user personas for aetherium org and there's a link here in this document that again is in the chat to a memo that is just kind of a summary of our thoughts on this so it is you know a description of what the user personas are for aetherium org in our view the research we did to kind of determine that and then you know some of the information that we've collected and that Sam has recently updated with with up to date figures so if you're into this kind of thing take a look might be interesting to you to kind of understand what we're coming from if you see you know flaws in our analysis things that you want to point out things we can think about differently you're gonna add a comment directly to the document by kind of clicking on any any content so that's a that's it for kind of my updates salmon town I'll let you guys kind of run through the next bits here I'll jump it if I have any comment but otherwise I'll leave it to you to kind of talk about what we've added the site recently dean you wanna kick it off is she muted oh yeah your honor there we go hi my name is tan I think this is the first time to introduce the translation program at the community call do we have time to explain how this works very briefly like before sharing the updates yeah please go ahead okay yeah so the translation program is aiming to lower the language barrier within the is there ecosystem so our goal is to help community members of learning English speaking regions including me to learn if they're even their mother tongues our program is mainly led by the volunteers from all over them all over the world we are cooperating with each other by using the translation program platform called Crowden the process consists of three staff first translation second review lastly integration so when the translation is completed our professional video service provider will proofread the quality of translation and then our github contributors will take over the final version to interpreting state their work yeah which takes about like three two and three weeks and yeah and more so that's a brief intro introduction of the translation program if any way interesting please feel free to join us need more contributors now and latest updates we have so the last few weeks we've finally added new language Swedish and Indonesian while Germans will in Arabic have been upgraded into the latest version 1.1 regarding the Persian update I will explain shortly additionally Romanian Turkish and Arabic persons are some review so we're expecting them to be online within one or two weeks yeah lastly I will explain our new version management system yeah our website is getting more complex over the time by adding new contents and language so yeah we've felt a need for introducing a Persian management system that can better track different stage of each language how this work yeah as you already have seen in the crowding we've created new folders with different version numbers which simply divided into version 1.0 and person 1.1 firstly personal 1.0 is the very first version of the thermal org most existing languages are remaining at this stage which indicates like a 48 percent personal 1.1 is the latest version in crowding which contains the latest contents on our current websites where are we now we are working towards person 1.1 in the near future we'll add new contents for version 1.2 we'll probably include a recent updated community page and more this person updates will be conducted regularly and planning the lights of the overall progress of the translation in each language why do we need this yeah some of you sent a feedback to me the addition of the ladies content has dropped the progress percentage significantly like some of them drop in the even job in half yeah which is like 50% yeah so this radical change could potentially lower the motivation of volunteer of all and I thought it will confuse newcomers or to start so by setting up different milestone I think our country readers can keep motivated and stay on track without feeling overwhelmed yeah this is my site yeah please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or good feedback thank you thank you to you yeah and I just dropped a couple links into this update section of the call notes so if people are curious particularly the page if you you know org slash languages that provides a lot of info of not only just the progress of each translation if you're eager to follow along but ways to get involved such as like joining our slack workspace that's just dedicated for the translation program itself so if you want to get involved we encourage you to to check it out we'd love to have you in terms of my updates so one big initiative we've been working on the past few months if you were here for our first community call back in January and you heard me talk about this but essentially rolling out a new design system on a theorem org which is composed of two main elements one being design principles and I linked to that again in the call notes but that's really just a brief document outlining like what are what is the guiding compass of aetherium orgs design and the purpose here is to really like give a common ground for the theorem org team and the community at large you may want to make a contribution of just like what our again you know these guiding principles that can help us make decisions any design decision any new page or feature is ultimately going to come with trade-offs how do we make decisions try to take those trade-offs into account it'll always be a work in progress so if you guys have feedback about it you know feel free to hit us up on Twitter open an issue whatever's more approachable for you definitely looking to continue to get feedback there the second piece the design system is really just like the design itself so we worked with a couple designers in the community to build a style guide in figma and over the past month we've been working with one designer in particular to actually implement that style guide and what we're hoping this will give is just a lot more consistency to the site hopefully a better user experience overall as well as just like reusable components that again if any contributor wants to say create a new page on the site they have like this tool kit to work with and that's like I'd say 90% complete we should be finished with that at least the first iteration of that by the end of the month which is pretty exciting so again open to feedback on all this stuff but that's one major focus we've been pushing on what else do we have I should just note to Sam that a lot of these changes already live on the site so if you refer that the site you'll notice that a lot of this has actually changed recently in terms of how the links work the styling the footer things like that layout changes are coming next to a lot of these pages but many of these things are live already right and a big piece of this yeah just to reiterate like with our design principle of just like modularity of you know over the past nine months the content on the site maybe hasn't changed too significantly but we're hoping these design rollouts can get us in a place where it's much easier to add additional content and I think something we can discuss is like that will be a focus for our team for the remainder of the year of just like now that the sites in a good place where it is modular and scalable we can really start to add a lot more content that the community finds useful any questions on that before I move on feel free to send something in the chat but content what I just brought up another piece we've been working on is just I mean the etherium org team as you can see is pretty small and we have our own blind spots right like we have our own perspective and experience and knowledge of aetherium but one thing we know for sure is like we do not know everything and we do not know what is best for aetherium org so an initiative we kicked off at the beginning of this year was recruiting what we called a tiger team of people domain experts community members within the etherium space who could give us feedback and propose new initiatives specific to content and what we did was essentially worked with a handful of individuals to take on one persona of aetherium org and that was the individuals persona so if you think like the what is aetherium page the wallets page the daps page and just trying to collect a lot of diverse feedback about hey what is this page trying to solve does it solve it what on the page should change and what gaps are there and we get a lot of good feedback from that first content audit that we're really right now in the process of just kind of synthesizing and turning into concrete action items which you'll see reflected as github issues pretty soon and all that to kind of rally for if there are any like developers on the call or people who are particularly interested in developer relations or developer education our next step is really going to be focusing on all developers content on etherium org and how we can improve the existing content remove content that's not useful and add new content where there are just like gaps out in the community of hey there's this one topic area or specific tooling that really doesn't have much documentation or information about it so we are accepting applications now you can see the link in the call notes if you have any interest in getting involved with that I would love to chat with you it's just a brief survey just kind of getting a gist of you know what is your experience with software development aetherium software development specifically and areas you might be interested in helping out with so if you again you know are interested or know someone who might be interested in doing this yeah we'd love to love to get you involved so just a quick question regarding user personas and how you guys see the content odd is going moving forward where do roles such as business marketing design kind of lay within those two personas of individuals and developers at this point it's good question yeah I would say it's a bit of both right so for example let's say you have a person who has a background marketing but you know doesn't work in the field yet his might be relatively new to aetherium I haven't expected that user to be covered by individuals and they might be interested in for example going to the etherium community page and then going to you know the sexual how I can get involved in reading about how you know if I have marketing skills I can do things here too right we kind of have a path for that on the other hand maybe a designer who you know maybe already works in the space is more familiar maybe they have a technical question because they are they work in a technical field they might be well served by you know checking in aetherium studio to understand how like you know the front end of their design might interact with a smart contract they I'd be interested in you know going to kind of other starting tools served by this page so I'd say it kind of depends a little bit on who it is but for the most part I'd say that they're served by the individuals or the developers users on does that make sense Akhil I'm not sure if I answered your question completely uh yeah so I'm just trying to figure out like what's the because we have clear flows for both individuals and for developers I'm wondering if there's a way to guide the learning for those individuals in a more frame manner if but if possible I don't know if it's even possible I see there's like a huge area kind of buried on the developers side of things right if I get surf is that better somehow so people know that the resources exist yeah I guess the point need to get a little bit more thinking on that yeah I think yeah and so but I was just gonna say I mean it I think it's a great question it's something we've talked a lot about because ultimately we know that personas we have right now are imperfect right like even for a developer you know they might be involved in enterprise and they're also probably an individual so it can create some confusion no matter who you are of like where exactly to go ultimately we decided to just go with something and we went with these three simple personas well we've talked a lot about doing in the future and as we continue to develop content is just having like subcategories within each for instance on like the what is aetherium page right now we just have one blanket explanation of what is aetherium but we all know that Thiam is multifaceted it means different things to different people and it appeals to different people in different ways so we've thought about you know adding additional subsections of like you know are you a marketer like learning how this applies to you are you a lawyer so I feel like they're definitely our ways where we can get more granular about this and I think that's a big reason like we tried to publish the user persona research is because one we're hoping it might be useful to other projects in the space but two is like we know there's blind spots within it that we would love feedback and ideas on so yeah if like if you come up with an idea of like hey this website is nice but it's really not cater to product managers or designers at all like in terms of tools for them to learn communities for them to get involved in even raising the question is helpful for us because right now we're just using our best judgment in terms of what to focus on good ok so I think next up Sam was just note about studious implication and then pretty plain boundaries right all right Thanks so a theorem studio you folks may be familiar with if you explore the developers resources at all you'll probably see some call-outs to it the goal of this project is really just to give someone a quick idea of like the etherium stack in you know 5 to 50 minutes if you will depending on how much time they want to spend poking around but it's meant to provide you know like a code sandbox like feel hopefully something an existing software developer is familiar with and can get a quick concept up and running so we have a couple like template projects that people can explore ways to compile and actually deploy their contract and interact with their DAP in this like preview browser so we released that late last year and since then I've gotten a lot of helpful feedback from folks and what we've been really doing is just trying to like trim out a lot of the features actually and just make the UI as simple as possible just because it can be a lot for even an experienced developer to kind of hop in and see all these different pieces and how they interact so yeah again just continuing to iterate on this try to simplify it I linked to the github of this project if you guys do have ideas one thing we want to do in the coming future is run some sort of competition around different templates that can you know demonstrate the value of aetherium and like why it's unique and valuable so stay tuned for that stuff and lastly related to that i'm just keep up on the radar for you folks if you are developers we will be releasing a bunch of git coin bounties within the next few weeks over the past six months I'd say we ran some very small experienced experiments maybe like 20 bounties for a total of like 3000 dollars but we had like really good success and engagement with that in terms of just people hopping in opening pull requests closing issues so right now we're going through process getting approval with the etherion foundation to like set up a much more streamlined flow where we can really try to scale up our bounty program and yeah again if you're considering different ways of getting involved I think that's an awesome way just to you know build up your github resume make some money in your free time and obviously get to contribute to open source which hopefully people find exciting that's it in terms of updates on my end cool thanks Sam so this is the part where we turn over to you um you know like I said I've got kind of one question I was gonna ask but maybe well it's first to see if anyone has any like Bernie issues that they want to talk about anything that you know ideas they have you know things they came here to complain about like you know stuff that could be better you know please the floor is open so I guess I'll get started again I can't a very over these issue I'm doing research in regards to eat - um you waxed and the initial indications we got from the community were like 35 percent of the people still look to that different foundation for all their information so I'm just wondering what's in the pipelines as far as getting to information onto the website and especially with things such as deposit ceremony there's gonna be a lot of issues with phishing attempts and other security concerns so I think we need some sort of source of truth for individuals to go to to learn about a - and how to kind of get on board it when it does the Phase II or does go live in the next few months so I'm wondering if there's that anything in the plans for that so the short answer I guess there's a couple things on this one is that so there's an important distinction between aetherium gorg and if you're in foundation obviously some people that work for or work on aetherium or like myself and like Sam work for the etherium foundation but really a theorem dog or is just like a website that is built by many people in the community about aetherium so it should not be considered like the event of like you know official communication channel foundation that more is the blog like the blog is kind of the source of you know all of these you know if two short updates that Danny knows have been writing this is kind of the official communication channel or anything coming out of the foundation so that is probably more likely where you're gonna see that kind of thing in so let me that's the kind of preface in terms of a theorem you org if to stuff specifically you know right now we have some resources on the site about this but there's no sort of kind dedicated page that is something I would like to change in the coming months you know as you know the next kind of phase goes live there's going to be more attention on this people are going to have more questions I think there ought to be a dedicated if two page on the site the content for that just doesn't exist yet and the people you know with the knowledge to create it are kind of busy getting us to that milestone so it is in the pipeline and we could certainly very use the priority of that but it is not you know coming up immediately next in terms of how you know the foundation and the R&D teams work any two should communicate about things like that to pause the ceremony I'm not sure we can definitely talk about that now and I love to hear your insights about it Akhil but it's not something that the etherium dorbz team has thought about specifically does that answer your question on the make sure I'm not kind of skipping over anything important there yeah that's I think the clarification between the community aspect of it and the blog is quite important and then making sure that we highlight those blog posts within the context of the website and as I think probably the best way forward for that it's a way for people to surface that information faster in a more linear manner and I suppose yeah but I definitely agree that there needs to be kind of clear communication around these things and make sure that there is you know good information out there about it and that we minimize the risks that you mentioned yeah thank you I I agree with you a hundred percent I mean it's a page that probably should exist I feel like we can definitely do a better job of just empowering people to help make that happen to like after this call I'll create an issue like generate a discussion for Annie's 2.0 page but I I guess I just want to say like anyone does have the power to potentially do that of create an issue on the github repo say like hey I think this is a page that should exist maybe here's a couple resources or newsletters or blog posts that I think should be included on the page and that would really help to kick-start at the discussion and make it happen I would say like one thing we just don't have a dedicated like say content writer or curator on the site right now but we do have people in the community helping out with that I can give you one example from this week just hopping in an EIP ip meeting and we talked about just like the lack or like the gap of knowledge for a lot of people of there's really no introduction to the etherium improvement proposals and how that process works so someone volunteered to write an introduction page that hopefully will get included on a theorem org so I think that just goes to show like people can make it happen if there is a need for that type of content and like you say people do look to the theorem org as a trusted source information and then we can make the decision from there hey does this make sense or should we just you know throw a couple links out to these other trusted sources and direct people there if the information is already available elsewhere so in that regard you just mentioned that you guys don't have a copywriter are you does the theorem produce any content at this point or is it usually just all external we do I'd say Josh you could definitely answer better yeah I'd say the short is it's a mix of people who uh yeah I mean so you know parts of the site are really you know just a portal other content right so if you look at the developer resources page that is mostly you know summaries and links to outside content some of the parts of the site do have more written content like the you know what is aetherium page is kind of a blog post you know some of the other pages like the page is about like daps and eath have some content we're going to be expanding that after the like content audit that Sam mentioned so there is a need for that anyone that's interested in contributing copy to aetherium org definitely like get in touch with me I'd love to chat with you and hear what you're interested in doing we do also rely on you know community contributions you I mean you can go back and kind of look for the good of history but lots of people have you know submitted changes of wording to certain pages we have asked people to submit you know what is the right way to explain this concept and that's amazing to kind of parts of the site so it is kind of a combination of many different sources it's a bit like I mean to be clear like it's not like there's gonna be kind of a the way you'd normally think of like a Content copywriter who is like you know constantly just producing blog posts like that's not the goal the goal is that you know the content that is on the site is great and that it can reflect what's needed and then we have the capability to add the new pages we need to add and you know add the content we have to add so in any case if anyone's interested in doing that definitely get in touch with me and I look to hear more about it okay anyone else kind of an idea a question something they came here to say floors open okay well I can kick it off with so I mentioned that I had kind of one issue that we were trying to think our way through and maybe this group can help us do that one kind of so if you're looking at the shared screen that I've got here let me just pull an example up so one kind of recurring challenge we have across the site is the following we have pages like a theorem walls and we list some wallets on this page and a big question is what wallets ought to go here one thing that happens is you know people will submit PRS with you know the wall that they've just launched that might don't have any users and maybe it's a great wallet but you know how do we decide what goes on this page and what doesn't so far we've relied on you know asking people in the community asking people who have a lot of experience thinking about kind of waltz and use your experience we're definitely making some changes to this list following the content audience and mentioned but it's a recurring question you know in a way this is kind of a governance question who gets to decide what get listed here it shouldn't be everything but you know there should be a circle of people that can contribute to this you know we have a similar question with the user theory impeach which lists some applications we are going to be changing this list but there's still a persistent question of how do we decide what goes on here how do we make sure that we're not sending people to a really bad application that's gonna leave them with a bad experience if it was their first time we're using aetherium but we also want to make sure that we're you know bringing attention to good stuff that comes out of the community so this is a challenge that we're wrestling with right now and and then we're thinking about different solutions too and I'd love to know if anyone on this call has any thoughts about the right way to do that you know things to avoid things not to do with good ideas you have open floor again to share your thoughts on this yeah just I'm really quickly I mean this is an idea that just came to my mind I just read it in the chat but if there is a publicly available set of criteria for Wallace to feature and for other sorts of tools that you guys featuring TV Norg then I think that could be really helpful and I mean a criteria can be obviously constantly updated and people can add to that set of criteria but I think if the community can come to an agreement on like what do we want in like a really awesome wallet like what we look for like ads the cult like you know kind of collect a group of people then that's like one way to judge Wallace you guys can feature because otherwise it would just that list we'd get way too long and be a little bit unhelpful right right do you've any opinions about what those criteria ought to be yeah I put in the chat I think with number of users privacy guarantees are super important I think like maybe dividing like I mean for the wallet for example like dividing up kind of Wallace that are like custodial wallets and wallets that you know or maybe more can guarantee anonymity you know just kind of thinking about like the norms community kind of I'm takes into account and like dividing that list of wallets up against those norms just build on the criteria so things there's a few Google sheets that exist whoever people are trying to solve this problem already so one's kind of led by Billy right Billy and then there's a few others that just popped up so we've been kind of looking at seeing what's the best way to do that so one of the suggestions was having at least like top five type situations suggestion for new users that come into the ecosystem and that's based on an aggregate of all the different criteria that are there and then you can choose how you want to weigh them but that gets a bit more complicated so I think once those those resources are out you can probably plug into them and not have to do that work yourself but it could be an option you know where I can find those I do remember seeing the one that really shared on Twitter but are there like where would I go to find these other ones I'll have to I'll paste them in the notion and just knowing that Sam added to the note document here that there is an issue already about this I think that's already existed right Sam yeah from February about kind of what these criteria should be so if anyone has other thoughts like feel free to jump into this issue and add things maybe we'll even take the notes from the discussion here that like Helena suggested for example and kind of paste them into this conversation oh thanks Martin okay so that's you know that's kind of one that's the wallet side of things another is obviously how to think about you know what gaps go up here and maybe another way of tackling this and getting your feedback would be to say you know from your perspective like what are the kinds of applications that we should be sharing with someone who's new to the theory right cuz you know this this page is really about someone who's pretty new to this and they're excited by what they've read and what they've heard about aetherium and they go here and they're like cool I want to use it and we want to you know kind of give them some sort of experience that you know it's positive that is inspiring that you know they have like an impact on or has an impact on them is there have any thoughts on like you know how we should think about that like what is the ideal experience of starting to do that and maybe one of the non-ideal experience is to try and avoid no opinions none at all Sam give any thoughts on this yeah I mean it's something we've talked about it's it's definitely a tricky situation like I think for one similar to the wallet curation we were just talking about is like there needs to be hopefully some sort of quality threshold of like hey you need to meet this certain bar I don't know what the right objective measures are in terms of like number of users or you know amount of value transacted but the last thing we do the last thing we want is to show an application that someone goes in doesn't understand potentially get scammed or loses money somehow right so there's that minimum threshold of like security and usability but to your point I think there are just like tears of experience with if you make ecosystem broadly and potentially just like financial literacy that are worth taking into account so one thing we've talked about doing you know is like creating at least at like a very simple type like app store experience where we can at least like categorize certain applications that could let the user pick their own journey like maybe they just want to play a very simple game where they can learn like oh here's how you can you know like play a lottery versus like here's some you know set protocol have a basket of different investments like that is much more geared toward someone who understands you know portfolio management at a high level so it's a tricky question because we do see such a broad range of experience but it is mostly new people who even them may have completely different backgrounds when it comes to finance or legal or environmental stuff so yeah it's something we we'd love and put on from folks I would think you could take some guidance from the keyword that people search for so if people are searching for stable coins perhaps you surfaced those stats a bit higher than let's say I'm looking at the list here mcdeere and absent theorem games only get like six thousand searches per month whereas something like stable coins get seventy thousand so perhaps you guys could do some more further analysis on what kind of resources are links feet into the content for theorem every now and then go accordingly to that yeah yes I think that's a great idea I would want to read too much of that I guess just because I I mean this is this is a hypothesis but I think that probably a lot of people that end up on this page who can most benefit for from it don't even know what to search for right like they might not even understand that there are such things as aetherium games and so they're not searching for it they like don't even know what questions to ask when they get to this page and so I wouldn't want to read too much into the search volume because I expect the search volume is an indicator of what people know once they know more but not necessarily the kind of user we're looking for here I'm not sure if that's right but it's kind of a thought that I had about kind of avoiding reading too much into this Sam you can tell me if that's totally wrong based on your experience Sam yeah that's fair right it's like to give context everybody I mean the large majority of search volume around aetherium is four it's like head terms like aetherium what is aetherium what's in aetherium wallet but you do get a lot of targeted search volume as akhil mentioned for stable coins or defy or specific projects in that space which you kind of do have to make some level of assumption of just like what is the intent or level of understanding but I would say people searching for a theme stable coins probably have a pretty good sense of what aetherium is and aren't exactly the people coming from the what is a theory on page to learn about daffs so that's a challenge we face but I think Akhil you do bring up a good point of like we can start with a the high keyword search volume and at least give that as an option for people to learn more about we've talked a lot about creating you know industry pages or application pages use cases whatever you want to call it where we do explain hey here's some concrete tangible examples of like what people are building on aetherium and what it is used for so again going back to that like App Store analogy if gaming or finance is a category that could give us a way to start to explain those concepts whether you are a newcomer or whether you came here specifically looking for that topic so I'm just noting so in the chat James suggested you know one way we could maybe solve this problem is as far as some of the kind of risks you mentioned Sam would be to have applications listed here that are built on test net and so we can kind of more easily send them to a faucet to get test net eath and then they don't have to like the the bar is a bit lower to do that I don't you've any any thoughts on on that or James if you want to kind of add to that picture feel free yeah I mean I like that a lot personally I think anytime we can start with a sandbox environment get people comfortable with the tools if it is Mehta mask or whatever other wallet this person's using and installing not having to actually go through a ktyc process to acquire ease in order to participate but instead just go to a faucet website to get some tokens to me yeah that's like a much to lower barrier to onboarding someone and less risk overall so yeah I like that idea a lot I'm I'm just curious I really don't even know like how many applications out there have you know test net experiences for them such as you know pool together or various other ones but that's something I'll definitely look into you after yeah yeah I'm not sure that's kind of my concern - is that the the user experience in other ways of a test NetApp might be a lot worse because people are probably not gonna put the same resources into it as they're going to put into their actual maintenance release and also that some of the test net faucets are just literally broken and don't work out yeah I think the other consideration is just the trade-off of more education of what is a test net wait yeah there's multiple different universes where aetherium lives parallel to each other there is risk of overwhelm in that sense but maybe it is worth the benefit if you can get someone up and running in a quicker low-risk environment okay and just noting Gabriele added some suggestions in here too about I'm not familiar with Daffy Duck PS but a couple links that I'll check out later so Gabriel thank you for sharing those and you added the repo - oh yeah and you saying okay I'm Stan cool okay I mean we're coming to the close State at the time anyone else

happy to call it there and say goodbye till next time hi this is hurry yes sorry I came in a bit late so I'm sure our loss of context you know that sort of to two angles so I'm coming from is so I work as community at the scan and we have a lot of user emails and a lot of them are sort of new ish kind of people and just throwing out there such that if there's any way we can sort of lead them to the resources that you guys have mentioned that would be that's something that you can offer [Music] yeah then separately so I'm an organizer of one of the hearing me ups mine is in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia so we'll be running it for about kind of two years now and so there's this bean pots that we've had around how me ups can help onboard people from the local areas and so there's two sides to it one is how to help keep the mediums sustainable without sort of relying on on handouts or responses and at the same time if we can come up with like a project that is coordinated between the various media organizers with with each dot org as a kind of like a template provided in a way so that there is a consistency between a different slow local chapters you can call them that yeah that's it so they can be sort of projects that we do around that and kind of like what you guys mentioned is if there's a realness to it and with the with the added sort of angle of having a local person to to help you out it might so help get people more interested yeah definitely I should mention that you so hurry do you know art is your meetup so we have this page right community and we yeah yeah what is it is it on there yep yeah oh great okay don't see it but it's Malaysia I think Oh excellent okay it's not kay oh yeah cool I just want to make sure that you're already on there oh cool and ice also mentioned I think maybe we can connect afterwards but I know that there's some work starting to be done by so a few people in the interior condition in terms of just trying to kind of map out the meet-up ecosystem and understand it better and you know maybe kind of do some of the you know support and and coordination activities you mentioned so maybe let's message afterwards and I can figure out who's doing that right now and connect them to you so it sounds like there might you might already have some ideas that they could benefit from and in terms of you know how to kind of use your your user base your mailing list to kind of help promote content definitely something we'd love to have help with our most of your users developers or I mean like what is the kind of demographic like would they benefit from you know for example a blurb about aetherium studio and you know the kind of getting started resources on a three-room dorg would that be like so it's beneficial for your audience so a breakdown of the users would be roughly like half are considering themselves as super like normal users so like very basic stuff and maybe a quarter would say they're developers well great I mean maybe it's a my can go away and think about this but we'd be very happy to you know maybe add a write a short little blurb or you know some links that we think are you know the best starting point for a totally new person who's no developer as well as a link about you know where developers can get started I think I'd be very helpful yeah her if I just add I mean similar to have pooja thank you for offering to share just like frequently asked questions but if there are like continuous questions that you get maybe you guys just don't have the bandwidth to you you know like add to your knowledge base whatever that question may be we'd love to know because you guys are the ones on the front lines interacting with a lot of users and their struggles or just their gaps in information so if there's like pages we should be creating that just don't exist out there we definitely love to hear from you in terms of like where we could help yeah so we do get a lot of support tickets I will double-check with the support team and I can let you know what are some sort of Helium questions that they are always asked awesome thank you yeah I'd be very interested to see the support ticket for either skin I'm sure that you do a very high positive with those providing such an essential service cool okay we're at time everybody so I think we'll call it there thank you again for joining we really appreciate it and hope to see some of you on the next community call as well thanks everybody thanks everyone stay safe stay sane see you next time
