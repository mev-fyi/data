hello everybody so I'm here I'm gonna speak a little bit about developer communities and how Kerry is trying to drive further a developer adoption for the etherium ecosystem and the projects for dinner and talk about the EF grant that we received and how we've been using that so current community landscape for krypter projects as many of you familiar consists of developers users and thirdly token holders with few exceptions the most successful projects today have really strong core developer ecosystems building on top of them and we can learn a lot from the lessons of web 2 and apply that to web 3 we don't need to reinvent the entire playbook so there you have it this is how many of us think of our communities but in many cases this is what makes a really healthy web 3 community and that user group you want it to expand to take over and make all token holders users as well but really what's important is that core kernel the developers so now we're just going to focus on that developer ecosystem and what to do that and some of these lessons can be learned and applied to user groups in more technical ecosystems but for now I'm just gonna focus on developers so one key component is have a technical community manager for technical communities it's really important that people can get into the code answer questions come up with creative demos really inspire your your users your developers a lot of times in this ecosystem we see pre-product people investing in marketing and big pushes it's way more effective if people can actually get into the code or play around with a test net or an SDK and the best teams so this is based off of 30-plus interviews with developer community managers and developer relations both in web 2 and web 3 the best teams are focusing on key metrics and relentlessly iterating keeping their eye on those key metrics and just making sure that they're getting the engagement and the adoption that they'd like to see this is a framework which I really like for measuring the impact that you can have on a developer community it's from Phil ligado of next mer and he has taken the pirate metrics of startups so R and then taking it all the way through the product cuz there's a loop back and a cycle there and it starts with awareness so why should I use your platform what is it just knowing that it's out there then second acquisition it's not good enough just to know that it's out there like I need a relationship with you is it about either it's an NPM install which is a little bit harder to track with metrics but you can use email strategies these types of things having an engaged platform where people can ask questions where people can interact with your content get in touch with you and what's really important is that this cycle flows all the way down into products so if your community is not really involved in the decisions that you're making in product and potentially even contributing to the codebase you're missing a big opportunity of that so what does Kerry do Kerry is really focused on the first couple of areas so it's awareness for your project and acquisition so people taking the first step actually using your technology for the first time and our main focus is the etherium ecosystem and the tools libraries and frameworks within the ecosystem and there are three main within our community there are three main types of users so there are the readers who are coming to Kerry to learn about how to use this technology or just want to read an interesting article contributors contributors or writers they are a rare breed they're hard to come by but having a really good writer can make a huge difference for your project and then communities communities keep content up to date they interact with it they engage with it they point out gaps and contributors and communities is an area which we're really focused on and I'll share a bit more about this in a second but before I jump into that this is what Kara looks like so this is the homepage this is for our first user group this is for readers so that they come in they know where to go they can read about topics which are important in a in the etherium ecosystem getting started finance scaling privacy these types of things then essentially or an essential component is you need to be good at the single player game we spent a lot of time catering towards writers so that they can write in markdown have content have clear attribution so this was written by Haida he's a full-stack dev loves using Kotlin and part of the Java community and he wrote this article about using web 3j to user authentication and then kind of bringing that together is multiple contributors can now contribute to like one community and here this is the Java aetherium community so there are representatives from consensuses pegasus team which were a client in java called pantheon which is now hi Felicia Basu the IO builder's team a couple of carry team members because our back-end is in Java and a couple of individual contributors and importantly Khan Espenson who is the creator of the web 3 library but what's interesting about communities is many people can have the permissions to keep content up-to-date and this is where we've been using a lot of the grant funding so and and the key to this is rewarding writers so to get good content out there where there are gaps within the the ecosystem so grants right now are coming from the etherium foundation and consensus grants this is sponsored a lot of the getting started materials many of the tools libraries and frameworks have been written about and then also working on keeping like the etherium wiki up today solidity dogs various different Doc's one area which Kari is also moving into if you want to get in touch is Commission content so if your project needs better tutorials help your developer community understand how to use use about why that top of the funnel let us know and then getting involved the next communities which we're launching are getting started which will come out this week this has some really exciting content including a couple of tutorials on how to use a new web IDE which means you don't need to set up your whole tool chain and it's just some interesting templates to give developers which are new to the etherium ecosystem that first our Hartmann and you'll hear more about that experience in other torts or Albert stork ayahs talk the superblock steam has been doing some great work their web 3 onboarding is another one if - as we the contract gets deployed and get closer to a robust beacon chain in the beginning of next year we'll have materials on how do you actually connect with the network how do you send funds to the stake in contract that kind of stuff and then I'll - scaling which is a really important topic and there's been a ton of research over the past few years but I think we're now moving from research into actual production use cases so get in touch if you'd like to be involved this is all about community making greater engagement with each of these projects and bringing more developers into the etherium ecosystem so you can reach me at my email or our twitter account is Towery underscore I thank you very much [Applause] you
