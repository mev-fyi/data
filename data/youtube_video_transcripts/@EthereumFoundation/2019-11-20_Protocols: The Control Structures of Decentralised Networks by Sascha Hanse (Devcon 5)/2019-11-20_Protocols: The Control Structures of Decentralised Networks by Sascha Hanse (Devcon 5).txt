[Applause] technical and full of complications second research and try to balance tracks for people's messages as explorers of the limitations of the tools views somewhat so implications I am cooking a four-course wasn't like an abstract thing not such as extra computation and the name of Thomas inspired by great work by on that way to support for 20,000 circulation since one first technical aspect of whatever we want to try to build an so that all system the most like reported around I believe all of its operating system and become the heart to solve it is hard way where the protocols the coders and he can be very specified for modification and unfortunately it's courtesy and respect implementation and then there's some aspect of systems rebuilding sort of produce communities that produce organizations so it's very much important topic to take care of when you try to pull apart also think of what sort of plate system able to build and also more importantly what sort of accidents before goal for example like the nice station protocol and all of a sudden they're like it's quite successful over some much much less protection on Shane myself much Oh what's this election season that starts application area one of the officers before we go Geneva Protocol Roger I cannot change market maker to Newport hospital so here every witness would be comfortable I think most people that I ask not technically we're asking me was one called a have this notion of fosters record formal things are happening to me resource of the earliest English like ancient Greek word so first things wrong and then later so things very like whatever I think we're in the policy if like awesome things about try to sort of give us social framework to human reaction if you will and this fortress so pretty nice because the price for a moment the protocol is on a social network the same thing applies protective layers also propose of an X and the self promise means those people who are closest can make to relate to each other the loss of freedom concentrating a contribution to society and personal and professional portal is in effect the frame of the picture are confident Brazil lost basically the pricing service and sort of like describing the extra content what's the sort of thing that then proposed due respect this or facility may never billion so firm cause provide the conditions under which there has been formed and thus they also shape sort of networks can be built so it's only recently when protocol the protocol so provides lack of services there are instances like implementations of a service and services like everybody knows for example if you want to post my what their losses on service and this was an information was for a night life become what's most likely you do for whatever different protocols but Secret Service is the same services so sort of define it strongly visible gave her a formal surrender some black box and limitations of these this behavior so let's get rid were irrelevant to the watching contents New Mexico they work closely what's proposed we have any sort of an order of like first appearance resident communicated also very intimate the graphically many novels the the interesting thing is that as you move from left to right you sort of starts child eyes sanity's observe the try to distance aside from occasional bolts all you assume is is just is Elizabeth Lhasa channel their every adversary serving spice eurozone the shores at work or like during a normal series thank you everyone goes on the second episode of military wants to interrupt the connection they want to maybe Easter all things like that an economic economic protocol system adds like the biggest economic domestic true people get their actual monetary incentives or whatever Iike a vicious animal what sort of actors or protocols breath out first aggression listen to actress after see actors they are one that followed and so at work while even if it means losing like tiny amount of money or whatever or basically yeah the rational actors are the ones who traction some of the solutions that they want to have the best place so it appears reportable Azula we can basically anything they're willing to lose money they will lose money to a packaging try to know yes sir so let's its own mechanism the open communication protocols which is like I said the the nicest world everything's good Mustangs example which is still in use today as a DGP which is sort of the protocol which controls peering over the internet basically will appear to be envy that doesn't work at the moment PGP sort of is a nice happy place where a register students are various goods there's also good graphic and is my ps4 graphic or even economic incentives Swamiji peanuts to keep them secure to announce all of the other things an emphasis on will make sequel new controls make making sure you interact as sequence let's upload up by numbering control with this direction then you have two protocols which come with lots of different flavors but generally just means I throw a protocol and concerts at the site which might be like a Byzantine [Music] concept that was in Ford Coppola consensus purple but it might be the authentication by parts such as HTTP web and all things that are listed here in the same no they got you when it is Mike miss hash environment signatures because my position on truce and whatever I just and then the talks broke up because the interesting things are all sudden becomes possible to push what economic condition way participate in the furball if they don't it was really interesting wasn't be possible for buy something from us a new direction if somebody misbehaved on the side saying you might slash the state that also gives you like access to a big array of all something make easy design like auction market things like that can incentivize people to behave rationally and to so lead to design of my being and it just makes a neural link behavior according to the portal must was more expensive there's also a nice little for security so the problem is that when he good with quoting rates focuses on architecture like so architecture we live in when you think I'm really good thing nation with your muscle also repair the wall around its and within it to the delay the work that one case because more hear it more all the things that think which it may take six places where information to making so this sort of the the things where things are getting messy because you can't mask even if you want some good progress registration I'm watching me thank my example like these way the grant I will just be fabrications all of a sudden the - have very high incentive to for example in the here to mess with the drawing of transactions let's say the amount of transaction from the unit are being suppressed fee and you try to trace up there you try to train my desk and he selling they've changed but a sudden the minor hasn't pretty much intended to make process that starts before myself it feels like gospel or take for example in the neck ago the other that position the price changes rapidly you try to talk off you review of STP basically and all of a sudden - very like so I incentive if perhaps you say ok you can write me I'm not going to talk me off your CBP this is problem and if you got arrested and it is all suede all problems away from running can actually reverse switches this is what the more recent papers - I thought yesterday on something similar which is basically exactly whatever they've given deposits of mining work on some degree listed - if you build like I soon forgot about the - they're very very high incentive to extract more value than they get from these of international awards it's basically down you know because basically the the protocols which are highly leveraged soom that they're known as idea which is sort of awesome I would have necessarily the sections capacity to useful some degree so there are more things under the city universe that are on those months Gilbert because the Muslims were like abstraction energy which in the end in our spot this week into the highlights and then is also the one of the biggest composers nobody has really interested is bribery especially to say so proper of us it would be very interesting to see or using different chains to bright people other chance will use 3d pretentious so let's let's see let's say you have before service' probably the protocol then it's response on an invitation the process they like drag apropos very much sooner just normal zombie design being tiger it's very messy you have often inconsistencies between the human tations and the sweat specification directing and it's lots of parts this we thought software what we thought after implementing them and if Sophia dismiss okay am I going to update the cover of these specifications especially if everything like the seven sunyoga resolution already the starts like a shoe these things and more complicated and that's often quite often protocols end up being used in situations that were never designed for which makes things even worse so some sort of late because guidelines for just this design of the model there's always simplicity which is one way to do something that it's most likely wrong exceptions make everything worth wrong because the sort of way that you basically forced to a mighty lot stay near a lake but often undefined States which is a mess and easy features our teachers what employees so you get some time a copy the teachers do most lacking of usable not be tested properly and you won't catch us very very late in life segment was portfolio off verses and maybe see the missus resistances in general like looking for a crew graphic port was for example if you like national should but what if you do an attack box where the signature really dealing with all sizes and he has to try to make the energy doing mrs. resistance like not really faults not my team of some sort like that make everything this explicit God because people would not read the four specifications they will assume things based on what they've read and which was it's all word problems and be very transparent about the facts that the things that he's trying to say had another interesting thing which is not really what not rethinking else in the make many make Russia birth workers they think about depreciation but what would look like if one of the sudden everybody to stop okay this washing systems now on David let's do two new one which was sort of happening one point zero two twenty liver but there's a usually a variable program progress that process spends just assuming other thing people think about not because of course we're designing for God he wanted to be used in water salinity and minimization routines on Shane customers money leaking doctors also not nice yeah so when you try to write a specification like the thing that people supposed to read don't try too clever please don't repeat words if needed because otherwise people might think there are different things because just trying to be good when your rights state diagrams are amazing if something that is complicated state diagram is probably too complicated and people will get confused and my single plates of the state diagram representation of us words it's so easy to formalize and and in the end is sort of the the the thing that you gave us like good balance between formalism abstraction I need you in an idea what he puts or like a formal specification on the protocol have implemented automatically put into codes that will be amazing but unfortunately writing on specifications really really hard to sing any better but it's the payment like try to actually write phone like definition of all the things that before sample watching truly a consensus our goodness my possible so too much for medicine makes it much harder to read from people so that you have to assume so let's try some start and probably most important thing is that it's easy to misunderstand something this is about respect otherwise it's just what were to be happy people will misunderstand me yeses the biggest kind of works like what happens most people use this thing what happened was it's applauds what are you offering things that people will not upgrade only you would like better stability this is really new art especially developing all this happens in your Britain and its diversity of people just assume is right something is excited in this very messy and yeah because especially like these addresses are trying to be centers since biggest movers not just technically but also politically which we've seen person into himself so to wrap up with some where they feel loved most and liberal searches in an important consequence for distribution of power and procedural deliberate pranks they're not Rebecca fermented one of the few foundations and were the corporation's move it become as a cement over time instead the result in specific tangible and enduring corporation products meaning that if before call ends up being used for ends up trying to sort of incentivize people for and serve like the Russian behavior you so need to think about what's the long-term weight layouts behavior things are very sticky if people are getting extract or information somewhere else they will and you might not know even if you have good intentions you're quite often Matt Milan I'm just making things worse and or just try to like not be able to move for the same people have actors who might be dissing fact that matters already just like importance advantage and I see [Applause] you
