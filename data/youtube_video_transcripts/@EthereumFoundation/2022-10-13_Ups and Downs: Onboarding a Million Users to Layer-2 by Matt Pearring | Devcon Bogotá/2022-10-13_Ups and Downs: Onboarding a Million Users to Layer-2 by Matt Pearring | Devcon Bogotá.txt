foreign [Music] exciting I'm actually really happy that the last two people covered you know kind of cross chain messaging and bridging and Layer Two stuff because I'm going to talk a lot about about that but it's great to have context so again I'm Matt welcome to my TED Talk um so three things I'm going to try to cover here there's a lot of stuff going on in Layer Two there's a lot of stuff going on in crypto I'm gonna try to focus on three things last one and it was broad talk about bridging talk about compatibility and interop and I'm going to talk about some scalability issues that I think we're starting at coalesce around that we have been talking about for a while all right so bridging right you got to move funds from layer one to Layer Two at some point this shouldn't be something you have to think about right so we want it to be there we want there to be zero degrees of separation between the layers at some point in the end game right you Bridge right onto Layer Two so here's where we are today it's a state of bridging uh it continues to be really challenging and continues to be risky we see hacks all the time it's not great um but it's something that we have to deal with ux for users is tricky or even impossible depending on the asset right not all tokens are your 320s sometimes you can't Bridge sometimes you have to bridge in a different way so it becomes really challenging for someone trying to use any kind of crypto product in the beginning when you have to educate them on what bridging is and what that means is for developers not all token implementations are created equal on Arboretum we have standard versus custom bridging so when you're bridging an asset over for the first time we can deploy that contract for you on Layer Two and it'll Auto it'll Auto deploy but yeah if you have things like interest or or other things that are you know maybe more custom for implementation you have to work with us or you have to you know build your own custom solution so it's pretty complicated and I think you know we're not in a space where things are perfect but we're making a lot of progress and kind of at a higher level view this is our Bridge you know fantastic we're from the team but if you think about it bridging is really designed for power users right so it's not something that in the long term we want to have be kind of like the canonical thing you have to do on on the blockchain um so what's next right and again this is a lightning talk I'm trying to go as fast as I can one thing that we're exploring is fast withdrawal confirmation so on arbitrum Nova we have a data availability committee um we can actually use that system to allow for withdrawals back to L1 to take less than a week be almost instantaneous it's not something that's live yet but something we're thinking about it'll make this a lot smoother um let's see yeah something that we're you know we'd like to see happen and the ecosystem is is more wallet integration you know deep well in integration I would say with fast bridging so when you're you know in a wallet you have an asset you can just use a fast Bridge from within there you don't have to go on the browser and actually sort through all these options and make trade-offs with your own independent research you can actually have that be like automated for you obviously that's going to require kind of community discussion um this is just something that goes without saying it was something that we've done a lot of work on is within the bridge itself increasing discoverability of fast Bridges and making sure it's more performant right not all bridges are created equal there's lots of different options and so doing what we can from an agnostic perspective to make sure that we provide the best ux is something that we try to do all the time and something I'd like to see long term is Bridge aggregation standard functionality right there's lots of trade-offs you have to make to find the best performance the best security between all the options that are out there having functionality built in and I talked about this with wallets before as kind of a standard functionality where you're given a bunch of options you can see the average cost and you can make a decision for yourself in the UI that would be great and making that standard across all options would be phenomenal so sorry I'm going really fast but the next thing I want to talk about is kind of compatibility right so we're in a good state right now in Arboretum on a lot of layer twos you know drop in compatibility is standard so the good news is you know evm programs work out of the box it's something that you can rely on moving on to layer two as a developer is basically kind of like not a huge issue and the other thing is core infra that you kind of come to know and love on ethereum on L1 on other blockchains RPC providers price oracles you know graphs monitoring analytics it's all it's all there it's already ready for you on L2 so we've got a robust set of tooling and infrastructure if you want to deploy so we're in a pretty good State there um and you know sdks and Frameworks we have new things like Foundry coming up every day they're beginning to multiply you have lots of options you have lots of things that you can you know potentially use to make your development experience easier this is just a quick graphic with Nitro we're running gef at the core so in terms of compatibility we're you know reaching parity as much as we can so what's next right you know you can keep pushing the envelope here but one thing that we want to think about right now contracts solidity as you think about Roll-Ups in the future we want to see broader language support for smart contract execution so this is something that you can imagine having you know different options to write your contract code in and compile down to something that will still work with the evm it's a really exciting time um again right now on on arbitrum we have two dimensional gas we price uh L1 call data posting costs separately separately from L2 execution costs this is something that you know if you're if you're a developer if you're a project you're doing a lot of things estimating it and getting accurate pricing for the gas as time goes on especially with high volume is really difficult so making that better and working with wallets to have different standards with transaction types is something that we want to push for um again I mentioned before lots of these sdks popping up I think as more developers you know come into the space and this goes on to this next Point longer term having better rails for web 2 developers to come into this space space with canonical paths forward for any kind of applications and having Community consensus around what the best tooling to use is is something we need to all think about it's hard to make those trade-offs the last one I want to make here is there's a huge perception issue in kind of like major Tech I came from that industry before working here people are not super enthused about crypto development and we need to do something about that I don't know exactly what that is but it's something we all need to think about so kind of a philosophical point there um I think this next point is kind of on performance right like as as much as we can increase throughput and bandwidth and execution speed on the Chain more people will use it more developers will build so the good news is this is happening all the time uh you know we're doing this today we're at a conference talking about how we can all work together to make this possible so there's lots of stuff happening we ship Nitro a couple months ago we seven extra capacity we lowered speeds things are looking pretty good for Roll-Ups and the one thing here to think about though is we focus on gas all the time remember Roll-Ups and and blockchains in general are not just about gas you have to have Security on the Chain so making performance for validators or for for nodes that are serving as validators you know making that more efficient making that more accessible is something that's going to continue to be more important as time goes on especially with you know State growing in the way that it is and this is just you know a quick reminder fees are low it you know they're not they're not arbitrarily low they're not tiny but we're getting better things are things are kind of improving um and so I'm not sure how much time I have left yeah yeah so staple it's a problem you know we're going to try to continually you know optimize for for client performance and you know there are a couple things that we're experimenting with rentable storage we've talked a lot about statelessness there's still a lot of work to be done here I think we have a lot of progress to be made the one last point I want to end with is at a high level in order for staple to be a problem we need to get people to actually use blockchains outside of like the canonical use cases we're comfortable with today I personally would like to see a lot more use cases come to Market with lower barriers to entry right now most games in crypto in order to play you got to spend 500 on an asset that's not something that most people can actually do right and you're going to make a leverage long on some ass that you've never heard of most people as they go into the world and want to try to experiment with these things you need to make sure it's easy for them to get to get involved with we want to make sure things like you know onboarding into D5 having account abstraction being able to pay with different fees for for your transaction pay with different tokens for your transactions uh something that we want to see something that we want to encourage um and something I want to talk about just as the kind of a last point is we we have novel experimentation going on with insurance um on chain we see a lot of hacks we see a lot of teams focusing on security focusing on audits focusing having the best talent in-house to make sure that things are secure that's not the only way to solve the problem you can kind of think about hedging in a different way so baking in Insurance into the core flows for Defy is something that I think there's a lot of potential and that we have lots more of experimentation to do with so sorry for going really fast but yeah that's arbitrary and that's us thank you for the Sprint [Applause]
