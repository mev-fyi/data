foreign [Music] of ethereum staking right so what's the Stakeout Steakhouse is a meta delegation protocol both for ethereum staking for inertia onboard mainstream users ethereum doesn't have a delegation built in so we build that protocol on on Smart contracts so we can enable the node Runners to get more users at the same time the users can get you know safely staked with ethereum and it's completely 100 smart contracts and all formally verified right so let's take a step back and see what we can do in two minutes and alive you know you can have a coffee or you could do a speed run of ethereum staking So currently it takes about two days to do that experience taking so that we're going to do that in two minutes so 60 seconds staking and 60 seconds to set up run the node so you guys are ready for that all right cool let's go for it then foreign counted two minutes [Music] foreign thank you that's it two minutes you become a Staker you got a node up and running and you're good to go so what we've seen here is like a complete smart contracts tooling wrapped around ethereum deposit contract and you know you got a note you have it you have your coffee what's next yeah two minutes it's a very short time so we got to do something else let's go get some LSD you want that I want to get a yes then only I'm going next slide all right cool let's go so now we want to get this node Runners to get more eat so stay can get eight validators for 32 each so you know that you need 32e to get a validator but can we get that to eight so that's how we go from one to eight X so how does the LST Works LST is a contract suit that is fully automated that will allow anyone to to send their any tokens erc20 or Eid and it will automatically get feed into a node Network so there's a two marketplaces node operators can simply register with the four eight and they will be get you know anyone can run this LLC Network Let It Be Dao or you know you're taking service or anyone and this pooling will automatically get the de back into the user's hands remember the de this slash free so the users who are protected and the slashing is going into the node if they are leaking or do something so this is like an inclusive Affair and open it's fully permissionless anyone can set it up under 30 minutes here we're talking about who can use it it's completely compatible with that node or steering packages or your staking services or liquid staking protocols think about you know we have Lido steak wise rocket tool and all these guys are doing amazing service they're providing not running but you also have solar stakers and you have institutions like coinbase and other people but it's all the fragmentation of liquidity we bring in this Eid back the meta delegation protocol allow you do the LSD networks underlying staked eat is completely fungible so no matter which node Runners are there they can all enjoy this and it's it's completely redeemable it's fully smart contract driven right we don't stop there so Steakhouse will also give you a complete visibility to validator level for stake earning and threat detections so you know that if something goes bad you don't really have to go and find out we'll automatically get it everything is on chain it's complete coming from consensus layer and you can build web hooks top of that so more things are coming there so if you go to joinsteakhouse.com today if you're a builder it's gone 100 Nano friendly all things are included you have templates ready to go if you want if you're D5 protocols you have that if you're you know if you want to do gatekeeping if your institutions you get there if you're a node operators you have all the sdks that they're in you know npm packages everything is there so if you want to do something if you want to learn more about it come and find us you know you can join out this code or you can go to a website you know let's make if you're mistaking accessible for millions of users and make it safer too that's it thank you I speed run the time actually get 20 seconds more it's a good thing to start all right yeah bigger plows
