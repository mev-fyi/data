matter how hard [Music] [Applause] [Music] for you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] cause I thought good morning everyone and welcome to Defcon I hope you had fun yesterday and thank you for starting the morning with us I'm here to introduce Andrew millik he's the co-founder and CEO of skiff which is an end-to-end encrypted privacy first wallet native communication and collaboration platform Andrew previously worked on spacecraft at eight SpaceX operating systems and spend time working all over Asia and Eastern Europe before that Andrew graduated as the Henry Ford the second scholar from Stanford welcome Andrew thank you so much and hi everyone nice to meet you I've got a great group so yeah we're going to start by talking about basically the stack of how you'd build consumer applications in web3 and so what does that mean not just for applications in defy and finance and trading and exchanges but how can we actually build applications that we use every single day and ideally every single hour so you wake up you check your email you check your messages how can we rebuild the stack of the way consumers live and work on the internet to be more private and user owned so we'll start with just some of the attributes of what we look for in our application and also in all applications in this sector we'll start with privacy first and this actually for us it's GIF is probably the most important fundamental layer of how we build things so what that means is all of your data is owned by you and it's private to you so no one else not some technology provider or platform will have access to it and so it's really only something that you should have access to which is just also a lot more intuitive for the way we use these really sensitive applications whether it's file storage or messaging or communication all the things that we store on those products should really only be known to us and that's not an expectation that people certainly have today beyond that and we'll talk more about this later we think it should be decentralized and what that means isn't always that you know compute is taking place all across the world on chain or um always on a decentralized network but it should be architected in a way where your data and your compute isn't always entrusted to a platform and that translates into the data structures that you might use into the way authentication and identity might work and also into so much more from an ideological side of how might your data be de-platformed if you're removed from it how would you think about censorship resistance how do you think about access to it that's always permanent and always accessible and then also how would you think about just incorporating privacy into every single piece of your data storage and identity finally this one's a little interesting we think that applications should be interoperable so when you're no longer asking an oauth application like Google for your identity we want you to be able to use that information in other parts of the web so whether it's logging into another product uh storing your data elsewhere or building really cool API and programmatic Integrations to all the files and things that you create and lastly we'll just say this very briefly we think it should be open source which is something we've committed to at skiff but also I think something that uh in the entire community of just ethereum and the crypto ecosystem is really important to make sure people trust what you can do and also can replicate it so we'll start with privacy first with a pretty intuitive saying which is if you own the keys you also own the data um and so basically everything on the plot the product should be n10 encrypted from the ground up so you're sending a message keep that message private only to you and the recipient if you're uploading a file or piece of information make sure that's also private only to you we've basically just seen countless examples in the last two years with people storing things on the cloud and being de-platformed targeted for the things that they store in a cloud provider or just not really able to understand and Trust where their data is being used is it being dropped into some massive machine learning model is it being used in some massive search indexing algorithm that's also just used across 500 million other users your data should be private to you and n10 encrypted I skipped over this but we also want to make sure there's no personally identifying information inside these products this is slightly controversial uh depending on the application but uh in the encrypted messaging space and n10 encrypted Communications it's really kind of this Ground Zero expectation that people have where you want to be able to use a messaging product you want to be able to use a communication product without giving out a phone number or a real name Etc and so many places in the world now make it harder and harder to do that whether you need to submit an ID to buy a SIM card or you need to go through an internet provider or an email provider and provide another address or some sort of accountability chain so that first one is also really important to us and finally a lot of this these bullet points actually rest on the idea of non-custodial wallets or non-custodial public keys where if you're doing intent encryption you kind of have to own your own key pair and so that poses a bunch of interesting consumer product challenges that we'll get to shortly so on that next point of decentralized we talked a bit about how decentralized can lead to censorship resistance where there isn't a single kind of point of de-platforming where you can get kicked out of your identity or kicked out of your product and also with n10 encryption it's really unclear even who is using that data or how it's going to be processed Beyond just the things that you do with it this also translates into client-side data storage data structures sharing search collaboration and more so once you've gone down the path of n10 encryption any product that you build will not have access to user data and what that means is you've kind of set up an entire sequence of challenges and Hoops that you have to jump through whether it's rebuilding how search works you know searching on someone's device or rebuilding how you share that data with other people so if I want to share a file or a document with another collaborator how can you know I as a user do that but the platform never be able to do something like that finally one super important point is also how you trust the platform in the product as well and so that comes from how you might actually look up other users public keys and we'll get to this later but this is one of the biggest you know age-old questions in communication how do I send a secure email to someone how do I look up someone's public key if I'm using you know signal or a telegram secret chat or pgp email back in the 90s and then on that interoperable point a lot of similar things about basically giving people ownership of their identity through self-custody of their keys or wallets and then also just using a much more local first on device model where data can still be synced or synchronized across the devices and things that you use but because it's n10 encrypted a lot of that actual computing power and Computing Authority is no longer with a technology provider uh and then we'll cover some of that last point about command line access or programmatic access for your content so I guess let's get into some of the actual technical parts of this stack uh how is actually end-to encryption communication been done in the past we'll start with pgp I don't know Has anyone used pgp or uses it regularly okay so a little bit so pgp is uh I think a little over 30 years old now uh it was invented or published in the 1990s I think 91. um and unfortunately it's become pretty clunky pretty clunky very complex and pretty inefficient where there were proprietary formats owned by corporations open source formats owned by you know open source standards and now just other basically open source Publications compliance standards Etc that try and take this age-old 30 year old standard and updated for modern cryptography and secretly it seems like we have a few pgp users here but I'm just going to say that almost no one actually uses it it's estimated that literally 50 000 people worldwide still maintain pgp key Pairs and if we look at the other option for n10 encrypted private communication we're literally looking at many three four orders of magnitude of different scale and so you can understand why maintaining your own pgp care or key pair is probably a thing of the past so if we look at signal and telegram as examples where signal is default antenna encrypted using the signal protocol and telegram is n10 encrypted using secret chats we get so much more privacy built in right out of the box so the protocols handle all the stuff around key exchange key downloading and actual encryption of messages and then that leads to you know 700 million monthly active users on Telegram and over 100 million on Signal finally one piece of this that you know somewhat of an advantage but also can bite you in the back in the end is a complex story around key ownership sign up and metadata where if you look at a product like telegram they're often criticized for not being fully open source even if some of the protocol is and Signal often is criticized for requiring a phone number on sign up which for some of us may not matter because we'll you know happily share a phone number with friends but for others it can really defeat the purpose of a privacy first messaging product now we'll look at one last piece of the current uh authentication framework so the last is oauth which I think is one of the most painful uh forms of doing authentication today because it's basically putting your identity in the hands of one single server and provider and so whether it's you know your Gmail account or another product you've basically made that to you know become your identity around the web Without Really knowing that you really own it and so the way oauth works is just for a quick overview you know you'll plug oauth into your app in five minutes you know developers have made that so easy you can query for a scoped token so ask for my birthday or my favorite color or my email address and get back credentials that can be refreshed possibly indefinitely for access to an application so a lot of these standards have developed as we you know the identity story gets more and more complicated around the web as centralized providers store more information about us and also just keep enlarging these scopes of data that you could access now we'll just flip the Paradigm completely on its head we at skiff think wallets are just a natural successor to this problem across encryption across identity and across data ownership so we've actually seen wallets start to be used as the basis for generating end-to-encrypted key Pairs and so if you're familiar with the method eth get encryption public key this is actually an Innovative thing published by the metamask community and then later adopted into Brave wallet where you'll turn an ethereum public key or ethereum key pair into a curve 25519 encryption key pair which can be used to just encrypt and decrypt data with your metamask or Brave wallet uh there's a bit of complication around that as some of the cryptography is ironed out but it's this much more simple and intuitive way of going from a key that you own to an entire framework for n10 encryption instead of access grants we'll where we'll ask Google or a provider for more data all of this will be super transparent to users where you sign a token giving access or authenticating exactly what you want or exactly who you are and then finally on the distribute distributed public key directory I think no one here wants to put up one of those you know HTML only personal pages with your pgp key and then just expect people to go to that if they want to communicate securely with you with wallets and things like naming Services we get a much simpler way of going from a human readable name like skip.eth to a public key and we have some people from the dm3 team here who are working on that exact problem uh we'll talk about this more later but it does introduce some problems on the consumer side with recovery and basically account reset as we all know and using a wallet so just to recap what's this new model for authentication we'll start with a human readable name like you know an email address or even simpler we'll take that and transform it to a wallet address which is done using a transparent on-chain lookup and then finally we'll recover a public key from that and so in certain cases we'll get back an ethereum key pair or in others like that uh kind of experimental method I talked about we could actually figure out a way to get a really well suited encryption key pair to send data to people end-to-end encrypted so now we'll go we'll kind of completely erase the pgp stack We'll erase oauth and we'll go from this you know human readable name all the way to n10 encryption much easier than signal much easier than Telegram and so much easier than pgp which is why people don't use it um so then we'll just cover some about storage and interoperability a little more on the technical side so this is a point that I've made a lot but I think is pretty intuitive as well if we're moving to a world where decentralized storage actually works for products we also need n10 encryption if you're storing data on a decentralized network you wouldn't want to store it all in plain text you know I write a note I write my PhD thesis I don't always want every single draft of that to just be stored you know sharded around the internet in plain text so instead I want that to be encrypted and I don't want that to be encrypted with some random person's key I want it to be encrypted with my key and that's exactly what M10 encryption means so to get basically this value alignment across end-to-end encryption and decentralized storage wallets are an excellent solution for that and then once you've actually published things to a decentralized network you can use that Network to query for it maintain a list of identifiers and have permanent access to that outside of any sort of platform which gets back to that importance of censorship resistance then we'll also just talk about the data structures let's say you're now using an intent encrypted product that has no access to the things that you're writing you're typing your notes your documents all of a sudden you can't use a single server like the Google model or you know the centralized model of collaborating you have to use a new set of data structures and so we'll cover this briefly because it's probably a little bit of a tangent but there are actually really good data structures that are now coming into modern production use like crdts which are conflict-free replicated data types that actually allow for composable operations to be done on these data structures from around the world so I increment some number and someone else across the world decrements it you can see how that operation is composable and so even if we there's some latency or someone gets disconnected we can arrive at a really consensus based version of a final product without having a server the last point about interoperability is that it makes account transfer sales and auctions so much simpler so when an account or identity is transferred on chain we'll just do that same lookup and the new owner gets access to that username or will just automatically have access to that's gif.heath it'll also mean that users can choose their own history and path around things like 2fa you know account uh signatures and login and all that sort of stuff so if you want to use a multi-sig wallet for skip.eth or you want to set some sort of 2fa mechanism or use a hardware wallet you'll get to choose your own security posture and so that has a lot of Pros for more advanced users it means that people can choose their own way of securing their their private keys but it also means that platforms no longer have to deal with some of that risk of accidentally de-platforming people having 2fa and complicated reset mechanisms and you can make sure that the right identity is going to the right person it does however introduce complications around account reset so we'll just be transparent about that you know how difficult it is to remember a seed phrase maybe you wrote it down or put it in a safety deposit box or you split up pieces and gave them to your friend but that makes building consumer apps a little more challenging too like if I want to reset my email address or my messaging app it's a little weird to ask my friend to click a button or three of them to click a button and give me their you know secret out of a few different secret shares or to use a multi-sig wallet to log into a single collaborative product so it gives users a lot more freedom and empowerment over how they can use these products and let you choose your own security Journey but it also means that there's more complexity around account reset identity and all those areas that frankly a lot of the regular consumers will get to and so that's something we spend a lot of time on at skiff how can you make products really simple really easy to use and really easy to sign up and so once you get to users who you know don't want to remember a seed phrase or write it down on their desk you actually get people who you know have access to all these amazing benefits of end-to-end encryption and you know easy to use collaboration but then if they lose their seed phrase it's harder to reset your account so to recap on the stack we talked first about the auth layer where wallets basically enable this entirely new user-owned flow for authenticating and logging into products they also give us a much simpler mechanism for Distributing public keys so don't run your own personal site with a pgp key pair run your wallet and just basically add that data on chain so we can go from your human readable name to your wallet address to a public key to n10 encryption from there the storage layer of using decentralization and n10 encryption give us so much more flexibility you can basically store data in more places or in a decentralized network if that data is encrypted with your key pair it also means that data is portable so you want to access it via program or via some sort of command line tool and change it or edit it or download it you can do that all from the decentralized network then finally on the app layer there's still a lot of progress that has to be made so this is basically a whole new paradigm for building a product like Gmail or Dropbox or drive or OneDrive I've tested you know or our team has tested every single email product out there every single storage product out there and it's radically different to build one that's nt10 encrypted from the ground up and works with people's wallets so it gives us a lot of benefits of basically this you know natural path from Identity to key pair but it also means that we have to rebuild a new stack of consumer apps that do this all behind the scenes you know simply naturally and also really performantly so that lookup process gets complicated um so I think from there yeah I just wanted to add a couple notes about basically how we think this benefits the entire community and ecosystem and then we'll do questions so my background is I've been a software Engineers my whole life since I was probably five or six years old although I was not a professional engineer at that point and now actually doing this for real you can see that this model of Building Products is just so much more intuitive and better for people and their identity so if you have a you know a wallet or a key pair that you really trust and you want to keep track of you get to choose your own security mechanisms and safety mechanisms for owning that private key if you want to communicate with people around the girl the world with n10 encryption you can now get that an entirely new kind of more user-owned stack of products I've been a big fan and so is our team of decentralized storage and n10 encryption is one of the biggest enablers for actually building consumer apps on top of it so there's still so much work to be done on the product side but we think that basically going from you know this distributed consensus around public keys to end-to-end encryption to allow more flexibility on storage and interoperability it's just a much more intuitive better and simpler future at the end of the day is giving people access to what we see as a fundamental right which is private communication private writing private collaboration and owning your own key pairs so I think we've got five six minutes for questions thank you all for coming I know it's uh early go ahead ah so this is a great question the question was what are the nuances of going from I think it's just basically a wallet address to a actual public key that you might use to encrypt data so the nuances are like a wallet address is derived from a public key so it might be a hash Republic Key or you know a hash and a truncation of a public key and that's how you get the you know the hex 0x whatever you can't use that hex to encrypt data it's just basically the hash Republic Key and not a public key so that gives us I'll just go back to the the diagram so because we can't actually do that there's now two options to go to a public key we can use for encryption one is we generate a new key pair that's derived from your wallet address so derived from your wallet private key for encryption so you can use whatever elliptic curve you want so one that's really well suited for that and generate a new key pair or in the ethereum context you could use an ethereum public key so a curve scp-256k public key which is not really quite as well suited for encryption it's a little slower and generally not preferred over you know like a curve 25519 public key so we have these two paths one is generate a new key pair the other is use one that's less generate some sort of care so there's a little a little gray area there yes wow this is a whole separate whole separate area of frustration but yeah I think there's still a lot of lack of consensus on how to go from a wallet address to a public key or how to use you know do encryption and decryption via wallets yeah uh and he said uh the data can be stored in a decentralized way to showed ipfs um how is this real lasting practice uh on crdts when that user presses the key is that a new ipfs hash every time or how does it work yeah this is a good question so right now basically the way our products work is when a user presses a key it's applied locally to your editor State your editor state is some data structure that's like editors are actually super complicated you know we should all go to a conference on text editing but basically editors store some array of values like headers body text Etc so that gets mapped to a crdt state which is just a data structure which basically like a set of operations on an empty State and so that operation you know I typed a key at position 500 is then sent or it's n10 encrypted sent across the network to other people who are collaborating and they also apply that operation and so you do both do that composably and end up at a final state from there every so often and there's another I guess like a few little kinks to iron out here from there where your document is intent encrypted so encrypted with a key that you have access to and your collaborators do but no one else does and then from there it can be uploaded to ipfs and so there's a few nuances of not everything in real time on our products is uploaded to ipfs but things that are immutable or static or published can be so that's how that's done today but um yeah the whole decentralized storage kind of network choosing is another whole area go ahead sorry can I just ask then are your servers they're providing the ipfs services that's not decentralized as of yet just having any plans around that or yeah so I don't think we I've been a big fan of ipfs for like five years and what you know tried running my own nodes all that I don't think it's totally feasible for everyone to be running their own kind of nodes in a decentralized network so they're a really great ipfs gateways you know for upload and even cloudflare runs a really fast kind of caching layer on top of the download part of ipfs so I think basically yes there's some you know antenna encryption which is done client-side then it gets passed through some sort of Gateway which is generally centralized and then it gets put on a network and like the user at the end of the day can get access to those identifiers so at the end of the day you still get the benefit of you know your data center encrypted it's put on a network you can get access to the identifier in the key but it's not you know every single part of that process isn't uh totally distributed cool uh well if any last quick things either come grab me thank you all for coming and yeah I guess we had that whole uh Power scare so uh someone you know did some sort of search [Applause] thank you so much Andrew

hello [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thanks everyone for joining us and continuing our conversation on privacy on privacy first web3 I'd like to introduce you to Santiago City who is our next speaker Santiago is the founder of democracy Earth Foundation a non-profit organization backed by y combinator that has built Universal basic income on ethereum and launched the proof of humanity protocol the proof of humanity protocol is a project that focuses in the future of identity voting and human organizations by granting the right to an identity he also started the partido de la red which is the first political party born out of the internet that ran for elections in Argentina and he is also the author of hacktivism which was published in 2015 by Random House yes all of that that's right foreign ly waiting um for the presentation to finish loading I'm not sure if any of you were in any of the other routes and rooms and where witness of the huge light shortage that we have here at Agra so we're still waiting for things to get back on track and hence waiting a little bit longer on the presentation I hope all of you have been having a great time here at Defcon I'm sure you've all witnessed several really interesting conversations in the future on what's on hold for the future of ethereum what all of the different Builders are working on and here we have Santi well very interesting way to begin this talk uh so what happened what happened since the last Defcon in 2019 three years ago in Osaka do you can see a picture of me there with Fede the CEO of cleros amazing guy good person uh we were talking about back then is proof of human possible you can see the slide there back in 2019 is a proof of human possible we were wondering if we were able to do um a protocol that would be able to formalize human identity on the blockchain and that would bring us as you can see on the list there democracy Universal basic income portable credit a lot of very cool social applications so what happened since 2019 everything happened because a lot of the things that were theoretical that were just uh speculation about how we could do a social identity on the blockchain or how we could do Universal basic income became a reality we have the proof of humanity protocol and the universal basic income token which is the very first application built on top of proof of humanity so today I'd like to share with you a lot of the very interesting lessons that we faced in these two years building this contributing collaborating open source which is the beautiful thing about building things as a community and to share some of the lessons that we learned in the process so a brief recap of what proof of humanity is it's a protocol you can generate a brief video of yourself you get vouchered by another human stake a deposit for three and a half days if you get challenged you go to a clearance arbitrator if you if not you become a verified human on the blockchain and we are starting to see social applications like Ubi the very first one lens protocol has integrated with proof of humanity seismo is doing zero knowledge and FTS for proof of humanity bringing a privacy layer on top of the Civil resistant registry and it's amazing we have I think around 17 000 humans verified on proof of humanity as of today why is this important if you look at this at the World bank statistics they claim that out of the 8 billion people that were on this planet almost 1.5 billion lack an identity and this is a very common problem especially here in Latin America if you go to some of the poorest neighborhoods you will realize that a lot of teenagers a lot of kids they don't have any kind of identity which means they don't have any kind of access to services to Goods to to the state protecting them so it's a huge problem and if you look into the conflicts today we have almost a hundred million refugees in the world these are 100 million people whose right to an identity is being rejected so an important thing that we have to take into consideration when we build these systems and when we think about decentralized identity is that we need to make these systems resilient enough so they don't discriminate users so they don't marginalize users and leave people outside of the door we are fighting big brother and we need to understand that in order to fight big brother we need to understand that in the web 2 era and in the web one era the void that the web protocol has in relation to Identity was captured was captured by Facebook and the big tech companies in the west and was captured by the Chinese Communist party in China and this has led to the modern forms of surveillance capitalism where our privacy has been jeopardized and is now in the hands of a handful of Corporations so making sure that we're able to think about identity in a decentralized way and no big brother whether whether that big brother is myself Clement or kledo or any private organization or the state or any entity that can jeopardize a right to identity is a very important fight so this is core to to at least in my view to many of the decisions and to many of the political choices that we have made as a doll so the main question I've been hearing since I arrived to Defcon that everyone asked me is what's going on with with the poh drama well we had a democratic summer kind of analog to the D5 summer that we saw a couple of years ago with a with with the rest of D5 protocols but with proof of humanity we have the virtue that it is the most democratic Dao in existence I would even go as far as to say is this the most precious democracy we have in the entire internet because the proof of humanity protocol allows for formal verification of human identity we can do one person one boat and this has led to a very active a very engaging now where all of our decisions are done democratically which is a big difference with all of the other dials where you do token boating and they are essentially plutocracies where the largest whales the largest holders are the ones who are ultimately the decision makers democracy helps to put users to help to give users power not just that developers not just the investors but the users have a voice in a democracy and that's The Virtuous thing about it all right clicker so a brief recap of the dial one person one vote allows to delegate the vote you can do vote delegation we have quadratic delegations that help Empower minorities over delegate whales and we have three phases of deliberation for proposals these are the basic rules quadratic delegations has been a recent Improvement due to a farmer of delegations that we identified in it now and it's a very interesting experiment on how to make a resilient democracy on the blockchain so that's democracy work which is a big question you know making Democratic systems uh something that I once heard from a an old activist a former president of Uruguay Pepe Mujica he once said to me that democracies always a work in progress democracy is not an absolute totalitarian idea like all the other ideologies out there it is the one exception it is the one idea about how we think about the ideas and it's in constant Evolution and democracy is constantly evolving and adapting so why it's important that we make Democratic decisions ultimately high risk decisions require a high level of legitimacy the higher the risk the higher the need for legitimacy decisions sometimes are not easy choices obviously we don't go to a vote to make technical choices that are no-brainers those decisions are not high risk are basically you know you don't go to a you don't do a democracy in order to build an airplane you just trust the airplane Engineers to make the decisions for that you go to democratic votes for the decisions that are facing conflicts of interest for decisions that have multiple parties with different points of view and this this represent very high risks for the outcome of the governance of adao or for the governance of a protocol or for the parameters of a given system so high risk decisions require High legitimacy there's a recent article I highly recommend it uh there's a QR code if for those of you who want to to actually read this dials are not corporations and it's vitalik uh basically explaining the nature of how uh Democratic decision-making can be very helpful for specific types of decisions in organizations and he gives this very good uh analysis of decision types where he claims there are concave World Views and convex World Views basically this chart is option A and option b on the x-axis on both charts and there are concave decisions are decisions that usually are much better when there you can negotiate between option A and option b and the best point is is this point in the Middle where you reach common ground and these decisions concave decisions are much more compatible for Democratic decision making because in democracy you have to negotiate convex decisions on the other hand convex decisions are decisions where it's obviously A or B should we vaccinate everybody or should we shouldn't vaccinate everybody there's no middle ground in the middle in this type of decisions so it's obviously one or the other and these are convex a convex worldview in the argument of italic he argues that technical choices are most more often than not convex decisions but a governance decisions what he calls Sovereign decisions are usually concave World Views and these are much more compatible for Democratic decision making so in order in this 20 months of existence almost two years we had a total of 88 voted decisions which consists of 72 what we call hips Humanity Improvement proposals and this has three phases uh the hips go through a process of three phases where there is a forum post a signaling boat which is kind of reaching Quorum if it makes sense to vote this or not and a binding boat which is makes the decision final and binding one interesting thing about our Dao is that democracy actually brought engagement where the engagement of the Dao has grown over the past 20 months since the beginning and we are seeing more and more participation uh as more users engage with proof of humanity and more users engage on trying to have a voice on how we make decisions about human rights on the internet which is ultimately what a protocol like proof of humanity and many others are trying to figure out and the fact that we're trying to figure this out with Democratic decision making and it's bringing more engagement more participation to the now I think it's it's a very good thing usually it's around five to six percent of the registered humans that participate in the Dao um it's uh it might not sound like a big number but when you compare it to the usual participation rates in other dolls it's actually a very decent number the good thing is that engagement is growing so we analyze a little bit of the decisions uh that we took in the Dao throughout the these 20 months half of the decisions we made almost 50 percent are governance decision uh mostly related to the governance of the Dow itself 20 of the decisions are technical decisions parameters operating parameters of the smart contract or a specific decisions related to the technical aspects a six percent were economic decisions uh related to allocating grants allocating funds that the Dow has in the treasury and 22 percent were policy decisions uh which means improvements in the policy that is used to evaluate the human applications on proof of humanity so only the technical ones are mostly convex most of the decisions around 80 percent of the decisions are actually concave decisions decisions that make sense making uh with a democratic process so another interesting thing is that half of the decisions had at least 85 percent of voter support this means that half of the decisions that we took in the Dow they had one of the options reaching 85 percent of consensus which is a very high number a lot of half of the decisions had 85 percent of Common Ground people agreeing on that decision whether it's a yes or no and even more interestingly I don't know where I have to point with this 25 percent of the decisions one every four out of every four decisions actually had a hundred percent of support unanimous voter support these most of these decisions uh are are really interesting because it you know people when they think about democracy they think oh people are going to be disagreeing or people are going to be fighting over things turns out that one out of every four decisions have 100 percent of unanimous voter support on the path to take forward and the fact that we make this that decision with the community rather than from an elite of developers showing their back to the community it's actually putting trust in our users is putting trust in the people that are helping build this together and not in an ivory Tower where you make decisions and you really just don't know what users actually want so uh I have a deeper look about unanimous decisions I thought initially that they were going to be mostly technical choices to my surprise actually the technical choices that had that kind of unanimous support is only 33 percent and most of the decisions around 66 percent were actually concave decisions reaching unanimous support so that's another interesting take that it's not only the technical choices that might get this the convex choices that might get this kind of unanimous support so those are just some numbers about the drama about sorry about the the decisions we made in abstract form but what led to the Dao drama what led to the the fighting and the debating and the arguing that we had improve of humanity well this is an old motto from politics let's just follow the money let's just follow what's happening with the money routes that are within proof of humanity and bottom line is that the role of clarus in the protocol became a decisive Factor on how we think about things proof of humanity is a protocol that was initially created by the clerostim which is an extraordinary team full of amazing developers great people um but ultimately when you start making this protocol subjects to democratic governance naturally there will be users that are more inclined to follow the interests of cleros usually obviously people that belong to the clear Rose Community who are pnk holders or who are employees of the company uh or you know obviously the core team of cleros and the community that is native to proof of humanity that came to the project because of proof of humanity are not necessarily to Plato's might have different interests than the very interesting this is an image from Dali I live to your imagination What keywords are used to in order to generate the image um so to show some stats we had 652 challenge profiles these are the profiles that are dubious profiles that might not follow correctly the process to do the proof of humanity video of these profiles we have a total of 153 addresses that acted as Challengers of this profiles the record month was 146 so the profile challenging has led uh to to to the whole game around proof of humanity becoming a little bit farthering from being a fair game and I'm gonna dive deep into this by the way on view analytics there are some numbers that are wrong and we actually checked the data so uh Salva who did the Dune analytics should correct some things because of the 652 challenge profiles we found out that you get if you get challenged 9 out of 10 times you will get rejected from the registry it means that if you are challenged 90 chances that you're gonna get kicked out you will not be able to offend yourself and uh that's a not a very good thing for the onboarding process for a lot of the users it's a very risky thing we looked into the 90 of the profiles that got challenged and it turns out that ninety percent of the profiles the main reason why profiles are challenged we have the protocol has formalized a couple of States whether the person is deceased and the person died the person does not exist maybe a deep fake the person might be a duplicate it's a civil attacker or incorrect submission the person just didn't follow the steps properly well incorrect submission is 90 of the profits that get challenged get challenged for making an incorrect submission that for making a mistake a simple mistake and the problem we have a deeper look even a deeper look into this on into this into these submissions and the the number one reason is incorrect address someone submitted the address and is showing the incorrect address in the video or it's the address in the video is not matching the address from the submission a lot of challenges because of the video size the resolution in pixels of the video you get rejected from upgrading uploading a video eight pixels smaller than what is the requirement uh video artifact no sign address and readable address mismatch facial feature is not visible like Kevin owaki looking three quarters so a closer inspection shows that 90 percent of the people lost their deposit which until very recently was 0.1 if which is 600 500 which is a lot of money especially Latin America where we have a lot of users they got kicked out of the protocol ninety percent of the people got kicked out of the protocol for making honest mistakes honest mistakes so vitalik said it uh in our chats this you lose your deposit if you do it wrong mechanism is Harsh it is very harsh and it's not a good look on web3 it's not a good look on how we are trying to onboard people and give them the right to Identity malicious Challengers exist and they are constantly attacking and taking advantage of the unsuspecting users all the time and we even have a category the a category of users we call both Challengers who are addresses that vouch for someone and then immediately challenge the very person that they have voted for in order to take their stake so we have a lot of malicious users and rejecting tokens if you're doing if you're doing this kind of magazine mechanism to build a list of tokens or to build a list of objects you know that's fine but rejecting humans for making honest mistakes is discrimination you are discriminating users because they don't have the skills the knowledge or the know-how on how to interact with web 3 protocols so here's a simple very rule very important rule of thumb that I would like to to enforce into our community Justice is not the same as logic more often than not we have in our debates a sort of positivist view on how things should be done oh the person didn't show the the label probably didn't follow the steps properly and it takes a it takes a look around the around the behavior of people which puts logic over justice but Justice is very different from logic Justice Means trying to make a system that is fair that is empathic that is able to attempt and not to punish people for making human mistakes we're dealing with humans we are not dealing with robots and the universe of humans is very different from the universe of robots so some of the most controversial changes that we had to the protocol and the Dao just to give you an example the very first one was the video resolution thing uh people were getting rejected because videos had 352 pixels of resolution instead of the recommended three of the required 360. because WhatsApp apparently crops videos and people were sharing and testing videos on WhatsApp before uh uploading them to proof of humanity people getting rejected for 8 pixels is not very very fair we had a people we have very strong debate about allowing people to speak in their own language believe it or not we have a lot of people opposing to making the proof in your very own language you know a lot of people don't know English so we had to actually fight to get people to be able to do the video proof in Spanish um we had to we we had the telegram groups which were built by the community the community did everything to create not only the official groups but also the groups that helped people to get vouches the groups that help people to learn how to make the video groups that pay for the deposit for users a lot of groups were built by the community only to one day suddenly find them uh being captured by the clearest organization which led to voting official groups on Telegram and Twitter and last but not least we found a user Farming delegations Farming almost 180 delegations of profiles that were delegating to this person the very second these profiles were created which led to a debate around the nature of how we tally delegations we came up with a model of quadratic delegations which incentivizes people to actually delegate to users with fewer delegations and makes delegate whales like myself don't have as much power over the more delegations they get this is a very new idea and we actually won that one with 70 percent of the votes so if we actually grab the top top five these are the top six I think we have here but if you grab the top 10 uh between the clear side and declares native users and the proof of humanity users the interesting thing is that the proof of humanity Community it has begun to win most of the proposals in contrast to the clearest native community and this is interesting because clearos of course they created the protocol they started the whole proof of humanity project in collaboration with many researchers which I was very lucky to be among the very first ones to be contributing and collaborating on this project but no single project ever begins decentralized nothing begins decentralized you have to build decentralization and you have to code the mechanisms for decentralizations over time and democracy can legitimately help decentralize Taos if we look uh today at as of today as of today you know if we look at the proposals proposals started by the community have 79 chances to get approved then proposals started by the creators of the protocol which is the the declaros community so the community has been able to gather power the users of proof of humanity have been able to gather power and put the the let their voice be heard thanks to democracy democracy decentralizes daos this is what we're seeing in proof of humanity democracy is able to decentralize the power of the elite of developers that might have control over the protocol might want to try to attempt to have control over the Dao But ultimately democracy is a good recipe against neo-reactionaries neo-rectionaries is this world where users have no choice but to choose whether to go to this Elite of developers or to this other Elite of developers it's a federal model where users have no rights only the developers and the elite get to choose how what are the rules of the system what are the rules of the of the protocol and users are left voiceless but if we are democratic if we build Democratic dials users have a voice users are able to be heard and this helps to actually factually decentralize the centralized the power the centralized the the community and empower the users over the elite of developers that might try to control absolutely everything so let's talk about the bright side of life what has led to the growth of proof of humanity you know we were roughly 17 000 users right now it's good to analyze what led to the growth if we look over time since the launch of the protocol this is somewhat how the curve looks of user adoption and the story behind this chart is that we can also look at the history of the price of the Ubi token the Ubi token had two big Moments One is during launch during launch there was a lot of enthusiasm around the idea of Ubi so we had a lot of uh Curious users that were interested in learning about this token learning about proof of humanity and then we had the miraculous day on October last year a year ago when vitalik started buying and burning huge amounts of Ubi and those those the vitalik burn the vitalik burn has led to a lot of users interested in proof of humanity and Ubi if we put the two charts together the proof of humanity being the yellow line and the Ubi price being the green line you know this is not a novelty in this industry price always drives adoption uh price is always an important thing for capturing and and getting users uh enthusiastic about that technology so Ubi is this simple protocol for Universal basic income it's very straightforward very simple rules which requires an effort for the community in order to make this miracle of turning on your phone and getting your basic needs covered happen Ubi is is a token that is streamed streamed in real time to verify humans on proof of humanity it's one Ubi per hour per human or 0.002h Ubi per per second for every human it streams in real time to your wallet there are Ubi burning daps and gains that help burn Ubi and build scarcity into the Ubi model it is composable with D5 protocols it's an erc20 token it can be composed with any kind of protocol and we had in this 20 months over 50 million dollars worth of Ubi transactions happening on the blockchain uh one of the most powerful things about Universal basic income is that it is the very feature that makes proof of humanity something different than being just a web free version of Facebook these are some of the real faces of the people that were impacted by the uh the power of Ubi when vitalik burned his tokens and bought like all of the tokens that were available on uni swap um Araceli here who is an oncology patient she and a single mother was able to use the money for Ubi to get help for their kind for her cancer treatment we had a lot of grandparents a lot of grandparents using web 3 for the first time of course it might be their their grandson or it might be a relative that is helping them to use the computer to be on board into proof of humanity but I I really for the first time in my life I'm seeing early adopters who belong to the third age could be our grandparents because they are in on countries like Argentina an alternative like Ubi for the first year it was actually a very real alternative to the pensions that people get from the state we had also users that were able to buy the materials to start building their first house we had users from all over the world that suddenly found in this idea of universal basic income on the blockchain in a censorship resistant Network there's a user from Myanmar Myanmar is going through a dictatorship through a terrible dictatorship and because ethereum is censorship resistant because proof of humanity runs on ethereum we are able to reach vulnerable populations that could definitely benefit significantly from having fifty dollars a month or ten dollars a month or even in you know if vitalik shows up 500 a month or a thousand dollars a month like we had during 2021 so we recently launched ubi.eth you can scan the QR code there has all the resources about Universal basic income about everything that we're trying to do with the Ubi token I'm very excited we're actually now working on the version 2 of uvi that allows to use your stream of uvi tokens and break it apart into multiple streams and you can delegate your stream to someone who needs needs it the most you can use 10 of your stream for a charity you can start using that streaming capacity in novel ways and we're very close to launching this on mainnet um we have applications like the Ubi burner actually any if that you send to Ubi dot is will go straight to the Ubi burner this is an amazing application built by Ruben from Venezuela uh who you know fell in love with the project very early on and it's any smart contract any any uh protocol anything that works on ethereum can connect to the Ubi burning and use a small percentage fee to burn Ubi tokens and we had even this one I really like coming from the clitos community project.if which is a sports betting platform and it uses three percent of the pool of three percent of the price pool uh to burn Ubi tokens um I'll finish very quickly just very quickly just one minute if you're kind enough I'll give you 15 seconds go first recommendations moving forward none of the human Farms got removed during the challenge period challenge period is pointless in proof of humanity um proof of humanity needs to be more accessible a high deposit is still a high barrier of adoption people complain about the high deposit it's not very inclusive uh just make proof of humanity work like a token curated registry reward Challengers that detect human Farms those are the real enemies not users making honest mistakes that's a stupid thing to punish and Universal basic income income is the proof of humanity killer that every new proof of humanity registration create organic liquidity and support Ubi which will bring even more users to the protocol perfect something here is the new version of proof of humanity thank you very much [Applause] if anyone has any questions for Santi please feel free to address them by the door right now we're going to follow up with the panel that we have coming up from our from the ethereum foundation fellowship program from the ethereum foundation fellows for the next billion I will come to the stage Abhishek Benson Gabriela and Marcus as you might be aware the ethereum foundation fellowship program was launched by the next billion to help projects that are looking to onboard people into the ethereum ecosystem thrive our panel will be talking about how to onboard the unbanked or underbanked into defy thank you great uh well good morning everyone thank you for for being here I know uh mornings after Ravi can be a bit of a struggle so appreciate you all all being here uh so I'll do a bit of an introduction uh to myself and the ethereum foundation Experian program and then I'll pass it on to the brilliant panelists we have up on stage so my name is my name is Marcus I am a fellow at the ethereum foundation where I am currently researching the implementations of Last Mile defy focusing primarily in Latin America and essentially asking ourselves how can we leverage defy to not just you know bring financial gain but actually Empower livelihoods in a real very tangible way so always happy to talk about these things at a later stage and context wise into the next billion team really the the essence of next billion is to ask ourselves how can we leverage ethereum and web 3 not just to onboard the next billion users but to create tangible very visceral changes in their lives and do so at a very scalable level so with that I will pass it on to the three panelists here to my left and allow them to introduce ourselves and tell us a little bit about what they're working on hey uh Audible hi I am Abhishek bhattacharya I'm one of the co-founders at a project called world what we do is we are a C5 to D5 Bridge we are we started three years back helping Farmers enabling Farmers take loan against their crops that they can store right after harvesting Farmers receive very less uh price for the crops at for the for per kilogram price for the crops that they grow we enable them we encourage them to store it in a warehouse in a government or a private warehouse and sell it off after three or four months when the prices are 40 or even sometimes 100 to 100 percent better we use blockchain to do that to bring banks on the table we'll be discussing about that as well that how we brought Banks onto blockchain and that is what we've been doing now we are going on to decentralized finance soon so that the same farmers in a country like India and maybe everywhere else can get access to D5 lending as well thank you thank you so I'm Gabriela I'm from Mexico I am working on blowing's blo INX that's an application decentralized application that manages saving circles you might know them as standards Couture's cheat funds or many ways around the world that's a way of people to actually let's say get an interest-free loan if you're one of the first uh from your friends or your family members and if you're the last you're actually contributing for them to get this these loan why this is important for us in Mexico and Latin America Asia and Africa it's not easy for us to get a loan and if we get one it's super normal to have 50 interest rate 100 percent and people don't read the small letters so we get into very big depth so this is why it's important to give them options to actually have this let's say social credit options so that's what we're doing hello everyone my name is Benson yuguna I come from Kenya um we've been working with smallholder Farmers with acre Africa solving the insurance problem so Agri insurance has been a problem where we have very low penetration for years it has been around three percent of the smallholders taking up insurance and we feel it's important for them to take up insurance and many other traders who are earning an income because we were able to protect them because lack of insurance has left most of the the farmers exposed to hunger because after a climate effect then no food then it means they can't sell because it also the food has been affected meaning no income and a whole cycle of unfavorable things so with that we are doing this solving the problems that are making them not take up insurance and blockchain has helped us to do some of these things which we'll discuss as we go on thank you Marcus awesome thank you um so yeah an incredible group of people here doing amazing work uh really just changing people's lives in a very real sense using you know this technology so I mean I just before maybe to set a little bit of context we could just go around and and uh just perhaps lay the scene of you know we've got India Latin America and Africa up here on stage across each of your respective regions what have you what is it about the traditional systems and our current incumbent systems that are set in place that are currently falling short for whether it's for Farmers or for local communities and saving circles where are traditional incumbent institutions falling short and on the other side of the equation there what is it unique what is unique about defy that enables your proposition to be unlocked through leveraging you know distributed ledgers Etc so uh maybe I'll be sure kick it off to you sure currently uh in India everywhere else also as we are expanding globally um is for example talking about the loans that we give to Farmers these are centralized Finance Loans given by Banks since ages it's not something we brought on but there's a lot of fraud in that and that's of course fraud is the biggest thing that blockchain solves anyway that's where blockchain finds most use case in fintech so as a fintech organization we saw that the government systems the the banking systems the entire uh platform that is available to the farmers and to the banks is not is not sufficient and blockchain could help banks are pulling out of this entire uh ecosystem leaving Farmers into the hands of usurious money lenders with outrageous interest rates so that's one one you know drawback that systems like in India the government organizations they have and uh you talked about D5 D5 is a very new thing farmers of course have nothing to do with D5 like to understand the concept but it is at play at the back end where I personally believe that it's access to so as we say there are more than 1.7 billion unbanked people across the globe with D5 we do not have to just go wait for a bank to process the loans even though if it's in real time it's still 15 minutes 30 minutes that's as real time as it gets for the farmers at this moment but with the D5 it is access to the global D5 capital and on the other hand it's a good thing for the for the D5 lenders as well because they get access to really stable assets not not against speculative crypto these are crops non-perishable crops May soybean rice anything you name it and that's that's where they would be interested in driving the D5 capital and we would be interested in replacing those systems that are already there uh and and the shortcomings with with this new system helped by D5 blockchain web 3 altogether Hey so uh situation in Mexico right right now with the ethereum foundation where I'm going to focusing on women what's the situation there so we have uh legally a 48-hour work week so imagine uh family a single mom that has two kids has to work 48 hours and then has to take Transportation then she has no time we don't have a good health care System well a child to a day care system so it's difficult so what option do they have informality there are two billion people around the world talking now about next billion we have two billion people around the world that are uninformally employed why because of this because they sell informally because they're Farmers so uh this is the situation they live day to day they either bake cakes or creams do massages or whatever thing they might think of so uh it's difficult what happens when they need they have medical emergency with their kids they need cash right they try to get it from a centralized financial institution but what happens is that they require a proof of income which they don't have so this is a serious issue they have this option of getting loans from informal lenders but super high interest rates or they have this other option what why these options already exist these options have been there for 100 years in many countries what you do there is you put in your social credit right so uh why blockchain well it's decentralized you can join a saving Circle uh yes you have the same risks of a common saving Circle but we can exploit their uh trust ability we know exactly what was the posited and when it was deposited and then to who it what it was paid to so that's super important in our case where we have a lot of corruption and people doing none let's say legal or correct ethical things so this is important for us and also we can leverage a reputation system that can eventually uh serve as a foundation for for them to actually get a loan from our financial institution for a bigger amount so this is why blockchain is there everything is Unchained so it's permanent immutable and node subject to to change by anyone so that's why well I'll I'll cue what Gabriela said so in defy in our context in Africa a case in point in Kenya we have mobile money as is a digital technology uh it's for example in Kenya it has over 98 adoption meaning almost every adult citizen has a wallet a mobile money wallet um but we still find challenges challenges in how how much they paying how much they're paying for the loans so we have very high interest on the loans in fact they regarded as predatorial uh in in fact even the central bank has been tracking down so this access to finance uh has been a challenge because of high interest rates and when it comes now to defy to protect for example income so a farmer has income how what why are we saying if I can help solve the problem so for us it was the transparency in the traditional Insurance business so an agent will go to the field convince a farmer to buy insurance but then keep quiet for a whole six months a season would take around six months next time they see the agent will be next time they're selling so no information no no didn't know what policy they took what was happening about it now with blockchain we're able to enable the farmer using feature phones the penetrations of feature phones is high uh to dial a style a number and able to see so far you your policy has triggered this percentage which is equivalent to this amount of money and also the triggers that were used to say determine whether they qualify for a claim or not are tamper evident so we generate hashes put them on chain so you can to prove you just need to produce the hash and compare it with the data since we don't publish the Pharma data on chain but yeah that's how we Define and blockchain is revolutionizing financing incredible amazing um yeah I find it really interesting that each of you is sort of working it through different sectors you're working very much so you know with governments and large Regulators as well and trying to figure out a lot of the real world asset integration as well and Gabriela you're very much so kind of working with local uh you know women level cooperatives and and figuring out like how do you download and work with metamask for example we were talking about that earlier right and how you even would you know add polygon to your metamask wallet and just thinking about what that user experience is like and then Benson like you're tying in all this technology that already exists out in the world too right and you're saying hey we've got mpesa ussd transactions as well and we're tying in you know climate data and so I just appreciate the the breadth to which each of you is is leveraging this and on that point I mean perhaps Abby you could paint a little bit of that picture of what it's been like working with uh kind of incumbent institutions in your jurisdiction right so you mentioned you're speaking with banks you're speaking with Regulators in the space as well you're very much so working with real world assets which is just just a fascinating Concept in and of itself too so I wonder if you could set a little bit of a light on that because that's been a really sort of Hot Topic in the space recently how we integrate real world assets within D5 so maybe you can shed some light on that yes I mean I understand because the entire blockchain ecosystem has always been wondering that uh how do banks and governments fit in with the ecosystem how to bring them on board I have met so many people here people working with the Colombian government I work with Indian government he's working with the Kenyan government so uh definitely now Banks and governments and all those institutions have started opening up to you know to to adopting blockchain based systems but then there are certain boundaries that you'll always always would have to keep in mind so for example I we could not have just asked to ask the bank to come and join us on a public blockchain right like ethereum polygon um but on the other hand uh so so it has to be designed very specifically so that you can take them in confidence one very important thing about Banks and uh I mean especially big Banks right and in India there are a handful of big Banks big odds and uh is that their sales Cycles are too long because it's just how they are right and further crossing the barrier of going onto a blockchain platform internally they have that bureaucracy as well that is a tough sell already but one thing we have constantly seen seen in our use case is that not a single bank has ever said that no this is not something we want because again this is not a domain this is called Warehouse receipt Finance you store a crop you take a loan against it it's as simple as that it has been in fact it has been it is one of the oldest lending products known to mankind what we did was we we just made it better right but Banks knew it and banks have been facing these fraud since decades so and they tried solving it with Legacy Technologies which they haven't been able to so they were open to at least open to adopting blockchain right they knew firsthand so yeah there's a very clear distinction here firsthand they knew we are only talking about blockchain technology and we are not talking about cryptocurrency blockchain banks on blockchain will barely ever get involved with cryptocurrency at least in such use cases not in uh the ones where we are talking about cbdc or or cross-border payments Etc but here they have to be very clear so what we did was to onboard them we created a permission blockchain which Quorum which was built by JPMorgan so came as a perfect use case that JP Morgan is running a 400 Bank strong Network on the same blockchain so why not we use it use the same thing and then when the banks were on board we also talked to the governments of course as much as possible reaching out there are state governments in India and then they saw that okay there's an opportunity no cryptocurrency involved the Indian government has been very supportive of blockchain I mean you know we have seen we have heard the Indian honorable Indian Prime Minister Modi we have seen him speak about blockchain at the Singapore fintech Festival last year he was very very you know praiseworthy for for blockchain so uh the government accepts it accepts it really uh till the time we do not bring cryptocurrency the challenge here is that bringing D5 onto the same platform which is where things become very complicated which is something we're trying to navigate even at this moment we are trying to keep them uh separate Banks won't be interacting with the crypto ecosystem the crypto D5 lenders won't be interacting with these C5 lenders but the farmer should be benefited so the farmer on the click of a button on a multilingual app would be having access to whether to take this moment this crop loan against that particular crop in D5 or in C5 that's what we're trying to abstract it's a challenge it's still a challenge I'm pretty sure that Kenya and Latin America they would be facing the same problems because it's just how it is I mean you know it's just a decade of blockchain that we've seen governments are not ready to accept it just at the first go that's that's what we've seen yeah yeah it's true for example in our project uh we were dealing with the insurance regulator so you have to prove that you're not using crypto so you don't have you don't need to mention crypto results we start with the efficiency so we're bringing a technology that will do exactly what has been happening but now we can pay claims immediately at the end of the season you don't have to work for six months so after a while the Kenya government is really good the regulator has what we call a Sandbox so it gives any crazy idea to to apply and say we want to try out this and this and this so part of this sandbox is where we are now trying to see how can we introduce risk uh crypto based risk pools where now we can pay out from from a certain risk pool that has been funded by by the community like the defy Community Abby is talking about so the regulator has been yeah start with the technology and then crypto later yeah I mean we've obviously seen a lot of regulatory talk and that you know sorry we'll sort of get back down on throughout much of this conversation but it is a really important consideration right especially if we want to reach sort of critical mass if we want to do Integrations with wider Partners as well thinking about how we do that definitely we'll take a lot of thought and and you know having even sort of these spaces for all of us to say hey these are the benefits of D5 here is how and I think being able to align with traditional financial institutions and governments and regulators and saying listen these are the these are the benefits that comes to you I think oftentimes there's obviously this very oppositional position that that comes up when we speak about defy in emerging markets and around the world right so and we've seen the likes of uniswap with the DFI education fund as well really push for more education more advocacy at the regulatory level which is obviously hugely hugely important but switching over you know gears a little bit uh gaudia I think one of the really fascinating things and Abby was touching on this too was the idea that what you're offering I'll be for example isn't necessarily new right um and and being able to Warehouse financing isn't a particularly new innovation the problem is that the traditional financial institutions haven't quite been serving Last Mile communities because there isn't enough value for them to engage with as they do these things so Gabriela also with the tandas you know there's something really interesting there as well where as you said you know these are Traditions that are hundreds of years old so particularly with D5 like what what is it about tandas and decentralized finance that unlocks that value and and really enables people to be able to do this at scale yes for uh so people were people we like tradition especially in markets like Latin America uh we do what our parents and grandparents did because it's just how we are we're very familiar uh let's say uh community so uh what happens if you for example um someone tells you hey getting to crypto because you can pull your funds and then you can put it in a farm and then you get the yield and then you're a farmer and it's like right uh tell this to a mom who lives day by day and has very few to actually take that risk right so uh what happens there is that this is a way to get them with a known thing right they also say Victor because they already have been in many of these many times so you take this something known into the blockchain and then you get them hey you can use your wallet you're using your saving Circle but they don't know they're using that app So eventually they will be able to get loans to stake to eventually get into a pool and do whole divide things right that they can that can unlock like that fear of what's this right the yield and it's just too much information from the beginning so these tools that are things that have already been happening many years can enable this to go to an audience that may not be that technologically savvy but has a need for these Technologies and they can use it for something very tangible just like like we saw with Ubi right for pay for uniforms for school or for a medical emergency or something that could really benefit them in day by day right so that's why we think these types of tools known could be good for these next billion users we're looking at yeah um casing point in Kenya as well what what are in Africa to actually have a farmer operator wallet and they can deposit and withdraw its yes as Gabriella put it it may not it's quite hard it's not it's at it's it will take time as to train but we see an additional layer of we see a layer of um we call it custodians so for example we have a payment Gateway an on-ramp of ramp called kotanipe we have bitlipper in Kenya doing a good job so what they do they they store the keys for for the farmer and now translate each wallet into a ussd based wallet so a farmer would dial style 800 hash the co access your wallet oh yeah withdraw to m-pesa because the m-pesa is their mobile money they can withdraw but you see they they are used to the ussd they're used to m-pesa the part of wallet connection somebody else is doing it at another level for them and with time as we get more adoption of smartphones because also smartphone is an issue uh we have like a third of the people uh have smartphones or 2 ads and that is the one that still has the feature phones the button ones so once we see more of smartphones coming in then we feel more people will be able to control the the defy Wallets on themselves and uh yeah and also we other strategies that we are introducing uh the government is really keen on Capital flight so on ramp you're changing your local currency to a usdc for example so if you you we start with projects that bring in money into the country for example there is Diva protocol and Fortune connect we tapping donations globally and reaching and pushing through like uh this off-ramp to to the farmer so the farmer is able to access uh ussd and withdraw for example donation but then this has started introducing them to differ so they'll see oh with time so this money was crypto now I have converted it to my local currency ah so we can slowly move down from the custodians of keys to actually having them be the holders of their own keys with time yeah yeah I think so the work acre Africa by is doing by the way is super fascinating right so they're essentially enabled like just when I when I learned about your project I was super blown away right the fact that you can essentially sort of execute these transactions utilizing ussd and integrate that with m-pesa just speak so much to the composability of these different sort of building blocks and Legos but I'd love to and and you mentioned as well like mobile phones right we've seen an increase in in traction with mobile phone use as well and when it comes to crypto we're still super far off um you know I tried editing an ens record today on my cell phone on my metamask it was like such a pain um and and so mobile phone sort of integration with wallets and generally just like crypto is still really far off and I think that is a huge huge unlock for you know there are more cell phones in Colombia than there are people right so when you think about what that means for the development of a technology that's really powerful so the question is you know and maybe starting with you Benson what are you what do you feel are really the sort of at the use end user or experience perspective what are the big unlocks that are missing for D5 here you know I'm sure we've got a room here full of people that are really Keen to get building and are already exploring sort of problem spaces and solutions so maybe we can touch a little bit on the current sort of end user challenges and what you believe are really the the underlying underlock said maybe we can work work our way backwards here to get each of your your thoughts on on those aspects thank you thank you uh Marcus so the biggest two challenges that we see is capacity building for them to understand that this is as good as mpesa it's just crypto how do you make them understand that it's not uh fraud because then that comes to my second point we need to deal with the trust if we deal with had them knowing how to work with it then bringing tools introducing slowly building on the blocks uh yeah off-ramp solution connect to m-pesa then with time you can go directly to the off-ramp so uh directly they can now directly rate they don't have to really withdraw because you'd ask a farmer what's your incentive you have been res you've received a donation in usdc or why are you withdrawing it to m-pesa you can go to that Merchant and whatever you wanted to buy or still buy and it will avoid the transactional fees that are in between here so dealing with uh with trust dealing with knowledge and also yeah trying to reduce as much as possible the transaction fees transaction fees are a big issue and the interests that come in between these transactions uh we think those are the building blocks that can really bring a lot of adoption um yeah and also smartphone the more smartphones people have then more control of their own D5 gateways right so smartphones I think are key in in Mexico it's the same thing people have phones they access Internet through their phones but have no computers or anything right so we we see that um uh I think one thing that I've come up with is that there are many people that with this uh fomo or with our situation desperation I don't know how to call it um they want to get rich right away right so we see a lot of people that actually got scammed and getting one person that got scammed like let's say at the beginning in their Journey uh it's super hard for them to get them back in again so we see that happening we see them we see there are people that have not good intentions and that are making it very very hard for people like uh all of these people here that are trying to make something good so that's why you're you're not mentioning crypto at all right so uh yeah so that's that's some that's a real challenge uh one person that got scammed once is going to convince 50 people but one person that uses it how many people you think is going to actually convert let's say let's say in a word two or three people so that's a challenge uh also um ux fortunately many tools have been translated to Spanish into different allowances around the world but we still need that Community feeling because in Latin America we are like very close we like being in community doing things in community so uh Community I think is key so we have a lot of uh let's say people building these communities now we need to reach that next billion right so we need to reach out not those communities to keep to themselves but how can we make that scalable let's say not just convert once and then you get your crypto friends and then you have your 50 crypto friends and that's it how can you get that sense of community uh scalable in a trustworthy way so I think that's an interesting question and ux I think is super important having applications we now see more and more Crypt applications mobile first which is great having just enough information in the screen that you need I think that's super important to research and to actually not just research with crypto people research with the next billion right because we're used to having your balance here your wallet here but what do new users actually need right so that's a good question I believe yeah for us it has been a very interesting case study um what we did was we created a multilingual app it's available in English first Hindi then and then Marathi which is another Regional language in it so what happened was we we thought that okay multilingual app is going to be very good when we launched it we were uh we we saw that okay the adoption is definitely not not much so what happened was so what what basically happened we redesigned the entire system two years back again right after launching and we put all those same functionalities which is available to the farmer from their phone we put that on the the custodians and because they we have given we have given products to everyone to use uh web-based on mobile based so so that the farmer can just walk in which is the easiest thing to do and just request the the custodian that please help me take a loan against it six months eight months down the line or one year down the line gradually we were surprised again we saw that farmers have actually started liking the app I don't know we did not roll out any major upgrade we did not add any more languages it was there what was there but then I think somewhere the custodians started making the farmers believe that it is a very simple app to use just try it once let me guide you use the app and then see how it looks and then they found that yes it's a one-click process one-click loan application they are not accustomed to like like everyone else us they are not accustomed to getting uh getting food delivered on phone getting Insurance booked on the click of a button for them this was the first ever such application that they were seeing in their lives and now they have become very confident using it and as you said that you know one person how many people would they say would they you know speak to regarding the benefits that they've received in our case word of mouth has really worked because farmers are very close right it's a very small community they have been there in that area since generation they know which Warehouse is nearby which is nearby where they have to go they just with that word of mouth and they just started telling everyone that hey do you know I mean I just got Loan in 15 minutes I mean in my life my father has never seen it I have never seen it uh and and whenever it happened it was like 13 to 15 days running post to pillar at Banks and then then you know getting the loan and whenever you're running there you are not basically not farming and you're not earning so so this was very very revolutionary for them and now we can see that that adoption Gap has really bridged because now they're comfortable as we move to other states so India has a lot of regional languages right hundreds or thousands I think so we would be just onboarding new languages which is not a difficult thing for our developers to do once we do that we have cracked that okay with the support of technology and with on-ground support and which is already there from the government we don't have to deploy our boots on the ground so I think I think that is something that is is working really well for for farmers in India and I believe another thing that that comes to my mind is uh in India again same thing as you said more more phones than people in Colombia um India huge population 1.4 billion people but one thing is that with a lot of changes in fintech in in technology almost every other person is having a phone now not feature phone a smartphone right there are very cheap phones if I talk about Indian rupees it's about what six thousand five thousand Indian rupees um maybe maybe uh seventy dollars eighty dollars so people are buying people are buying these smartphones and now they are onboarded onto the technology every single every single you know the cart roadside cart or vendor or or you know the auto Wallace right the the uh the local auto haulers everyone has a QR code you can just scan it and pay it it's not just us paying via QR code anymore it's almost everyone paying by QR has started paying my QR code that helps us that acts as a Tailwind for us because they already have been using the phones we just say that okay let me let me open an app in your phone and that's it now start using this app for this part of your life and and you it'll all be solved and then they're very looking forward to that so that has helped us a lot in a country like India when we are going outside we'll see you know what what other countries use so we'll have to adapt to that yeah maybe to contribute to the user interface yeah to onboard more Farmers so it's a combination of the user interface and user experience casing point in one of the example in selling Insurance in initially selling Insurance the agent would work with a folder with forms you would fill in the formal feeling must sign Etc so bring in a user interface that that is almost similar so we started with scratch cards so a scratch card that they would scratch reveal a certain number and then now use the phone the ussd to send that number and automatically that's how they were on boarded into Insurance we'd collects now information in that way technologically wise using triangulation we're able to get the location of the farm since it's important the card code is associated with a crop It's associated with a location It's associated with the agent who sold at that point so with you leave them behind with a card and they'll say oh this is my insurance the card but actually the insurance is something you cannot touch but if such people now over time are able to dial the ussd code without having to to scratch a card or remain with something since they've trusted the process so that Journey has to start somewhere slowly bring them in and build that so we see the the Need For You user experience that is well thought out yeah just to add to that I mean you're solving the insurance problem honestly uh so I've tried selling Insurance before so before starting this organization I was with with a company called policy Bazaar which sells which is an Indian unicorn sells Insurance even selling Insurance in an automated way to Urban people to educated people is a difficult task so with Farmers I'm pretty sure it's a daunting task but if it's getting sold and I think the farmers are really getting a good service I I just uh one question to all of you like you mentioned how much time did they actually like spread spend to get a loan yeah how much time is it earlier it was 13 to 15 days now it's 10 to 15 minutes which is like real time perfect so what about Guatemala yeah so I was uh I met some we held a side event the other day and I mentioned this anecdote earlier but I was sitting at the dinner table with my dad and we were talking about you know I think he's yet to become a full on sort of crypto convert um we're working on it but you he was we were sitting at the dinner table I was like hey let's both sit down on our phones and try and get a let's try and get a loan so he went on his like mobile banking app he had to fill out like a 20-minute survey input all these different things and he's like oh they'll get back to me in two weeks um I went on Ave put up uh you know over collateralized loan done in five seconds right and I was like check it out here's my here's my money um and and so I think you know literally in Guatemala could take a number of weeks to get a loan and that's the magic of this right and that's sort of a little bit of what the actor chose is you know a matter of seconds right same in Mexico in Kenya because of the mobile money wallet you can get a loan instantly but now you pay heavily by the time you calculate is over 120 percent interest so yeah that's that's really common by the way for those of you that are surprised in in emerging economies or is the normal uh interest rate yes yeah I mean you can pay like you know it's bad when the interest rate is posted daily and it's like two percent daily um so yeah this is the reality of of the countries that you know we're in and this is what D5 is here to disrupt and promise right when you think about the fact that you can take out a loan on D5 for you know three five percent obviously there's a lot of questions here around the collateral et cetera et cetera um and but the reality is it's you know there's there's a lot to be said for how can we bring down you know interest rates that are hundreds of percentage points thousands at times um down to you know single single uh single percentage points so just we will do just like one last question um and this will be just a bit of a go around and then would love to open it up to the audience for for a bit of q a in the last 10 minutes um so the we've got a room here obviously of people that are all largely probably very familiar with the space and the ecosystem and the question would be and we we spoke previously about what are the challenges on the other side right so what are the challenges for the end users in Africa and Asia and in Latin America as well uh but I guess I'd like to flip the question on the other side of that is like what's coming back to you to the ethereum ecosystem by deploying these Solutions right we're no longer becoming a self-referential system we're actually able to draw in a lot of feedback and a lot of input around user experience around mobile phone adoption you know all these other things so if maybe we can just spend like a few minutes on on that and then we'll turn it over to the audience for a quick q a um so yeah just feel free to take it away on what can you know what can the ethereum community learn from deploying Last Mile defy Solutions good let me maybe let me start with what the the community has done when it realizes you're doing something so for us when we said okay we need to solve this problem but we immediately got support from the community the ethereum community is passionate this the the people who are here I believe most of the people are here are passionate so the first help we got was from either risk is that uh they were they had built a generic Insurance framework and they said okay uh you can build your application on top we'll give you technical support and we'll give you time and we will always spend ensure that you're able to run it we received support from the foundation ethereum Foundation they helped in the networking and we also chain link heard about it because we are using weathering data to determine whether to Bear claim or not they say how can we help to ensure that your source of truth is actually a source of truth and not only that moreover financially they got a lot of financial support got a lot of human people spending time with you people experts who are very busy spending time with you to help you and also now with that I think we can say the the community um and what people should do if you hear of a good project I think uh we couldn't have been here if we people didn't just come and jump in and helped in the in the in the journey so we could say let's be lights on the paths of starting projects and you will see great great impact because of that so I could say that's a on the support the community has helped and now now what what are we seeing the Community Learning you see like Lessons Learned for us the community is able to understand you can't just directly bring in uh crypto and you expect the farmer to use So This research lessons uh other people now are able to apply on their different projects if they need to reach the last mile customers thank you well first I would like to say that well if we are onboarding people from our countries that let's say as I said live day by day we're bringing people that can use these to benefit in their real life and we can bring actually these examples and get the community I mean in give it let's say more empathy right because sometimes we are yeah I mean we're here we have a roof we have uh air conditioning and we're not get if it rains there's no problem we can go out and get water and drinks and go to a bathroom and we have everything right so uh getting these people into the the space could be very interesting because that way we could maybe uh be sensible to the realities of others and how can they benefit so I think empathy is an interesting part and also we're bringing in people that actually need financing need things so we can actually also balance the offer and demand so that could also be interesting for community yeah so uh talking about giving back to the ethereum community right or or bringing the ethereum community on board ethereum has reached Millions right and that's what the purpose of the next objective is to reach the next billion um with with all these projects so these are these are few handful of the projects in Kenya India Latin America there are so many more projects that are already on ethereum or on one of the l2s and trying to trying to get a larger share of the ecosystem so I believe that that by by bringing by the support first of all with the foundation with the community it's a huge Community right the largest of all the chains that we know all together I think I think we are at such a right spot to to like be in a very synergistic relationship where where the projects need communities no project Works without Community you name any right and and then once that is done more and more projects can come on the Chain come into the ecosystem help each other reach more masses if we are reaching maybe a small holder marginal farmers in India someone else could be reaching blue collar workers in in in Australia or anywhere else right there are still so many projects and things that can that can still come on the on the chain and and I think now is the right right spot right time to do that so that's what we're looking forward to it incredible thank you I'm uh yeah just incredibly honored to be sharing the stage here with you all and we've got a few minutes left here so um maybe we'll just take a few questions uh and then we'll we'll call it a day so gentlemen with a blue shirt uh you put your hand up first yep very very yeah and sorry if you could maybe we'll we'll just pass the mic over to you hello um fellow Latin American here it's good to hear that it's that this is doing a good this is this is doing some good um I want to know if uh well as I understand you are all using uh the blockchain more to register people or their hashes of their information so are you planning to use uh to use that information and that identity you being a verifier so that for example we they can use a protocol similar to the proof of humanity that was here around an hour ago so that for example you can prove that that person exists a modern just that person being able to receive a loan yeah I definitely see us contributing to proof of humanity for example what represents a person for us is a transaction which is hushed so if the details of the person has the same way we do the passwords can be hushed because we don't do that we just do the entire thing then we can contribute in some way because that hash is a combination of the location of their names their phone number registered in government and many other details so we feel uh looking at how uh what using how can we use this hash to prove is the truth yeah the ZK roll up Etc I think it's part of the thing that can work so yeah I just want to add to that likewise we also do not put the direct details it's not right you know because you have a right to you need to give a right to forget right um and once you put all your all their pis onto the blockchain you cannot forget them so uh but there are these are the challenges but yeah somewhere if you you can you know you know taking more solutions and bringing some sort of identity on blockchain like from the foundation I was having a very good discussion regarding so in India we have aadhar which is like with 1.4 billion people if we onboard that onto the blockchain just imagine what kind of identification can that be right and then you can subsequently use it possibly across other chains you know cross chain as well but yeah it will always have some challenges it will have you know uh barriers to entry as well uh but at this moment I don't think that a lot of people are putting identity directly on blockchain or maybe combining it with some sort of did decentralized identity and making it work but not not in 100 of it yeah in my opinion I think it could be interesting combining reputation with proof of humanity because that makes uh if someone uh for example didn't pay a saving Circle they get a bad reputation in their wallet and it's permanent right um then they can just change wallets right but linking that to uh proof of humanity I think that's interesting uh for a moment we're not putting any personal information on chain it's your wallet if you paid or you didn't pay it's stored with the event of the smart contract and that's how it's tracked thank you um yeah sure right right there second row the principal the capital comes from D5 or C5 and the interest rate the initial guari approximately uh how much pay of Interest the the taker thank you I think that the question is to me anyway so um so uh yeah so that's that's a that's a beautiful part of the entire platform since two and a half years banks have already been giving loans on the platform 7 million till now that's completely centralized finance loan as you can see now once we go live on the mainnet it would be uh D5 loans as well they would be disjointed amongst themselves right the C5 and D5 part but the Pharma would have access to both from the click of a button so you see it's a bridge it's not we are stopping one and starting another it's just that we're bridging in fact yeah so that's that's what it's the need of the art at this moment and whenever the farmer would see that okay one C5 has a lower interest rate or defazer lower interest rate they can just go ahead and choose that option farmer has nothing to do with which I'm specifically choosing right one point here is that for the D5 solution we would also need an off-ramp solution because you can imagine I can just go ahead and give usdc to a farmer and say that okay yeah you know buy your next crops uh you know next season cycle for that with that usdc so that is the challenge you asked about interest rate it is uh currently nine percent for annum so it's very low it's one of the lowest in India and we have seen across other countries as well that this interest rate is very very low uh in the market and once we go on D5 were expecting somewhere around seven to eleven percent again which is a very stable interest rate in in terms of D5 I'm personally really excited for when a farmer in India can buy their crops with crypto that's that's right something to be excited about yeah so um yeah deeper there and this will be the the last question and then uh we'll just yeah I just wanted to say that ethereum Foundation has done a great job by uniting for I don't know how many fellows are there in all together there's seven seven in the second cohort and now you all are talking to each other and you're collaborating and learning from each other but there are many other projects in the ethereum ecosystem and that are doing reaching to the next billion people like this good dollar there's proof of humanity there is uh human Dao human though is actually bringing work to people providing economic opportunities so I think it's very important that maybe we need to form like a next billion Dao or something where everybody can be in one group and then on top of your like your services you can provide their services and stuff like that and learn from each other because uh for instance good dollars in over 200 countries and as part of my study because I'm writing a book on impact that was a human down good develop a part of my studies and they got to learn about each other and now they're working together you know in in a lot of countries that they're going to so I think it's very important that we start like a next billion Dao or something like that I think that's like a really really fascinating idea and I mean I think that's a lot of the the work that I'm doing is basically ecosystem research um and what will come out of that is basically a whole ecosystem map of different folks working on these specific Solutions sort of focusing on defy um so I think that's a great proposition I don't know if there's anything else you guys yeah no it's just similar to where we were talking about yesterday like how to gather these projects in an organized trustworthy way so yeah interesting question yeah I think those are pretty early still because you know so many more use cases are coming on now but I think that's a good idea next you know now for the next billion is is going to be good yeah yeah so I think that's a good thing to explore and congratulations on your book yeah awesome so just last minute maybe just a quick go-round um where can people find your work where can they find you and uh yeah we'll wrap it up yeah you can find us at be blowings blo like uh block with the sound of a peak where you put your piggyback savings that's it you can find me on Twitter at benjuguna on in uh Instagram no no Twitter is uh Duke Benson understand you're good on the telegram it's at benjuguna and email uh Africa and website africa.com yeah so for me it's uh it's the product name is World w h r r l comes from Warehouse receipt lending with an extra R in between uh or just search for Abhishek bhattacharya Twitter is that Abhishek yeah that's all so I think you should be able to find this online from the agenda anyway it's there incredible thank you yeah marcus.am as my website and my Twitter as well and um yeah thank you so much big round of applause for these incredible panelists thank you thank you so much we're taking a lunch break and we'll be back at 1pm with the next panel on the next billion thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Applause] [Music] I'm Joffrey do you want to introduce yourself sure thanks thanks so much so my name is Jeffrey I'm a co-founder at a y combinator back startup called Poco and I think for me how I'm involved as a fellow in ethereum Foundation is that I've been looking a lot at how we can better get Regulators to interact with webtree technology and to learn and understand not just the technology that we have here but also the culture that we have around decentralization and how they can build better policies that that the intersection between decentralized and centralized systems interesting interesting actually there was a very hot conversation about Revelations right now before the panelists started Jeffrey can you tell us a little bit about your background are you an engineer are you yeah so I kind of took a almost like accidental journey into the regulation and policy making process I actually start out um I got first introduced to uh Bitcoin in 2012 when I was in MIT uh doing research and then I was working on the product and Technology side of things uh launching a protocol in 2017 and then I found myself having to work a lot more with Regulators uh since then not the most fun thing to do but very important um and you know I was actually helping the Central Bank in Singapore um uh kind of launch their experiments around blockchain technology so they can learn and understand what's going on there but I think my journey and interest in blockchain technology is a lot more personal okay uh so I used to run a non-profit that trained women entrepreneurs in an ofic sanctioned country uh we were doing everything compliantly and then one day the bank comes to us and they said hey uh you are operating a high-risk environment we're going to shut down your company's uh your non-profits bank account uh and and that was a huge blow to us it took a lot of time to sort out those issues and the worst part of it is that we didn't do anything wrong you know we were compliant the bank made a business decision around the risk they had to face and I see that problem happening again today where uh because of the perception of regulators and the pressure from Regulators they are conflating activities that are legitimate and illegitimate and I think vastly affecting the industry I think that's something that motivates me to help Regulators better understand what web3 is all about awesome Jeffrey so uh as as Mary was introducing herself and now Joffrey we can see that probably because we don't like to talk about that and because we don't like to talk with Regulators maybe we can find the next billion people there right so I mean hey look can you share a bit about you your motivations your background thank you Jay hello everyone my name is Michael I'm coming from the world organization of the Scout movement this is where I lead the digital transformation and technological projects so can I say highlight this yeah like this like this okay yeah so I'm just out in the room and so yeah I'm here with the Italian fellowship and my project is basically about looking into how how to Gear Up This the movement educational non non-formal educational Movement Like scouting is or 58 million members in 220 territories around the world how do we bring them and get them ready for web 3-0 how do we make how do we work with young people um you know and to understand the blockchain and to be the citizens of the of the the future world yeah and what about uh like like your your educational background where are you coming from in that sense sure my education background is project management but then I basically all the time I was in the I.T type of projects and technological projects I volunteered for The Scouting for um for most of my life I was a scout and volunteered and then started very early actually to work for the world organization discount movement first in the European level and then later on now at the global headquarters which is now based in Malaysia for the past nine years awesome awesome love it so we can tell that perhaps from from and I I will try to oversimplify so no means to this respect so for my volunteering kind of approach from a legal Tech approach and from a policy making approach let's see and let's dig deeper into what's the next billion what we are thinking uh will be the next billion users for your turn Community um Jeffrey when we when you think or when you hear this question or when you joined the the next billion team I sent out everyone fellow what's the Persona that comes to your mind can you describe that person or that stereotype or that yeah subject yeah so um we're doing a lot of work with the government of Kazakhstan to Pilot certain experiments around web tree technology and also web 3 regulations um and I think the one thing that really stood out to me was that uh the Central Bank did a survey and they found that 25 of the population had exposure to crypto so and I think you'll see that consistent number going anywhere from 10 to 30 in most countries around the world and I think when you think about it there's really a population of like 70 uh that would not have touch uh any of these Technologies almost in every country in the world so I see it as a very very big pool of people who have not uh had access to crypto have not touched it and then once you think about actual decentralized technology because most people is their first exposures through on-rems through centralized exchanges uh once you think about actually say hey have you set up a metamask have you used any DM that number drops to maybe like five percent three percent and I think that's really the Gap that we're trying to close uh in a number of ways yeah interesting I I love when when this Statistics come and they say like hey just in 2021 the crypto adoption went like like a two thousand percent like oh that's a lot but then just in Latin America is like 30 million people out of 650 million so it represents almost nothing there there is a billion here and there right Marie what about you what's what's the Persona that that you think well that comes to your mind when you think of the next billion well when I think of the next billion I don't I don't think of it from the perspective of a Persona I think of it more as a product and then I think what exactly are we selling to the next billion and if I drill down into it what I see is what we're selling is a trusted product and service and if we take if we take a step down from that what we're selling is Trust so what we need to do to reach the next building billion is to build the trust of our ecosystem and these products and services that we make because if people don't trust us they won't use us okay so interesting I'm I'm willing to dig deeper here but I don't know how to put it I'll come back I'll come back to that it will come to me can you can you describe the Scouts can you I believe the discounts are your personas right yeah that's that's actually what I have in mind I have in mind not just cows but young people the future uh future is in them and they we talk about building trust with The Regulators we talk about these challenges um but the future Regulators will be the young people of today and those those people are not far into these Technologies and things um for them this is all more natural more open they're more open-minded there's less foreign less foreign for them but what we need to do uh to to reach that uh one next billion I think we need to work um work with the young people thinking of the long-term future work in the presence work now with The Regulators work with the all the stakeholders right now and the people in the room but also think of the future and work with the young young Generations uh that will be the future regulator future users future and you know mobilizing mobilizing more showing to the world that um blockchain is not only about crypto that is about doing good that is technology for good and showing them what I felt here when I came first day that this is really about everybody is in the mission of doing something good and solving some some real life problems so if we could build a trust by showing um to everyone more you know becoming from a niche from a niche group as you said that that growth becoming a mainstream and the path is to build the trust and and make make ourselves more open and I believe that the web tree and blockchain ecosystem in general has a lot to learn about these clouds the scouts kind of organically or naturally organized in different nodes right let's say it's a very interesting approach to to see things so I I became an auditorium fellow during a hard years this is the first time I met well the next building team in person uh but even though we we didn't have the time to share in person a term Foundation helped me a lot because I worked with public institutions because I want to to teach public servants and also serve technology and also bring them into web trade Technologies and kind of get into your government portal and instead of creating a digital profile just connect your wallet so that kind of approach for us was let's jump into the web tree and let's bring institutions into the equator that was my approach to applying into a term foundation and to become a fellow and to try to learn how the theorem Foundation can help us and how we can also help the therm ecosystem when you think of that when you think of how you applied to become a your own fellow what's the problem you were describing with this person as what's what's that thing that personally moves you to be tackling or addressing or trying to gather these next billion people Joffrey do you wanna yeah sure um I think the the big gap with um working in Regulators is that they and policy makers is that they don't you know going back is like the problem statement I had was that they don't understand the culture they don't understand the technology you ask a regulator have they use a metamask um none of them would have done it I just want to check you know in the audience is there any Regulators or policy makers in this audience here raise your hand if anyone okay so so I think that's uh they clearly need to go for them right yeah you can't understand the culture without being here without feeling it and interacting with the community and the approach that we are taking uh is to get Regulators to experiment with the technology uh so in Kazakhstan for example we are working with the government uh on two different projects uh one is around uh provision of public services so they have a national I.T Park they have a bunch of Education uh activities around it and they say Hey you know if we transform this into a Dao a decentralized autonomous organization uh what does it look how will people use the technology uh you know will people need to how do they open up wallets how do they use those wallets to interact with each other these are things that are very very new to most people in the world and they want to experiment and try and see to understand exactly what it is that they're dealing with here um the other thing is that they are introducing a national crypto Fiat rail by mandate but then as they start doing it they say oh you know we have all the stakeholders with all these different issues you know how do we think about it you know what's happening out there um and I think learning by doing is just so critical uh in trying to understand the web tree space from a policy maker perspective interesting and there's a new customer is there any like personal motivation that you feel that it's moving you uh to to to tackle the problem that you're referring I love how you introduce yourself and it's I am Mary I'm working on how to do what will happen to you when you die so it's really good but is is there anything that is actually moving you towards there uh is there anything you want to share on how you apply to their information how you describe this problem and what moves you to be kind of pulling these next billion people towards the ecosystem well I think that without getting all deathy when people die transferring assets from the individual to their estate is extremely complicated it it involves not only inheritance laws state law but contract law Privacy Law and and it isn't as simple as just handing over the asset and the laws are very old and they're complicated and they're different jurisdictions have different laws and in some jurisdictions multiple laws apply and I thought that the way to approach the problem of what happens to your youth when you die is to at first build a database of all of the laws that apply across the world to transfer of assets on death and then to look for patterns in those laws and then to sort of compile that as a list of requirements and then approach the community and say these are the legal problems that we have with asset transfer on death how do we use our technology to solve them and that that was the sort of driver that that got me going and realizing that if we disrupt what I call disrupt from within if we look at how it works now and look at what needs to be reformed and changed and how technology can replace things like Wills need a wedding signature that's crazy they need to be on paper that's crazy I mean we have technology that can do that without either of those requirements but unless we know whether those unless we understand the law enough to know that that solution will work I think we risk have it flying in the face of disruption right and and being opposed by the powers that regulate that sort of thing rather than being accepted by them interesting um and it's just made me think that when we die and when we have money in a regular Bank like Fiat like for example in Mexico you have no will and no one claims it the bank just used his money yeah that's the way it goes uh but but here when we're thinking about uh Eid for example it's bad for you and it's bad for the ecosystem because it got luck so the problem gets bigger and bigger right and that's a problem it's a problem for an individual it's also a problem for our ecosystem if if uh digital assets are frozen or I mean think of a I think of a service provider that has you know Frozen Ethan on his books how do they handle that I don't know so yeah it is and also the going back to my trust point if they if we can't be to transfer assets the way other assets transferred are people going to trust eth itself or digital assets registered on blockchain with smart contracts so it is it's a it's a multiple layer problem very interesting yeah very interesting problem so uh going to Yumi Halo are you thinking of an actual problem or an opportunity that that is personally moving you to to kind of persuade these 58 million people you said yeah 58 million people to come in uh so what what are you thinking what are your thoughts behind that so as a scouting is in as a scout as myself and scouting is in a mission of creating better world we do that by creating better citizens for the future we do that by providing them non-formal education opportunities so bringing this other education that nobody talked about so much or is not but it's actually bigger and in some cases also more relevant especially in today's uh times where education is evolving so education education education so it's really really about that so personally I am um I'm on that mission looking into how we educate more young people to do to use this how we get more and more users um and how we with that spark their um curiosity and there so it's not that we are giving and this is how you do it so you go and be doer but hey this is how you do how you do it but you can think of other solution another way to build something on this and feel free and how do we Nutrish that Community within community so my my goal would be to create one of the things I would do in the project is to create a community within scouting that works on the blockchain the scouts who are interested about battery web 3 0 and blockchain and and support their work basically not not direct them not guide them but just support their initiatives and I'm thinking to do that like a tao Community as well also within the scouting yeah so um yeah I believe that's that's the answer for this I think it's very interesting I can think about multiple things from from digital identity and I remember uh Danny Ryan sharing on the opening that the probably the next steps for for the therm ecosystem are not going to be Financial but perhaps tapping into the potential of identities and and I can see an opportunity here in Dallas um yep just one thought uh about the debt that you mentioned and that is your remind element a very important problem that we look into solving are it's a big challenge of today of course is the child abuse abuse of any kind not a child but anyone adult young people anywhere any abuse any any form of abuse I am very interested to figure out how technology can help us in that so and I believe there is a way can help us it's it's about yeah I mean partial Union education but partially also about figuring out the system and mechanisms for um creating a safe environments for everyone I think that's also something I'm very like motivated and driven to so that would be one of the important initiatives within scouting very interesting and I can see uh the kind of the the hard part of the motivation behind so and that's that's what we need to get the next billion to be like Purpose Driven and persist uh and that's going to be that's going to be it so before I jump into opening questions and opening the floor for for the audience to to tap into different things on around your what you have been sharing I would love you to share where are you going or how do you think the ethereum ecosystem can help you to reach this next billion uh do you have any any challenges in mind do you where do you see yourself in six months from now into reaching this next billion Jeffrey you want to go yes I think one of the issues um you know where I see this decentralized system meeting centralized system uh kind of bumping up against quite frequently um I think it's in the crypto Fiat rails and I do believe that that's still very much the call through which most new users uh in the world will start to get access to this ecosystem uh and I think it's something that there needs to be uh ways to kind of facilitate that and make that a more seamless transition and in many parts of the world it's getting a lot more restrictive you know I go to my bank and I say my company is dealing a lot with crypto uh you know the bank says oh high-risk customer forget it I'm going to shut down your bank account uh so I think that's one area uh you know I love to talk to people you know if they have to have to deal with these issues especially from a kind of compliance I love to engage with people to to learn about you know kind of the conversations they're having uh in a confidential Manner and and you know what best uh what can best be done to persuade Regulators that there isn't the kind of risk that they imagine exists in this ecosystem uh the other part I'm super excited about actually is um gaming I'm a gamer um and I believe that actually in Southeast Asia where I live I'm currently in Vietnam um I think games is a very very great way to introduce a lot of people that don't have um experience kind of uh with this ecosystem and get them into it uh even the dial that we're working at the national iot park in Kazakhstan it actually came out from an original thinking where they're trying to say how do I gamify the experience and involvement of my community uh with the infrastructure that we have and now it's extended into the web tree space so I think you know that's another area I'm just super excited about I would love to talk to people who know the web 3 gaming space uh better than I do awesome awesome Murray where do you see or what's the obstacle what's the challenges that we are seeing up front in the next six months for your project and for reaching this next billion well I think in six months we'll have a database of all the law that applies to the transfer of digital assets when you die um I'm gonna need it it'll be no I want it to be an open source database so I'm going to need some sort of a platform to record it and make it accessible to people and then the next step is to create the list of legal requirements for what needs to happen in different jurisdictions and then what I'm hoping is that the community will be able to look at those and say okay we've got the technology to do this and this we can solve this problem with a technical solution and that that that's the sort of vision for the next phase of my project okay interesting what about what about you may look do you do you see any any challenges there I mean I can take a picture some of them but what are you what do you see you like your next steps can you share with the audience you're going sure thank you so we'll start with the smaller bytes of course and the things that would be easy and will actually be a um something that comes will be very motivated and easy going to to accept is there will of course start creating or putting the the Scout badges into the and as turning them into the nft badges and putting them in a via Pope and other technologies will put them into into the wallet so we'll have Scout wallet with Scout badges and so that will help Scouts bring on Scouts on like on the basics on a you know first level understanding having you know what's the hash what's the private key what's the um what's the nft what's the what's the wallet and then we go into deeper we go into like again having these champions in in um in inside of the community looking into how um what projects we could get into into what projects we could do what are the most relevant ones I heard so many good ideas since I came here about what we can do in scouting for example I you mentioned we are decentralized yes we have local Scout groups everywhere in this neighborhood also there is a scout group actually um and they are in they they need some support in like creating a simple a treasury um a treasury mechanism with a blockchain or um you know they also like scouting is voluntary LED meaning that people are voted for and elected to lead and and then to you know represent um then in the other circles so using Dao there and things like that so I what I'm looking forward from this community is like ideas and openness maybe to suggest some things and help us actually do this thing some we are non-profit and yeah we're looking forward for anyone who want to partner uh on a doing good basis and and do something great together solve some big problems awesome awesome I remember when I was a kid I was I used to be a scout um and I remember having different beans because of the different accomplishments or Milestones so now we are going to have pull-ups maybe right exactly um so there's 25 more minutes here and I believe that this is a good amount of time for opening uh to to the floor like anyone in the audience wants to to pick the brains of these fellows and how they are planning to reach the next billion users one second hello great to meet you all fantastic work you're doing um one of the things some of the things I heard is the use cases that you are all approaching are kind of existing use cases payments smart contracts maybe DIY or credentialing at least for Scouts um and so what it sounds like is like we've done well for these first billion with this use case let's push that to another billion um Jeffrey you mentioned gaming are there other use cases that you see as you look at different sort of populations or is it a matter of we've got some good use cases we just need to reach more people I'm just curious about your thoughts on a macro level on that stuff yeah um so I think the so for me the way I look at this is that when I think of the next billion um uh it's that I think different countries interact and learn about crypto in in very different ways right so going back to the Kazakhstan uh example it was quite interesting because what happened in Kazakhstan was that China banned Mining and all the miners fled to Kazakhstan and then they were like at first they panic because you know they consume a lot of electricity Kazakhstan 1.0 number one or number two hash rate in the world and the government panic and they they overreacted and they kind of clamped down on it and then after that they said hey this is actually a very interesting industry you know we need to do more or more about it more in it and then they started inviting uh exchanges back into Kazakhstan you know binance set up there a bunch of other exchanges went in there and and got established um so I I think it's the way I look at it is too that um we need new applications that provide benefit to people on a day-to-day basis um but I think that the pool of people that we have not touched uh is still very very huge because you go in there and they they are at the beginning of learning about this uh most of them would still not have a metamask wallet um 25 of population owns digital assets um but you know there is a lens and a process in which some of these countries learn about crypto and I think it's still a very very early stage in terms of the 75 or 80 of each of these countries that you know crypto has not touched it so to build on that and about the use cases and this is more tapping into my experience uh from the previous year being an ethereum fellow working with the public sector typically they don't there's no one wanting to be the Pioneer Pioneer they want to be the second Pioneer the third Pioneer but not the first one right uh so so winning these small battles having these different use cases is always super relevant it's kind of a divide and concur approach it's more on the on the mindset of them uh we start for example with uh just verifiable credentials for commercial permits that was a very simple thing and then at some point we started certifying City inspectors and policemen so that you were able to actually scan and see if that was an actual policeman doing their job and then we started into construction permits and then we are now thinking about legislation uh there's actually a congresswoman here doing that thing she's using her WhatsApp right now but now she's she's helping with the legislation right now but because of the use cases so after we moved with around 50 different implementations different flavors just as the ones I've done I just met mentioned we were able to start thinking about law initiatives and after law initiatives you can start thinking about how regulation can foster Innovation not block Innovation and then after that we started stitching the ecosystem and saying hey can we have standards can we share the same thing when we talk about Identity or public sector credentials or or a sense of ownership of your digital assets and then we are now integrating even with more web 3 services so everything departed from the use cases and that this was just to highlight the relevance of your questions so thank you Jeffrey do you want to add on that actually just want to add a quick point I think because you you raise something very interesting in terms of how regulators think about this technology um I think one of the part I one of my biggest fear is that uh there is different use cases for webtree in different countries right if I'm a small country I might think differently if I'm a big country I want to regulate a different way because I have different interests at stake and what I see in this space is because most of them do not understand the technology and don't have access to the expertise they will just copy the US most of the time and the U.S chooses to regulate web Tree in a way because they have particular policy interest that doesn't isn't the same shed interest as all those different countries so definitely there's there's this Noble effect here you have the more problems you find the more business and impact opportunities you find right as well so any other question anyone wants to jump in hi so uh I was thinking is there any way that uh um the ethereum foundation is documenting this kind of like growth building blocks on how um like every single one of you have a different approach on how we can reach that next billion so is there any kind of like documentation on how that like the growth building blocks are starting to merge with the patterns that you're discovering do you have any plans of sharing any of that kind of documentation do you have any plan to kind of be limited no it's a good question I mean we have plans to look into understand a little bit of what where what's the the stage zero where we are at the moment and then to measure throughout the step the the time of this projects what's the impact made and and what's the like what has changed from the zero so for example for my project I'll be looking into where we are and scouting and there's I'll be identifying some use cases and we'll be identifying if someone is already working on it on the national local levels of identifying you know the interest in that sense and then on the end I would also measure a little bit how that increased for example uh over hopefully over the six months I I think um you know this is a experiment in itself right I think we are figuring out uh ourselves how do we best achieve the impact that we want but I think the point you raised about sharing I think is really really crucial because what I noticed with policy makers is that or even Banks right so we're trying to say hey Banks police Bank people with crypto and their first response is that oh it's very very high risk can you point out to other people that are doing it so that we can have a sense that what we're doing is kosher and and I think that sharing is just so important right when it comes to policy process because honestly most policy makers and Regulators are conservative they don't want to stick their neck out and they'll rather say okay you know who else has done it and then I can go back and explain to my stakeholders that I'm not trying to be too crazy here remember you were saying about uh building this database or repository of the different flavors of regulations that we have uh so are you planning to to open source to show it somehow what are your plans on that yeah absolutely because I think that it will help companies when they're putting together projects and they write their terms and conditions like today I think the only thing you can put in is that there is a risk that when you if you die holding this account you will lose everything that's in it and I think once we get a little bit more knowledge about the different laws it may end up being that we have three or four different variations based on where you're resident in the world because you know not only were your resident where the asset is resident and where the person dies that those things all Impact how Property Transfers so yeah it the plan is definitely to make this open source and ultimately to create a standard of how whatever our solution is so that it's you it I have a vision in my head of it being something like an nft standard where there's there's one way of it's done and it works for all all concerned it would be interesting and an interesting documentation challenge to think of six months and having your documentation documentation for web 3 wheel kind of thing right it will be very interesting but that's the long-term Vision yes yeah definitely that'll take a while because we have to go through law reform before we get there final problem yeah on a very bright practical note on that um me being a fellow from the previous cohort what we built was a different notion sites so everything is open uh there's even a blog post at ethereum.org and you can go to the blog and you can see you can actually go to my Twitter and you'll you'll see the pen and tweet there so we try to blog we try to say videos and we and particularly notion work well as a tool to sharing different information so that may that may answer your question in a very practical approach so anyone else yes please can hey Hassan from Brazil so thank you for like brainstorming for the adapting the next billion one thing I believe we're all working here a lot for an incremental change how we incrementally improve something we have between our hands um like we were working on the hackathon like a couple of days ago and there is one thing for instance the address the wallet address which is the very very very basic something for anybody coming to ethereum or any crypto do you have to set up a wallet address for him the wallet address by itself whatever in ethereum which is hexadecimal or in Bitcoin it use a Latin actor which is already exclusive there is 20 30 percent of population they can't recognize the Latin character you know like there is there is the ones they recognize the Latin character and hexadecimal for them is like extremely weird but there is the ones they don't even recognize it and that's already 1.5 billion of population we have today so we work it we actually won the prize on this part the re like presenting the wallet address on shape like instead of having it hexadecimal I can let the numbers one to ten ABCD FD we having it hard Square which is shapes and colors something kids could recognize and my grandma can there is some stuff like very basic I would say it's just like instead of us working incrementally to improve something exist maybe we try to think about it again scratch from zero it's like how if this if I don't have anything how I would Express this how I would do this if I don't have anything already exist I just want to share this and I appreciate really your work on the incremental and I know as like as anybody working in a domain Focus head you have to increment but yeah how do you feel about like scratching something just like let's throw this all away and scratch some some some brainstorm from zero yeah thank you thank you thank you for your question I'll try to reframe it a little bit coming from the use cases and documentation approach so this is from how kind of scaling question and and particularly addressing the language barrier uh as a Brazilian there's always this thing that we have with like hey do we have the Latin American Gathering and everyone is speaking in Spanish and it feels weird right uh so I've lived University for a couple of years and and I know uh where this comes from in a sense of language uh and how it kind of becomes an extra challenge for us also uh talking about blockchain Cadena de blockes doesn't sound that sexy you do one blockchain right so this kind of small steps that are on the language kind of barriers for scaling do you have anything to share like do you have a thought of any strategies can you can you share anything I would love to share a little bit of that because I feel touched on a very important issue about really how how can it be more inclusive the ecosystem and I feel one part of kind of is a huge long gripe of minus how the ux itself is can be exclusive an example is that you know I live in many places where the GDP per capita is under two three thousand dollars uh so it's not very very rich places and when you make a mistake with your wallet on gas fees or anything it's very expensive you know me losing three bucks if I'm in the US because I made a mistake on my transaction it's not a big problem me working with someone in Vietnam uh who loses like three bucks or ten bucks because they made some mistake on the transaction that's a huge amount of money uh and and I think there needs to be ways to make the ux more inclusive um I think what you're suggesting might be One Direction but just I think there's many many of these little things that can be done to make it just a much more inclusive ecosystem yeah I would like to add on this inclusivity is very important it's a very good topic and very good ideas out there don't think we should think of anything that we have so far and now as a set in stone as a founding founding things that we should never touch uh that will put us in a very wrong step we need to be criticizing and everything which have a critical thinking over everything uh maybe it worked but it at some point but it didn't thought of everything inclusively now when we have this mind when we have this conscious of that we were not inclusive we should go back and be criticizing on any of the solutions that we have um that are not inclusive so I think that's very important to like be be open-minded to this and and just like challenge everything that we have if it's if it's not inclusive enough nothing is Secret in a way secret than safe uh in insane in that sense not to be touched so man well I'm getting a little bit ahead of my project but I suspect that once we've gathered all the data we're going to be jumping from in most places paper documents to some other form of solution so yeah I think there is a possibility to rewrite the whole how the process is done as long as we work within the legal framework to do that so yeah coming back to to the original approach about language our white paper was written in Spanish the Spanish first and it has been a quite challenged because most of the people want to read it in English but we want to reach most people Spanish speaking so it is like no no it was reading for you but no no but I want to read your white paper in English no no but it was written first but so so yeah I I feel that challenge a lot so we have 10 more minutes and I would love for them to have also some kind of a closing remarks so maybe we have a room for one or two questions so there's one person over there please hi I'm Maggie thank you so much for sharing and uh talking on this panel so my question is actually about building trust so um how do you actually build trust within the audiences that you serve because I think ethereum for the next billion is a really big topic that all of us are looking to work towards but I think like on the other side for people that don't know about ethereum or people that are end users um what are some of the challenges for building trust Within These communities and what are some of the things that you're doing already to do that I love that question particularly because from the different audiences that you're addressing these next billion people the first care when they think about Bitcoin they feel bouncy schemes they feel scams they feel all these things that we were discussing before so please jump and and can we have our 20 minutes please sure if I if I may just like I think we just need to be stay more open and show what the good things are we doing and what we want to to do with like there is that it's not about making a personal gain and it's not about ethereum it's not about that it's so much about solving the real real real problems I guarantee you people who are not in this room or not in the ethereum committee have no clue about that and just finding ways how do we bring that so bring them on talk to your friends Advocate bring them together you know organize talks and and disclose all of these talk about you know instead of them asking you so what about this is about cryptocurrencies you can make no no no let me explain you what this is this about actually and what is what it does so like go into that I think going into this um being more open and being you know like taking off the hoodie and showing that we are we are human and we are people and and we want to you know be open not just like a close little uh room that you can't access actually unless you are part of the community I think we were just chatting before this session about expectations pre-devcon and in Devcon um and I remember you said like oh you know I taught people be lining up outside with the Ferraris and the conversation all about Lambo Lambo Lambo um and I think it's a very different vibe we actually got coming down here and I think uh you know one thing I feel is like regulators and policy makers that is their impression of the community uh and if they if more of them come to this event I think they would understand it a lot better and I think that's something that uh you know has to be done uh to build that trust where they actually see hear and interact uh with the community to understand the values of this community and I think to add to that I think our our style of communication I think we need to remember that our audience doesn't come with the backgrounds that we have and that we if we can I like to I like to bridge things so it's like something you're doing already but it's a little bit different so that they're not completely intimidated by what it is we're doing um and then to perhaps touch it slightly controversial nerve we were talking about this earlier I think we need to self-regulate I think that when we have incidents in the community that are not good we need to be seen to be disapproving of those incidents because if you look at what mainstream media tends to cover it's things like hacks or exploits of some sort and that doesn't make us look good yeah there is a lot of to build on self-regulating these communities as Geoffrey was asking when she said like is there any regulator here no one raised a hand so there's this means that there's people making rules for how we should operate or build and determaker system that they are not in this room that they are not feeling this Vibe so it is our responsibility to bring them here and also for us to visit them and to share and to grab these next billion uh is there any other question sorry just that to be open-minded with that you know to understand like where they're coming from and what their pain problem points are problems are and how do we navigate through that instead of being angry on them you know we have a tendency when we hear from them like we will forbid this is not going to work and it's never you're like no you're stupid no you should just turn this different like different really be what we are a good people open our mind and open heart like with the with a clean heart so come into that talks with a clean you know open-mindness and and and you know good intentions and also good like good good heart you know this this is also why I love the traffic principle graphic design principles on web3 if I jump with this shirt into any political party they don't know who I'm rooting for so I'm as inclusive as possible right so this is kind of the message to bring the next billion to to show every single color and bring them uh any other question well there's probably one minute one minute and a half I would love for you to share any closing remarks hopefully optimistic on how the ethereum ecosystem can positively impact the life of the next billion and how people can reach you yeah sure I can do uh I can start I think we just need to stay humble but then on the other hand uh be more open help help others look for you know one week once we saw one problem look for another problem we can solve there are so many problems in this world but uh and and maybe we cannot solve them all but we can solve a lot so um that's a big task to do and if we are oriented always to that to look into how we solve some of the real real problems then um then we will stay on a good path and it will be recognized better it will be be more and more seen as someone who's uh who is part of the solution rather the part of the problem and we need to prove that no we're not doing that not only to prove that as we know we've done that for for a good reasons for the good cause but just staying with this good cause always and this value system uh would be very important I think um I think closing death and the transfer of acids is a is a challenging expensive complicated problem and I think once we get a baseline of what rules apply to it I know that the ethereum community has create a solution and I'm counting on the development teams in the in the room to help with this because we will be we will be sparing people heartache and we're sparing them cost and complication and for a lot of folks it's a legal process and they don't have access to lawyers and if we can make it something that is done automatically and driven by the holder of the asset I think we can improve people's lives you know I think the one word that really stands out for me um is inclusiveness um and I think the way I see it is that you know we should be thinking about who should be a part of this conversation but it's not a current part of the conversation uh so I think for me you know my thought is that I'm gonna have a bring bring a policy maker bring a regulator to an event uh mindset I think the future where you know if they are not you know they are dealing with these issues but they are not part of this conversation part of this community or part of the the environment here uh it's it's something a burden that I should take to make sure that you know they are able to come here and participate in all of these things so thank you very much I just want to close with sharing experience an experience that I had a couple of years ago pre-pandemic um I was in a global government Summit um actually was an open government partnership Summit in Ottawa in Canada uh and to my surprise I was I was feeling like the only Technologies there and to my surprise one of the first conversations at in this stage was Tim berners-lee so he was sharing all his thoughts on how he envisioned the internet and how he's thinking the web tree will look like or the next internet or the next web uh and when he stepped down of the of the scenario say like hey you know probably probably you and me are the only Technologies here like what brought you here do you actually think that the web tree or the next internet is going to be better and he said just like the internet the web tree is like a sidewalk there's going to be good people and bad people walking through it so that's a message you should wealth bring the next billion for positively impacting the lives of the menu thank you [Applause] how are you feeling yeah we did well of course of course [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign community and specifically on building a thriving developer Community today we'll be hearing from Sam flamini Sam is a self-taught developer who works on the developer experience at superfluid please join me in welcoming Sam better oh there we go wonderful all right so today's talk is going to be on building a thriving developer community so I'm Sam uh you know a little bit about me from the intro there but I'll get into who I am in a couple minutes but first before we get into like actual content here I want to paint a scenario right let's say that you're building a really cool protocol or piece of technology right you're you're targeting developers you're building this platform right and you just sponsored a hackathon because you've heard hackathons are a great way to engage developers right you've paid 10K in travel expenses and sponsorship expenses you've told everyone how excited you are for hackers to build things you've never even seen before and you've told your team to be ready because this weekend is going to be intense right it's gonna be lots of questions lots of Developers then you show up and nothing happens right the hackathon Flop is a real thing right I've seen these talk to people in the community that have had this happen to them uh let's say you get three submissions two of them are figma files uh that don't really actually use your Tech they're just mock-ups and your docs get ripped to shreds by the people that you do engage with and they tell you that they're not usable it was all very confusing and it's just bottom like the bottom line is it just didn't go very well right and the key lesson here I think to take away is that it's not enough to build awesome tools right you need people to know about them right and you need to make using them a great experience so who am I I help lead developer experience it's super fluid uh superfood's a protocol that enables real-time finance and money streaming right if you're curious about super fluid check us out at superfood.finance there's lots of good stuff there uh I'm a reformed SAS salesperson so I used to sling B2B software and I taught myself to code I got really into the technical side of that business I fell down the the crypto rabbit hole and uh here I am so at superfluid I also host the devs do something podcast which is a technical podcast for engineers in web3 and at superfluid we've had over 300 projects built on superfluid in the last 12 months or so if you go back further it's more like five or six hundred um we have teams building on superfood that have raised eight figures in grant money slash Venture money and you know it it looks like your community is doing well right obviously we have a long way to go you know in our eyes but I've learned a lot in the devrel trenches right I've been to a lot of hackathons I've talked a lot of engineers in the space and I'm still learning but I know the feeling of sponsoring a hackathon and just not getting the results you wanted I know the feeling of having your docs torn to shreds by developers who get frustrated right if you're in the audience here and you've done a hackathon and you've just started exploring uh some different Technologies in the space there's no doubt you've probably been frustrated by documentation at some point in your journey right and what's nice for me is that superfluid is a cool protocol right it does cool stuff like this money streaming thing so it makes my my job easier but I've still had to learn a lot and we've had to learn a lot of superfluid so today I will share some of those lessons so if if we zoom out a little bit right I think it's worth asking why we even build developer communities in the first place like why are these things useful to us and the key the key thing here is that if your Tech matters to people you win right that's like the simple way of putting it right so but what does actual success look like like what what does succeeding with the developer Community really mean like what's the output right and I I like to Define it as really two things right that will actually move the needle for you economically and the first thing is an ecosystem of new and successful applications built on top of your Tech and the second thing is Integrations between your technology or your protocol and existing Solutions and applications today right so a good web 2 example is twilio they've enabled new applications like uber and Lyft and Airbnb and they've also integrated with a lot of existing applications obviously right everything that uses SMS push notifications those kinds of things it's probably using twilio or something like twilio in the on the back end and the obvious web 3 example is ethereum right so uh unit swap maker ens all the existence of those apps makes the ethereum ecosystem more valuable right it makes ether more valuable actually and the on the other on the other hand the integration bit for ethereum is is to help if I mean I think some people have this Vision release but it's to help ethereum become a kind of global sediment layer for international finance and some of the other non-financial use cases might be examples of those Integrations so if those are our outputs right if if that's what we want when we create a developer ecosystem and that's that's what we're looking to do the discipline that creates this is developer relations right so you'll see a lot of devrel people run around like myself we tweet a lot we make lots of videos uh and it really has become a kind of very important discipline in web3 right and what I like to do is break devrel out into the dev and the real side right so on the developer side this is your libraries your apis your docs your tooling even your smart contracts if your protocol it looks a lot like engineering and a key thing that I think most teams get wrong is that they don't realize you need to product manage your developer products like you PM any other product right the other half of devrel is the relation side this is a very loud thing you guys all probably see right this is your tutorials your videos your meetups your podcasts all this stuff right it looks a lot like marketing but it cannot feel like marketing right and we'll get into why that is in a second but you know for those of you that are technical it's probably obvious um the key thing to keep in mind as a devrel person or as someone who's building out a devrel function is that great developer experience teams have both right you need like I said a couple slides ago you need to have great tools that are really easy to use and you need people to know about them both are important so how about the dev and devrel right how do we at superfood approach this well I think the biggest thing that I've learned is you have to PM these products right you have to treat them like any other product and run the same kind of process right that most valuable product for a developer relations team is your docs right that's number one number two in order to make good docs and other good developer tooling you have to understand your developer personas you have to really get into the minds of the people that are going to come to your site and be using your stuff and make things for them and the third thing that's a little more in the Weeds on how to build individual good Dev tools and sdks is to be mindful of your abstractions right so on on the side of docs right there's this quote that Elon has on Tesla autopilot that they they view a Tesla all input is user error right so a loose analogy for your docs is to view all developer questions and every piece for confusion as a failure of your Docs right obviously you're still going to get questions about how good your docs are and I hope that's evident if no one's asking questions that's probably a bad sign but it's a useful mindset right and the reason why it's a useful mindset is that it points you in the direction of higher leverage activities so when I first started at superfluid doing devrel stuff I would spend a lot of time answering questions I was like building my self-esteemer on how good I was at this job by like how fast I was at answering questions and how many questions I answered and all this stuff right and that that really wasn't the right mindset to take right because all the question answering although it's useful right if you ask a question someone's Discord and they don't answer you you're going to feel like you know they don't care about you right so we still do value answering questions doing it quickly but the higher leverage thing is to find patterns and spend time in your docs making sure that people ideally don't even have to ask you right and if and if they do ask and you do have to give an answer ideally you should send them a link to the answer and more information right I've seen uh so Patrick Collins you guys might you guys might know who Patrick Collins is he's a great developer experience person in the chain link ecosystem that I've I've learned a lot from him uh what he actually does is if someone asks a question to him in their Discord he will like answer the question he will create the question on stack Overflow answer the question on stack Overflow and then send a link to stack Overflow in a Discord and the reason why that's so smart is that every question you answer in Discord just stays there right Discord like it's it's really hard to like go research like go search in the Discord search bar and find useful answers to questions it really is difficult to do so what Patrick is doing is he is adding more leverage to his activities right he's answering a question but creating a paper trail back to stack Overflow so ideally he doesn't have to be there and answer those questions every time right docs work for you while you while you sleep answering questions like you can't do that in your sleep unless you're you have some kind of powers that I don't know about um so okay with that being said how do you maximize the utility of all your docs and developer tooling right how do you how do you think about this well you you need to start by identifying developer personas right so a case study on this would be with superfluid uh and I'll walk you through what we've done right we have a few different ways of doing this but the two main ways are assessing by skill level right so you have your beginners you have your intermediate and you have your gigabytes right and we also segment by the role or intent right so come to hackathons right they're just hackathon devs or Indie devs company just hack and have fun uh you also have developers at integration Partners right people that might go Champion to their boss that uh they you know their company should do superfood in the next product and you also have like especially if you're a developer ecosystem that wants full-blown applications and companies to be built on top of your stack you might have future Founders or entrepreneurs looking at your stuff and you need to cater to them as well because those would be some of the most high value people you can interact with so in our case for the beginner slash hackathon devs right I'll Loop them together because there's a little bit of overlap here but for our docs we have a nice quick start page where it's like go here get what you need get out it's quick for tooling we have a simple JavaScript SDK to interact with our smart contracts we also have very simple solidity libraries I want to build smart contracts with super fluid and then our tutorials and examples we have a Zero to Hero series and we have very easy like dead simple beginner examples on the front end and react okay so that's that's like the beginner segment for intermediate devs we have our reference docs right if you're an intermediate Dev you know what you're doing you're you're happy to just go literally like look into the reference docs and find the functions you need we also have advanced guides for some of the more advanced features of superfluid and the more powerful things you can do all sorted by topic and we also have in the tooling section that JavaScript SDK also has typings so that you can use the SDK with first class typescript support right on top of that we have a developer console which is helpful for like getting data from the subgraph and in terms of tutorials and examples we have more fully fledged example applications that can take you end to end building a more full product right you can see test Suites all the stuff you need to actually build some kind of integration between superfluid and what you're working on and then projection real devs we have a library of ideas we'd love to see built right we try to seed the community with ideas uh so the entrepreneurial types can find something to actually try to build uh we have this super fluid reactor program which is like a mini accelerator that we run to help people go from idea stage or like good proof of concept to actually raising money or getting a grant and then in terms of tutorials and examples we have a lot of Primitives right which you can think of them as like building blocks they can use within applications build on top of them and then ideally ship an end user product or or thing that can actually become a business right some other considerations right when it comes to developer tooling right one one thing I like to think about is being mindful of how many abstractions you're putting into your sdks and tooling right if you have too little abstractions you know you might be asking developers to come to your your code base your docs and figure too many things out right you might lose beginners however if you try to to Shield the developer from the the tricky stuff too much you lose the more advanced Engineers that would be comfortable dealing with the bare metal and you even stifle innovation in the process as well because you're not going to allow access to things that some really intelligent developer can make use of and then finally something we actually haven't done a pretty good job of it super fluid is that naming really matters right uh protocol Engineers sometimes like to throw really uh crazy names in their contracts that don't make a whole lot of sense uh so you should think about this uh you should think about this for your team all right so moving on to some of the more relations side of things right this is one thing leading into this I think is important to keep in mind and it's that most Developers are not good at explaining their product to newcomers so why is that I think the reason is that most engineering types who are really really good at shipping code and really really good at building new features sometimes we're blind to how much context they have right uh in order to really explain something to someone new at a hackathon or even an event like this you have to be able to go back to First principles and explain things from the ground up right and people that become really good devrel people people that actually become founders of of protocols and things they have to get really good at this right because you might have to explain the same thing over and over again and honestly I actually respect it like Engineers are often working on pretty cutting-edge stuff you don't always want to go back to zero you want to you want to push the boundaries and build something new but it's worth keeping this in mind right and when it comes to the relations side of what you do in all your tutorials and all your examples and all your content you have to keep that in mind right don't assume too much context from new people coming to your your stuff moving further into the devrel stuff one thing that you have to keep in mind that many of you probably already know is that you can't Market to developers right you need to Peak curiosity instead right so we're going to go through what I've seen doesn't really work when it comes to marketing developers what I've seen does work and then you know we might talk a little bit more about being mindful of extreme context but I wanted to lead with that because I think it was so important to hit you guys with that up front so what doesn't work when marketing to Developers well anything that feels like a traditional demo or sales piece of marketing collateral uh does not work right Engineers can see it from a mile away it will immediately turn them off and even if you're giving them something really useful they're not going to pay attention right and this kind of is looped in with anything that's feeling right so there's the the Supreme Court Justice quote about you know there's like a case on on pornography and somebody asked the judge like well how do you know what porn is and he said I don't know but I can I know it when I see it right it's the same thing with shielding right you know when you see it uh so be careful of that the other thing that I think is actually underappreciated is that you can really lose credibility with people if you try to mangle every use case into using your your technology right so if some engineer comes up to me to hackathon and says hey Sam you know I've got this thing you know it does XYZ should I should I use super fluid to integrate with that right and if they tell me that XYZ is something that really makes no sense to integrate super fluid with and I try to sell them on why super fluid is a good thing to connect to their to their their project if they don't recognize it right away they're gonna figure it out when they when they start going through a docs in our code base and we you just lose credibility with people right so one of the most persuasive things you can do in my opinion is actually to be really upfront about when your technology doesn't make sense right interestingly people will come back to you and find some reason to use your technology in a more interesting way if you're honest with them right you just you cannot be dishonest especially to Engineers Engineers here you have some of the greatest BS filters in the world right you should be proud of that uh but devrel people need to keep that in mind it's very very important so how about what does work well I I mean I think that focusing on education is really the right move right and not just education around what you do but general education right even if it's just adjacent to what you're doing right so one example is this new chain Dev YouTube channel that the chain link Community put out and another is a podcast we we launched a superfluid called devs do something so Shane Dev they just do very general stuff like Patrick Collins does it he does very general uh just web 3 tutorials and that builds a lot of credibility with with the chain link ecosystem and you know I think people know who Patrick is and they want to they want to go build on chain link because they know he's helped them a lot and he literally is always wearing the Chain Link T-Shirt right that's that's a good thing and then on our end with super fluid we launched this podcast called devs do something that is designed to just be purely helpful for engineers in the space we've had on just a lot of really good technical minds and we we don't really talk about streaming money or superfood stuff that much at all right all we do is we just talk through like what they what they're working on we go to their favorite design patterns and examples and it's worked right people like it so that those kinds of things will you know your community will accrue value as a result of these kinds of things you do another thing that works when it comes to being more specific to your your stack and your protocol is creating really interesting examples and proof of Concepts right so this might be obvious but one one thing to keep in mind is you know we're all playing a long game here I hope hopefully right but the problem is that there are so many things that become hot and capture the attention of every engineer in the space and they always want to work on them now right so the Cycles go so fast right one at one moment it's nfts at another moment it's defy right now we're hitting the stage of like zero knowledge stuff is like the the sexy thing and yeah rightfully so I hope people build good zero knowledge stuff but what you can do is stay up to date with all this new stuff right stay up to date with all the new features in Foundry stay up to date with all the new ZK stuff and if you can create some kind of interesting integration between this these new technologies that are hot and what you're working on you can stay in the conversation right they don't have to be perfect Solutions and you don't and remember like I said a second ago you don't want to force anything but if there's a genuine integration you should you should build some proof of concept around that right it helps you stay in the conversation like I said and another thing I really want to highlight is that you want to create superstars in your community right you want to make people feel really really special right so this means promoting the projects that your community builds it means hosting little like sessions and meetups where they can come in and share what they're working on to your broader Community you really want to highlight people right it gives you content right because you have something to say and it also makes people feel good right because it's just it's just a nice human thing to Spotlight someone and tell them they did a good job right especially if it's if it's true obviously so that's the dev in the real side another thing that I think is interesting to talk through is how to spend money in a in an intelligent way on developer acquisition right so all the hackathons you guys see those are not cheap for sponsors right those are very expensive so I think it's worth keeping in mind how to actually do this right so again our industry spends so much money on developer acquisition it matters to us it's spent mostly on hackathons bounties and devrel team members I'm not going to go into how to hire deveral team members but in terms of getting money getting getting Roi out of the money you spend at hackathons and bounties uh you have to keep in mind you cannot just throw money at your community and hope for a good outcome right there have been times I've been at events where someone from a protocol says hey if you build anything on this on this on this this L1 or this protocol will give you a 10K Grant right they just start throwing money out like crazy because there has been a lot of money in the space to date right unfortunately that just doesn't really work right it can get you some growth immediately but the way I like to to put it is that you really get out what you put in from an effort and and how thoughtful you are uh point of view right so when it comes to hackathons right on hackathons first the selection of the hackathon you're going to do really matters right so you want to look for really you want to look for events that have really high quality co-sponsors uh and you want to look for organizations to put out lots of good content and seem like they're on top of their stuff right you should ask yourself before you show up at a hackathon before you pay money to be at the hackathon what kind of community is this event going to attract and is that Community one that you want building on your on your on top of your protocol right or your technology in general two really good examples that are kind of the gold standard are each Global and devfolio I love youth Global if you're a needs Global person in here thank you for doing good work at good hackathons that's right so look for look for teams like that right it helps and then at the hackathon one thing that's counterintuitive is you should prepare a couple of ideas at least before the hackathon starts because you know we also like to sit here and say hey we're just so excited for the applications no one's even thought of yet right and it's true that you will be surprised and people will build cool things on your Tech stack but people have two days here they have a lot of things coming at them give them something to work with give them some idea to start with it's really helpful and ideally those ideas integrate well with other sponsors uh devs at hackathons like the stock price on top of each other they look for ways to integrate multiple things and it's worth keeping that in mind and then obviously you want to be friendly being friendly really matters obviously at hackathon so that's that's how to think about hackathons the other thing that we do at Super fluid is we think about bounties a little bit differently right so I think that when it comes to developer experience and building developer communities using bounties like individual bounties to to get people to complete tasks is a little bit overrated you can crowdsource some good content and things but what we what we kind of like to use bounties for is to get Giga brains and really smart people looking at your code base that's what you want right you want to have them looking at your technology and ideally they go out and they build something brand new as a result of seeing this right that's that's a very important thing to note right again this is just kind of a regurgitation of what I just said um they're decent for crowdsourcing tutorials and educational content but again use them to get smart people looking at your technology all right so so to wrap up here right I want to go through a couple of devrel failure modes right that I've experienced in mistakes that I've made mistakes that I see in the space uh just to just to give you something to walk away with and then I'll kind of recap and you know remind us all of what the goal is here so some several common failure modes number one trying to throw money at the problem right we talked about that number two not seeding your community with enough interesting ideas and examples to work with right you can't have people you can't expect people to read your mind right giving them something to work on is sometimes very useful uh another three is adding or assuming too much content in your docs and tutorials right meet developers where they are understand those personas and you'll be much more successful four is doing way too much low leverage work right so that's me in the beginning only answer is not really working on our Docs but on the flip side go too far there you can only focus on High leverage work right and if you do that you don't do the things that don't scale meaning you make people feel uh like you know like you don't care about them by not answering questions in your Discord um and not staying you know for example we stay up until 3am some nights at hackathons right that's not exactly High leverage but it does help us build Goodwill with the ecosystem right so be willing to do those things uh in addition to some of the higher leverage stuff it's both important and then finally the thing I'll leave you with is to remember what success looks like here I think you know we sometimes forget that we just get in this cycle of just throwing money at hackathons and just you know going to all these conferences and things and we forget that success looks like a thriving community of developers who tell all their friends their bosses and other people they know about your product uh that help developers other developers in your community right they give back to you that build their Integrations uh at their existing company or protocol between your stack and that ultimately launch businesses that are built using a technology build right that's all the things that really matter um so if you're interested in all this stuff I love talking shop on devrel things uh thank you all for for coming today get in touch with me on Twitter at esplanet5 I'm also in Discord at Sam f superfluid with this little zero nine zero two thing uh so yeah come say hi I'll be outside to answer questions if you guys have any questions or just like to talk or meet up and thank you so much for for joining us today oh well one one more thing I have my my friend Yao in the audience we're gonna have we're gonna have a Dev run meet up tonight from six right y'all six to nine thirty from 6 30 to 9. all right so if you're interested in this stuff we have some cool devrel professionals and developer Community experts coming uh stop by say hi and uh we'll have a good time so thank you again [Applause] thanks very much Sam for all your insights and takeaways there next up I'm still on the developer infrastructure track we have Sam sorry we have Franco zioli and yeah Franco is the co-founder and CEO of nomik originally from Argentina and currently based in latam um Franco will be discussing and sharing all of the insights from creating an ethereum non-profit please join me in welcoming Franco foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] SpongeBob [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] for those of us who have just walked in I'd now like to introduce our next speaker on the developer infrastructure track we're really lucky to have Franco's Yoli here who will be speaking about the creation of an ethereum non-profit please join me in welcoming Franco hey everyone thank you for coming um I'm Franco co-founder and CEO at the number foundation and today I'm going to be telling you a bit about uh the story of how we got here what we're working on uh and a bit of our vision for the organization um so Naomi Foundation ethereum dedicates a non-profit we [Music] basically build developer infrastructure and developer tooling to improve ethereum developer experience that means we're working for ethereum we're dedicated to ethereum um and we're trying to empower developers to decentralize the world so we're best known for building hard hat um hard hat is the leaving developer tool um ethereum ecosystem Beyond developers use it to build tasks and debugger software um there's a whole ecosystem of communities plugins and nice things going on there but within always do this and I'll share a bit of the story of how we go here you know we got involved with ethereum in 2017. um we built contracts tabs we audited stuff um but by 2018 uh we started focusing on Audits and out of our own Neve to be more effective when doing technical work I was also working on a developer tool um while at the same time we were uh you know exploring what to do we were Founders trying to find what we actually wanted to to work on and all these courses our way of paying the bills but we need to be more effective um so we create a Visa which then in 2020 became hard hat because that was an awful name um and you know it was for internal use we open sourced it some of our friends likes it uh people started using it uh we uh so a need for it and we applied for a grant from the ethereum foundation which they gave to us and you know we spent the rest of the year uh continuing our exploration for what we wanted to do while you know working on this side on on be there to deliver on the roadmap that we set out for the grant um but uh you know by 2019 we realized that uh something you need to change uh we needed to to focus on on something to to actually do it well um and you know we we have or actually my co-founder Patricia had this vision for what uh heart could grow into I know they were big missing things um and we knew that uh if we just built out these things that were missing uh there was a lot of value that we could add to a lot of people and you know we we're just thinking at about the level of productivity that people were dealing with and you know if we managed to improve that very significantly uh it was very interesting to think what it could mean for an entire theorem ecosystem um so with four months of runway in the bank we decided to drop all of the all the team and focus on our little open source project that have maybe 10 15 users um so um yeah that's where our relationship with the ethereum foundation started and you know as he focused microphone are focused on building I went out to get some more money I asked absolutely everyone that was uh close to the evm this was 2018 the year where Theon killers were hot so I asked everyone for money almost no one gave us money but we had existing relationship with Team foundation so it was a conversation on going there and through that we end up meeting some people at the management team of ethereum foundation um who turn out we're looking for ways for people in the community that could help them improve their experience right they knew it was an issue uh the new Improvement and what they found in US was you know a team that had a working product some users a diagnosis of the situation a concrete plan and we were looking for funding it was a pretty good match we started collaborating with them they gave us another small Grant to implement uh solidity stock traces um and as part of the this same collaboration as um we will generally help them improve ethereum right this was uh not just working on hard hat but how do we make ethereum as a whole better and we ended up putting together a very small or relatively small roadmap of projects that we thought were very high priority high impact that could be delivered quickly and would make a meaningful difference in a short amount of time we worked on that it was great went really well we hit it off and by 2020 um you know the relationship took another step and we became what EF calls delegated domain allocators which is uh EF terminology for when they Empower someone in the community to allocate EF resources to improve specific domain within ethereum so basically it's also funding us more aggressively and allowing us to allocate more funding we started giving out grants you know we spent a bit less than the first quarter of the Year doing a lot of research trying to figure out what where the sources of all of these issues um and we worked on things like we worked on many things but to give you an idea of the kind of ethereum Channel General ethereum approaches that we work on we got GitHub to have a solidity give things that's highlighting on by default before you need to use an obscure dot file in your wrap up for that to work we entirely replaced the cryptography dependencies that were being used across the stack and that was a preview project today that's called ethereum cryptography where you know we worked we put together a new package with all of the cryptography different uh Primitives that were needed and then work with every single team maintaining all of the different components across the stack to replace them and uh that was that led to the entire thing being a lot more reliable and have less friction uh these are just some example of like 17 different projects that we worked on this year but just to give an idea of it was just pure ethereum and not really anything related to to our hat um so 2020 hard hat really takes off um it was an anzio 2021 that it got really crazy uh but by 2020 by the end of 2020 the trend was very very clear you know the the the the professional core ecosystem of ethereum had uh mostly all of them adopted hi-hat and this was great all the fun um people were very happy with the product and you know we learned a ton um no but by the end of the year we we realized a whole bunch of things these are I think the main takeaways uh the main one being doing this is very hard you know building sophisticated tooling it's for ethereum specifically uh in its current state it's super challenging and we realize that the next 10x uh so you know with all of this work and a lot of other things I went uh on that year in the ecosystem ethereum devx improves hugely um and we but there's still a lot more uh that can be done and we realize that you know the next 10x is not going to come from hard hat it's not going to come from any single tool out there um because what we realize is that you know a great great development platform for ethereum in let's say five years is one that is diverse you know today the ecosystem is very focused on node.js and solidity but that's unlikely to remain negates for for a long time and in software uh you know for the exact same problem there are a variety of different solutions that are all valid depending on personal preference on circumstance and different trade-offs that different projects have um so she's having a few or you know one or two solutions for each thing uh usually it's not the case in larger platforms so we know that what we need is not you know another specific feature it's not about missing functionality the next big step up it's more about General growth and more availability and diversity within the tool within the ecosystem which is you know the third point um so we knew uh you plan you know hard hat and everything else that we worked on and 2020 uh worked out but that was a very you know urgent execution of oh my God this needs to be better let's do better um but then we we needed an entirely new plan because you needed to to do that when actually that many in one year we we covered most of it so but for you know 2021 and forward we came up with a new plan that we proposed at ethereum foundation and we realized basically that what we had to do was is uh go one layer below hard hat and rebuild the foundations down there you know the things that weren't there that we would have loved to be there when we built our hat build those things so that other people will build more things like hard hat truffle remix brownie um and so on so that's a new plan you know build core infrastructure to make it easier cheaper and certainly better to build new developers rules like hard hat uh so and I'll get into what that actually means in a bit but you know by 2021 um the crypto Market was you know in in the advanced stage of the the bull market and the whole reason why we were doing this in the beginning as entrepreneurs were trying to build a business was well to build a business right like the whole even the relationship with the AF felt like a win-win because we would get to build our product build relationships build a position of leadership build a brand and in the process help them improve ethereum which would grow the pipe for everyone it was a win-win but it was uh initially we saw it as a great strategic stepping stone towards eventually building a business monetizing something um and given the the market context um being ideal for fundraising we thought that if we were actually going to do it build a business around this now is the time to fundraise get the money and do it so we felt forced to make a decision um and we decided not to um and the reasons why we decided not to build a business and instead turned into a non-profit um or a bunch and I can't cover them all and um something had to do with what we think is best for ethereum in the long term and many others have a lot to do with just personal uh things motivations and preferences that we the founders have and you know the main three ones that I'd like to show today is one we loved the experience of working for ethereum you know we had spent in the past year and a half basically being part of ethereum Team since our Monday towards the AF was improve ethereum you know they deliver value to ethereum developers and even hard hat which is something that at the time needed to happen you know it was the right vehicle at the time to deliver value to ethereum developers but end-to-end the whole thing that we were doing was trying to um improve ethereum and this was an amazing experience super gratifying super challenging um simulating and we didn't want to let go of that and simply seal ourselves to just how do we make money out of our hat which would have been a much smaller scope than what we had been working on so far another thing is that developer experience we think is absolutely core crucial and critical uh to ethereum and it's also very hard you know there's a lot of attention that goes to uh the work being done on the protocol layer and makes sense it's amazing uh work the the the merge has been an insane feat of engineering um and without taking any kind of credit away uh from how critical all of that work is uh we shouldn't forget that all of that work uh is there to support why ethereum offers you know the network supports the value proposition which is a platform to build decentralized software um so if we have the most amazing scalable Network and it's decentralized but when you actually want to use it to build something on top it's not that great then that's a significant issue for ethereum um so we think this is uh she's a really valuable contribution that we can make uh to to the project and then you know the the entire speed of innovation in the ecosystem and its growth are very much directly affected by developer productivity you know the faster your developers can write code iterate debug test launch and repeat uh you know the faster everything will improve the more users will be captured uh generally by improving developer experience we inject productivity into every single team into the ecosystem which has a super powerful compounding effect over the long term right like faster faster faster faster faster and then the last one um you know tell me you're from a developed country without saying you're from a developed country crypto has no use cases you know like as Argentine Founders um I got involved with crypto in 2015 initially with Bitcoin and having lived our entire alarms in Argentina and struggle and experience the day-to-day limitations that come from living in a place like that even in 2015 it was really obvious that this thing was had the potential to meet mean something very meaningful to a lot of people um and which is very big Believers in what these can change and mean in the long term for people who live um in countries like ours um so we went ahead with it and we raised 22 million dollars in donations from across the ecosystem with the ethereum foundation being the largest donor but we had a bunch of amazing organizations and individuals donating to get these new ethereum non profit off the ground you know Unison now Italy coinbase the graph chain link polygon and many others all very long-term thinking organizations that were very thankful towards um so how are we going to do all of this how are we actually going to empower uh developers to centralize the world um you know as I mentioned before we came up with a new plan that was all about getting the entire tooling ecosystem to grow more and we got become more diverse and for that we're basically building new infrastructure to make it easy to do that these two components in slang and refnet are actually one same project massive project with two very large components slang is a new solidity compiler that we're building and which is designed from the ground app to make it easier to build available tooling for solidity right so it turns out that in a development platform the very core of it is the compiler and many of the tools that we use rely and integrate deeply with the compiler so um you know we actually designed the compiler to for that purpose it's going it's it can be a lot easier more effective than it is today and you know this isn't meant to replace salty so C uh it's you know compiles and you deploy to mainnet and this compiler is not going to be for that uh it's going to be used during the development process um because it's main you know the target audience is two developers and what we care about is basically making sure that there are great insights during the development process not when you need to deploy it and by not aiming for a main a deployment we're actually able to read ourselves with a lot of very difficult constraints that salsi has to deal with and make those constraints uh make many of the things that we want to do basically impossible to do for this whole city team so these two compilers are actually going to be complementary and and we're going to be using them together um there are one breathnet it's going to be a reusable dividing in runtime also to build tooling and it turns out that hard hat is actually a pretty complex piece of software and with completely different objectives and constraints it's basically an ethereum node you have to score a lot of the very same components a mempool and evm and storage um consensus component and an entire layer of debugging features on top where we do runtime observation to figure out what's going on with the bytecode execution to then tell Developers and you know that's what basically every tool that wants to provide the uh runtime insights to developers has to do right what we've all done truffle brownie remix we've all built this same thing which requires very in-depth knowledge of the platform because you need to basically build an ethereum now right like when you use maintenance working in hi-hat it pulls data from mainnet and it works as if it's maina it's basically I know with very different objectives um so if someone wants to build a new tool instead of them spending six months figuring this out putting the pieces together to only then start working on the very first developer feature we can just build a thing that is reusable that is extensible that it's very modular and that if someone wants to build a new developer tool they can use as a starting point and it will be a lot easier you know these are the things that we would have loved to have when we built hard hat and didn't and we suffered through it and we don't want anyone else to live for that um so um where's hi-hat in all of this we haven't forgotten about her hat very much remains a very core uh priority for nomec and you know the the SE projects are all about the long term you know like they will take a while to Drive meaningful impact as they are dependent on other people building things on top that then end users use but until then developers still have needs today you know we need to have users to service bugs to fix um and hard hat remains our um response to those needs that developers have today so quiet is growing so we're expanding and continuing to increase our investment into our head and it's expanding into a suite of tools uh hard hat Runner and network are the main components that everyone's been using you know the sea lights has Runner which um is basically what you run and what contains the the conflict system and the plugin architecture and all of the extensibility and the kind of starting point that connects everything else that's our runner than our network is the development node and we recently this year launched our vs code extension which makes um solidity editing feel a lot more modern provides basically Advanced solidity editing assistance John Gable talk about it yesterday that you should look up um and then ignition has been uh in development for a while we're going to to launch it soon um it's going to be these uh infrastructure um as code deployments tool that we're hoping uh will change the game of deployments then where you're going to uh start seeing is that all of these things start seeing more and more Integrations across them and while we're trying to we're trying now it's an objective uh that these things can be used in isolation including in combination with other tools but if you use them together uh cool things uh should happen um so that's basically the roll map um where 12 people were ethereum dedicated were impact driven and what we do doesn't run after a financial metrics um and you know if you would like to write some Rust to build a compiler or help us improve hard hat uh to you know continue empowering the ecosystem to keep building cool stuff we're hiring that's it thank you [Applause] thank you very much sorry thank you very much maker great to hear your Insight sir foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] all right foreign [Music] for those of you who are just walking back into the room we're switching it back up to the opportunity and Global impact track next up we will hear from Mario Havel and he will be sharing what he has learned from building a parallel economy using ethereum before I introduce Mario do we have friends in the audience from Central Europe today raise your hands Central Europe cool cool okay Mario is someone I've had the great pleasure of hanging out with and also learning from he is a protocol supporter and researcher working with the ethereum foundation co-founder of the bordel hacker space a bit louder [Applause] um Mario has been building and educating local communities in Bratislava Prague Barcelona inspired many people to live crypto native and contribute to the free and open source software ecosystems please join me in welcoming Mario um thank you very much thank you so much for the lovely introduction uh I really appreciate that uh and I'm excited there is so many friends from Central Europe here because so what I'm planning to do here today is actually to share a bit of experience from Central Europe experience of building local barrel polish so the name of the talk in the in the schedule is building Pearl Academy but uh that's two narrow topic and it will be actually uh more about parallel Society but all structures in general so um yeah so that's the first question I guess what is the spiral Society what are these parallel structures I'm talking about and um yeah let's see where where it leads so first of all to to somehow Define somehow explain what is what are the parallel societies um let's talk a bit about theory of social change I believe that many people in the world but especially all of you folks here have ideas how to make World better uh how to improve societies how to make uh betterment for everybody because well there are many issues in the current Society in the governments in the in the cultures and there are there are a bunch of Utopias but especially there are various ways how to achieve the change how to achieve this Improvement um uh and I will very oversimplify the social change theory I'm very sorry about that but uh to sum it up uh we have some top-down approach uh to changing society which is uh we can imagine some politician creating uh better rules which will improve the life uh we have uh or like also I vote right I'm giving my voice to to somebody speaking for me so so uh uh he has uh he has then took down power uh the bottom-up approach coming from communities coming from people from activists whether it's entrepreneurial uh non-profit activism and uh people actually uh building projects which are permissionlessly changing the world and uh uh we're going to social change I also have to mention uh revolutions which are another maybe kind of sudden uh kind of change in society I hope you can see the slides through me actually um yeah nice and um I mean we can argue about many issues of these of these uh of these approaches uh first of all uh there is uh there is a the violence uh involved uh especially in the top-down approach uh when we have government enforcing rules it uh requires coercion um also Revolution can be can be kind of violent and uh there might be hidden violence even some uh in some bottom-up approaches so that's that's one of the critique and the second thing is effectiveness of these of of various approaches to social change and the effectiveness in the terms of uh social context I would say so the problem with uh for example the top-down approach is that the politician or somebody who is creating these rules for us needs to follow the Zeitgeist of society the side case of society the the social context uh for example the politician in very conservative country cannot make very liberal reforms right so he always needs to follow what the electorate wants but also in the bottom up uh systems uh we are limited by the social context in multiple ways uh like uh when I'm when when you're creating a movement which is two outside of the the overturn window uh it's hard to gain traction and um and uh you might be even you know out censored and um uh also in the in the in the activism uh we see uh we see this uh limits where I'm putting my productive energy uh to something I believe in but it might be used completely differently in the current social context so for example I'm building some open source tools I'm contributing to to some open source ecosystem and uh now government takes this takes this open uh open program and use it for an army for example so I'm actually contributed to something I didn't want it at all so yeah so we can argue about like Effectiveness and issues with a social change uh but the the main issue here or what I want to mention is that none of these work in totalitarian regimes so in the in Australian regime where you well cannot really vote so the top down doesn't work at all you don't have freedom of expression you people cannot uh cannot do any forms of activism this is this is not possible and so what would I like to share here is uh the experience from Czechoslovakia which experienced um Decades of the italianism after Communist Regime which started after second world war and in late 60s uh there was a kind of a liberal wave uh in the in the Socialist Communists around uh Czechoslovakia which uh argued for opening borders so people can actually travel to the West for example argued for certain free market principles and and so on and so on and of course uh the peaks of it brother didn't like that and um as a part of the Eastern Bloc uh it was it was something which was very discouraged and uh it resulted in invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and uh yes so the verge of backpack the the Soviets just sent tanks and well compared to Ukraine these days uh Czechoslovakia wasn't able to fight back so for coming years uh it experienced strong uh uh soviet-run Communists totally totally damn it Authority and regime and uh and uh especially in the 70s in the coming years there was Era of so-called normalization which was a wave of a strong totalitarianism and this this resulted in uh in intellectuals in people in scientists in artists being persecuted being uh forced to uh become just Workforce not the intellectuals and uh and uh people were persecuted uh spied on and of course this kind of totalitarianism results in some opposition in some distant movement and um there was so around the whole Eastern blog there were many interesting and and um courageous um uh distant movements and in Czechoslovakia there was also uh various of them for example like second culture which was for example false folk singers um artists like uh uh but uh but one important one important and probably the best renowned this isn't moving from uh from Czech Republic or Czechoslovakia I need to mention is a charter 77. 77 was um well it was a collection of essays it was petition which was appealing uh to government so it starts to comply with basically what it promised with uh of um to stop violating human rights uh Civic rights um and uh as peaceful as as uh humanitarian this this uh this movement was the government really took it back uh government started to chase people behind 277 and and uh publicly destroyed uh destroying their figures and uh basically uh it was yeah so there are there are many interesting people on this picture you might know on the very left uh that's of Hudl who later became the first president of Czech Republic and he's world-renowned humanitarian uh liberal and um uh so the charter it was collection of essays it has had few spokesmen and uh uh one of the one of the colleagues of one of the one of the leading uh personas in general 77 on the right here was vasov Bender and he uh within within this recent movement he actually focused on um exploring how is the movement itself evolving how it's how it's How it reacts to the persecution from government and uh he uh described it as uh parallel police uh he he noticed that this Contra culture this persecuted uh subculture or movement is building Pearl structures its own culture its own uh education right we had there was there was many books which were just prohibited and these were distributed uh you know hand rev written uh Within These communities so he described it as could be defined as set of strategies um for uh creating some independent Society uh this is this is outside of the context this this big uh big uh uh quote here by Irby Fuller but it kind of kind of uh sums up the idea uh that I have there uh basically let's when I'm in the society like the Communist Regime right I cannot fight against it uh we cannot have uh protests because we will be violently punished we don't have any freedom of expression we cannot write freely we cannot there is only single party the Communist party we can vote we cannot change anything so we are forced to uh building free independent parallel structures and um and uh it's also it's not just uh like out of the necessity but I believe that it's also effective and moral approach uh does this this is something similar to what Gandhi says right uh be the change you want to see in the world and um so yeah parallel police uh is to me a set of strategy set of uh various spiral structures uh and here are some examples so the pillars of pearl police would be uh not just the name of the talk is the parallel Academy but here it's just within the context right so it's parallel education uh parallel economy culture uh Civic rights protection which was actually uh the main reason behind the charter 77 uh but all infrastructure governance systems for these people and this is not something which is strictly defined which is uh like okay this is the power of police these structures uh it's these are just examples it's always uh based on the circumstances uh what the independence Society actually requires in that moment and uh it's a it's completely up to you right okay the community what it what it needs in that context and uh yeah speaking about a social context when I when I mentioned before so here is a beautiful thing which parallapolis enables and that's uh actually having these let's say design principles are rooted in the in the paropolis itself so when we are building these problem structures we are building them on the on the basis of uh positive social context and we can uh feel free to put our uh our uh productive energy towards uh parallel police and uh this protocol is is not something the czechoslovak dissident invented uh it's something there described but I would say it's uh anthropological constant through the history we see people creating parole structures out of necessity throughout the whole history uh whether it's Christians who were persecuted in the Ancient Rome or in the in the recent history uh maybe hippie movement or LGBT and similar uh Contra cultures uh ended up actually building their own parallel structures okay now where ethereum fits in all of this and ethereum uh or like speaking about these Technologies I have to go all the way back to cypherpunk and um server Punk is another movement which actually uh comes to life in late 70s and 80s um and this was a this is a movement community of various interesting people uh many programmers scientists mathematicians entrepreneurs uh people who uh at a time where internet computers and encryptions started to spread the governments well wanted to fight with it right the government said the encryption is a weapon it's something which only Army can have and only to limit what people can do with their computers what can actually happen um what kind of encryption we can use and cyberpunks were people who stood against this who create uh not just build tools as it's described here very nicely by Eric use um it's uh build the tools but also created residences against uh against regulation of cryptography for example uh uh filmor who started eff altering Frontier Foundation very renowned in today and so is different banks so the first part here it's a it's a part of a cypherpunk Manifesto by the by Eric Hughes and the second part is a Manifesto of crypto Anarchy which is a movement coming out from the uh growing from The Cypher bank and the manifesto was written by Timothy May uh the left okay on the left in the picture and uh Timothy May took the idea of The Cypher Punk even further not just to protect ourselves but to actually achieve Freedom through the digital Technologies uh it's like 30 years old it was further distributed on a conference crypto88 in 1988 and I have to say it's very prophetic if you read it and he said during basically about what we see today I believe that today when you look at the world uh when you look at the digital world the digital realm is uh well I would say bigger than the physical one it's maybe even even more important and we can leverage these Technologies because the government the authoritians will have the power the the coercion power in the physical world but they are losing it and maybe never really had it in the digital one and that's thanks to tools of crypto Anarchy the crypto networks a bit like something something ideological like it's some political political idea like anarchism based on crypto I don't know uh to me Anarchy acrylicism is a set of tools it's a toolbox which allows for many important things generally I would say that crypto Anarchy allows uh to build uh to build human interactions uh more voluntarily rather than based on coercion and uh it comes with many important tools with those four um uh anonymity in the internet digital money uh encryption and privacy which uh I believe is the fundamental uh fundamental uh a building block for freedom so we have this parallapolis which is set of strategies for building independent parallel structures and now we have crypto Anarchy which is a set of tools for building independent communities well and it kind of fits to get together doesn't it um so there is this lovely building in Prague called parody police as you can see in history Anarchy and I would say this this building is actually like the manifestation of the connection between the physical and digital world and um and this is where it comes together uh in the idea that we can build these parallel structures this independent uh communities thanks to the tools of the crypto Anarchy and parody police has been running for over nine years now uh educating about these Technologies and experimenting with them and so in the talk I would like to actually later explain some some examples of how we uh how we experimented with ethereum as two of crypto energy for building parole societies but but uh one one uh one uh piece that get uh is famous it's actually this little place bordel and many of you who followed the merch might heard about bottle WTF but it's named after actual physical place which is in basement down there uh of this building and the basement is called bordel and you might know these memes about the robsten merch with the whole get team which happened there so uh the paralleling police is like open platform uh talking about a specific project it's open platform for various communities to meet uh because like when when various communities I'm now talking about the crypto not just ethereum but we have bitcoiners monorail people I have Monaro socks here uh and uh and all the people who are actually building privacy tooling and an encryption tooling and artists and so on meeting this place and create beautiful things so there are a few things we experimented with in parallel police uh considering ethereum So like um I I mean I don't really have to explain this I believe that you folks who understand ethereum know that it's such a strong tool for what I explained because it enables permissionless coordination and uh I would say it's uh it's a Cypher Punk solar panels each bank and pixel Punk Tool uh very versatile tool um kind of a when I have a toolbox uh in the crypto of the crypto energy tools ethereum would be a Swiss knife which can which enables me many things and these are some of those few important things that we uh we use in our little experiment with parallel police and first of all the D5 or the open finance the permissionless finance which ethereum enables this is something which is which is necessity for uh well uh I would say dissidents or for people who are who don't have access to the traditional Finance or don't agree with uh immoral morality of the traditional finance and and want to explore the permissionless Alternatives and paropolis uh this building that I showed accepts only cryptocurrencies for the whole of its existence there is actually a Bitcoin Cafe it's placed with this Cafe which accepts only crypto there is a co-working there is many people coming to this building and they are forced to pay with crypto so all the income is actually only in cryptocurrencies and it's kind of a mess to live crypto natively because of the volatility because of uh because of the bear markets which will come always right so uh thanks to ethereum we have tools like stable coins we have tools like collateralized loans uh so the defy here is not about chasing yield farming but about actually using this to to survive economically in some parallel economy so uh and uh so so uh as an individual who is living without banks it's uh it's a tool which is which is a necessity uh to be able to to survive um with uh just crypto uh but also as the organization as police it's uh it's great we have the tool like loans and there are it's not just using the tools but there are also uh people coming from paraple is who are creating these tools there is pwn Pawn Finance which is aiming to bring mortgages for crypto natives for people who don't have or don't want to have can have access to the traditional Finance uh public goods uh I also don't have to go deep in those because you folks are here you understand what public goods meme interior is uh but uh it's the realization here how it clicks it's it's super it's really amazing right I mean we have the the whole the parallel Society the parallel structures which are mostly all public goods the whole building ratio it's not it's probably good which provides education it provides platform and and it's a something which needs to be funded not via coercion via taxes or or so on but uh by uh but alternatively regeneratively and um uh would we uh would we experienced is that parole police get uh uh uh get uh successfully uh crowdfunded multiple projects uh not just for itself but for example the the other tough coveted winter uh paropolis took uh the volunteers from peropolis had a track with Bitcoin Cafe on the wheels and provided coffee for doctors uh fighting the coffee in the hospitals and this Cafe was free for them it was crowdfunded mostly with Bitcoin and Fiat another 50 room to be honest but uh still the crowdfunding and the public good funding ethereum tools are much stronger but our police accept donation on bitcoin on give it and um and uh generally if you we want parallel structure they need to need um this kind of funding uh running out of time but uh yeah the governance uh uh another another important part uh we need uh reputation systems and governance what do we experimented with is for example tokens for people who are contributing for volunteers who uh get awarded with our own token and based on this you can you can track the contributions in the physical space right in the local community but also in the in the digital one uh like example of the digital parallel police would be for example the network states there is balaji's book about it uh vitalik has a good article on it and uh or like uh Network States or parallel or Cloud Societies or parallel societies it all sounds same to me and this is these are uh local or or digital communities which need governance and repetition systems and ethereum provides that um the specific project in Prague created these beautiful silver coins or medals as a tribute to uh to Alan Turing uh the certificate of these is nft on ethereum uh but also before we uh uh there were uh coins silver and even some gold ones with Aaron's words um Russell breach uh and and others and these These are certificate on bitcoin as a multi-second Bitcoin so it was kind of like a technology but still uh this is something which sends crypto weddings were a cool idea which which almost got materialized in the Slovak version of paraple is in Bratislava where a lawyer I was working on basically this parallel kind of wedding where uh so as a homosexual he was fighting for uh having uh same-sex marriages which are not possible in this country but he created as a lawyer he created a contracts peer-to-peer contracts which enables similar uh similar things as uh having the normal legal marriage and the certificate of these can be a contract on ethereum um it was yeah uh yeah security system this was this was a concept which didn't get materialized but there was a nice nice idea a nice concept about having like parallel Uber kind of police based on ethereum in a way that I have a fountain I have a physical device in my home which uh I found through a contract and when you come you beep your NFC card like you have these uh these cards with your with your ens and you get rewarded by basically securing the perimeter um as a proof of concept of these uh we had there was a bird feeder are in parallel police it's a cute project which does this incentivization for uh this like this kind of instrumentation for feeding birds so we have like a bird feeder with a device where you tip your cart you put there uh you put their uh bird seed and you get paid from a contract where everybody can some money right uh for for feeding the birds so incentive systems and Environmental Protection another important thing which uh ethereum also helps with uh in free independent manner there is a there is a project which was also funded thanks to quadratic funding which was at eat Prague in parallapolis uh and if Turtles and these are folks from environment apps from parole police who another piece of community which came and learned about this ecosystem and these folks are coming to Indonesia saving Turtles and the thing is that each turtle is unique they have unique faces like people so they make nfts under them and you can adopt them you can buy them and support uh the actual the actual protection of the turtles because it's a lot of work to be on the beach all the time and make sure that they are they're right uh yeah good I think I went through it um and uh so the motor that we use in parallel police is enter the outside ADI here is that thanks to these Technologies thanks to these parallel structures um we can I don't want to say opt out when people often say this opt out from the system use crypto you are opting out but it's not like opting out to some vacuum because you are actually entering something right so you enter the polar police but at the same time you are entering outside uh and whether in English I like it in Spanish or Czech and so uh yeah enter the outside I guess I guess that's it thank you so much I can't believe I made it on time and I'm sure if we have room for some questions anybody it's all right thank you so much for coming folks I really appreciate all of you here hope you liked it and I will be around here you can find me if you see masked Anon it's still me uh just leaked it but uh whatever yeah and can yeah normally I work in the protocol support this was totally out of EF stuff but uh there is my email feel free to contact me or Twitter yeah thank you so much again thank you thank you Mario moving to the governancing coordination coordination track our next guest is Charles St Louis Charles is the CEO and head of government governance at element Finance previously he was the decentralized governance architect at maker maker Foundation he's been an active contributor to ethereum the ethereum cat herders helping with improving the EIP process coordination of hard Forks advising eat.org and working on ethereum developer growth strategy here in Bogota Charles has been enjoying hiking and today Charles will be discussing why crypto Protocols are failing at governance please join me in welcoming Charles [Music] foreign [Music] foreign hello everyone how's everyone doing today hey so this has been absolutely great hasn't it I mean we waited three years to come back to Devcon the talks have been absolutely incredible I just can't stop smiling I'm seeing so many friendly faces so many new faces I'm just so happy there have been many themes of this conference the merge of course is the highlight we have a lot of L2 development zk's D5 protocols with their financial Primitives and many more but we can't forget about governance after all governance or lack thereof has a massive dependency on the success of our protocols So today we're going to talk about our governance structures why they're failing are Dows and protocols and how to approach fixing it I might have a small life throughout the presentation so I hope you can spot it um but yeah again I'm Charles St Louis I'm the chief operating officer at element finance and head of governance I previously worked at the maker Foundation as the decentralized governance architect and today I'm talking about how to fix our governance systems from the failing or dows so of course element is a fixed rate protocol for variable in yield markets but today I'm talking about a governance protocol that we also built so our company is very focused on research and development and governance is very dear to our hearts so we spent a lot of time countless hours on this governance research and we came up with something called Council which I'll get into a bit later but before I talk about all the challenges and things we dislike about governance I just want to do a quick little fun Journey Down history Lane so since humans have existed there's been some form of governance and coordination let's say it starts with tribes and clans three million years ago where people started grouping together to make resource Gathering a lot more efficient give or take a couple years later we had kingdoms and that came with Kings Taxation and better resource defense for the resource Gathering that we developed over the past Thousand Years the next came Empires which introduced a large amount of hierarchies and power inequality but the thing about Empires is that they always fail from Empires we came to democracy it didn't come easy there was a lot of battling and fighting to make this happen but it truly introduced the first concept of the vote where everyone in society or at least some people in society inclusivity didn't take that much time to like develop through that but each person had a say in their governance decisions and how things move forward so democracy was great and all but it also had some problems tyranny of the majority and also bad decisions getting pushed pushed forward because people just simply didn't want to vote I mean I can probably like eighty percent of you who probably don't want to vote in their local jurisdictions or in decentralized governance so how can we expect this to be an efficient system from democracies we had republics which weren't too far away from each other as you can see here like they're not mutually exclusive the only difference is that we're essentially trusting people who are paid compensated to be experts in their area to make decisions for us and obviously with republics became constitutional republics and so on it is paraphrased history so today many forms of these governance systems exist they're emulated they're improved upon but we also have new forms of technology that have evolved our governance systems the internet of course blockchain and many more so at this point I hope you can kind of see some similarities between what we've done in the past and what we've learned and how they translate directly to our systems today in defy and crypto so the first one I mean direct democracy I think it's pretty self-explanatory here I think the closest one that we have is the one token one vote we have the new system of reputational voting where you have non-transferable voting power based on your contributions to your community or your society and whatnot and then we have an emulation of representative democracy which is token weighted voting with delegation we even have Republic like Dao's where teams are voted into do their areas of expertise and basically deliver like Finance work operations and all that but we trust them to do that work on behalf of our Dow to push it forward so by now I'm sure you're all wondering why I gave you this weird history lesson but I swear I do have a point and that point is governments fail they failed and evolved over thousands of years it takes time to find out what works and what works often changes nothing is permanent so why are we building our governance systems as if we're getting get it right on the first try or first deployment it's pretty silly isn't it it's not realistic it doesn't work the rules are complex people don't want to vote it's just not working so these are some of the pioneers of the governance systems that we've seen in ethereum and generally in blockchain and I'm not picking on these protocols at all they've done so much for the entire ecosystem but there definitely are some challenges in these systems around adapting too slowly or not at all we have a lot to thank to maker they were the first on-chain system in ethereum and they've done so much great work but at the same time they aren't easily adaptable they have a smart contract system that was deployed once in order to change anything you'd have to completely redeploy the system you'd have a token migration you'd have a lot of technical debt user disruption and much more so it's not simply easy to evolve in a similar case with compound yes they did at master upgradeability of smart contracts but that also comes with the technical debt user disruption every time they want to add a feature or a security feature and that is a problem because a lot of protocols in the space have actually forked compound governance we've gone from alpha to Bravo projects like uniswap and gitcoin are both following that system and they have to upgrade their systems each time too or unless they fall victim to vulnerabilities security and lack of features we also have a big favorite here urine the protocol is absolutely awesome they have this upgradability via modularity system in their core protocol however on the governance side it's still a little lacking because it is relying on a lot of semi-centralized parties with multi-cigs executing transactions lastly not so related to defy but we have Aragon to be able to be one of the projects who invented the term Dao and and really brought it to the market and they've done a lot of customization with their projects so you can do a lot of different voting systems different types of quorums etc etc but because it's so customizable the smart contracts structure suffers a little it's almost too upgradable in the sense of smart contract upgradability not just modularity so this is the part that you're all waiting for I'm going to take a sip of water first so I can keep you on the edge of your seats all right so here's the little lie that I told you about so I'm not going to tell you that there's one solution fixes all our problems there's way too many to address there but there is something that we can do to help significantly improve the failure of all our governance systems and help them adapt way faster and that is to build adaptable governance systems from the start and I know that's big but what we've done at element is to build a very minimal core structure at the foundational layer and everything else is modular that way you can upgrade quickly you can remove things if you don't like them and it evolves more quickly with the political dynamics of your protocol or Dao so the hope with council is to reinvigorate the standard model for governance while keeping decentralization at the Forefront of governance but also allowing our Dows to scale better and make decisions quicker outside of the adaptability there are a few other goals that we strive for when Building Council and the first is to continuously strengthen inclusivity the one token one vote just simply can't work especially when it's a capital burden to acquire that there's many flaws of that model because people with tons of capital can capture tons of votes and they can sway governments activists investor Style what we can do is allow the actual people in the trenches on our GitHub on our discords speaking on community calls to have a say in governance as well to equalize that Capital burden the second one applies to all of D5 of course in governance and that is to make voting not a burden for people voteropathy and voter fatigue are real and actually can be detrimental to a governance system and protocol if people stop caring bad votes come in systems fail so the last one is the most important point that I want to get to and I know upgradability in the smart contract sense is a highly contentious topic but this type of upgradability is built on a very minimal structure at the core and everything else is modules you can add on and off so we want to design a system that can actually adapt as we change our minds throughout history instead of having to redeploy and fail and fail so this is the core it's very simple that's it that's all all this does at the center of the governance system is to define the voting process for those with governance power in the system it tracks proposals and counts their voting power and it retrieves user voting power from approved sources which I'll get to in a quick second so that's it that's all the core system does everything else is a tooling or tool belt to use in current situations future situations and much more the modules or tools I've selected here today are my favorite ones and we've decided to choose these for very specific reasons but keep in mind anything you can come up with can be added to the system whether it's a new form of Delegation rank Choice expiry the possibilities are endless so the first one here is kind of a take on traditional corporate governance where board of directors are trusted voted in compensated to make better decisions for the organization and obviously scaling decision making a lot faster there is a Twist here but I'll leave that for later the second one is my absolute favorite voting vaults in a way this allows you to sign voting power to any person use case position Etc so it breeds inclusivity but also Capital efficiency which is a huge problem with D5 voting governance voting the next is optimistic grants and that's kind of a Twist on optimistic Roll-Ups but also the literal sense of the word optimistic because many grants programs with Dallas or organizations are very pessimistic they assume the grantee is going to fail at their work so this takes the opposite approach where it assumes they're going to succeed and if they do they automatically invest their payout but if not it can be clawed back at the discretion of the governance system the last one is Dow teams with authority and this one is really important but it's not a module of itself it's an addition to the same structure that the GSC has and that is giving your Dow teams authority over their areas of expertise if a dow team has to go through the regular governance process that everyone else has to go through decisions take forever processes your developed kind of become outdated and it results in a lot of people just not wanting to get their daily work done because it takes a month three weeks to pass a vote it's a little more on the governing steering Council like I mentioned it was definitely inspired by traditional corporate governance because we can't discredit that it's worked for Generations it's been battle tested I get that we like inventing new things and trying new things but this stuff works so why don't we try it here the way it works is you become a GSC member by getting delegated votes from anyone here once you reach a certain threshold you're then able to join the GSC and what that means by joining the GSC is like you're given authority over your work people trust you you should be able to do things The Authority we've baked into this is the ability to push votes on chain automatically so without having to go through that long strong governance process so they can make the calls for people at the top level the second one is they can spend part of the treasury up to a certain limit that they can still do one-off Brands bug bounties you name it they don't have to pass that vote through like a month-long process to spend some of the treasury which is good in some senses which is why it's capped at petty cash levels and the last one like I mentioned other councils within the system can be formed using the smart contract structure Dow teams can have authority over their expertise so a treasury management working group could spend the treasury without a resistance or a protocol team could basically deploy things to the protocol without having to be burdened with the rest of the voting process all right so this is my favorite and it is voting vaults and the reason I mean the main reason we developed this system is that a lot of governance systems today make you lock your voting tokens in the governance contract all you can do is vote if you're a small minnow in a sea of whales your vote barely matters why wouldn't you go use your tokens and put it in defy or make some Capital out of it so it's really inefficient from that standpoint so what we did here is we allow you to assign voting power to those types of positions or reputation and those people are automatically given votes in the system so it balances out the like Capital barrier of people um just buying tokens and they're also modular and upgradable so what I mean by that is let's say you assign voting power to GitHub contributors and you find that their voting power is too little or too high you can change that through governance you can also upgrade these things quite easily and I get that this is very theoretical so I did highlight a couple examples to make it real for everyone the first one is probably the most interesting and that is a compound Ave maker voting vault so like I mentioned before you have to lock your tokens in those systems to get voting power but in this system using Council you can essentially borrow against your clut like your collateral in these systems but still maintain the ability to vote or delegate so you get the best Both Worlds in a similar in a similar case you have the lp volt so you could be in a liquidity provision and still maintain the ability to delegate or vote and lastly the identity verified vault is pretty cool so you could verify your identity on chain and get voting power for that or even a reputational thing where it's an aggregate score of your work and GitHub discourse Community calls working groups and it scores it and assigns voting power and the last one is an nft so it's like you own an ift you could basically map that to voting power in the element system when we launched we gave a gift to the community and that was the lfiverse nfts so right now someone in the community is building a voting Vault to give anyone with an nft voting power in the system it really spreads out the inclusivity of the whole Community which is absolutely amazing foreign struggling here so dry here all right so the next is optimistic grants which like I said it's an optimistic Twist on the pessimistic view of brand systems whether it's just from an organization a Dao and whatnot so the base like the tldr is that you can set a schedule and a Time expiry the grantee can claim that Grant if the time expiry is hit without it getting clawed back so when the grants allocated it contains that expiry date if it isn't removed by that date they can withdraw and get their Grant if the governance system or the GSC realizes that they're not making their Milestones they can Claude back so what does this entire system look like like I said it's modular so there's many options the first one being what we chose for element Dao and it is a refined form of rep like representative democracy so with the GSC it's basically like representative democracy but as you can see here this is this is only the core contract so it tracks the proposals counts voting power retrieves retrieves the voting power from the defined voting vaults and basically the time lock up here can add new Quorum or change the voting vaults as we go foreign so all of these things here are modules this is the only course I really want to emphasize that this is the base core system and very little things can impact that your system could also look something like this which is liquid democracy so you take away the GSC because you just want simple delegation and the last one I want to show is just inclusive governance I also took out the time lock the time lock is definitely a recommended security feature because it has a pause between when you make execution and calls but if you want things to happen quicker and you don't care about that risk like you can remove it it's like defy Legos but governance Legos so by now I've talked about the long history of failing governments and how it takes so long to improve I've talked about our considerations with how we built this system and the core and the modular aspect of our architecture so now I just want to talk a bit about the council protocol in action so we launched governance for element on March 31st of this year and we were really excited to just see the traction happen I mean a lot of this was a big experiment right the GSC the rolling the rolling delegation was very new so we weren't sure if it was going to work but today I'm happy to say that the GSC is nine people and they all have together pushed forward quite a few proposals to improve the system on the social layer but also on the protocol layer we also have two voting vaults a vesting one and a locking one the vesting one essentially allows like the core contributors who created this protocol investors advisors key Partners to have voting power in the system but at a lower multiple so the community outweighs the actual core team which is a pretty cool balance of voting power like I mentioned earlier we also have the LV nft voting Vault that's in the works so that will be three coming up quite soon I've talked mostly about the on-chain and smart contract aspects of the system but the social Frameworks and DOW structures have also moved really quickly and that's because we've designed that proposal framework to actually adapt really quickly so people can make changes to like the proposal process or how we want to onboard assets and that's already happened twice already without friction so we're all really excited to see how the governance steering Council evolves right now I mean they've pushed proposal forward they haven't spent any of the treasury yet we have to see if that actually helps scaling these decision-making processes and if it doesn't we might go back to the direct democracy that everyone else uses where everyone just has the ability to delegate their Vote or vote themselves so what can you do with Council today well you can do a lot I mean you can Fork us you can build with us it's all open any dower protocol can use this for their own governance system and like I mentioned the system is very upgradable it's modular it's literally built for experimentation we want people to try things add it to our system create a voting Vault so that your governance protocol can have vote on ours and vice versa the possibilities are endless so you can use this system or you can add more to it so with that I've gone over all the problems with governance how we can adapt faster and the architecture of what it could look like if you were to adopt this model but right now I just want to say that like governance is evolving as always it's going to fail as always so we should build these systems to adapt quicker and for us governance systems are literally the make or break for our protocols I think the best is yet to come and thank you to everyone here for being a big part of that and for caring about governance and being here today thank you oh any questions yeah give you the way oh finally some water thank you that was super interesting uh I'm really Amazed by the way that you're thinking about governance and the upgradability of it and um so my question is a little bit philosophical sorry about that but uh delegation I see it as a way to handle this problem that people don't want to vote right but delegation can't always work because it can very easily if people don't care it can very easily turn into popularity games like who do I know that I can delegate my votes to um so like we have this problem that people don't want to vote and delegation is not really a solution to it so how how in your experience can we have people engage more be more I don't know socially responsible and all of that and I have a second question I don't want to monopolize so feel free not to answer but uh I also think that reputation is kind of very key element to solving governance issues but the thing is that uh application itself is not a solved problem as far as I'm aware so I'm wondering how do you approach reputation and element yeah so for the first question I mean yeah delegation can definitely be a popularity conference especially with like big people on Twitter with previous experience being delegates I think the best way to do that is just like have accountability layers so like if these delegates are just doing nothing or like abstaining from boats you have to kind of have that like disincentive there or transparency reports I think coin is doing a pretty cool job with their report cards on like how their delegates are behaving how they're participating and all that I don't think there's like a quick fix but there are two things I do want to see more in delegation systems and that is ranked Choice delegation so if I choose you as my first one you're my second year my third if you're away for a weekend with your family it reverts to him and then to you so it just kind of plays more to that human level of governance like people have their lives they're not always going to be online and so on but also adding the time expiry of Delegation so if I delegate to you and I forget about it for a year my votes are basically just wasted especially if you stop voting so if the delegation actually like reverts or expires after a year it puts the omen on me to actually find someone I align with more as for the reputational thing it's definitely a tough one um maker did a really cool experiment with Source cred where they like had a custom algorithm that took months to kind of filter in their discourse forum but it assigned kind of incentives for those participation people I think the reputational layer can definitely be gamed and whenever you add metrics to something there's definitely risks but if you could aggregate like certain scores and like for like my involvement in Discord my involvement on community calls the or the more tangible things like GitHub commits and you aggregate into a score I think you can kind of give you some level of their like participation in the system or if they own an nft so you kind of have to pull from a lot of different sources to even like vet if they're like an active member versus like the gameable aspects but yeah it's definitely a tough subject I can't give you a great answer Charles um you talk about here you talk about a delegation expiring after certain amount of time um I'm wondering are you guys creating certain rituals or let's say re-elections every every let's say certain amount of time um and yeah I'm asking this is because as you said some people use delegate and then they forget about it and and yeah there's no rituals there's no like a way for coming back uh like as we do it in traditional governance we have let's say in governments we have like four years election or stuff like that are you guys thinking um to do something similar among those lines or what yeah so when we originally came up with a governance steering Council the idea was to have like election Styles like every six months in the beginning and then like maybe like every year but there is a big problem with that and as the off-boarding of a member who is a big delegate or a council member you have to create a very like stronghold process involves governance so that's why we went with the rolling King of the Hill Style with like a delegation threshold so if someone were like that to like just kind of abstain from everything or do something malicious they would simply just like Drop in delegation and then someone could kick them off the GSC so it's a little more like dynamic when you say someone can you explain that um so if a GSC member were to fall below the threshold to be on the GSE anyone in the community or any internet in a wallet can kick them by clicking a function so it's immediate off-boarding basically so is that kind of like a liquid democracy where you're essentially like I don't like this delegator anymore I pass it to I pass my boats to another person and then uh once they uh the threshold is below a certain point basically they can get kicked out yeah so it's a roof it's representative democracy like but mixed with liquid Deli like democracy that's a mouthful but yeah so it's a group of people on a council being able to do things if someone does something malicious or they're just not doing a great job people stop delegating to them so that's liquid democracy aspect and then once they fall below the threshold someone kicks them they're no longer in Authority position so it's a lot quicker than having to do an off-boarding proposal where it takes a month to Upward someone where they can still do bad things or be an active and get compensated for it um we'll see if it works I mean the election style is not out of the question I think it's just a worthy experiment to try for sure hey I we have thank you I would like to continue our conversations I'm sure um yeah I'll be I'll be right down there if anyone wants to talk okay all right thank you everyone else thank you very much [Music] cool cool next up Griff green might not need an introduction here but to name a few contributions he's made to the community Griff green is co-founder of giveth common stack dap node Community manager for the Dow so let the crisis response effort for the Dow hack and first parody multi-sake hack from every angle he is the co-founder of white hat group and led the creation of token engineering Commons Griff green is advisor for polygon ID polygon Hermes red ID doing good and Stuart for git coin ens and optimism Griff yeah right come on [Applause] Griff also leads to crypto focused burning man camps let's hear it for Griff green yeah people forget I lead burning man camps too it's uh too much too much yeah that's my slides oh thank God so hi thank you for having me I'm going to talk about something that doesn't get talked about too much no actually we talk about this a fair amount in the theorem space and but I what we don't what we miss is that it's a huge opportunity in fact I would argue it's the biggest opportunity in the web 3 space and no one's talking about it as an opportunity to public goods public goods thank you public goods are it's a huge industry one of the largest Industries in the world and it's like the opportunities are endless no one is making money in public good space right now it's led by governments and non-profits and yet it's a 25 trillion dollar a year industry as in governments and nonprofits are spending not investing spending 25 trillion dollars a year to provide public goods for societies around the world this is 25 times the total crypto market cap being spent every year and it's being spent at a loss it's being spent by governments and non-profits so this is uh you know public goods are one of the four types of economic goods and I'm sure a lot of people have seen this slide or something like it before but I want to talk about it in a little bit of a different way because in my opinion these are these are like places where things end up but it's it's not definitive so on the left side we have private goods and Club Goods these are excludable Goods the cool thing with excludable Goods is that you can have business models business models are like these really cool games that end up allowing people to score points in very predictable ways right I see money as kind of a a point system and the way that we coordinate around money could be thought of as like a game hence the game version of this slide deck I kind of went with that theme uh so businesses really succeed at providing excludable Goods it's the Invisible Hand of the market the these Point systems these business models these games they allow for the Invisible Hand to just coordinate everything effortlessly because everyone uses profit as a shelling Point everyone's on the same game they're all trying to win get the high score but in the exclu in the non-excludable side as in half of the different types of economic Goods there is not this game right the game is taxes and donations which I would argue is like sacrifice people have to sacrifice to provide value in in the non-excludable side so this is common pool resources and public goods I just call them all public goods non-excludable Goods public goods so uh for but what's really interesting about this slide that people don't really talk about enough is that for instance fish in a bay it's a common pool resource but actually in practice fishing a bank governments actually move fish in a Bay from being non-excludable and they make it into a club good they make it excludable by requiring people to have a fishing license so right now in this in our normal society because there's great systems in place to manage excludable Goods non-excludable Goods often get privatized they get EX they become excludable and we move them over here because we have such great systems in place but what if we could create great systems that allow for win wins on this side of the chart what if we can actually take things that are normally excludable and make them non-excludable what if we could create abundance for society and and take care of the less fortunate in society by creating systems that actually work we don't have a choice we need to do this we're failing at the game the collective needs game the environment uh just general Global coordination is really shitty like full stop and if we don't fix it we're in huge trouble but we are fixing it it's already happening actually so many people in web3 are building a new way to coordinate on the global level and in win-win systems they're optimizing the games that are being played and and creating new games that actually allow for Innovation this is what I'm going to talk about mostly today I'm going to talk about all the cool projects in web3 well so I'm going to highlight a few of the many good awesome projects in web3 that are trying to get to the solar Punk future that we all want and I really want to create this framing that so that you guys can understand to get to this future we need to build win-win systems where that allow the people to coordinate effortlessly so where do we start well governments have a lot of funding this is not where we start when governments fail to provide public goods that are in demand people start non-profits nonprofits are the seed of the Revolution when people don't like what their the services they're getting they start non-profits and nonprofits need our help more than more than governments by far nonprofits are literally just burning money all the time everyone who's participating in the nonprofit system in some way or another is sacrificing and it's tragic because they're creating so much value and you know it's creating a lot of value because it's a huge industry sure it's not 25 trillion but I think 500 billion dollars being donated a year just in the U.S is big enough of an opportunity for us to make some major Headway so the cool thing is this is already happening you know I feel like in 2016 2017 this stuff was a dream we're like we're working towards this but we're in a place where there's so many awesome projects that are doing it and I kind of want to create a separation between two types of uh donate of economic games that are being played uh of different models we'll say of public goods funding so there's the donation games which are amazing right we're always going to have donations donations make people feel good right and these types of donation games uh that that are being played in web 3. uh the donation games rely on donations to fund public goods now often they create incentives for more donations whether it's social or straight up Financial uh the the there's usually some kind of system in place to optimize the donation system and make it more fun especially by giving governance to participants it's very common uh the economic games actually skip the donation side they rely on supply and demand to put fund public goods this creates really interesting entrepreneurial opportunities for participants in the system and it allows that invisible hand to actually make some Headway and uh just like donation games they give governance governance to participate participants I can't overstate this enough it's so cool in the web 3 space you know in the public goods funding space normally it's very top-down Capital controlled governments say we're doing this nonprofits have donors and the donors say we're doing this this is what the money is earmarked for but in web 3 we we build systems that allow it to be bottom up and where the participants not just Capital participants but through reputation systems and other other systems that we have there's a plethora like you saw Council there's so many cool ways to provide governance for the players that are playing the game so let's start with donation games so one of the landmark donation games that was started uh what in in the web 3 space are these Grant owls so molec metacartel metagamma Delta these these things are a fundamental building block in I think almost every uh public goods funding uh piece and I should have put Dow house on here I want to give like huge shout out to dollhouse like those guys are on the Forefront of this stuff innovating all over the place and there's somebody to watch like one of the things I want you to pay attention to is these are the projects that are going to be leading this new industry that's emerging and DOW house is important so the way Grant Dallas work it's basically a social club you could say a donation Club where when you put money into the Dow you get non-transferable tokens that allow you to govern the pot of funds and if you don't like how the Dow is going you kind of have a money back guarantee you can Rage Quit get your money back out so it's a really cool social system that in the end has collected millions of dollars for donations in ethereum in ethereum public good space especially one of the biggest donation games of course is quadratic funding quadratic funding is a really cool system emerged out of the radical exchange Community the radical markets book and clear fund and get coin have implemented it of course Bitcoin has raised somewhere around 70 million dollars for public goods using this donation game yeah a round of applause for Bitcoin those guys man and I should probably say us because many of us are GTC holders in the crowd I see you I see you out there uh so the get coin Dow has this has been managing is starting to manage the quadratic funding system and it's a really interesting game because uh the the foundational layer is the public goods funding team they are able to talk to Big Wigs in the theorem space that have a lot of money that want to fund public goods to get a big matching pool so this is why it's a donation game for sure I mean it's clearly a donation game but there's it doesn't work without a really large matching pool and the larger the matching pool the more interesting it is to donate to these projects so uh the the governance over this matching pool actually happens from each donor so if you donate uh the more each project can get a share of the matching funds they get more of a share if there's more people and more money donated to the project uh and of course it's a complicated equation I'm not going to say but it's really cool as a participant in the system because you're like okay if I donate a dollar they'll get 27 wow that's 20x 27 percent or sorry 27 x times my donation that's amazing but if I donate a hundred dollars then 250 bucks will go to the project so I'm allocating 250 out of the matching pool how much do I donate you know and it's kind of a fun game this is the best part about all this web 3 stuff it's fun to play you know donations usually are not this fun the next donation game is protocol funding now it kind of feels like it's not a donation but uh you know the protocol funding is really led by optimism ens polygon Hermes and bit Dao and basically they're taking a percentage of the fees that they're collecting and allocating that to public goods now this is uh this is basically like a web 3B Corp but benefit Corporation in the states where it's baked into their mission statement that they're going to support public goods and optimism has one of the coolest systems because they even add this retro public goods funding piece to it where they can find they can get non-profits or or people who are developing open source code to go find investment knowing that they could get a grant later if they succeed and it's it creates an even another system on top of it it's super cool foreign my favorite donation game and I'm a little biased is uh give backs so give backs is a pretty simple one whenever you donate to a verified project on giveth a hundred percent of the donation goes to the project and the donors get up to 75 percent back and give tokens streamed over time so what's really crazy about this is if you donate a hundred dollars then you will get 75 dollars in give up to 75 dollars and give back into your like for donating part of that will be liquid so you could sell it you can donate it you can play the next game that we'll talk about and the other part is stream to you over time until like 2026. so if the give token goes up because it's a volatile currency you could even get more money than you donated which is crazy you know this is the kind of stuff that can only happen in web3 give power is really important for the giveth roadmap but just we're in a phased rollout for the launch and it just launched the first part the staking and locking piece uh two weeks ago major shout out to Lauren Lewis who runs that piece of it runs the economy uh give power is really important to giveth in this in in the Evolve like to evolve non-profits to the end goal uh one of the big mission of giveth is to take non-profits meet them where they are and eventually help them create their own economic game so that they can be basically an impact now and give power will be the first opportunity that many of these projects have to make a win-win offer to their donors so let's say you're a project someone just donates 100 bucks to you you know that they just got give tokens right so you go and you tell them hey with give power you can stake your give tokens behind my project you earn a sick APR and I get benefits on the platform so specifically they'll the project will get higher up on the on the ranking list you know where uh where they come up so they'll come up faster from they'll be seen by more people and they will also get more give backs for their donors so you're basically would give power the give token holders are voting they don't even know they're voting they're just supporting they're just staking behind their favorite projects but they're voting for how give backs are distributed so it's kind of a cool economic game tied with with a donation game and the but the coolest thing is this psychological shift that projects have to get to make when they say Hey you can earn a yield while supporting me as opposed to you can sacrifice while supporting me so the really my favorite part of the web 3 public goods funding stream though is the economic games in the donation games donations are always part of it which means there's a little bit of sacrifice injected into the system that makes it really hard to have that invisible hand making magic but in economic games it's win-win all the way and this happens through issuance so ethereum and Bitcoin and all the blockchains are in my opinion public infrastructure like in a city the water or or electrical infrastructure yes you have to pay a bill you have to pay a water bill electrical bill or you have to pay transaction fees on to use the blockchain but the infrastructure itself is the access to the tooling is a public good that's why this infrastructure is usually funded by governments well with blockchains it's funded by issuance and that's the key for these economic games issuance is sent to people who are providing good work right so in ethereum it's the miners and that are now the stakers uh blockchain Bitcoin it's the miners but there were some really cool innovations that many people have forgotten about or never heard of in 2013-2014 that actually use this to do direct public goods funding Z cash actually supports uh cryptographic research this is without this protocol it would I doubt we'd have Roll-Ups today and uh and it's just the block reward and then name coin Prime coin curecoin these are these bottom threes they're crazy like no very few people actually even follow these projects but they're runaway economic games Prime coin to minor block and Prime coin you have to find a new prime number people are mining blocks every day every minute there's a new prime number found by Prime coin and I doubt most of this room has never even heard of it but it's a runaway economic machine and no one has is no one's donating no one's paying taxes people are just getting the block reward for finding prime numbers name coin was actually the first Fork of Bitcoin and it's kind of like ens does anyone have a DOT bit domain No Hands okay cool you can is infrastructure that exists even though no one's using it it's amazing and curecoin's folding proteins for cancer research one block at a time it's so cool they're using issuance and and the but it's in the digital space what's exciting is this move towards bringing it to meet space so like panvala subsidizes communities like Bitcoin subsidized security they're using issuance to actually support Community groups to to meet and share ideas and uh rainbow rolls in public nouns this is the nft style it's not all fungible tokens playing games rainbow rolls uh sold like 900 nfts and funded get coin matching rounds helped to help support some giveth projects and also wiped away seven million dollars of medical debt from random Americans that they that they were able to buy up their medical debt incredible project no one donated people bought nfts they could sell there's upside public nouns it just started two weeks ago Again by the Dow House crew uh it's kind of like a molecdo but instead of the shares being non-transferable it's an nft that's worth one vote in governing the treasury right and the intention is to spend it on public goods so it's super cool and it's it's basically I'm looked out and instead of Rage quitting and getting less you could actually potentially sell your nft for more than you paid for it token engineering Commons is another amazing economic game this is in partnership with the common stack this is the first Commons the common stack ever launched it's really cool it uses a bonding curve which um I don't know how many people have heard of bonding curves oh my God this is a smart crew so for the ones that didn't raise their hands a bonding curve especially a token bonding curve is a very simple smart contract that when you send it money it mints a token and if you and it holds that money in the contract and if you send the token back it will release the collateral and burn the token this will win a Nobel prize in economics I promise you this Simon De La rubier Bancorp they created something that has never been seen before this is a one-sided market and it solves a liquidity issue for Mark for small market cap tokens like paintball is super cool right I said it before but when when they issued when they issued uh their token it had no value at first and eventually uniswap it found its way to uniswap and it created a value but it still has very low liquidity with a token bonding curve uh economy it doesn't have that issue it starts out with infinite liquidity because uh issuance is dependent on demand which is super cool and it uses fees throughout the system uh when people are issuing or minting or burning tokens a percentage of the fees go to the common pool and also at launch a percentage of the launch goes to the bootstrap the common pool really interesting system that we that we at giveth really hope to learn from and apply to our end game which is curves so curves curves are actually bonding curves backed by giveth by give tokens and they're kind of the The Sweet Spot at the end of the rainbow the treasure at the end of the rainbow for every non-profit who comes on to give it if uh if so first of course you're a non-profit someone donates to you the donor gets give tokens right now with give power people are locking Capital they're locking give tokens behind a project there's Capital being locked behind each project that's that that's participating and give power with that locked up Capital we can launch a bonding curve and the bonding of course like you know there's a lot of cultural stuff that goes into this and talk working with the common stack to launch more Commons and to understand the the different reputation systems and the other kind of looking at uh projects like Council and how do we govern these systems so it's not just Capital it's not just the bonding curve that creates governance tokens but there's other governance involved this is the we're we're sorry I'm ranting but long story short we're still in the research phase on how to launch these impact dials with bonding curves but once we figure that out once we work with the common stack to actually understand the best ways of doing these things and making it easy for nonprofits any non-profit could launch its own impact out through the giveth system the coolest thing about everything that I'm talking about is that none of these things are in silos web3 is so amazing for its configurability for its everything can kind of plug into each other everything I mentioned is public goods Legos like the public nouns Dow could actually donate ethereum on giveth and support get coin grants incentivizing lots of Grants on gitcoin to get funding through extra donations and then once and then they'll get give backs they'll get more give tokens that they could further donate to other projects or they could stake and give power or one day they could use to invest in an impact out using a girv public goods Legos is where the real benefits here this is where this 20 this is why web3 is going to save the world you know because we can plug in all these ideas into each other and build a new industry that never existed so I'm sure a lot of you are Builders a lot of you have like an impact project that you want to see uh have have an impact become an impact Dow and maybe some of you are just you know hey I just want passive supporter of these projects and would like some upside well I've I founded a lot of projects in the space I want to highlight three of them that maybe could part could help everyone get involved more in the public good space so first is General magic uh probably many of you have never heard of General magic it's been running around for well over a year and it's a service dial that actually has helped many organizations panvala giveth token engineering Commons common stack and countless others and like ens we just built the ens swag shop which is super cool so if you if you are looking to if you're building in this space and you need some support you don't have a good designer or you even just want to offload a full project or you just want a swag shop or you want to integrate praise a reputation system you can reach out to us at General magic we'll help you uh we are we give insane rates in the crypto space because this is you know kind of an all has an altruistic swing to it even though it is a for-profit company uh so it's I would say it's about half the market rate so definitely reach out to us and we can support you in building the next public goods Lego for me to talk about uh I and I have a huge announcement from the common stack actually launching a new service where we want to help you launch the commons so we're supporting we've launched the token engineering Commons uh we helped the token engineering comments launched I should say and we're working with Grassroots economics to support them in their launch and now we actually have the bandwidth to support a few more comments so if you want a bonding curve you have an impact project and you're like yeah let's let's do this thing I want to learn about collaborative economics I want to design from the bottom up with my community Mission Vision Values parameterize the the economy like you guys the the community would do it themselves instead of us uh reach out and let's work together on that and of course giveth giveth has a token and this token is going to be the lifeblood of a new industry and it's a really easy passive way to get involved if you want to become part of the give it Dao and support this account this uh emerging economy uh definitely talk to me and I can help you out I can help you out with it basically any if you're working in the public good space I want to talk to you I want to work together this is there is no competition in public goods how can you compete when you're creating abundance for society right thank you all right thank you so much I'll be right outside and we can chat [Applause] that was awesome thank you thank you all right we've got our next speaker in the house Vince major um head of marketing at ether wallet at my ether wallet and today he'll be speaking on the importance of soft skills soft skills in crypto Vince the floor is yours [Music] oh foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] next up we have Vince major who will be speaking about soft skills in crypto Vince major is an actor marketer and Storyteller currently working as the head of marketing at myether wallet Vince has been working in the arts for over a decade and I'm really looking forward to his his talk with us this evening thank you so I need the names of some projects projects you love projects you work for just yell a few out for me bacon splat okay uh give me some more projects garlic coin okay what else stable node okay perfect thank you thank you for those I appreciate that so some of these I know some of these I don't but all of these projects have something in common and that is my mother hates them for and that's not a bad thing because she is my project too for those of you that don't know me my name is Vince major and I am the head of marketing at my ether wallet now to be clear this talk is not going to be about the mom test okay my mother is fairly techno savvy and really only calls me about once a quarter to have a refresher on how to attach a PDF to an email and that's a lie it's actually once a month but you see it's not the technology that puts her off from crypto and it's also not even the concept of the tech that really makes her confused about the company I work for instead it's the way that our industry communicates and story tells That Make Her roll her eyes at dinner and you know I'm sure that this is not something that's unique to me I'm sure you all have had to explain to your friends and your loved ones this industry and there's a good chance that they gave you a face not dissimilar to this and that's a bummer right because if you were anything like me you were amped to be in this industry and just want to tell everyone so today I want to speak to the heart of that and how I believe that we can overcome these challenges and finally win over this Broad because I believe that our industry focuses on and values the hard skills over the soft skills to our detriment so for the duration of this talk I want you to think of soft skills as those sort of non-technical skills that people have think creativity The Gift of Gab mentorship morale building basically anything that your project managers cannot assign a unit of time to right and I want you to also think broadly not just the skills that people have but also people that devote themselves entirely to the soft skills I am one such soft Skiller I have my masters in Fine Arts and the only programming I know how to do is slash BR which I think is a return in HTML I'm still not sure now there are three key areas in crypto that I believe can be improved by the soft skills and those are communication creativity and connection if you take away one thing from this talk today I want it to be that words have immense power they have the ability to paint pictures to inspire and create movements that move mountains so now let's look at some of our crypto words shall we GM coin and on lfg huddle no I'm old enough to have all of these remind me of a word I used a lot as a kid and that word was pone so now for those of you that are not older Gamers pone means Next Level Ownage or to completely dominate someone in gaming at least that's how it was explained to me when I was playing EverQuest it's a word that in that bubble in that time we all used all of the time however fast forward to now gaming has gone completely mainstream and yet this word has fallen to the Wayside the word itself failed to bring new users into gaming and so faded from the mainstream lens now on the crypto side I think we are using far too much of our Insider lingo to try and bring those on the outside in now I see this so often in marketing and the problem arises that new users don't know what our crypto words mean so we're imposing a barrier to entry right out of the gate of our own doing you know as an industry we find ourselves using huddle so much that it literally became a major segment on the John Oliver show and yet that mainstream ribbing did very little to bring new users into the space nor did it cement itself in the minds of others okay so to be clear I don't want to get rid of our slang right I mean it's part of the fun of being an Insider right we want to use these words and tell these jokes it's fun but what I do want to point to is that by improving the language that we use to communicate with those outside of crypto we can only help bring more people into the folds because right now as new users come into crypto they are being overwhelmed by so many new words and languages and I can only guess it's like being dropped into Colombia and not speaking a word of Spanish bonjour and this is not just related to copywriting and marketing let's take a look at the word ethereum itself so when it first came into being the word ethereum was weird to a lot of people and you know it's still weird to some it's also super hard to spell which is why this always makes me giggle like a child however after years of constant work by so many incredible people the word ethereum has gone mainstream which is fantastic I mean that's probably why most of us are here today and then they came out with ethereum 2.0 which is a hard Skiller naming convention but not horrible I mean at this point most people understand software versions and get that the software is evolving or leveling up like a Pokemon right and then there was consensus layer and I can't help but think that had there been more soft skillers in the room to be like I don't I don't understand what consensus means in this context could we explain that a bit easier that we could have had a better name and better communication and I don't want you to think that I'm picking on the amazing people that asked me to speak here today I tease because I love and I I want to see things get better and believe me it's not just ethereum that does this at my ether wallet we recently released our new browser extension wallets called encrypt which is spelled with a K now encrypt Services ethereum polka dots and is built for the multi-chain future it's out on all stores including Safari which is pretty cool now with encrypt I was Stone Cold new to the polka dot ecosystem so I had to do a lot of reading and as I was doing all this research there was a word that stuck out to me like a sore thumb in so much of the public facing information and that word was as existential now when I hear this word or see this word I think of the fact that I am going to die my loved ones are going to die and eventually the last person to remember my name will also die you know an existential crisis at night when the tears come I mean we've all been there no what's bananas to me is that in polka dot they are constantly referring to an existential deposit which means the amount that a wallet must have to exist now this to me clearly shows a hard Skiller naming convention at work now it might be clear to that hard Skiller on the back end it might be clear to other hard skillers but to the rest of us existential deposit makes little to no sense so if we apply the power of soft skills to this something like minimum balance comes to mind right because it's something that we immediately understand it uses language that is familiar and of course doesn't conjure up feelings of existential dread all of this is to say that by developing more soft skills around communication and more employees around Caucasian will only help bring more people into the folds because the clearer we are with our messaging and communication the easier it is for everyone else to get on our same page which brings me to creativity in crypto we are creating things out of thin air through code like it is an absolute magic trick for me to watch a developers work however while some might think naming something 2.0 is creative it's not it's iteration now to iterate is to make products great iteration is a hard Skiller in their finest form they continue to improve upon that prior base getting better each time again and again and again until we reach the immortality I I guess I I can only think immortality is the goal and is why we pay developers so much more but the problem is is when iteration uh replaces creativity in our space see because when you iterate you were only refining the boundaries rather than pushing them and then when iteration starts to cross pollinates you get a lot of noise now I feel like I saw all of this noise in the most recent nft run if you search the word board on any nft Marketplace you are going to get a Million results right and of course you're going to get the board Apes Yacht Club but then you're going to get the board kitty cats club and the board Bad Boys Club and then eventually you'll start to get things like the indifferent hamsters Subaru Society now this is where iteration becomes knockoff becomes scam and rug pull all of these lines begin to blur in the minds of not only crypto natives but those outside of the space as well and this creates confusion for users and even worse can create connections or implied connections where they do not exist in that case we can experience one bad actor or project bringing down several because a a loose connection in the mind of the other for instance it's very easy for the media or for people outside of crypto to see that one dog themed crypto project is a scam therefore all dog-themed crypto projects are a scam or be unable to tell the difference at all and think they are all one big project rolled in together much like your parents probably called all video game consoles a Nintendo growing up at least that's how it was for me and of course my ether wallet is intensely familiar with this iteration problem from others to this day we continue to see products called my blank wallet and this does make our brand management difficult the oop did I lose my mic nope there I am the wallet space in general has also iterated itself into a whereas so many developers are being forced to create their products with a specific wallet in mind and the reason is because the current model is winner take all now we're hoping to correct this unintended Monopoly through creativity Rec 5749 will give users the choice of the wallet they have installed rather than defaulting to the first injected this restores creativity to the wallet space and will also give diverse more freedom when designing a user experience you don't have to D to one specific am I coming back in and out uh you know and so I I encourage you to just looking for feedback and do I should I swap all right we'll swap perfect can you hear me now hey there we go I'm back so I hope you check that out because I think creativity like this EIP can solve any problem that we have because a creative idea or Vision can help set your Project's North Star they can put you on a path that you never thought possible brand confusion Echoes out the window the moment you are creative and wildly different from the rest of the noise it can give new users a fresh and interesting way to understand web3 and help bring them in the pitfalls of iteration can also be applied to hiring which is why I encourage you to not iterate but create Foster and build a team of unconventional skill sets bring in those creative thinkers who will help Drive the storytelling of your brand or who can think of a new user Journey or even a new product feature out of left field because when you were able to spark creativity and effectively communicate what makes you special to others that is when we see true Innovation and adoption in the space which brings me to my favorite of the soft skills we need more of in crypto connection now humans by our very nature are looking to connect with things we want to connect with other humans from person to person but we also want to connect to ideas so frequently in crypto we talk about use cases and road maps but what we don't do is craft the story behind our projects we are letting others like the media tell our story for us frequently to our detriment or we have to lean on hard skillers to do the storytelling for us this results in Project descriptions like this an intent-driven privacy-centric protocol designed to enhance Discovery and settlements now I wrote this down I memorized it and I just had to read it off this just now because it just feels like a string of words mushed together and I work in this industry I can only imagine what someone outside of the space takes away from a description like that okay yeah that that tracks and this is certainly a place where we can use soft skills to storytell when explaining it to our mothers because as it stands right now that description is simply telling you what that product does they don't show you the superpowers that it gives you think how much easier that description could be to understand if we hypothetically say okay we're going to start with a privacy problem right because everyone understands the big Tech is invading us and from there we'll probably highlight it connects to people quickly and then exchanges assets without having to wait a long time like with a bank so in essence we could go from story uh from jargon to something like our project without invading your privacy through something like a credit check or verifying your identity find someone that has the asset or ask that you want it then connects you exchanges that and you don't have to wait for five days for it to settle like with a bank now obviously this is a bit wordier and a bit rough because I am not the Storyteller for that brand but you can see how this story gives you something to latch on to and starts to paint a picture in your mind and it's not just related to projects where we need storytelling I think it's in moments like this where we put ourselves in the public eye it's why everything I am saying here has been scripted it's been refined edited and rehearsed nothing here is off the cuff all of this is a crafted story except for the bike change that was on the Fly foreign because ultimately I want you all to connect with me Vince not only as a brand but as a human and also to the ideas that I have storytelling also applies off the stage on a peer-to-peer basis I tend to go to a lot of crypto conferences and at them I will go to booths and I will stand there and I will look at the collateral I will look at the screen I will look at the banner I will look at the swag and I will look the person in the eye and nothing happens they don't engage with me and I ultimately leave and that's alarming right I mean it happened to me here multiple times because if we can't connect with each other inside our crypto bubble how can we be expected to connect with those outside of it this is why when we staff our booths I always try and pair up a soft Skiller with a heart Skiller I try to actively deploy my staff in a way that makes tactical sense this way I have that soft Skiller there to start the conversation and communicate and then they have that heart Skiller there to turn to when needed the reverse holds true as well if that hard Skiller is hitting a wall trying to communicate they can always tap in that soft Skiller for an assist because their skill sets complement each other I also tell everyone that I don't know is a valid answer because I want to empower everyone to not be afraid of hitting a wall of not knowing the answer look I mean you all know this this Tech is hard and we are on the bleeding edge here and I would rather someone leave with a positive personal connection than leave not having engaged with anyone at all because this Tech Will Change day over day hour over hour like if I'm honest but that memory of that someone that you chatted with at the MU Booth will hopefully live with you for years now the idea of Storytelling weaves through all of my points that I'm making today the story of increasing the amount of soft skills you employ around communication creating instead of iterating and of course connecting with others now there's a chance you might be sitting there I mean like Vince what what what is all this are you just saying we should hire you absolutely here is my Twitter my DMs are open best offers only I'm kidding Coastal left Brian please don't fire me what I am saying is that I want you to look to the soft skills for the challenges your product faces question if those challenges have a solve from communication creativity or connection I hope that you'll also look to those team members you have that have a spark of a soft skill and help them to grow and Foster that at the same time with subsequent hires look to their soft skills instead of just the number of PRS they can submit in a given week in crypto we are taking risks all the time on moonshots and I want you to think of the soft skills as an investment in you and your project because sure you might not see an immediate return on that investment I mean hell you might get that investment wrong however on the flip side if that soft skill turns into a force multiplier that ultimately onboards the next zillion users and my mother into crypto that it only benefits us all at the start of this I said that words have power and I truly believe that they just have to be the right words at the right time to make a difference and they don't have to be a lot my favorite example of this is when King Philip II of macadon was conquering Greek city-states in 300 BC he was just left right and said are conquering he sent a message to Sparta and this message read if I invade Laconia you will be destroyed never to rise again and the Spartan response was simple if it's like so many ideas and thoughts and inspiration and words packed into a single two-letter word in crypto we always say oh you know we're going to bring more crypto users more users more moms into crypto and we we put it out of ways right we we're like oh it's in the future this is the internet and that now is 1996 right and mass adoption is a ways away I disagree I think the time to develop the teams that are creative and inventive who will ultimately onboard the next billion users into crypto quickly is now but only if we invest in the intangibles of the soft skills thank you so much everyone [Applause] [Music] [Music] this is [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you all right last session of the day and it's gonna be an exciting one at that to close out the day we have an interesting panel how can blockchain help connect the next billion I'd like to welcome our panelists Anda salima Gaben and Rajesh along with naroa as moderator just a couple of quick words on naroa naroa zuratula it leads the mapping and Tech work for Giga UNICEF prior to UNICEF neroa lived and worked in various company lived and worked in various companies in Kenya from a startup that is trying to change the world understanding agriculture to a non-profit empowering local entrepreneurs through access to finance neuro holds in Masters in electrical engineering from Stanford University and a masters in telecommunications engineering from ehu upv neuro is also a proud EF fellow please join me in welcoming our panelists and naroa foreign can you hear me yeah perfect thanks thanks so much for joining us today especially I know it's the last session of the day so we appreciate you being here and we actually have a quiet interesting and diverse panel here so I'm sure that you'll enjoy the time as as it tells us we'll be talking about Giga and about how blockchain can help connect the next billion but what what's Giga it's a partnership between itu to connect every school to the internet and every young person to information opportunity and choice by connecting schools we in one hand equip young people with the skills they need for their future and at the same time we build digital economies for the communities that are around are around these schools there are many connectivity initiatives out there I always say that what's different and unique how Giga compared to others it's that we use data and Technology to make the whole process more efficient and more transparent in particular blockchain Technologies and that's that's why we are here today the the panelists will have a discussion about the blockchain applications they are building and that they are implementing and deploying in different countries the applications go all the way from staking nfts tokens smart contracts and others and with further Ado I'm Gonna Let each of them introduce themselves okay great uh hi everyone my name is andang NABA I serve of the chief of operations at the UCT Financial Innovation Hub where we translate the latest academic research into novel blockchain applications before this I served as an analyst at convergence Partners a TMT focused private Equity Firm uh focused on sub-Saharan Africa and great to be here thanks thanks and great to be here also thanks for inviting me I'm Rajesh I'm one of the founders of launch nodes and our whole reason for being is to help people become self-sufficient ethereum stakers so um it's great to be here and we're looking forward to sharing more um hello everybody my name is Salim Abba I'm a state Council um from the directorates of science technology and Innovation which sits within the office of the presidents of Sierra Leone I mainly well over the past two or so years I've been leading the project coordinator coordination as well as some of our policy work thank you and my name is Harman kaina I work as the blockchain lead for Giga at UNICEF uh thank you so much nice to be here um so Herman let's start with you you you work at UNICEF and UNICEF is not the type of organization that people would think of that's working on blockchain that's building Tech products and can you tell us a little bit about giga's tech team uh how it works what type of work you do sure so um Giga sets uh inside the office of innovation at uh at UNICEF and we're a kind of small team of like 40 people approximately and we operate kind of like a startup within the UNICEF itself um are there any like blockchain developers in the room maybe could you guys stick your hands up yeah so uh we're we're growing our Tech Team uh we actually have a position open right now uh if you want to come talk to me afterwards um but uh basically so far we have uh connected approximately a million students uh to the internet uh and the challenge that we really face is how to connect the next the next billion so to do that we see uh blockchain sort of adding value in a couple of different ways uh the first one is uh we estimate uh needing approximately 428 billion dollars to connect the world schools so our biggest sort of uh well our first sort of use case is moving all this money around and getting it to the right places in a way that's transparent and efficient and uh and affordable um the second option that we see uh value in is uh automating payments for connectivity so using smart contracts and monitoring connectivity in schools to automate payments to internet service providers um then we also focus on nfts so at the beginning of this year we launched uh the un's largest nft collection called Petra kingdoms um where all of the royalty uh goes to uh front Giga goes to help support Giga uh so that's that's that's kind of a neat thing uh and we're also working on follow-up projects uh for that uh that particular project um and we're also investigating um if like Innovative financing uh solutions to pay for the operational expenses of connectivity so uh one of them is connectivity credits uh another one is where we're looking at uh using staking to allow people to uh to stake their their eth and generate uh returns for uh for paying for connectivity um but basically we work with governments um to try to convince them to give us like a regulatory sandbox to try these things out try them for the first time so that we can scale them up later and deliver some impact um so far the most of the projects I mentioned are sort of in the MVP stage um and we're seeing some promising results so we're looking really forward to uh to making an impact in the coming years good perfect as you said I think for the ones that for people that are not familiar with UNICEF we operate in one 90 countries around 190 countries and something special or different about assets that we work very closely with governments that all the product solutions that Hermann was describing we work closely with governments to implement them in country and that's where salima you come from the other side of the person where you see to think the government of Sierra Leone and so I'd like to tell us a bit about this unique or different uh directorate of Science and Innovation that you have in your country our setup how it impacted the Innovation ecosystem in the country and the work you do sure so the directorates of science technology and Innovation was established by the current government in 2018 and the main mandate is really to leverage the use of science technology and Innovation to support the government deliver on its National development plan so by that we work across various sectors and we've all also developed a 10-year National Innovation and digital strategy which is our 10-year plan to digitally transform Sierra Leone and we focus on three key areas which is digital economy digital identity and digital governance and as I said because of where we sit we really in a space where we're in a position to work across various sectors that includes the private sector we work with various private sector Partners in Sierra Leone out of Sierra Leone to really support the development of our local ecosystem because one of our aims is to really establish civilian as an Innovation Hub one of the works that we've done is to kind of work with the private sector to develop an ecosystem mapping of the Innovation sector in Sierra Leone so being able to know what the different services and players are within the field or the place where we work is we work with our public sector partners that is all the different government Ministries departments and agencies basically supporting them in the different work that they're doing seeing how they can use Science Tech and Innovation to really achieve the government's agenda and also finally one of the key areas where we work is our International Development Partners we work with various International Development partners and one of our main Partnerships has been with UNICEF from the start the UNICEF Innovation office in Sierra Leone has been really key to the work that we've been trying to do and one area where we've really worked closely is to support the government in its educational agenda which just really the flagship of the government's human capital development agenda with um we so with that we've really worked on various projects um such as Giga which we're talking about today we've also worked on other um actually even before officially Giga was announced we worked with UNICEF to map the geolocations of all the schools in Sierra Leone so that was really key to us in Lane that found the groundwork for the work that we're doing now with um Giga but then one of the other projects that we're really also proud of that we've worked with the UNICEF Sierra Leone's on learning passports which is really a partnership with Giga they kind of go hand in hand so that's kind of sort of the work that we do within the space in Sierra Leone and so we're really happy and excited to be here and we'll be talking about some of this work in a little bit before that now we want to uh can you still hear me yeah we want to announce an exciting project that we've been working on for the last year in partnership with the ethereum foundation under Rwandan government it's the first time that we are publicly speaking about this so we are quite excited about it and yeah they make it it's yours fantastic thank you for that now um so yes um we have a video coming up very shortly which kind of explains more about this project um so rather than kind of spoil that let me just give you the outcome and the outcome is that Rwanda now has a solo staking infrastructure which means that it can use staking rewards from staking ethereum to fund internet connectivity in schools and that's a world first and pretty exciting um so yeah that's that's been great um the other thing I'd like to say is we're really narrow to stage where the proof of concept's been running for a year it's been successful we've seen the outcomes from that and we're inviting the broader ecosystem to get involved so we want our competitors to get involved we want um you know developers we want other people involved in the ethereum EK system to take up the Baton now and to move this forward um you know no one entity can do this gig has been fantastic in kind of capitalizing the whole program we've had support from the ethereum foundation and elsewhere but um you know 50 of schools in the developing world don't have internet connectivity right now there's thousands of there's billions of dollars staked on the ethereum network at the moment um some small fraction of that could certainly help change change lives so that's really what we're what we're saying here um and I think the final piece really is to say the technological aspects of this were one part of the project but really the other challenge was um you know bringing people together bringing people along this journey two years ago there was no such concept as ethereum staking it hadn't been launched um and yet here we are um effectively two years on and the random government has done something which no other country has done so far and that didn't happen by accident you know it there's been a lot of kind of negotiation workshops working groups education sessions briefings um to bring us to this point and in particular um leadership on the ground from the leader of of Unicef in country and Rwanda Juliana has been amazing um Minister ingebera has also driven this project forward we've had support from the Ministry of Education Finance um the Central Bank of of Rwanda um and ICT and really everyone coming together and working collaboratively has made this happen and it's a model now that we hope we can um scale across the world can I ask a quick sort of follow-up question about that so I'm I'm sure all of you guys are wondering like why is this so complicated like staking just makes sense right like why why aren't we doing this so maybe can we talk a little bit about like why why is it so complicated to do this in in a country like Rwanda yeah so so again two years ago staking wasn't even a thing and if you imagine the complexity of getting anything changed in a country it's it's pretty difficult I think Salim has probably got more insight into you know how to make that happen than anyone else here but um you know it does take regulation to change it does take people to really grasp the concept and you know you know we've been immersed in this for years no doubt a lot of people here will have been involved in ethereum and other blockchains I'm explaining that to people and taking them on this journey isn't a straightforward thing it takes a lot of Courage a lot of um you know bravery really to to kind of adopt this as a concept and to take it to government departments and say this is something we want to do so a lot of that time hasn't been um installing servers and putting software on on devices it's been around the table and and with your support and narrowers and others so that's that's really why it's been complicated and I'd say that it's also linked to the regulation around crypto whether a given country it's allowed to hold crypto not um so link to that for this first payload and after many back and forth we decided that we're gonna have the node hosted on the cloud instead of locally tell us about the way of this decision and maybe elaborate also on the pros and cons of each of them like a locally hosted versus cloud yeah so that's a that's a great Point um along this journey there have been a range of kind of key decision points what um ethereum client do we use where do we want the infrastructure to be hosted should it be Cloud should it be um you know on-premise somewhere um and I'll start by saying our whole philosophy kind of aligns very closely with the ethereum foundations which is geographic diversity is key and having diversity of kind of software client is is really important as well we don't want any like we don't remember to be too many people hosting in one particular place that's that's our strategy um and the reason I stress solo staking is so important is because it makes people self-sufficient which again is part of our our approach um so for practical reasons for Speed reasons um for resiliency reasons it made sense to use the cloud for the proof of concept effectively longer term we want every school to have a node we want everyone to be um you know community being able to stake and and run their own infrastructure um and that would be a fantastic achievement when that happens long long wait there but I agree with that and salima she's one of the first ones starting uh the journey towards that that goal where is Sierra Leone you are actually setting up or in the process of setting up a lot I know that that's locally hosted um yeah so I think we've gone um in terms of the proof of concept but I think we've started with looking at a physical um hosting instead of cloud but I think um this is where collaboration and one of the things actually we've also tried to do is an engagement with some of our other government around who are also doing the same thing we've had a couple of engagements with the Rwanda government and the point is to really learn learn together learn lessons and making sure that you know we're all working towards the same goal um so for us as I said we've really looked at how we could um lay the initial groundwork for hosting a physical node as you she said obviously we won't also want to be in the position where every school does have like a physical notebook also but we're not at that place yet um looking at um the different challenges that we face so one of the things which we wanted to do was looking at the possibility of Hosting notes with um specific um internet service providers so for the initial preparation for that we've kind of sourced um the hardware that will be required we have an agreement in place with one of our internet service providers who would also be one of the service providers actually providing connectivity um to the school um I think we're in the last stage of preparation and we're hoping I think would have been the very near future to officially launch uh um physical um node and yeah fantastic no that's great and another thing that we're hoping is going to be the norm moving forward is our internet service providers taking crypto as well as payment but because you know that what part of the hurdle right now is you'll have to convert from ethereum to fiat currency to pay for a service you know we've we've had conversations with isps where they've said no we'll happily take payment in ethereum and that I think will be the future as well yeah not um I think same as sincerely under conversations we've had with our isps has been very um encouraging I think um where the conversations now is at is with our other government Partners uh public sector Partners looking at the national the bank of Sierra Leone who regulates that space and the ministries of finance and that kind of sort of thing just making sure I think um I think the initial conversations around the legislative framework to do this kind of sort of thing I think that's been the areas where we've been having the more conversations around but then also look making sure we have the infrastructure as well um ready for that yeah and another thing to mention I think is the road map for ethereum clients means that it will be a lot easier to host nodes you won't need you know the resiliency and and the you know to store full versions of the blockchain in the future so again it's going to get easier and easier for people to host their own nodes which is fantastic what I find really interesting to to sort of hear is uh it seems like everybody's kind of on board with this uh everybody like thinks it's a good idea but still it's like so difficult so how do we how do we talk to governments and help them understand and help them shape their policy I don't know salima do you have any insights in in into that yeah as a government representative um I think it's it's a combination of several factors in terms of um why we currently don't have it and what can be done I think um for me where I see I think that it's about highlighting where the opportunities are um with this I think first of all the opportunities with regards to blockchain especially when we talk about um Giga and how that couldn't be utilized for smart contracts and used to um improve the relationship with internet service providers provide better accountability and monitoring and transparency I think highlighting those opportunities uh are great in terms of getting everybody on board but and I think also beyond that there's a bigger opportunity with regards to most of these emerging Technologies when you deal with the government or traditional governments such as hours my thinking it's about [Music] um opening up the space for learning I think it's about improving the local expertise within uh different nations and it's about improving awareness so one of the things we're excited at the SDI about Giga specifically is looking at because we we believe in leveraging the use of the most high-tech technology you can find as well as the most not low-tech but the most useful for our current situations looking at we also utilize things such as ussd and those kind of platforms because we consider our local context issues such as electricity and internet penetration rates so all those are important but with the gigger and blockchain and possibly even looking at cryptocurrency to ask payments the opportunity for this our government is to Pilot these Technologies within a very small space which will hope then raise awareness allow us to learn about the these emerging Technologies then use the data and evidence to really develop really effective legislative and Regulatory Frameworks that would better support and enhance this so we want to get ahead of the pace we know um these Technologies are coming whether we like it or not so the opportunity with this is really to provide a pilot where we can really use this as an opportunity to learn much more about it which would then enable us to better regulate regulate it so I think that's where the opportunities and the learnings and it's about really showcasing that to get everybody on board exactly and showing its value right one of them challenge to say I don't know if it's a challenge but usually face it that we have to communicate super technical and complex work to to people that are not technical or don't necessarily understand the technology and what happens sometimes it's that if you mention the word crypto smart contract to someone that doesn't understand it then they get scared and they just say no we are not on board so the moment you start proving it starting small and making small things and small steps then I think they understand the value and they start becoming more comfortable uh I guess from outside as well on on your point coming from an emerging market like South Africa to drive cryptocurrency adoption you need to meet them halfway so one of our PhD candidates has actually developed a solution where you can send cryptocurrency via ussd and SMS we'll start looking for use cases we've spoken to one ISP who actually approached us saying oh this could actually work dating people and communities pay for for internet connectivity so those conversations are still ongoing but that whole project made us realize that we can't just ideate on silos and think you know people from South Africa or from Sierra Leone whatever who made that software we need to go to them and bring the solutions to them you know be even with speaking about blockchain and everything they don't even have to necessarily know that there's a blockchain in the background I always have this argument with people they'll be like you have to educate everyone about blockchain and this and that but how many of us know how a light bulb works you know you just you turn it on how many of us know how our Acorn works you just turn it on so I think this this uh you know this view that you have to educate people about everything you want blockchain and this and that for them to be on board it is incorrect and we should rethink that and to be on board to to make everything work and we all know that ISP is usually for the mitc to go to cities to to run areas and it's harder harder to convince them to go to more remote Community Schools from your experience working with the private sector what type of incentives business models would need to to make them also go to places that maybe are not as easy to connect yeah I think you know there's obviously tax incentives that South Africa is now put into place but one thing we looked at is this tokenization of The Last Mile infrastructure so maybe you could have a big private sector player private Equity Firm put the capital expenditure at the beginning and then resell that after three or four years when they refund life cycles now coming to an end to local communities you know and then the uh wherever you're able to get in the interim can then sort of subsidize the resale price so they may not need the large multiples that you need in terms of a general sale and why something like that would also work very well I know we once invested in a fiber asset in Ghana and a few other countries and we're struggling to now but we were struggling to sell it now to a third party because we could only sell it in the sort of the 25 we owned it but if we could tokenize that 25 we could start it to local isps we could sell it to people you know with who have extra money we're not just want to help other people but because the I guess the framework wasn't there yet we weren't able to do that so you know on your point as well how much was it 428 billion and I know in Africa alone it's 100 billion dollars we can't look to the financing mechanisms that we've done in the past to sort of solve future issues we have to completely rethink how we do it and things like blockchain and tokenization I think will be you know the the key to doing that I mean absolutely like nobody likes making Banks even richer right so nope not me no no definitely not anyone at this conference either that's something that egg itself is experience as well this organization and the linear token system that aware schools are granted a certain amount of tokens based on how difficult it is to connect them and then providers if they decide to go to schools that are harder to connect they get these tokens and they'll be able to exchange these tokens for a set of incentives um maybe one thing there is that again for these incentives you have to work with the public sector so I guess highlighting the necessity to work with all the players in in the in the market all the way from the private sector to the public and have them have conversations together good yeah I think as well Academia so from I now work at the University of Cape Town and it's a often there's a place that we don't consider so we really now translate this sort of academic research on my PhD Masters level to blockchain applications and I think we also need to come to the table now because you need a new way of thinking like I was saying a private sector company that's been making huge margins from selling connectivity for 10 to 20 years they're not going to change how they do it you know you need new people now to come to the table and challenge the status quo which is what we're trying to do at the Hub yeah I think I think that but I think that's a really interesting um sort of contradiction because on one hand we have to like rethink all these things and on the other hand if you want people to sort of join you on the journey you have to work with their systems and you have to you know make them understand that way and I don't say it as um Old World versus New World in the second way it sounds like you do I think you know big corporates are coming along for the journey now increasingly they're understanding what blockchain's about they're looking at their own proof of Concepts and Pilots um and and yes you know they've got other motivations potentially but um you know this is this is an opportunity for everyone the way we see it and and that you you work again closely with startups in the region more in general what are some of the trends around blockchain and around startups that you see in the African region uh so around blockchain we're now seeing less uh Financial sort of use cases so we're now looking at a decentralized data marketplace where data creators can actually sell their daughter to other people that could now be used maybe fun connectivity for example we also have an nft startup that is working with content creators to let them share Revenue based on their contribution to a work so he's particularly working with uh authors and wants to work with illustrators now so I write a chapter for a book you write a chapter four book and my tree gets more views will get remunerated more so those are some of the interesting use cases we're seeing demand the money one I explained earlier about the ussd cryptocurrency payments as well to send the financial side so it's quite an exciting space and I mean our hubs only been operational for about 18 months and we have six spin-up startups now let's just come from academic research which has been really beautiful to see maybe some people are in the universe Source some of these startups none you could share yeah I'll connect you guys yeah everyone following Trends before you spoke about some of the past work or work that Giga has been doing could you give us a sneak peek of what's coming next or what's next and some of the things that we are excited about for the next year yeah for sure so um the last year has really been about like building MVPs and talking with governments and getting them to allow us to do things um and I think we've made like a lot of Headway with that so for example we're now starting to roll out a product called gig accounts which will allow um payers for internet connectivity to monitor contracts uh get sort of real-time data about the performance of the connectivity at schools and then uh register payments for that so we're quite Keen to roll that out and what we're hoping to achieve over the next year for that is to start issuing our first sort of smart contract contracts I suppose so the the idea will be that an internet service provider would connect to school and then automatically receive payments if on internet connectivity is detected so that way we can make it way easier for internet service providers to to receive payments and uh reduce a lot of a lot of overheads so that's one of the projects that were we're quite excited about about progressing another one is we're building a sort of collection on top of our uh existing nft collection the the original nft collection Patchwork kingdoms that we that we launched was all about fundraising so you know you you purchase these these tokens you get a really cool sort of data driven uh art piece uh and the and the funds go to Giga to uh to to help Giga connect schools what we're building next is um a collection where we will create an nft for every single uh School in the world um and really not put the focus on uh fundraising or raising as much money as possible but instead sell these to people who care about the school communities get them in the hands of the people who actually support these schools and create a sort of gamified platform where we will reward uh rewards people for contributing data about these schools so we'll create a crowdsourced data system for collecting School data and the idea is to make the the largest sort of decentralized School database in the world yeah and addresses many interesting questions such as if you are crowdsourcing this data what's the consensus mechanism that you'll be using to approve or to ensure quality of the data that you are gathering and this type of like interesting new questions that we didn't have before yeah absolutely and I've I've learned a lot at this conference about uh about ideas like that so it's been super useful uh to uh to to join this conference and and learn more about that uh yeah and there have been a follow-up we we've been saying that sometimes it's like it takes a lot of work to to make changes within the government or make a government bodies to to innovate UNICEF it's not a government but it's also a huge organization that has many many processes in place how is it to work in this type of things within UNICEF um yeah you're you're right uh it's it's a very big organization I think um I come from sort of the world of startups where things go super fast and You Break Stuff uh and you try again so that's certainly that's certainly a big difference but I I always like to sort of compare the the progress UNICEF makes as like glacial so it's like super slow but it's Unstoppable so I think UNICEF uh opens a lot of doors um yeah we're we're talking with central banks and Ministries about implementing some some real change in the in countries and we're finding it really difficult to do that so imagine being uh being a startup and trying to get a get a meeting with a central bank uh Governor to to approve your well-intended sort of crypto project so um yeah so I think UNICEF as an important role to play there in sort of opening the doors for these kinds of things opening the minds of uh of governments and um yeah and allowing a lot of other startups to to then make some real progress and selling any advice on how to yeah maybe interact or get that difficult meeting that everyone was talking about and yeah um yeah sure and I think um one of the things I would say looking at the model that we have in Sierra Leone is I think uh not it's not just because I work there but I think having uh institutions such as like the directorate of science second Innovation and Sierra Leone has been really key um I think especially when you work within uh developing countries such as Sierra Leone where science second innovation has not been a big player and the local expertise is not there I think one of the if I would advise I think one of the key things would be for each government to have um its version of a dsdi as we call it because I think it really um cuts across and really enables that partnership to develop um I think we're lucky within the SDI to sit to us we call play with various different individuals we have lawyers we have our developers we have our data scientists who have our policy advisors and all of these individuals that and enable us to do what we do and I think that's why we were able to really form an effective partnership with UNICEF Sierra Leone and The Innovation office I think in terms of having one of the few like Innovation work plans and work plans out there with UNICEF I think that's been really key and I think we kind of play the role with UNICEF off we develop our projects together we establish our goals and then our dsdi plays the role of fronting with the governments on behalf of um of USF so we would go to our government partners and I think also the fact that we sit within the Office of the President of Sierra Leone gives us a lot of Leverage in terms of when we go and knock on those doors like the National Bank of Sierra Leone to say together with UNICEF there's this great projects which we want to try out deals with blockchain and crypto could you please um you know engage with us with us on this and they're willing to do that so I think for me what's really important is having that very high government and political buy-in into these kind of things and then and even with us even though we do we have our challenges but I could just imagine having to do this or trying to do this in countries that don't have that high level government buying that could um potentially be very difficult so I think um one of the key things that have been useful to us or have enabled us have a lot of the progress that we have is having that um seat and being able to interface with UNICEF with our government development partners with the private sector with other International Development Partners so being like in the middle of all of that and being able to coordinate it I think that's been one of the key things which are more than maybe to learn from and replicate in other places yeah it's interesting we met with the Colombia team earlier this week and we were talking about the types of things that we could do together how to start working in different aspects that we're discussing and what we're told is that here it's actually quite people because they don't have this type of coordinating body that you have in Sierra Leone what they were telling us is that there are Ministry of Education Bank Ministry of ICT that each of them work on their own and that it's difficult to coordinate the work across all of them and I think maybe just a quick nugget why they go to be interesting actually so the chief Innovation officer of Sierra Leone who effectively leads a dsdi is also the current minister of basic and Senior secondary education and a lot of our projects as I mentioned do deal with education so I think that gives us an added leverage in terms of really being in the critical space to be able to coordinate all of these activities so yeah yeah so I like to learn definitely and it's been we've been working with you for many years now and I think that the things that we've achieved it wouldn't have been possible otherwise um maybe as follow-up questions to both of you what would be the main opportunities that you see with blockchain in your context yeah from tokenization like I spoke about earlier we're also looking at blockchain actually for dynamic Spectrum sharing because in South Africa a lot of the spectrum that's owned by the large MLS but and the small players don't have enough Capital to obviously partake at the auction but there is sort of time during the the day where Spectrum isn't that used by the big mnos so we're looking at now using blockchain for dynamic Spectrum sharing with an ISP in a small town like grahamstown where I went to high school can now use Spectrum from 10 pm to 5 a.m you know at a lower cost than what the sort of use it during the day so that's one interesting use case we're looking at it I guess in this context yeah Thinking Out Loud every possible made to do something similar also with pricing for connectivity depending on apply something similar to that yes so the pricing now would uh be dependent on how much the ISP would get the Spectrum for and obviously when it's underutilized this pricing would be less so I guess that's the keyboard inside it's still very early stages the government announced it a few months back and we just now started writing a few concept papers to see what we could do but that would be the model but we're hoping we can move forward with it and yeah let's say from my side I'm very much kind of immersed in the world of staking and just the possibilities that every individual can be supporting this network and can gain rewards from doing that so whether it's a small community or a school or a project for climate change we just see the march of Technology enabling that more and more so we're working with a range of entities who want to use staking returns for different things the beauty of this model as opposed to traditional kind of philanthropy is that you can put your money on a node use that node for good and then take your money away later and but it do other things with it so it's not a case that you have to donate and your money's gone forever and I think that's quite appealing when the you know the need for capital for some of these projects is so vast so yeah there's lots of exciting kind of technological developments we're just excited to be part of it and then as you said maybe it's not huge values but you can start Distributing and decentralizing this hosting and each school could have one load where the the revenue maybe it's not huge but enough maybe to pay for internet in the realm School absolutely and and like different models as well so we touched on liquid staking for example right now it doesn't have to be the case that every school needs 32 ethereum um for its own school or multiples thereof there could be you know liquid staking across Rwanda or um South Africa or Sierra Leone and different entities have different amounts but they all gain staking rewards so there's a lot of different avenues that this could progress through anything you'd like to add any of you um yeah so I think the the biggest opportunity I see is in um moving all this money around uh so um paying for internet connectivity in countries that may uh have like a lot of corruption or something like that I think blockchain can really provide a little transparency in that and a lot of fairness in that uh so I think I think that's a that's a huge opportunity um yeah I think um going off especially with the smart contracts and the real-time connectivity monitoring I think um for us those have been really exciting on both ends I am the private sector specifically also excited about the facts of having a smart contract then there's no discrepancy of whether how much connectivity did I actually provide and that back and forth exchange so um that's been exciting on the private sector space because actually so we have been in the process of connecting some of the schools which currently have connectivity to that platform to be able to monitor um in real time but then from a government's perspective it's also very important for us being able to really hold isps accountable to their service contracts that they signed because before if you have no way of really monitoring the connectivity that they provided you're just really paying out without being absolutely sure that what you're paying for was um the delivered so for a government perspective that's been really important to one of the the areas which we're really looking forward to exploring a bit more yeah yeah absolutely because usually what's the case is that uh for a lot of these schools the connectivity is paid for by a government or you know units of country offers or something like that and then one person is responsible for monitoring 150 schools or a thousand schools and it just becomes impossible to sort of check whether the connectivity is actually delivered and the schools themselves have no negotiation no negotiating power with their intern service providers so um yeah one of the products that we're offering to schools is this sort of application that they can install themselves on their Network that will provide us with real-time internet connectivity data so it's really a tool for them to sort of take control over that and allow a huge body like UNICEF to put their weight around making sure that internet service providers are providing the connectivity that schools deserve I hope that you learned as much as I did maybe if you can go to the yeah to the next slide too many tabs open yeah let's try the video now um yeah yes you say that if any of the things that we spoke about seemed interesting to you uh whether you are interested in joining our team working with us scan that QR code and sign up so that we keep you in our Network and we can count on you in case you need your help and yeah the last thing is that we have a video that we wanted to show it's not appearing here though so I don't know if someone would um maybe you need to get out of presentation model technical issues as that's not fair there it is okay for some reason play cool and this is a video about the sticking work that we've been doing in Rwanda as we said before this may seem a bit too basic for this audience but that's because as I said before we have to communicate these technical things to non-technical audiences so this is one of the examples of how we need to talk on a simple way to communicate the idea is a global initiative to connect every school to the internet and every young person to information opportunity and Antigua is leading in the beginning Finance School internet connection foreign every school to the internet and every young person to information opportunity and choice Kika is leading Innovative models and mechanisms to finance School internet connectivity over long periods of time working in partnership with governments to build the right capabilities for the future Giga and the ethereum foundation are collaborating on an exciting and Innovative approach to fund School connectivity Tiga wants to use ethereum's taking as a new sustainable model to generate income to fight the long-term social impact blockchains like ethereum allow individuals and organizations to contribute to network security availability and processing power by staking funds while running their own loads within the network in return for providing this service participants and staking Rewards ethereum is the most widely used smart contract capable blockchain and is now a proof of stake blockchain which effectively eliminated their energy usage that was associated with its former proof of work model anyone who commits 32 either can benefit from staking new words this model of staking provides irregular rewards over many months and years enabling a wide range of different use cases that can deliver societal benefits and social impact from the money that is earned Nita is working with the ethereum foundation and the government of Rwanda to provide a fast example providing funding for school connectivity in Rwanda launch nodes is an Institutional provider of investment grade ethereum solo-stating products and services and was the implementation partner for this pilot project in Rwanda how does it work number one people and organizations that are interested in supporting screen connectivity we call social stickers commit either number two Giga steak by running valid data nodes number three the rewards generated from the nodes are used to pay isps on an
