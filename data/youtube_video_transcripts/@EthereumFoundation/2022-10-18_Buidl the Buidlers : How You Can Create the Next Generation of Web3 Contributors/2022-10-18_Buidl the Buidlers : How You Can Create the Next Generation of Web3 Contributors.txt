foreign [Music] thanks for joining our Workshop we are people of skilled it's real privilege to be able to speak at devcom and share with you what we're all passionate about sorry I'm short of breath I was just running from bathroom anyways um I think we will give you a little bit of introduction what this is about but pretty much we're gonna have two hours which are going to be quite uh quite easy going we thought of four different workstations that we will split into afterwards but um to begin with we'll look into the topic we're actually covering here and we assume all of you are interested in building the talent inside of your organization you're either a Dao operator an educator a leader or someone who's just really passionate about building talent in your Arc so that instead of always looking for talent from outside you can bring in some people who are maybe not as experienced at what three or not at a senior level and you can build them and help them evolve inside of your Arc becoming much stronger and happier and successful and also like contributing to your uh to your Project's overall success yeah so to begin with Chloe do you want to continue yeah yeah I'll give a little bit of like background context too about who we are um so I've been doing people operations in the crypto space for about four and a half years um and I often felt like an island in my project there's like nobody else who is working on people issues um and it can feel like wow these other people have a different mentality and I just wanted peers right so I found out that there were many other little Islands in other crypto orgs turns out we're in archipelago of uh people Ops staff in in various entities people with backgrounds and Aragon and git coin and giveth and people currently in pocket and giveth and um chainsafe currently in git coin and DX Dao and maker Dao and many more and so we try to bring together the wisdom of what's going on in the realm of like managing people in crypto it's pretty different right whether you're a Dao or you're a crypto company even if you have like a company structure still like half of your people are like crypto anarchists right so they don't really align to traditional structures of management um and what it takes to build a healthy team and maintain a healthy team is pretty different than in the Trad world so that's why we've all come together and we Face our problems uh as they arise we find we're often facing some of the same problems at the same times you know last year we all went through swells and Recruitment and trying to stay balanced and how do you do that ethically we've also gone through a lot of themes of compensation as the bear Market started to hit how do we build you know ways of assessing compensation assessing competency that is crypto native but really helps us budget well um so we've we've faced many of these themes many of these people problems that the space encounters and today we want to talk about building the builders biddling the biddlers and it's really timely I think because as we settle into a bear Market it's this natural time for professional development and growth within you're not going to be hiring as many people from external to the crypto space we can't just rely on you know yanking experts from web 2 anymore those people are expensive and out of touch sometimes and so there's this natural phase where in crunch mode in Bear Market times contributors who do stay they have to step up to the plate to take on new responsibilities new levels of professionalism and proficiency and it's up to us um as org leads Dow operators or even just contributors who care it's up to us to to help our organizations Foster that environment of growth right um so that's why we're here today and as Lenka said we've got four different breakout stations that we'll go into um at like 30 minutes after the hour um and we'll get into the description of those in a little bit but I want to take us through the life cycle of people operations do we have a clicker I don't think we do is anyone here helping us with the slides okay while we're waiting for technical things I want to just hear a couple shout outs like what's a big people problem that you notice happening in this space team Health you know rage quiz it could be anything anybody what kind of people problems are you seeing happen in teams yeah anybody has a people problem yeah go ahead um Fife dumbs fiefdoms yes yeah cool so power structures anyone else sometimes what people want to do doesn't align with the best interests of the Dao mmm good one anybody else sometimes people come for instant for incentives and when they dry out they can go elsewhere or they come for instant instant gain instead of long-term growth of the Dao heck yeah isn't that why we love bear Market building okay cool it slides now so so I think we'll just move to that um yeah so I talked a little bit about um what we do as the people Ops Guild where we come from um but yeah we we try to educate this space we try to educate ourselves and just be a Learning Hub together we're also available to anyone who needs some help if you have uh like consult that you want to request um we're happy to share our resources there's a few different educational resources that we have put out um some like worksheets and an article but we're also down to take people's questions and you can reach us um by scanning QR code there will be also more opportunities for that QR code later too okay so um I'm gonna stand up so I can see this hi okay so um this to me is the whole life cycle of people operations in the crypto space A lot of people are like what the heck is people Ops I don't know are you HR that sounds stuffy I hate HR what is this um but it's a little bit different in crypto orgs um so kind of at the at the entry at the 12 o'clock we have like the hiring process we have like the discussion of compensation and benefits which often is left out in crypto jobs um we have onboarding processes can be kind of hard in Dallas we have um role definition and work contracts work contracts can be super different in like non-legal entities or in very inventive legal entities um then we have uh you know the maintenance of culture once people are really in the org we got team building and and Vibe maintenance um we got IRL time with our teams these are all things that people operations do then we come to professional development opportunities for our contributors as they've already settled into their role and they need some time to grow how are they going to know if they need to grow performance review but it doesn't usually work in a typical managerial sense in all crypto orgs so a lot of us have some form of decentralized peer review um we also have conflict resolution as well as like one-on-one contributor support for Hard Times these are things that people operations provides um and some orgs have a code of conduct too and this is something that's attended by people operations staff so when we look at this whole life cycle I see the main things for contributor development being obviously the professional development and the peer review and sometimes actually a lot of the team building and team RL IRL time because you get a lot of educational opportunities in that time we're all here learning at Devcon right we're growing so much just by being here and so education and professional development and peer review are the main things that we're going to talk about today for contributor development and now I want to invite some of our guilds to speak about their experiences with that yeah hi guys uh I'm Lenka uh I'm basically not officially a people Ops person so I always feel like uh like a black sheep in this group but it's kind of fun because it's something I'm passionate about and I got close to this topic uh while I was working on a project together with my teammates we called it X-ray and we were researching the centralized Workforce we were researching uh the ways to best attract onboard and retain talent and the team I'm at in our language core unit it's called SCS sustainable ecosystem scaling at Maker Now and uh yeah the personal story I want to share here with you is actually my uh my time when I learned that the maker Foundation as you probably know is closing down and basically there's this completely new structure uh where people should kind of like sell themselves as contributors to the Dao and be voted in so it was like a really big change in transition but we kind of knew this is coming because our organization has always committed to like Progressive decentralization and when the time came I just want to share that the good experience I had from my orc because on one hand if you are a bit more centralized organization you actually do not want to have um like you don't want to mess with the process of Dao contributor onboarding so you actually do not want to influence or weight in when it comes to making this decision but I was super fortunate that we were LED some sort of a wiggle room where we could actually in a bit more peace and less stress figure out whether we want to transition into Dao how do we want to transition and basically we were allowed that space without the foundation kind of like abusing it it could abuse its power uh because they you know they have a lot of influence so basically I was in a situation where I had a bit more time and space to be able to figure this out and get the support from the foundation side but not the support of helping me get there but checking on me and hearing my my plans and figuring out what other work and important things I'm managing I'm leaving behind so that the transition is smooth so I think that's a very really good example to share with you if you are in a situation where you have a bit more startupy traditional organization and you're looking into how you want to decentralize so I think that was a really nice approach to offer that safe space but do not interfere with that and yeah the funny thing is that I used to do I was part of the marcom's team and I used to do like events management and community building and when I transitioned to the Dao I just said okay I want to try something new and I kind of had to figure out a way to apply myself and I became a Project Lead so completely different thing you can have some experiences but it's really nice this opportunity so that's what I wanted to share with you this short thing who do we have next [Applause] what so who wants to go next this one this one works um so thanks you for sharing that link uh I didn't prepare a share for you guys but I just want to tell you a little bit about who I am and what I do my name is Melanie I am a contributor to DX Dao I lead the contributor experience there I uh I have a traditional background in HR so pretty much my entire career I've covered all things under the HR Bella like recruiting compliance Performance Management all the way to talent management um and coming into a Dao has been a completely different experience but definitely learning these skills and like gaining that type of knowledge has given me the skill set to really help support my team helped support my squad um and my Dao so today I'm actually going to be at the peer review Workstation and we're going to be talking about building a culture of feedback introducing some mechanisms that you guys can use within your Dow um and then implying them to certain cases but that's a little bit about me and who I am and yeah thank you for joining awesome um yeah thank you all for being here I'm saf I do people Ops at git coin getcoin is an example of an organization I think we've like gone through all of the things that Louie mentioned earlier where we've grown really quickly we're up to like 45 full-time contributors in the past year um and uh yeah like I you know being the people a people Ops person I have gone through sort of like many of the the different pieces of the um the contributor life cycle um yeah like just doing a lot of hiring and uh when we were still in Bull times um and then realizing that there's a lot of work debt that we've accumulated um in the bowl times that we now kind of have to um uh yeah like set up a structure and processes for um so yeah I've been involved with like compensation creation I get coin um and today I'm just uh I'm here with Anna and Melanie at the peer review station yeah thank you hey guys thanks for being here with us I'm Anna um I work at chainsafe and I come from traditional web 2 space and came into web 3 two years ago with you know a bunch of tools from web2 can be implemented on web3 which is with different different outlooks and basically adjusting making it work as well so happy to be here and talk about that today um I'll keep it brief and short uh yeah the the very thing the peer review station is super robust and it's gonna be a great um breakout group so um Heather I don't know if you want to say just a little bit about um Recruitment and what you guys will talk about there hi um my name is Heather um and I'll be filling in for Francis at the recruitment station and I currently work for giveth um oh I forgot to mention like thankful for showing up I thought we would be speaking to a room of crickets but it's really awesome that there's like so many people in here that are like really passionate about this are at least interested um as we are and um a little bit about myself is I don't come from HR at all um yeah I'm I'm actually trained as a clinical I I also stutter so if I stutter during our breakout session that's just me but I come from a clinical mental health um counselor background so I got my Master's in that and I worked in an adult Psychiatric Hospital a locked unit for five years over in Denver and um it sounds like maybe it's not transferable but I think in this like wild west of web 3 there definitely is I'm like all right ah thank you um so I think through that experience um what taught me a lot about that is how important job satisfaction is to everyone you know it's like you have purpose in life if you have a job that you like you're probably going to be happy overall and I think it's really important that like we try and create like a curated workspace so like people show up excited for their jobs that they're having fun with their teens that they're laughing and if like you have that like good vibe going on in your team chances are you're going to be more productive you're going to have more retention and like people are going to be proud to like work for your org so um and I think the very part of that starts at the recruitment process where like I get to use my like detector and um just really choose like the outstanding candidates that can fit in your teams the best and I'll pass it on to Ben [Applause] uh hi everyone um so I'm Ben Perez I work at pocket Network um which is protocol for decentralized node infrastructure if you don't know what that is you can come and talk to me and we can talk about together I'm looking forward to meeting lots of you I'm an incredibly awkward person so if I look to hug you and you put a hand out for a handshake just warn you up front that's who I am um uh and yeah I think there's like lots of ways to think about web 3 but um uh one that I think about often is that it might be like the largest human re-education program since like the Industrial Revolution um I think the fact we're here today talking about different ways that we can develop people and upskill them is um it's a really important topic um the really important part I think um is to also not teach them all of the patriarchal power structures that are built into our existing Educational Systems um so I'm really looking forward to talking about that a little bit my station is about tactical development um it's with a bunch of experts who are working on educational programs that you can potentially work with so um yeah looking forward to chatting about that today okay so um we were gonna have you guys pepper out questions I think we'll still do just like five minutes of that because we want y'all to have a good idea of what workstations um you should go into um and I might I might just uh make a little a little bit of Distinction kind of between the workstations before I have you guys give questions so um as you know these three folks are are really focusing on peer review I think that one is pretty self-explanatory um recruitment you know for like a life uh recruiting for a lifelong um growth Journey for any contributor um and then the the two that I want to give you a little more Distinction on is um continuing education which is me and Lenka um and tactical development which has been so at our station we're gonna talk a little bit more about um The Learning environment in general we're going to talk about like brain plasticity and how to build like a culture of learning in your workplace we'll talk a little bit more about like the philosophical education around crypto the movement and what's important to know about that and how people can develop kind of as you know thought leaders in web 3 as well as just doing a good job of being in these organizations and what it's like to develop those skills to exist in a tower wherever else versus Ben station is more about the technical skills it's going to be about more tactical professional development stages and like he said he's got some visitors from various different developer education and other really tactical web 3 skill education cohorts so just so you know kind of the difference between those two um and before we go into breakouts um I'd love to just open up for a few questions these can be questions about like you know how do I um how do I execute um like a decentralized performance review you or how do I convince people in my org that this thing is important just I just want to hear a few questions from you guys so so that we can see you melding into these breakouts better you can just raise your hand and I come with the microphone okay hey I'm Alex a question from my side I come from web2 being in web 3 for one year I was fortunate to be in a webtool company that focused a lot on growth and HR and just helping us in in the company we're 200 people there coming in web 3 I see it's very focused on financial and Technical part and missing that Human Side I try to bring that in the company it's not easy how to do that thanks that's a great question um and honestly I think it it steeped in the culture um overall and kind of involves all of these aspects um but I would say if I were you I would go to either like continuing education or to peer review um I think those stations will have some some good answers for you okay do I see another hint okay sorry about that thank you uh really fascinating I have my question is how do you work during this bear Market as a team and avoiding people burning out or not delivering or you know just a number of human issues during this bear Market really it's very important to talk to your people and like actually hear out what's going on why it's going on and be it you know in 101 setting or through some sort of survey Anonymous or not and just hear your people and like come up with things that you can do together to you know address some of the issues we're all facing burnout Wellness you know disconnecting from your laptop that's a big one I think for everybody um I'll add to that so I like to call myself an emotional support human um um and I think um in at least in at giveth um what I do is like someone's having a hard time like I come in and like have a checkup call with them I'm like hey what's going on like your productivity is down like you seem kind of sad on calls like you're not showing up and it's like a private neutral space so we can just talk candidly about what's going on in their personal lives or if it's something internally going on um and then we like don't really dwell on the problem so much it's more like focused on Solutions and like brainstorming how they can like communicate better or um how they can like propose different ideas that they're kind of like struggling with so I I think it's it's especially in like this digital space it's really important to have like that human touch that we lose and when when we start losing that human touch is when people start feeling more isolated disconnected from teams I have one more answer to this question and then we'll pass it um I I think that it's really advantageous to have like connection moments in your team and like uh fun educational moments because sometimes when it's like not that fun to be at work it's more fun to be at school and to remember that like even in the struggle of trying to have a successful business that you're in a place where you're developing yourself so much and you're learning and that's thrilling and you are developing a sense of community um and so that's like something that we're going to talk a lot about how to do at the continuing education station I really think you could take your pick from any station for this question um but yeah just so you know okay thank you okay go ahead okay uh we are a traditional organization and we have recently kick-started our Progressive decentralization process uh and I can definitely see some resistance internally from some of the some of the colleagues uh from the perspective of being judged and seen by everybody else in the public basically uh because I mean yeah when you're in a traditional organization everything is a pack uh you're like you just work with your colleagues like you have your manager but when you're a contributor when you are working in building in public basically uh anybody can can look at what you're doing everybody can see your performance so there's definitely uh a mindset that some people do not have uh coming from I don't know 10 years of experience in a traditional organization how can we help them to to kind of be feel safe and and I don't know feel the not judged let's say yeah thank you for your question who wants to take this one hello um the first thing I would try and say to those people is it's okay um one of the things that I find um about the experience of being in web 3 is that it does challenge you but usually it challenges You by allowing you to see things that were sort of kept from you in the past um and I think it's really important that people understand that maybe challenges around their development or their capability are okay and that the conversations were happening before often behind their back um so I think it's like a really good healthy culture to have that transparency it gives people the opportunity to lean into developing themselves and growing I think the part that you're saying though which is really tricky is them feeling judged and I think often that comes from the way that we communicate with each other so I think communication is a huge part of what we need to do to create safe environments um and I think in this space if anyone's ever heard of non-violent communication by um Dr Marshall Rosenberg Rosenthal um yeah definitely great to pick up that book it will not only change like your how you communicate and like your job and life um but I think when people feel judged they tend to shut down and uh that's really easy to shut down when you're on a screen and like you can literally just close and not engage with your team so I I know we have another question coming too but I was definitely going to second that about clearly communicating I think it's important to communicate some type of road map maybe introduce like some phases into the transition um and transparencies of course really important as well so thank you I'll be really quick um it's mostly just a question that's clarifying I hope um Ben I think this is mostly directed to you um I I noted that Louis mentioned that this was kind of like the Tactical and or more technical skills I I'm curious if that's like really just geared to developers and like those hard skills in in the space or your Workshop will also cover some of the kind of like Frameworks that are necessary that may be for non-technical contributors yeah um uh so we will talk about one framework just a way to think about your development and your capability um our experts or our speakers are working on projects which are around technical skill development um but they will talk about two things they'll talk about what their project is and does as something that you can think about the way people are addressing these challenges and then they'll look to share their insights or expertise around what they've learned from that experience which would be generally applicable to any type of skill development but um yeah they're a little bit more on the technical side so I'm not not sure how that answers your question yeah okay right yeah and so anyone who's like really feeling that the non-technical um like skill Journey you could consider coming to continuing education too so and I think that means it's really time for us to start these uh these breakouts um we have a lot more people in here than we were expecting uh thank you all you guys are great um so we had originally made four different like groups of two tables um I'm gonna say you guys might need to pull more chairs around or you know if you even want to add a third table if the group is getting big that's permissionless in my opinion um but let's just name these sections so here we'll have peer review so staff Melanie and Anna will be at this huddle here um in the back we will have recruitment so Heather is going to be there um and then let's see up on this side let's do continuing education so that's me and Lenka and then this group of two tables here will be tactical development and Ben will be anchoring you guys over here um so I'm just going to change these titles here did you guys have fun in those breakout sessions yeah okay okay good I'm glad um so we'd love to hear uh just some learnings from you before we go into that I think we're gonna just do the very last portion of continuing education all as one group together um because it's about events it's about the importance of being here at these conferences at off-sites um and Lenka wanted to share a little bit about how being IRL at events really feeds into contributor education and development and then after that we'll uh we'll hear from you guys what you learned in your stations yeah thank uh thank you guys so uh we also have a couple of handouts so if you didn't get the physical copy you can just get in the QR and then you'll be able to get it the one that is continuing education we've been doing uh this is the last bit of it and it's basically talking about events because we're here at Devcon and we're also learning something new and sharing together so it's quite interesting to actually consider like uh in which ways do you think that having people as part of the event is helpful to your organization and then it's also interesting to think like not only one-sided that they're representing your organization but also at the same time that you help them to learn and grow so um I have actually like three examples I would like to share with you uh that might inspire you but I would also like love to hear from you or maybe you can try to fill that uh empty box in the table yourself later on so it kind of can inspire you like how can you actually use events for continuing education to both enable your contributors but also like gain something as a secondary product of that as an organization so of course I have this marketing background so this is very close to me and first thing I would like to share out of the three takeaways is that I have been hired to work for a distributed organization uh to to do community building for Europe and that's quite a large area too called cover I don't know where the noise comes from I think this one's better thank you so basically I was three months into my job and I went to my first in real life event I have barely met anyone from my team or I barely have been to like a real crypto Community event other than like what I knew in my area or something online so my first event was Eid Berlin and I remember that I was in 18 and I just remember I was like really unsure like am I doing the job well am I really building the community am I really connecting to people and by actually being like at the first hackathon I actually understand what does it mean to be part of ethereum community I also understood you know like all these practice rounds you need to to promote your project and like meet people who don't know about your project and you have to as we talked about like learning the basics teaching the basics to the people who never heard of your project that's like a quiet Challenge and it's like exercise you need to do over and over so after I came from eat Berlin I felt like okay I have met the people I actually work with I understand the community better I met other people in the same situation and I have the contacts I actually need to actually make some events and initiatives happen and it's so much easier than trying to cold call or cold email someone because you met them at the party and you were sitting on a van together at one of the closing events or something so this is really good for roles that are outwards facing Community roles BD roles marketing roles anyone who really need to connect with the other people other projects in the communities it's really really important so make sure to include this as part of their onboarding or a personal growth professional growth because it really makes an impact after those after that event I felt like a lot of things have changed plus I had a lot of motivation and like the energy to keep going forward because like it really recharged me so I think this works for many people as well that's the first option second thing is I was also managing events and you know I really do not like if people go by title or cxo levels Etc and everyone wanted room to speak but I never wanted to do that I was always looking for what is the opportunity and who would be the best person who could be the most knowledgeable on this and you know not always we had people who joined orc who are trained speakers but I always try to like combine the two and if they needed some support to be confident and comfortable on the stage I wanted to provide them with so it's a great way for people to like share their learning share their experiences like being with like-minded people and also like overcome this and through this process of starting at the small event coming to another one and another one they can actually become like thought leaders and many of the people as we call them maker Mafia have been starting on that little stage with their nervous City you know so just support people enable them to become speakers give them the courage give them the address rehearsal help them with slides help them with some practicalities and show them grow on the stage it's really awesome and what was the third example sorry oh yeah um so you probably love to talk about crypto and blockchain so you imagine that many people are in this space then imagine they have like some super Niche area they're nerding in and they're working with where can they talk to like-minded people at the events that focus on that specific Topic at that specific level so if you enabled them to go to these events they're not only are gonna like build a good Network where they can spare with these people but they also get to bounce ideas and maybe get inspired to like come with the next best product so I give you like a three examples of how I think like events were really helpful personally for growth for different types of contributors and how you as a as a person in your art who cares about building the talent inside could get inspired so hopefully this was helpful and it's very very good to consider events being a part of your budget or plan how you actually manage your team or how you grow your team of course there always has to be a good connection why are you sending this person and is this person going to appreciate and be happy for it but it's a really good thing to consider if you want to have a strong team that really enjoys the work that they're doing and is grateful to be in the arc that they are in so it was a quite a long example of why events are important but we're all here at Devcon we're learning together we're sharing together so I just thought to share this with you please don't be shy to ask your team lead or whoever it is whether you can go to the event represent the arc I think most of the time you meet with very positive response and you can always call back on lenka's examples right we have lots of examples of why this is important that's part of what we want to do in this Workshop is give you guys ways to argue for these elements ways to argue for professional development ways to argue for an event's budget ways to argue for time spent connecting um and educating right because sometimes it can be hard to prioritize that to budget in but there is absolutely a business case for it um and y'all whether you are org leaders being convinced yourselves or you have a leader you can go convince now you have some um tools and some some facts to share there and just so you know uh that like last prompt that Lenka responded to this is kind of a homework item that we left for you guys it's on the continuing education worksheet um and the prompts are like in what ways have you benefited from going to events and like what roles do you think benefit the most from that um so great Reflections to have especially continuing education folks love for you to reflect on that and any of you can scan the QR codes that we've provided it'll take you to the the notion site for the people Ops Guild and you can see all of the all of the worksheets that we have there um so with that I'd love to just hear from you guys like a little bit of what you learned um what were your takeaways uh from these workstations you were at and I can I can go around and pass Mike so which is the first workstation um we were the continuing education work stream and I guess one of the main takeaways um or one of the things that's going to stick with me is the idea of incorporating some sort of 80 20 rule into how we ask contributors to invest their time to allow them at least 20 percent of their time to go out and actually learn and contribute to other orgs and bring and actually and bring that learning back also just for their personal growth and development anything else to add I also just want to say continuing education station if any of you guys want to share what game you came up with you're welcome too uh I passed by a couple of stations but my first and main one was the recruitment one it was amazing thank you for that um so I learned how to like search for people with a spark of interest to like start a community from scratch because we can't do this alone we need to build Builders and we learned how to search for these people how to retain them how to keep them engaged and Inspire them to teach more people later which was which is like the seed that you plan to like grow everything after yeah that was amazing thank you well done Heather um thank you so much for the continuing education Workshop I was there to contribute but I think I actually gained so much that I was not expecting really I was just like oh just tune into this but I've been doing this for a couple of years mostly on my own um but I somehow have managed to gather contributors volunteers for now around me that are supporting me and I'm a bit emotional just thinking that I would have wished them to be here um with yeah Defcon because they've done so much to support me and I just wish that I can get to that point where I would bring them on and I want to include events for them I'm already like thinking where they should all go and grow in their own respective areas of interest because apparently they like to be around me already without me paying them but I think just you know I'm thinking like bringing merch back for them and stickers just something like just little Snippets but next time I want them at Defcon um with me and the second thing is the social Gathering hour I think that's such a brilliant idea um I think I was doing it sort of in a very loose casual way but to actually make time spend an hour to just connect share books share the latest crypto news together and just have that moment and to make time for that is what I'm going to be implementing moving forward so thank you so much and I might hire you for the social Gathering just to to launch it and do games together well this is why we need to pay Educators like you right and we need to put education budgets into our team so that like your project and the contributors who volunteer for you can come to these places and keep doing more of what they're doing um and be funded to do that cryptocanal by the way oh yeah who is are you there you go so he came up with a fun game for uh engaging with people uh and that would be to have their co-workers describe them as a cryptocurrency [Music] might be a little shady but uh all in good fun we promise and yeah just so thank you for the space thanks Peyton hi everyone I really want to say thank you to the peer review team it was a lot of interesting insights and a lot of interesting discussions the takeaway that I'm going away with is creating that safe space for people that people need to have a safe space just because we're in the web 3 world doesn't mean we're different and from IRL so creating that safe space that one-on-one conversation and building that human connection because that's what's most most fragile and yeah I thank you thank you thank you in the peer review Workshop we introduced a few Frameworks for the participants to use while giving feedback that's one thing that's really difficult to do it's easy to give positive feedback it's definitely difficult to give corrective feedback so we you know provided some Frameworks for them to use and I think it seemed really helpful unfortunately not everybody's here from our Workshop still but um that's just a little bit about what we did there okay one more game that I wanted to suggest is only to have fun it's a usual game but uh in our space like what did you do at Defcon and people who played the game like crazy in their hands if if they did the same anduin who have less people who did the same that's a cool one thank you um which station did we not hear from or is there anyone else oh yeah Ben oh there you hear glasses uh so I've been sort of synthesized all of the answers um partly because um I know being in um my session that I had massive fomo that I wasn't in the other sessions um uh so actually on our board we've got um the websites for the people who presented um I thought they were all fantastic lots of uh lots of great insights there so um we just encourage you on the way out to maybe uh take a screenshot of um of those websites that are uh that are up on the board they're doing really cool things and if you're looking to develop people or collaborate with uh experts in the space um yeah I think that's really great do we still have any of the Educators here okay yeah I know you guys finished early if there's not more takeaways I also have another question for you guys but I'm just gonna scan if anyone else wants to share another takeaway okay so I have a question for you guys um we would love to know uh for us as a guild what else would you guys want from the people operations Guild we've already put out some stuff on on uh on education and development here um and uh we've put out like a couple of resources online but we'd love to hear from y'all what's needed from a guild of you know decentralized HR Folk this will totally not come as a surprise that I I bring this up um in the sense that you're specializing in Louis and it hadn't hasn't really come up I think yet but um so we all work in remote organizations which um means that you cannot just go to up to like a person's desk for like two minutes and be like hey that thing in that meeting there was like this small disagreement or that misunderstanding I wanted to explain what that was so what happens is that tensions build up and so I think um having um all various forms of of conflict resolution and Remediation in Dao's is massively important and I was wondering if you could speak a little bit to that so I definitely can I'm very passionate about decentralized conflict resolution um I would love to call out that there is a group dedicated to this gravity down they run a cohort of conflict resolution education called the graviton training I think there's been two or three so far to date um and it's a great like discussion group on on topics of conflict resolution but I also really recommend um just being aware of trained facilitators they exist in the space I've collected a roster of like 10 of them that are ready to provide this service to various crypto orgs so you can always reach out to me um to get in contact with those people um and in general it's worth it to provide some training on um you know reflective listening um and safe communication and conflict resolution to your teammates you know if you're going to have this time for team training or for connection hour you could consider having a non-violent communication specialist come in you could consider watching some videos on restorative justice together or bringing in a practitioner to talk about this and guide people through some exercises because the whole point of conflict resolution in a decentralized sense is that it belongs to us it belongs to the people who are in Conflict it's not about some external judge or jury um it's about the people who are closest to an issue having the most agency and how to solve it and I know that that will stick well with your teams because most people who work in this space really value that that self-agency and decentralization I think that's a great point to make to bring in some type of external facilitation in our peer review Workshop you know we introduce these Frameworks of how to give feedback and but some people are asking what about if the person isn't receptive what if I'm talking to my founder and you know I'm nervous and I don't know how I can give him this feedback but he really needs to know and that's what we suggested bringing in some type of facilitation some type of mediation to help support you through those difficult conversations because like I said giving any type of corrective feedback is not easy you may also not be fully equipped or have the skill set to do that so leaning on someone else I think is also really really helpful thank you um so we have people all across Europe at the moment um and I would say in terms of diversity we're doing okay there's still some more work to do I don't feel like it's a focus in my organization at the moment um and I don't really know how to bring it up in terms of like Intercultural communication to have it like in a sensitive manner but also just like providing a place to work from people from all types of background um so I'm wondering like do you have any like type of information about that topic we have people Among Us in the guild who work in Dei diversity equity and inclusion and I would definitely defer to them um as far as providing resources on that um I think that you know a lot of times it's about like just advocating to the decision makers that this is important and worthwhile and if you can at least get them to say yes to a consultant then those Consultants are the are the best folks to put it in the right lingo you know they can they can speak to your um to your Founders on like the real business cases of having an inclusive environment they also can speak really sensitively to people that are just experiencing a hard time in the work environment um so like I'm not um a specialist in that myself but uh one of our Guild members Sandy has a background in Dei also a personal friend and colleague from git coin Gloria kimbolla um has done a lot of Dei work so I certainly would just like recommend those people and if you want to get in touch uh feel free to go through me if you need to thank you you okay that's that
