I'm RIA from layer X and University of Tokyo today I will talk about what we want to do in this Eastern Foundation grant so let's start with a quick introduction Obama team radio X is a broken startup based on Tokyo and we have two research projects one is a research on Casper and another one is zero change which is zero knowledge rock change based on substrate and Caspari research is supported by a certain foundation and the chain is supported by a webserie foundation so I'm working on the Casper project so I will talk about what we have down so far in this year and what we want to do from today from today yes so we started to get involved in Casper research from the formal verification project so we verified very fundamental lemmas and theorems of shimshi Casper including asynchronous safety state transition and very recently we finally finished the verification of minority detection or of shimmy see Casper which is kind of similar to the six confirmation Lu in Bitcoin but in CVC Casper it's much much more complicated so we think it's important to verify that it actually correct and then we eventually started to work on an academic paper of a shape see Casper where we try to systemize the knowledge of the current research with Casper and try to kick some mistakes in the white papers which is accepted in smaller academic conferences and these days I am more we are working on theory side including an analysis of the attack on a remedy ghosts and aliveness analysis of Casper FFG I will talk about these results tomorrow 1:00 p.m. so please join us if you are interested so what is our missions of this Israel Foundation grant the first mission is to continue to publish academic paper I think the current program in the Casper research process is the resources scattered over the internet so when you want to run by the Casper you should lead white papers in tourism is research post YouTube videos medium post and even Twitter sometimes so this results in next raishin that to catch up Casper research is very hard and there is a very very high entry barrier into the research community especially for a bit separated community like Japan and also there is very very little parental walk by academia I mean Casper is like an consensus in the wild for academic people so there's very few people working on Casper for the academic walk so in my opinion yes Casper research is ongoing but we need some systemized papers for the checkpoints of the research I think the biggest merit of publishing academic papers it's simply that we can get more people working on the research you know top conference fabrication get attention of the professor's PhD students masters postdoc so they might get interested in Casper and they might want work on that currently Casper research is mostly from inside of in certain communities so there's no academic work on that in another merit I think is the peer review system in academia encourages you to write a paper in a super super understandable way because in most cases the levels of conferences does not exactly working on the same topic so this allows you to write a paper which is understandable without interaction this is I think it's super important for people who are not continent in English conversations like Japanese communities another mission for us is to be a layer one research hub in Japan so the current status of the research community in Japan is a bit it's not that big and there's only a few core devs and researchers in Japan I think there's two reasons one reason is in Japan there's no crypto giants like forked out divinities who likely to give monies developers and researchers as a result in Japan there's little opportunity to walk as a Broxton researcher through time and you know there's no interim 2.0 team in Japan another problem is there's no top conference publication from Japanese universities about rock chain so this does not encourage students to welcome coke upon the Broxton research and when I say this to my friend we once say to me that you should organize some hackathons and a meet-up in Japan it's kind of true but I do not think hackathon and meetup is a complete solution like so laya X has organizing the proximity up in Tokyo called broken Tokyo for more than two years every month it was great to expand the community but it does not grow them to the quad researchers because you know there's no job in the pan as a production researchers so yes we continue to do some awesome meet ups but I think the fundamental solution is to simply hire researchers as pro-temp and to cooperate with universities and at each gem the what is a program to be solved in the public approaching yeah it's pretty much saying the talk thanks so much you you
