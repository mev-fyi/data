53 running for zincon yeah i have 500. hey everyone good morning and welcome to uh the zinken testnet launch this is a phase 0 test net launch of the ethereum 2 network so we have done a couple of these test net launches this is a dress rehearsal rehearsal to help clients be ready for the mainnet launch this is a short-lived chestnut it should last about 72 hours maybe even less because our actual focus is uh just getting that launch tooling up and running well so my name is superfiz i am here from the eath staker community and i'd like to begin by welcoming everyone to come and join us in the east acre community we are a group of users who work to support each other to learn more about staking and to get ready for uh the mainnet launch so you can find the e sticker community in a couple places if you look at reddit.com we'd love you to join us you can check out our sticky we've got a welcome video there we're also on the discord at uh insta dot gg slash eat staker we'll take you directly to our discord where you can join and we'd love for you to join our community if when you're there we have a couple programs you might be interested in the one that i want to tell you about today is our mentorship group if you're new to staking and you don't know anything we don't want you to dive in head first on mainnet we think it's best if you spend some time on the medasha test net getting used to staking and so when you come to our discord you can learn about our mentorship group where you'll be linked up with a small group of other people who are interested in staking and spend about a month figuring out how it works before you put a lot of money on the line so we'd love to have you there um with us today we have the the a team uh of ethereum development um so welcome everybody uh to get started um so danny can you tell us um can you tell us about the big picture of of how this launch is supposed to look today and what we're looking for so um you mentioned it before we have the madasha test nut which is a long standing uh phase zero e2 test that we've had running um and at least in the past handful of weeks been very stable um a lot of people have helped us out on that it's majority run by the community um and a couple weeks ago we did a dress rehearsal called sedina um we had a few false starts out the gate a couple issues with configuration and some last minute things on the edges of the stack so we are doing another dress rehearsal today called zinken and what we're looking for in zinken is a relatively clean genesis and optimally we see finality out the gate but really what we're looking for is that client teams had a clean release process and that the validators that showed up turn their nodes on were able to connect to the network and begin validating producing blocks and testing without any issue obviously since this has been not incentivized test that this isn't a mainnet there is a chance that you know whale showed up dropped in a thousand validators and didn't turn them on uh that's not really if we run into that oh well uh but we're looking for finality and we're looking for over the next few hours validators not reporting that they have many issues so and i'm looking at the lincoln beacon chain beautiful interface they built that i'm sure they're going to show us and i'm messing with the new general standardized api following along awesome so we're about 10 minutes away from the genesis block uh if you are looking for a great place to view as danny mentioned you can check out z-i-n-k-e-n dot b-e-a-c-o-n-c-h-a dot i-n n that's zinken dot beacon chain uh with a dot before the i n uh i hope you're interested in the poep uh the pro co-app is a proof of attendance protocol token and uh that program is uh led by patricia worthalter and basically a poep is it's something that we all get kind of excited about it shows that you were a participant and in an event and the way that you can get a co-app for this event is by uh coming to the e sticker discord that's you can be you can get there at insta dot gg slash east acre you'll have to be validated on our discord before you get in and we have someone working on that actively when you get there you'll look for a channel called poep and in that poe app you're going to see a link to our po app bots and so what you're going to do is send a direct message uh so you'll right click on the the poet bot and hit send message and you're going to send a link to the youtube live stream um to that poet bot and there's lots of help in that discord if you get close we have people who are who can guide you to the right spot because everyone's sort of learning exactly how this works but that poep is sort of a badge of honor that uh that you'll get to show that hey in 10 years yes i was at the zinc and test net launch which is the hopefully the the correct dress rehearsal that got us ready for mainnet ethereum staking so tyler smith is here with us today and tyler you've been in the ethereum community for a really long time um what what are your thoughts about what's happening today and where we're at in the big picture well first of all i appreciate the opportunity to be here a lot of familiar faces on the call so it's good to see everyone yeah and as a really long-term community member i mean my time dates back to like the first time i was an active participant was on the olympic test net now i was actually at the miami bitcoin conference um hi hi vitalik it's been a while and the olympic test that i feel like there's a lot of similarities with uh the way i feel today to be honest a lot of excitement a little bit of anxiety um it feels like it was a long time coming to where we are now uh because we you know i think we're all chomping at the bit to be ready for mainnet um but test nets are a really really important thing sometimes we we don't appreciate how important they are especially for the non-technical person or at least the non-devs so i'm probably the least uh you know software savvy in this call and it requires a lot of effort for me to participate but i've participated in every single ethereum to test that thus far um and there's actually some like really embarrassing uh questions that have been asked that i've asked in discords um and uh shout out to proto lamba who has helped immensely and and chided me a few times that maybe my question wasn't exactly in the right forum but these test nets feel for someone who's waited for a long time they feel magical the thing that you've been learning about and and wanting to be a part of for a long time all of a sudden happens and it changes the way you view the space and a lot of times test nets are really the the vehicle that we where we move a passively interested person into the active builder space active participant and that's why i think that this is such a special thing that we have these test nets beyond just the technical reasons that we've got to get this right before economic value gets put on the chain hey thanks yeah so much i i loved the olympic test net i had i had wires and gpus hanging out all over my my office um i had no idea how key management worked and [Laughter] i didn't know what i was doing but man i was sure having a lot of fun and that's i i got so excited about the e2 test nets because i crave the excitement of this fledgling kind of like you know you believe in ethereum but you don't know exactly how things are going to unfold that just makes it really exciting to me yeah i mean sometimes i think that we're a little bit guilty um especially people who work on this stuff day in day out that these start to become our own little playgrounds and we don't realize how i'll use the term again magical it is for community members that are able to finally start to play with the network once these things go live and and even like we may think that test nets have a specific purpose that we have in mind but people use test nets for all sorts of crazy reasons and those are just as valid as maybe what the core devs are using them for oh definitely that's um i i've had so much fun like just so we've had a great opportunity to test on different hardware on you know everyone a lot of people are interested in raspberry pi 4s and i i think we're sort of learning that those may not be the the best hardware to run on but if we hadn't tested and tested and tested in in uh on these test sets we really wouldn't know what the best solution is so thanks dollar i didn't know we had that that olympic mining experience together that was that was a lot of fun um something that's that's recently had me interested uh and we just have a few minutes before launch is i'm realizing that with all of these l2 solutions and with uh sharding coming up the transaction fees on ethereum uh and vitalik i'm about to ask you your thought on this the transaction fees on ethereum are going to to fall so low that they're once again going to be able to onboard or bank the unbanked which is something that i i really feel is a strong ethereum philosophy um the first time we had this potential we didn't really have the following or the tooling ethereum wasn't big enough yet do you think that that this set of l2 solutions along with uh the sharding solution is going to be a great opportunity to begin banking the unbanked i absolutely think so and i think uh and first of all like we we do need to remember that uh and in ethereum history we did have these long eras during which uh sending transactions was incredibly cheap and it was uh cheap to the point where no core developers were even worrying like whether or not it's too cheap essentially um and but at the same time you know there is not a lot of usage the chain was like less than one percent full and not much what's happening and so i think craig you know it turns out that we do need both things right like we need to have the you know existing momentum for people from people who are actually building things and who kind of know what they want to build and build build things that are kind of basically useful enough that uh people wants to and actually can use them and benefit from them and at the same time to have the space in the blockchain so that the applications can actually happen right and like i guess up until now we've been kind of alternating between those two scenarios right like we've at the at first there was nothing happening then you know there were the cats and then the cats clogged the chain um and then the cats that kind of went away in the rest of the applications i guess and forgot to come back for a while and then some a new set of applications came back and now we you know instead of the cats we had what was it was it the the food um and now the foods farm yeah but um i think um the the difference now is that if we can get roll-ups and shorting out then the scalability of the ethereum chain is going to go up by a very large factor like a factor of anywhere from 100 to 10 000 depending on which technology is uh kind of gets stuck together and so that kind of increase is going to be enough to not just allow a kind of a bit of a temporary bump but it's enough to actually give um application developers hope that you know even if they build something that reaches uh 10 million users they're still going to be able to run it which is the sort of certainty that you need to actually start building something that that go tries to go out and reach 10 million people um so i'm very optimistic about making the unbanked i'm also very optimistic about the non-financial applications that were once possible recently have been less possible but very soon are going to be possible again um so and we have just done it before lunch but i'm curious to know what what is your what is your favorite non-financial application right now probably ens okay great yeah that's that's a good solution uh so we have just about a minute before launch um lamboshi if you want to go ahead and begin your screen share of beacon chain um and buddha if you want to give us a brief walkthrough of what we're looking at here yeah sure so once the chain starts rolling we are expecting and hoping for the slots to turn green or the blocks are turned green which means that they are proposed and below the four epochs we can see a checklist and hopefully we have a participation rate higher than 80 percent um if blocks are missed they will turn red and if they're orphaned they will turn light blue and yeah in the end we hopefully have a just finalized e-poke one that's the goal if not we already see what happened previous uh last time and we're live and we so we should uh hopefully see a proposal in a few moments but we're not we're not using this as our gauge of success um what we're really looking at is client stability so client team members if you have an opportunity to chime in with with how your client looks uh that would be a great help for us we're moving we hit yes and also keep in mind the tech store is lagging so we will see the blocks turning green a bit uh yeah a few seconds afterwards i see a block at flat one yep my node's working great i see a blocking slot too same for us i think we have slot eight danny can you check and make sure you're on the zinc and test net just kidding slot three i see a block one hundred percent oh [Music] vitalik can you reboot the master node please do you want it slot four uh so we might want to switch do we have a backup view because so let me tell everyone what's going on real quick is we're hearing developers report that we are hitting blocks as we're supposed to the beacon chain explorer is not not reporting that but where things oh it's all it is it just showed the first block as missed okay maybe we're on the fork that's interesting i see slot six yeah i see seven my uh gotta block it so what we see is our success is not being visualized here but on the back end the network is running smoothly and so uh bitfly has done an awesome job development but are not using it for this launch i'm actually surprised sure it shows us missed gotcha um yeah i mean i'm still seeing black but i also so much i think my prism node is also stuck i get uh current slot zero zero fault it's a loop proto or someone have a graffana dashboard up that shows us hitting blocks that we can switch to a screen share there yeah there's a there's a fork happening my prison note is working all right i just um look at the blotry explorer on my local note and there hasn't been a fork yet i have a block at slot 15 right now c1 d9 yeah we have that also yes so my local note and the production note have the same bug we are not getting blocks for some reason i posted the book in the present discord great thanks looking at it right now i got slot 19 yeah nimbus got it as well cb 9-3 very cool and so from kind of following my logs it seems like we have a relatively high participation rate um i don't have a good handle on the ad decisions but the block which decision rate's pretty high i'm seeing about 30 so far we're only part way through the epoch oh on the uh agitation sum gotcha yeah just jump to 37 so it's pretty on track i can't do that math in my head this time or not but well it might be it might be um we might get like above two-thirds at the start of the next epoch yeah i mean yeah it's really important to note that when i'm talking those figures it's it's the current epoch so we're not expecting it to be above yet because not everyone's had a chance to attest great we'll get get some more meaningful figures at the end of the epoch right or i guess around three or four slots into the second epoch because there are going to be some anticipations from the end they get included at the start of the next one yep yeah if uh like and if we're at like exactly two-thirds participation so um and that two-thirds doesn't uh get included with an epoch but it gets it good at the start of the next and it just means that well i think finalizing three blocks instead of two or something like that yeah which is all good so an overview for people who are watching on youtube and may not get the full picture um it looks like the chain is is hitting blocks um and so we get a slot every 12 seconds and after 32 slots or 6.4 minutes which is going to happen in about 30 seconds we we will have the opportunity to finalize um our first epoch and regardless of the display that shows miss blocks the the back end the actual network is getting proposed blocks and so it will take us a few minutes just to see what what the full picture looks like plot 30 that's a 6 1 f7 root i insured this chart in the eastern discord where it shows slot since the test block and so you can see that missing blocks so while we're here i'd like to remind you about poep maybe you've tuned maybe you tuned in at the top of the hour for the chain launch and you're interested in saying uh hey i was at the zinc and test net launch i saw all this happen if you'd like to claim your po app what you'll do is um go to the ethe staker discord channel if you haven't been there before you can get there by going to dot gg slash eat staker that's a direct link to our discord you'll need to join our discord and there are there are some uh a verification hurdle to get through for that just to identify yourself and when you get there you can go to our poep channel in that poep channel you'll see a poep bot and you'll send a message to that bot that is a link to the youtube live stream that you're watching and you're gonna say ah fizz that's too much work uh well if you want the poep it's worth the work we make it as simple as we can but we want people to put a little a little bit of elbow grease into um proving that you were here and it's it's great i like it's it's a good collection a good way to say that you were here for all of these test net launches um i'm very happy to have mine does anyone have participation for epoch zero i'm seeing 64 we usually judge that a little high that's the 64 attested not necessarily got it right so they'll be a little better we're at plot 40 41. i think we're saying about 60 so what end point are y'all using for the um i'm just looking at the techy metrics which is why they don't do the advanced filtering and calculations um it's the basic stuff but it's quite useful it's usually pretty pretty pretty close my beacon notes looking kind of weird my prison beacon i've got parent root is zero for for everything now but my validators see slot 46. yeah alex uh that is just cosmetic right now so there's no impact changes it's just kind of annoying and i apologize for that cool hey guys anybody there's what are we looking at there that's uh my prism dashboard about 53. did someone report the participation for epoch one epoch zero i'm sorry somewhere between 60 and 64 62 is probably the accurate number by looking at that dashboard in terms of people who actually got the data station right um and not just was included i asked a question for a stat that was in front of thank you so is anyone experiencing issues other than the beacon chain explorer uh my prism node is throwing a lot errors i've not seen that where it just says it's requesting parent blood for a genesis block and that's just cosmetic right now so yeah we'll fix that i'm getting a lot of failed to fetch pre-state interesting pre-state let me dm you on the discord yeah my validators my validators are showing the same beacon block route for every slot and source routes all zeroes and target routes the same for all of them too well we give everyone just a few minutes to collect some information um hey nolan you you ran recently a survey on um a google form survey about staking hardware and staking clients can you give us a real quick one rundown of what you learned from that and and really what it means for people who are setting up um staking notes now um well we saw overwhelmingly that people were going to use linux to stake which is great because that's you know lightweight simple secure open source um prism was still by far and away the uh most popular note i think they had something like 70 um people were going to use them um lighthouse came in in second place with about a third of the responses we allowed people to choose multiple that's why the uh won't add up here then i think teku was um about 15 percent and nimbus and lodestar unfortunately were uh lagging behind um we saw a few people planning to stake with windows not a huge amount um a little bit of other os's like esxi and pros proxmox um but again because we encourage you to try out all the different clients they all have their own strengths um and you know you are incentivized in ethereum to to run a minority client because if one of the big one goes down and you can stay up you will receive far less penalties yeah and beyond just running a different client it's going to pay to be able to run multiple clients especially early on when the event of a failure of one client is much more likely than say like two years down the line so if you have another client that you're familiar with and can easily swap and there's a nice validator interchange format that everyone's been working on to be able to safely and quickly swap between clients so you know getting your hands dirty with another client on a test that's always good it looks like after you do it 85 on epoch one you said um i'm not looking at other stations just at blocks oh okay gotcha gotcha does anybody have updated uh participation rates for epoch zero and or one so zero participation from what i've seen from the deco graph and then it goes to 76 uh for apricon that's fantastic and we're at about slot 77 so we're part of the way through that epoch 2 which at the end of epoch 2 is the first time we can justify and or finalize anything which is some of the key metrics we're looking for uh now's a good chance to remind everyone that uh this call is brought to you by the e-sticker community um we're all learning together and uh you can find us at reddit.com or discord where everyone's going to get the poe app we have a lot of programs running to help people get involved one of them is our is our east study master program where you can read an article about ethereum or ethereum 2 every week for 10 weeks and aside from gaining some really fundamental knowledge you'll also get a poet for that one of my other favorite programs is our mentorship group group program where you'll sign up and get assigned to a group of four other people so it's a group of five people you kind of get together in your own discord room and just talk about staking progress and and work together to answer questions my idea for that is over the long term over the next three or four years you can build strong relationships with those people and have someone to rely on when it comes to running your staking notes so i'd love for you to get involved with either the ethereum study master or the ethereum staking mentor groups that you can find at uh in the east acre community so uh i hope you'll join us about two minutes till the end of epoch two which will be the first time we can justify or finalize looks like we have higher than two-thirds participation on these initial epochs so we're expecting something to happen couple slots till that epoch transition so these test nets have have been a great chance for the client implementation teams to test their clients against each other and and we really know that the fundamentals of the network are stable we've been running the madasha test network for uh probably over two months now uh we justify yes eighty percent sorry about that no you're great we justified epoch 2 which is uh the network is coming together uh we have not finalized yet we could have in the optimal case finalize epoch 1 right then and there we did not but we did justify epoch 2 which means it seems likely that at the end of epoch the next epoch we might finalize that epoch 2. which is great yes so these dress rehearsals are intended to to bootstrap the network to get up and running and both with modasha and spadina things just didn't hum as quickly as they should have from the beginning and so zinken is another attempt to to have just a perfect out of the gate launch and it looks like things look really good right now i think with the genesis of any network there's that initial stress of is it going to work is it going to happen but when you have a lot of distributed nodes trying to intercommunicate it it does take a few minutes for things to settle down i think actually one of the most kind of promising signs is the the lack of chat on discord and dasha there was just a constant stream of support requests across all clients um as people were trying to get it working um it's pretty quiet at the moment and uh that's it's really nice yeah agreed that's one of the main things i'm looking for um so we are at about slot 106 and the next evoc transition is at slot uh 128. still got about three and a half four minutes left click remainder there is this e3 this dashboard and the only two nodes that are lagging behind are two outdated nodes a nimbus note in the out of other version and a prison load like three versus parents so head slot 121 seven slots still that next epoch transition reminders slots are 12 seconds and so like danny said every 12 seconds a block can be proposed and if that validator is online doing its job it might it ought to propose a block um and so when we accumulate 32 proposed blocks we have the opportunity to finalize an epoch if more than two-thirds of those um blocks have been proposed and attested to so that's really this the silence is waiting for those uh 6.4 minute time spans to see if epochs are finalizing a couple slots to go we finalized sweet great work so epoch 2 finalized epoch 3 justified and we will monitor the chain for the next few hours see how things go and it looks like there were maybe some minor errors experienced by some prison clients so we're going to circle back and see what happened there but success great thank you um congratulations great job everybody yeah congrats everyone yay congrats and so the big picture in zinken we were looking for a hundred percent smooth smooth launch and i i would say i would say we came close to that um the teleco how close did we get i mean it seemed like the clients all worked fine right it was just uh the the visualization that wasn't working so yeah i mean i think it really is the that's that's the the butter is is when you can see the visualization and you know that it's a tick-tock tick-tock right and we are going to still have um at least one more address rehearsal before launched using the launch ready client uh client code right this is them yeah we're talking about it depends on how public we make that but certainly um you know we're doing that v10 release this week we had a release candidate of those specifications last week and we will certainly be uh taking our 1-0 clients and sending them up into networks but we'll we're still going to have some discussion on whether that is a public dress rehearsal like this or whether we kind of do some uh maybe lower key weekly 100 test nets just to kind of keep making sure everything's standing out properly but this is definitely the signal to move forward barring barring anything catastrophic happening in the next few hours so i i know everyone watching and i know that the the recaps of this are going to ask and i danny sort of said you know this is this indicates launch readiness um do does this give the impression that that we are going to launch the phase zero uh beacon chain in 2020 or are we on target that's my impression um this is kind of an ongoing dialogue with client teams and we we need to kind of take a second to look at this test net and but my understanding is that this will trigger the next series of things there's always blockers that might show up uh we need to do this responsibly um but this i'm feeling like at least this this wave of things that runs up on you know about as committal as as i'll be and like i said look us uh coming from the launch date is it's not about me it's not metallic it's kind of the synthesis of um everything that's going on conversations with engineering teams um and doing the best you can yeah i i have the beauty or the the joy the luxury of being an outside observer and so i'm not i'm not in the middle of those conversations and that gives me the opportunity as an outsider to share my perspective and things look really good um i feel i feel confident that uh you know i would say back when we had the interoperability conference months ago it was it was a year ago that's a good year ago time flies things just seem so up in the air like is it ever going to come together and and now at least the past few weeks i felt like we're 99 of the way and just kind of um the construction is done and we're just sweeping with the debris so while i don't speak for the ethereum foundation or the developers it really does look like we're close to um close to a phase zero launch so that's exciting very much agreed so thanks everyone for coming out today um everyone if you want to say your goodbyes and we will shut off the youtube live stream in about 30 seconds bye everyone thanks for coming bye yeah let me join you guys very exciting for that next e5 transition uh i think we're going to finalize the next buck let's hold out for one d5 dude if you'll hold the stream until that that next transition it would be great to see yeah the explorer will work next time bitfly beacon chain have done a ton of work getting this explorer up and i know it's hard when something doesn't work as you anticipated um but we still have a ton of faith in that product and i i look forward to great things yeah it just hurts when you spend so much time on it and it just doesn't work we all know the feeling at this point oh yeah have you tried turning it off and on again [Laughter] oh you wanna try turning it off about four slots until that next epoch transition three slot it's worth it's worth saying while those slots are ticking through the people who've been testing and giving feedback on all the different clients is hugely invaluable and that's that's why we're making such good progress and why we're seeing these things start to run much more smoothly um so thank you everyone who's been giving things a go and getting on discord and giving us the feedback yeah follow up on that like this is all open source this is an open source community even if you're not a developer um you are a part of the open source process the more that you engage the more that you give feedback uh the better this all becomes and that's i've spent a lot of time um mentioning the e-staker community we want to be a gateway um for you to staking but those client discords are always hopping and there there's tons of support there so if you favor a particular client that's a great place to hang out i'm always going to encourage you to be familiar with more than one client but sometimes the most comfortable place with you is in a specific client discord so by all means uh check them out and and find a home in staking that works for you and we did finalize that epoch 3 so it looks like the chain is healthy fantastic so great job everyone um and we will see you again um i'm not sure when but you'll definitely hear the announcements about it so take care and have a great day thanks everyone bye everyone happy thanksgiving bye bye thank you
