I made a couple of suggestions so basically what we want to have is we want we wanted to be possible to figure out what's the gas cost of the whole thing is in O in O of one time and in O of one memory reads so the suggestion I had for mod X was that we would take the bit length or sorry the byte we would take me at the byte length then we would look at just the first byte and if the first byte has is that has less than eight bits then we will kind of appropriately discounted so at one example would be that if you have three bytes and the first byte is 255 then the exponent likes to be counted as 24 if it's three bytes and the first byte is let's say three then the byte length will be counted at 18 now if you have let's say 10 bytes and all of them are zero bytes except for the last then the byte length would still be counted as the nine times eight or 72 because that's just the way the algorithm works but you can argue basically why the hell are you throwing in a value with free with a leading zero bytes in the first place so the that basically is all I had to say on all those gasps boss so what would be the next step to actually open or not I think so to determine on the elliptic curve side I'd say and possibly just I mean agree on preliminary gas costs for the purpose for the purposes of testing and then maybe or or perhaps holes the other thing we could do is just have a like but you know it takes the practical thing to do is that we agree on some preliminary gas cost for testing purposes then we get to the point where we're passing the test and then we actually see how many milliseconds they take C++ go and parity to run through some of the tests some of the test cases and we go from there to figure out what the final values are always that's one approach on the mod X side I think we would need to first of all figure out in principle what is the right like whether or not we're going for this bit length approach and if so what what approach are we taking in principle and then the next step would be a finalizing a very precise definition so I did some performance measurements on the pairing function in C++ and it resulted in roughly 60,000 gasp times the number of pairs plus 40,000 if we target 20,000 gasp per millisecond I'm not sure if that target is correct which I did okay so my next question is though is what numbers do I get and parity get so I'll I would prefer to avoid finally finalizing the gasps class until we have enough numbers from all the clients to make sure to make sure that we're creating a reasonable guess per second for and all of them yeah wait for it stuffing the constants but we would be good to finalize that algorithm for monix pretty earnest yes if you will do the same benchmark when next we do yeah so maybe all freecell three tides do a benchmark and also also resize so a guest EBUS POC and parity should also figure out what what swore makes sense so I will I think like the most principled way to figure this out would be to just basically say what is the most time what what is the for now so I guess that firl up the curve I mean in general it occurs addition should be constant I guess and yeah multiplication models depending on the size is the scale right uh I would argue that there is not much benefit in making multiplication depends on the size of the scalar because pretty much all multiplications I've ever encountered in cryptography multiplied by a random 236 bit numbers and so I don't think we really lose much by just going straight to the work with writers for point yeah I mean there's some use in okay you can kind of abuse multiplication to and get the inverse or something like that but that would be a large skin or anyway so yeah so maybe we'll put the number of that Kristen have so now like start with something and to actually do some tests and the next meeting or before the next meeting if if we get more benchmarks we can adjust that but I will read the numbers nothing says so far that's not exactly that crash tested sorry um is 20000 Gasca millisecond a reasonable number or what to be annexing others think so I recall that we arrived at 20 at 20,000 Gasper milliseconds because we looked at basically what are the what are the most most inefficient other opcodes that we had and we got something like 20 million us like 15 to 20 million gas per second in the worst case given is that correct so I think I did a comparison with with other pre-compiled contracts and internally with Mal mark yes so needy yeah in in general I think 20 million gas per second is definitely fine yes I guess the other better bencher it would be good if the other benchmarks could also yeah check that with other pre-compile contracts so all what what thoughts that people have on them on the Ahmad ex-officio I ever comment on that one kids of them if anyone can hear me yeah the idea was there to accommodate the fact that we have 256-bit the memory stores so crafting did request the kind of demise for 2056 bit and but the content might be much less so what if we only care the topmost 256-bit and assume if say the exponent is like it has in bits we assume that the bottom 700x bits must be set and we only considered top two and 56 so then it's only hmm you know the exposure is limited so basically the exact proposal I have except that instead of working edge one the top one byte will look at the top 32 bytes yeah yep Mohammed kill that and this is this is a constant effort and can be priced in with the yeah baseline guess cause it yes yes Vitalik do you see what Hudson is writing in the truck let me tell let the Telex know to proceed with the next item when Donald gasps yes so basically the other concern I have is that I wanted to just basically like kind of accentuate the fact that with the fact that the revert opcode can return things we actually like basically it was a Joseph for BBC really really pointed out that we actually are making a major economic change which we're always a significant economic change which in some ways does break BBC release current model and the change but basically the problem is that BBC relay works and potentially a lot of there were other applications might also work by charging some very small amount in exchange for give our give reading some some value from the contract stage yeah so the idea that it was one way to do a paid Oracle and with the revert up code what you can do is you can basically call to a contract then in from it from the contract make a call to be deeply relay or whatever other thing get the response then in the outer contract he would use the revert opcode and you have revert the response and this way the payment that you would make that you want to make for an exchange for the response will be reverted but you would still get the data out and so I'm based this is something that's not not possible to do easily now so right now basically the easiest way to kind of cheat these contracts out of data is by basically asking from ask for merkel groover of the state and this is arguably subset much more much more expensive whereas here we have is just basically a tower of two calls and that's all and that's how he needs to circumvent in any kind of a wall so like them answer that a bit but you know we discussed this a few weeks ago and so I that's why I open let's take it against me to see relay but the thing is that even without return data you can always see the same thing with the river can return wrong based at a time so you can do an Oracle you can query because you realize this hundred valid invalid guesses fact if you don't all you want wait how exact how exactly does the one bid Oracle work I think I was working human reporting you might use the amount of gas that you revert with mmm I would either a bird or I would knock your guard and go but if you don't but if he don't report them the payment goes through yeah but you can or you can revert it in a different place right but if you are revert you need different I see so you could have like a tower in the repo at the channel point also again and basically you would get back yeah the exchange you can extract long bit of information that way and you can do it yes one way to do it today is the magic with what you mentioned in other ways to actually use throw you can do it the same way but it's much more complicated because especially will be the serial a is not constant how much it costs so it will be easier to do that with something which is constant there is this simple code in the chat for BBC relay yeah well Reba please see doesn't go the income you know you're cutting out all room so can anyone make sense Andrea I think you're cutting out yeah Andre I think Erika is I've never found the paying for Oracle's case particularly compelling simply because it is so it is entirely plausible to just fetch the data from the state and create makeup Merkle proof so that's only difficult so long as nobody's put up a local Oracle I've always I think Lea if I recalled the arguments would matter then they have to Chad give your ignorant would so the argument would be I think that even though a payment of twenty five cents might not be defensible a payment of let's say one cent still would be defensible because the cost of either of these attacks would still go higher than 1/10 and one cent might be all the Union in order to pay for the transaction fees of maintaining one of these things I just I don't think for the property that we should strive particularly hard to protect because doing so disables other useful use cases and ultimately once the data is posted to the public blockchain relying on a special barriers and the V into proving people from reading it just seems I can seems like the wrong approach to take ok that's there if no if other people are Greenline was that a question so right now you can trick the BTC relay by making this throw and making a call into your same verification and then taking the result of the throw to see if it's vaporizer knows and avoiding the payment right now yes could you Nasik we have to know how much gas BBC real angles consume and you will have to as to set the low amount low enough amount of gas too big to distinguish between natural failure and this is so good I can get absolute today I see if I was reading the example by Alex to train understand how it works and but now I see why does this last calculation there all right thanks hey guys can you hear me now I think I fixed my audio yes Oh excellent yay okay so was that it for that item yes okay well that was ahead what was the decision in this item but we just don't want to put it in videos yeah I think so that's what it seemed like was there anyone it was like heavily opposed or would it have an alternative okay cool and that covered that covered the river top code correct metallic I was fixing mattias only caught half of that yeah I think we're going ahead with Roberta's is great I so the next one is yo Ichi talking about a IP 96 video years it's the triviality um in Vig 96 256 blocks into Metro Police the blog has instruction can change its internal working and then the same et auto says the gas cost for broke has should change from twenty to eight hundred or something my question is it just cause change should happen at the first block of the metro police or 256 dogs after that um hold on should the gas price of one yes okay um there's a link and the event or dendron actually discusses it and points out in the code I believe we're where he's talking about if anyone needs to look at that yeah I'm looking at the snow so I think we did agree in one of the previous calls that we would to make a change to EAP 96 so that so restricted so that technically you could argue that one way to implement you know implementing would be to not change the behavior of the black ash output at all so did the does the gas cost increase um oh I see him yeah it's a bring it home mmm-hmm I'm checking in previous meeting that's right now to see if this was discussed but I definitely remember that too so I did we I think we said that I want all of the notes before I make it eat I'm pretty positive we saved that location which continue to return only the to be six most recent patients and if you wanted all the ones you have to call the new Oracle contracts that's okay so I got here yeah identification seems like we could change their back so the price won't change and the you know the car channels you might change mm-hmm yes that's the reasonable choice down there so we go out on that so the guests cost increases on the three hundred and fifty six blocks after metro police start well I'm suggesting that we needn't increase the gas cost of all the physical continue to operate as it used to if you want to access all the stuff if you call the Oracle contracts it is but this is very just so one thing that one thing I think one thing I'd suggest this it just as an as an experiment see if we can kind of but basically I want to see how long would it would it take to do a million basically a million rounds of crawling these yet I delegate calling the black hash contracts over and over again just to see that if someone decides to exercise to implement a kind of history free implementation then you know what they have what they infer any debt and like extra difficult is there we have clear enough as this 90 weeks we're talking about 96 yeah okay basically what I'm sure what I'm trying to make it possible to do is I'm trying to make it positive I'm trying to make it possible to make an implementation of the of the protocol that does not depend on any kind of history access that's not in the state and that doesn't require any kind of additional weird data we are data structures in which case implementing the blog hash table code would be basically just either calling that contract or just reading reading a storage once and now we could of course argue that those particulars for storage fees are going to end up being in the cache so it's done it it's it's not like this is a particularly serious issue but I'm basically trying to wonder if xx 520 gas is low enough for that kind of implementation or whether it's something slightly higher would make sense I would suppose being trees to gas cost and those clients which can use the old implementation they might be saving time by that but we should assume that every new client would implement it through the Oracle hmm that's my proposal okay we if we increase the guest cost can we just do it on the topless block instead of two three six laughter yeah I think that's more consistent okay we go rather open-ended yes yep yep we didn't I don't have notes talking about the specific part of 96 but I posted the ones I did find that anyone wants to read those to kind of see the what we talked about previously on that but it sounds like we came to a resolution on that yes I think I got em my questions Linus could be test exchange VIP takes particular by TSP I am to clarify that a gas causes increased - I'm asking about the amount I'm asking about which bloke said there are questions the metronome might work back then okay okay yes and that Vina and I have one question about the CIP so if we are going to deploy a byte code to that contract why don't we charge they actually Casca so for executing it so there is actually that's three different ways to implement this one of them is to execute to get one of these execute the code one of them is to read that particular account storage I'd also argue that a discount might be prudent because if someone tries to call this contract a whole bunch of plans and all just end up being in the cache on the other hand oh I could see how it's about how how it would be kind of a very principled upper bound to calculate the exact spots in charge that so yeah I planted a the this is have time so far okay personally I'm not really worried about a conservative price because I don't expect many contracts to call it and those who do probably won't call it much yeah and I think like 800 will be fine because I get still it's basically one call anyway and no I can't imagine there being applications it'll be a willing to that will be afraid of having a lot for block hashes in them but that's yeah but basically it'll really expect here to be applications that means the kind of spam blog has reads enough for even a fairly substantial increase to be a substantial issue for them and my thoughts exactly okay I did also about the game yeah II and the next point is about the amount of the system account the system account is after metro police supposed to all PC brokerage contract in the beginning of activity block said yes in Korean because notice that it is a call and not a transaction right so transactions in criminal is also a core transaction would increment unknown and for from the e BN would not increment right unknown so there is an biggest correct so by call I mean a call of I mean a call from medium and uh that's how I usually use the word call but I'm happy to clarify that so the notes would not to be incremented correct so the code pathway that you should use to implement yet you know each X should be the same or that you would European like the coop code okay who you're angry and I have some disagreement over this which we have a member can be moved to the next item that sonic that's a different yet deal okay such that the next point is about e98 the intermediate state removal ah when you the each text literally the change starts one block after the metropolis artwork block but I guess it's a typo so I guess let's change that up okay and that mysterious HIV greater than we go to attend a pizza right now okay who my last point is actually well maybe not via triviality it's about the 211 return date copy when returned a copy wants to copy more than returned what should happen I'm currently the body of the text says the between zeros that's the same as ordered copy but Nick suggests exceptional old um I think both reasonable I think at least we should gather opinions here I'm glad to be jail convinces my by unfilled as a service station or intercept reading pasty in the middle ray he is almost always an error and therefore wish traced as such and what's find imitating jurors is likely to lead to particular lugs and I know this imagine its consistency but I think we should fix the issue where we can rather than a traditional to opcodes okay I don't see we are a technical issue with Nick suggestions ah apart from that we will have very similar opcode that behaves differently are more wary in implementation and testing on remembering in deviance take but that's just mental cost ago implemented the other address spaces or trying to be valid for little addresses and you know we should should be the same for consistency but having a light as I said I I think consistency is a weaker argument firm this is the wrong thing to do is like a really should be consistently wrong a friction avoid a I'm going to say that I hope yours over because there is at least one contractor named above chain that will fail if my copy that's right now is called out a copy throws an exception because it deliberately reads for bite asking it okay so I think I commented on the issue but I can't find the comment anymore so it might be lost or together Nick so what is he what's the problem with solving here it is the Khurana most incorrect included in potato right um well it's it's anything where it tries to read data that doesn't exist silently Virginians here ours is in my mind if you're struggling like on solute undetected scares and very amazing Indian idea but if the return date has fully specified to always be virtually infinite and contain serious than what if the owner were dealing with but they actual water and data isn't infinite like the contract they returned together specified a return link and if you then try and read asked the links that were specified by the returning contract that should be an error because the - doesn't exist I mean so what I want to say is that when we compare this to the the arrow to that that sparked this discussion and the error was incorrectly encoded user input data then we have a different situation here because the data we're dealing with here is usually created by yeah we don't have great size and what you here is back for discussion I'm fine arguing listen Anna vacuum I think surely that reading past the end of the range with the in error because the the data should be undefined and not just silently filter zeros I can't think of a single situation we are filling in seriously good thing I want to ask reg what this means or even one point file because in even one point five it should be easy to detect potential exceptional all before execute in the contract for just standing in the code and I think introducing a new kind of exception old might make this more difficult great oh trying to find me on network I agree with Nick that it's totally wrong that we treat it that way I've been told it made the description mathematically simpler I don't know if you can't opinion on that I also agree I wouldn't want to extend the mistake beyond the domain it's currently in and yes if we insist that gum then all code is going to be validated before it's run we can we can catch things like this much more easily and I think that take Martin's I believe that would be true for as am also but Greg wouldn't that be a new kind of run time exception condition that cannot be validated before actually evaluating it it didn't sound like it but I could well be misunderstanding I don't think you want to have me take time to reread to eat and think about it more this very second so because the Des Moines offsets are not constant and norm to the validator of the conflict you cannot check it before deploying the contracts then you see the indexes are our dynamic so we can prick compute them on the right time okay but wait a minute this discussion is not relevant because called data copy always copies to memory and there we anyway have a dynamic guest condition so whether we run out of gas because we run out of gas because we have to enlarge memory or because we access return data beyond its length that doesn't matter much does it we only have one Pro instruction it has no data we don't distinguish why it's gross and also I assure me you don't you don't think you can aesthetically determine whether that so instruction is reachable if you just assume that if there is one medical 32 throw we can determine where any instruction is reachable really what if the condition is is this piece of code evaluates to true then troll know about sense of reach ability yeah signing the same would seem to applies the called out of the cop that you can't statically determine all cases whether it can ever happen but you can you can if it's impossible you can say social servant but if it's possible you just have to say maybe exactly and I think the same would go for called us obviously into the array certificate Lera file when anyone says call it a copy when that person most likely fails to turn the marine genetically I also made a mistake is worse okay now I hear people with truly different opinions and it's not reasonable to expect consensus in this also shall we agree to continue the discussion on the place being from the agenda so actually I'm I'm indifferent this is only for selecting an alkoxy both arguing for consistency in different instructions yeah Arkady want to elaborate on that well yeah my point is that it just makes a simple definition okay yeah I think that there are more people in favor of explicitly instead of filling the out of bounds array or down there with zeros to actually just not let it happen and throw in air is why it sounded like the majority of people were for that am I wrong instead the impression I got I'd be curious what the Telex angst well I'm fine either way all personally although one thing I will point out is that I remember there was resistance to doing things like what like one of the reasons why for example the division of code in the EVM returns bureau when you divide by zero instead of throwing is that we did not like at least some of us did not like the idea that you can have parameter dependence throwing and like basically they like the idea that I believe that all coaching with the RO because of like actual out of gas and that mean anything that happens after the out of gas step it should is a it should look basically not throw under any circumstances and rolling on bad return call i data would in a inflict was bad i think that that confuses developers or at least when I'm developing like everyone I've talked to the thing they have the most problems with is the fact that throws don't act as a lot of modern programming languages would act when something is thrown it's not always just one single error it's usually gives a little more indication so if there's any interest and providing more information on throws in the future I think this would be a good first step personally well I think we're good we'll do that to some degree but we at least four throws generation by code rather than by the V okay right so it sounds like we're pretty much mostly in consensus that the behavior should be that it would explicitly throw an error rather than fill with zeros am i accurate on that are useful alright yeah peachy as is that and that point of discussion is there any other comments if I ask the computing one perfect okay the next one is EEG has a proposal for freezing EEPs for to a lab for testing for metropolis actually hold on yes to go back on just to go better on that one point um one thing I realized is that back back when we were discussing the IP five versus the FDA it sources returned data copy and so forth I recall one of the one other proposal being being so the original problem that we were trying to solve is basically how do you deal with variable size returned data and I remember one of the proposals being that you would so right now the way this works is that before making a call you would expand the memory for to cover the full range of the input and the full range of the output and one of the proposals was to switch to the full range of the input so expanding the full range of the input at the start and then expanding to the output but only expanding to as much out but as well as was actually provided after the call was made and this was a in some ways a very very nice so a nice solution except that I remember that it ended up falling out of favor precisely because it introduced this or this idea that we get an operation inside the VM lights the row because of something because of the actual execution of the operation and not just because of yet because of initial gas computation issues and so if we're willing to abeyance in that principle perhaps would be willing to go right back to yeah b5 and EAP 8 whatever that there's still a big difference here so the accessing returns later beyond its length can be I mean it is there is there are even the other core proposal there the error condition would only be checked after the Kali returned it which is a much later point in time than point where you read the inputs for a return date so K will come so I guess though that we point this from just from the point of view from the point of view of kind of making a softer abstraction I think the argument in favor of kind of purity is that you want to be able to break down every single VMI execution into two parts where one part just does gas consumption and the other part does just like execution and only the first part can throw but that's I mean if I do am load at a very high memory point or if I do a call it a copy with a high end point that is the same thing is that both depends on values on the stack okay yeah I can see that I would you have any other comments on that metallic no that was the only comments ad okay um yeah okay so I think it still stands that because some opinions have shifted or become less strong on the fact that we can you know throw for things other than just being out of gas Ayers that we can be that that is still the the conclusion is still that on that a I P the behavior would be throwing an error rather than filling with zeros I guess yeah okay cool I think I think I followed all that the next thing is yuuichi proposal to freezy IPS to allow for testing we Dimitri Mattias Linda and I had a core on Monday discussing the testing for Metro quarries there was an agenda there was a topic how how much shows the test of the covers we couldn't answer because we eat a still changing and some of the books table but there's no indication that this table looking geek will not change so we don't know how many obliques will not change and we don't know how many test cases uh ready so my proposal is to introduce a notion of freezing a need for Metro Police and after a nip is frozen for Metro Police page that it cannot change until Metro Police if there is such fear program tips can be dropped from Metro Police or if the sticks is very easy and everybody says where we have enough time to test it from this can this change can be made but the customers the unanimous everybody agreed both in the orders meeting and my question now at this point is shall be satisfied to write on the meta if about this process so shall be there is an opinion if there is no penalty we shall stay away from these kinds of all maladies I like the rigidity of your idea and the fact that it will allow for things to be a little more clear in the EEP repository which is still pretty messy the people maintaining it have just been busy with other things so I think that one thing is to yeah a meta II and this actually goes back to what Alex Bears Ozzie put as a meta if it hasn't been accepted yet but it's just basically a file that says here's the EEP sand metropolis and along with that we can amend that to have a column that states when an ape has been finalized or no more changes will be accepted to that EEP except in the event like you said of an extenuating circumstance potentially where there would be a bug found or maybe there's an EEP with a small there may be and like a consequence that you discover while testing that it relies on a different EEP that's been finalized so I think that that's fine we should kind of uh you know be flexible as we move along and saying that you know depending on the size of it just try to have a lot more open communication between the dev teams when there is an issue to immediately get feedback so we don't have to rely on the actual audio all core dev call since it only happens every two weeks but otherwise I think it's a great plan I see I see and attic I've already made a comment in the group chat so I need to try to write that something and so it's two addicts Hudson and anybody interested under in the next meeting I'm coming with some more detailed jokes yeah I think that'd be good and people can also close their eat their PRS or whatever or put a comment saying I'm done and then the editors will go in and you know approve it add it to the repository and then actually close the PR and any you know issues related to that it only reopen if necessary so are there any other comments on this plan anybody opposed or have an idea about it looks fine to me wait all right awesome the next item is any subtleties we need to work out with regards to metropolis does anyone have anything on their mind as far as a subtlety or something that may have not may have not been discussed or we need to discuss I think metallic you wrote that as a topic did you have anything in mind I didn't have anything actually I think I might have had so well there's the one but I've been talking about for a while but that we actually I guess technically it's part of you I think it might be part of eBay t6 that creating a contract sales if it already has if the the destination address already has code but I was more thinking in mind like smaller things that have to do with like the way that non-sync romantic works for gas calculation or I call their boring details about storage no that's not right or something that would yeah that sounds like it would be need to be defined in the EEP and as implementation goes through I feel like people would ask those questions but yeah everyone should feel free to voice those concerns in both of the eeap's and all core dev chats I know you eat she's been good about that when he's been applying them to the yellow paper so yeah if no one had anything for any quote subtleties yeah well my thing is the the point of fondant erase both the origin to this neutral section is that something we need to talk about because the issue a racist of or general basically of the useless for the new types of contractions his proposal of those youth the youth verifier contract of origin so a schema generally if they're a use 40x origin at some point it was banned because people think that being insecure so yeah people haven't really used it much in a while it doesn't that just mean the transaction where it originated from either if it hops through multiple other accounts yeah the account creation see actual projection so it takes the original used motivating uses what was it was so that contract could refund the transaction senders for gas payments but I would say with that yet EBT success not rolling that theory because we can open up ways where any contracts down the chain for just paper gas directly so there isn't a need to actually take it out of the system it would just be plain machine yeah yeah pretty much I think it's a bit of a mystery and I heard some of the say women's you know access to it from future version just likes Tinsley treason isn't something useful so some Martin did that somewhat answer your question yeah okay great um any other subtleties okay great instigator so as far as the time estimates and testing and release let's first just kind of go through the teams and see where everybody's at we'll start with you eg since he's been doing some of the yellow paper stuff and I think what we've talked about today is kind of outlined where you're at basic now no maybe so here's yeah okay we thought we were jobs from the internet um the yellow paper so I have created an appear pretty great for every keep considered PO metro police I believe it they are mostly up to date Chris deep and yeah some predictions made about well that that was a great day um that's a little bit of data I'll be meeting the metropolis changes in city paper in with them on the parity and I'm halfway through it up quick Adam back on okay cool and then we'll go to guess if there's someone here and I think maybe Powell or okay I'm back so um okay that was a Python I think that's everybody C++ team or Dmitry testing if you'll have updates the garlic actually she was a scientist working and getting into today lick snacks and then Podesta eroge in the Gucci just noticed yes Widow what were you saying some very well I am saying that snark test and working and you could check it against icon okay great um have you checked Python test against the C++ yet nope yet maybe anything stopping you from doing that I'm going to dirty her hold your clutch is equal to Susan oh well okay then I then I deliver what we say aog ah there's no blockers that movement I was trying to Said's okay great and was there anything else either you each here Dimitri on the testing and for I think I saw beep about standardizing the way that tests are formatted through JSON is that correct oh yeah our consensus issue is then JSON files for month and how integers encode it in different files for that so so on from fightin teams and insists that integer should not be perfect by you leading zeros and and the foil singlet it's nonsense cool graphics for other 0x perfect for contract crashes and other hashes so we have an quite a finishes and okay and you said that was between Python JSON files that are submitted issues you know how the best dollar eats with it okay and Ashley multifarious torment for Jason best files in children agrees okay um well what let's do this the eats out there so if anybody here who has who does submit this kind of test files could go in and comment and if no one or if not enough people comment on it we can pull in some people who submit and see if we can come to consensus on that hopefully soon so we can get those standardized for when we're submitting more for metropolis sound good yep okay the next item let's see Oh actually yeah without it for testing I'm going to be working on lucky coat this and to take a loyal I see that the statically ap we most that equal so do I will do local this that the AP okay sounds good so the next thing would be time estimates for testing and release so I think because of the price spike we're given a little bit more time and it's looking like because of the the there's a lot more testing that has to go on because of so many eats we might need to look to more of a July release is my opinion but Alec I know you've been thinking on that what's what's your opinion if yeah so I can just run we come I train script again with the latest numbers let me just do that right now just for the fun of it okay hold on damn ice age so the current difficulty has run up to 40 wait but the block timers run up to fifteen point seven three the time stamp has gone up to one four nine five two and the block number has gone up to three seven three three one two three okay so if we want to maintain a twenty second block to keep the water time under 20 seconds then our deadline is July 14th and if we want to keep the block time under thirty seconds then our deadline is September 12 okay it gives us a good amount of time so is anyone willing to and I think it sounds like from until we freeze these eats we're not going to have a great estimate on testing without the accurate yuuichi in Demetri at least and once I started working in particular ap and sometimes find the issue so when making this and with any clarifications it useful you see the questions about the eighties in my pop up when we start working on tests okay yeah the feeling I'm getting is late June would be the absolute earliest for a release and that's if a lot of things go really well with testing does anyone have any other opinions that's again just my opinion based on just kind of seeing an overview of all of this we won't meet it in July okay you're saying it should be later than July yeah okay sounds good so what if the time you want to reserve for testing on the testament so the distance between fork and minute hotbox like it you're a fatality cutout try talking again the number people here I can hear you now or at least I thought I could get here mean a Vitalik yeah good hearing okay you're cutting out off and on but just try talking again I think we can hear you now hold on month either netting grab him okay if you disconnect reconnect that's fine until there was there any other comments on the timing and things like that the metallic there was a mention of district and testing so that when would the desperate for company winning the main net happen with this is that we talking about my assumption is Rob's then unless we create a new one I'm not sure I've heard those things mention the past few months I mean it has to be tested we're all clients can participate so exposed on drops Nancy yeah there's gaps not support Kelvin see if you're in supports neither ah I see okay so yeah what app it will need to be wraps and then yeah was being either oxen or during K be how to pronounce it but the ice if didn't Conklin increase we're option yeah and I think it should be Robson because that more accurately reflects that basically what the current conditions are it's a proof-of-work test net that consistently gets attacked whereas you know coven and rank B are more controlled so that wouldn't reflect true conditions oh yeah hoping nothing but happens during the fisting Butte like happen like last week something come into the specimens again it was doable exactly Nelson I thought I was going to say we can also do a Robson where we you know start from off either a snapshotted and minimize or compacted Genesis Bach or just a clean you know Genesis block oh yeah yeah and perhaps impose a you know a hard cap on the on the gas limit to prevent any kind of attacks and yes yeah just saying we don't have to you know um key props and going we can do a reboot or you know refresh in preparation for testing the hard for okay sounds good yeah so got a lot of options it seems like and I think this is something that doesn't need to be decided today necessarily does it make sense to increase the muting frequency okay I'm back my phone is freaking out can everyone hear me still yeah yeah I don't think it needs to be decided a because yeah because it'll be months before at least beyond you was the estimate you gave Dmitri you said after July is when we'd be able to test or it was after July when we'd be able to launch most moving boots lunch you need more time oh I see I see you're saying okay I thought you meant that the test wouldn't be done before July okay okay so it sounds like we can't really get a block number down today but between now and next meeting we're going to have the freezing of some of the eats and we're going to potentially have a little more standardization with the and also we can start looking at what it would take to do an alternative to just using what Robson is today and doing either a reboot or some type of configuration change okay see I think you already looked because you were involved in getting Rob stand back on its feet a few months ago would it be significant a significant changes to do some of the things you mentioned no not significant at all okay would it make sense to is a change freeze deadlines and after that LOC deadlines nothing can be changing any of the eats and if something is not in the state here happy with that it just dropped just iterating on ano a cheese fries base I think that's an okay idea except for the fact that some of these eeap's were decided on related to other eats so I believe static Hall revert and a few of those other ones were all intertwined in a way that made them work together best if they were all implemented so for something like that I feel like that would be an issue am i incorrect and thinking that I I think those stones are actually fairly specified okay so yeah they might not be as interconnected the tower can you hear us now yes I could hear you now okay so Casey just while you were gone Casey brought up that we likely would need ease ralston because we would need to use a test set that the clients can all support and additionally if we want we can because there's been a lot of Robson attacks lately we can do a reboot and configuration change to like live it you know guess or Mozilla get in Casey yeah hard cap on me on the gas limit one just fill the hard cap would be tested all the way right and I mean it's a software it was what a you know parity residue during the original attack but right we can enforce it in the soft work just you know by putting the majority pointing the mining power at the head of minor that imposes the limit right yep so that that's probably the route will go and then Dmitry stated that we wouldn't be able to really be releasing until August and until then we need to figure out the length of time that a test net would need to be on and so for instance like the test that needs to run for two weeks or six weeks or four weeks or what but what opinions that you have on the timing and anything like that metallic I am personally I'm inclined to say two weeks should be fuss should be fine the justification being that I'm practically speaking for all the previously IPS we've a to all two weeks has more is more we timely than we've ever had for a hard fork and also like I'm not sure that any more time will help much especially given that it like cloak of these air catching is gonna be done before everything even gets released okay yeah that sounds like a fair point with I guess with the caveat of that would be if there is an issue found the I guess it would be extended in that case correct okay that sounds reasonable so let's just say this it definitely won't be the end of June and if things go right over the next few weeks we're going to have a number of things such as freezing eats and some testing improvements additionally if there is anybody on this call or who listens who is able to help with testing and wants to pitch in please reach out to myself Demetrio Ichi or Martin hosts one day and we can get you hooked up on that we could use all the help we could get in that area so yeah if anyone can devote any kind of resources that would help move things along for metropolis ok I think that is pretty much the end of that so the conclusion to that bullet point would be that we don't have a date and there's going to we're going to know a lot more the next meeting but it's definitely not going to be into June and the testing time for the amount of time a test that would be running before we actually launch would be at minimum two weeks and we'll have more discussion on that next meeting okay um let's see the time we have a couple of minutes so Christian if you wanted to just get some feedback on your thing real quick that can be the last item all right so yeah death developers also face the problem that they it's quite hard to see when the user interface needs to be updated and also wallet developers currently have no way to see whether an external account get resistant transfer via an internal call so it might be beneficial to implement something like yeah a listener filter index data structure that is filled or triggered whenever an account is touched by anything inside a transaction yeah Arkady said that something like that is already implemented by parity and what our other client developers thoughts on that I I proposed thus ago Syrian before building blend filters for all the accounts that were in some way touched by a request so that he can narrow narrow down at the time it wasn't usually popular because you just elected actually trace the calls in order to determine what change or you know potentially take down once before and after the block but I still drink it it could be worth doing and I guess the other objection was when I take it or disfavor our Connie do you haven't can you may remember about how much disk space that good nice well when I have to look it up but from the top of my head it's like conditional 20% data missing oh and how big is the bloom filter in blocks at the moment for topics [Music] it's qw 6 bytes right so fishing a similar size we're talking about let's see about another nine gigs and gigs no sorry nine needs for the same opens a blockchain applies over here and which you could probably expect and X data basically about the same again more so even if we're using the transformed bloom filters that we're creating to gif so the slider that it may not be significant okay so um besides one be significant forget any other clients have any comments well another objection is that my clients wouldn't be able to execute these queries yes ultimately this is either this was client specific all we define an API flourish in which it's a nappy seasonal thing growling a consensus little thing academic with any reason to adverse to consensus personally I mean you don't have to trust a response I mean so if an account was touched they can always verify by by running the transaction and it and it's very lovely but a client could maliciously leave out a change so you don't detect it yes we want to see sorry I mean it's still very useful even if it has that property I would say yeah I think it's useful as a client site optimization anyway I mean the ideas you register a callback whenever your accounts are touched and when they are touched you just read their state again so and you can also read the state at regular intervals to avoid the the attacks of not being notified okay so is this already an eight-person I don't know yet I said that this was referencing Annie birth this is just an idea and I know I don't know I mean yeah we should focus on what's up with anyway but I just wanted to get some sense Uday okay sure the problem cool so yeah feel free to eepa phi that and the trademark that term and yeah i think that is the last jim that'd anyone else have anything or didn't want to read anything neat in the troll box that they want to announce something that we made up not known I would understand anything in the troll box so I had no idea what they were saying there's no other topics I decided to I shouldn't wait on anyone with ideas about address checksums I'm working on an address check some format so here come talk to me yep I would like to talk okay with Stuart cool all right anybody else I talk to you guys for the up go head Nick no I was I was just going to ask parity folks whether they were going to implement any any time today to do this good to go [Music] yeah all right I thanks everybody talk to y'all in two weeks Oh you
