foreign [Music] well I hope you're ready for this talk um I'm certainly not this is usually this is usually a speech that I give half drunk in a bar somewhere to a potential Consulting client um I'm hoping it'll work here as well so five day cons in five minutes why am I qualified to give this talk I'm not very prominent I have to accomplished any great thing but I have been to almost every Devcon except the one that was in Gavin Wood's living room so you can see here proof of t-shirts um I did think the obvious thing of just like stripping through them on stage that idea did not survive beta testing you you wouldn't appreciate that so um as with everything in the short story I'm going to impose a narrative arc on what I'm doing so this is as much perception my perceptions in reality but I would see that they've gone softly going like this nerds met Bitcoin that was the very beginning within a grown-up technology very respectable we were rich and fabulous as anyone remember 2017. it's not a point of Honor but it was fun followed by cry and build I would describe that stage as but it's still a time when a lot of progress was made and then people discovering Society so uh Devcon one was really small it was basically the size of this room except reasonably full um it had one line for coffee that was the only catering that we had um Casper proof of stake was first mooted here um a lot of stuff was said about the benefits of smart contracts and they had a sort of nice academic feel um the Dow was proposed there I think in the side events um and ethereum was denial of service attacks um you'll notice a theme on there and here is an example slide you can see it was a very very nice Hall Dev Contour is my favorite Devcon um because I seemed artificially cool because Shanghai is a confusing and artificial and scary environment and I'd already been there five or six times before so I looked like I knew what I was doing um this is when it really became respectable the IBM was there people had stalls people from Chinese local government showed up it was great um for very obvious reasons um Safety and Security were big things formal methods came in um it was still very much bring your own nightlife people just hung around the hotel or said they were going to certain bars vitalik was in I think the sheep's head Pub it translated to quite often um and it was it was it was very small you could just go up and talk to Joseph Levine it was it's very communal um ethereum classic were there if you want that story get me a beer later um the Dow was informally postmortem quite a bit um and in accordance with what was then tradition ethereum was denial of service attacked in the middle of the event um but it was a lot of fun as you can see and the catering was good it's also where uh Pookie boo bars string game started uh which have been a constant feature I'm not sure if he's doing them these years but if you see people with just bits of string and sticks stunts bits of uh strings I've stuck to themselves that's because of him Devcon three if I want to leave you with one image from this talk um my timer stopped that's probably good um if only one image of this talk um it's me on a pontoon that's a golf club there's a party like for two hours without figuring out who is actually paying for it talking about mortgage security as well being brought whiskey everything was going to be great there were lots of people used to work in multi-level marketing the corporates were a bit more quiet a lot of stuff was focused on the use cases there are also a lot of zero knowledge of side events um dexes came along um it was all pretty good Prague the money went away but there were lots of developer tools and Prague is great the beer was excellent um it's probably the first time I felt that we had proper tooling for what we were doing um so on the whole there were a lot of paper that is everywhere and blockchain's LLC was quite an event there was a huge haul with this girl as a hologram I still don't know who she is how am I doing for time okay two minutes good I'm okay um Osaka I think Osaka was a point where actually the money hadn't quite come back but if anything that was a good thing a lot of people looked at ethereum 2.0 um there's a lot to talk about crypto law and that was actually something people started to think about you know Society law the general world that was good ELC 721 came along foreshadowing the nft Boom the generalization of crypto kitties which is previously we need these things you had to refer them as something kitties I did climate kitties for carbon credits at one point and uh Ava and Libra came along which was cool and Japan is generally beautiful um I skived off a lot to go to the castle and stuff like that Devcon Bogota is of course whatever we make of it um everything is still to be announced even the beer the coffee has been very good so far you'll notice I've comment on that a bit and here are many thanks to people on Twitter who help me with things um the pictures you see that are um not mine are from them and you can see that in the speaker's notes which I think will go up online I'll redact them in a minute um and here are some really good articles about things that went on there that I would very much suggest if you enjoyed this talk thank you very much [Applause]
