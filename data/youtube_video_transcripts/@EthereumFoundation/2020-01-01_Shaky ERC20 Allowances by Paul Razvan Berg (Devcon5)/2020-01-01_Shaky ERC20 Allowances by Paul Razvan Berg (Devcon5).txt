[Applause] oh well and I won't be talking about yesterday Lucas is every three developer has been true exe 2000 codebase probably used opens up and goes and yeah I'm going to be talking about about about a very specific feature which is the max approval thing many valves have been using it and it's way less your than we may think a bit of a meat on building this for legal severe on an out and performing on real-time payments you might not get your salary every seconds and I publish the Beza original of project in early this summer and of course I loop the other doubts and I saw that they have this massive rule faint acceptance - that's cool it's easy because you have a point after you ask your resource once and then that's it so this is like how it looked you have to prove the savior called her once and those it all things worth one fine for like one or two months I had like 50 people was thing 100 I totaled so it was not a big deal I was like it's fine if there's a body spotlight no because of this thing there was a bug and when a big one is even if in the culture killing had 100 died at risk I boots by mistake more than 10,000 to total because there was a bug in the contract that allows people to create streams what I said like real-time pavements using the year spent allowance and pay themselves basically using the money that was not in the contract funny enough demanding the contract was safe but the money outside the contract was nothing that's what I like to think that chocolates ain't missing the forest for the trees so that tree is your smart contract beautiful secure and and whatnot but the ear strange allowance is basically back and you're not seeing it so hope can you solve this you either all we have to build Wallace I don't feel like kinda 30 days but this is bad like penny why there's no way I can easily explain this to to anyone it's just a big number it looks like some half wants to steal all your money from the world right right now even if it's just looking cool already so there's that and it's the back end this is what we can do as developers there are three solutions the first one being that you can use the different token it's like I'm here because most tokens are gear c20 and yeah just we're stuck with this standard moment but hopefully the future will be using more Astana's like this then you can use the matter rapper that philippe customer I think developed a way to deposit dye and use it in a safer manner I think they use this where so they use it within you on standard developer engine poles 11.5 good but still requires user input so that's quite troublesome and optimal solution is signed to transactions so we don't you adapt and you have like a troop and then spend and even if that is slightly better you ask you can sleep better because you know that in case there's something bad all the like the forest is fine forest safe right so kudos for it kickback for doing this I think UI is good enough I didn't have any problem with what the long event and that's pending so all those it thank you for [Applause] you
