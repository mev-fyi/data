[Music] hello thank you thank you all for being here thank you all for coming ice I saw the presentation by Amber Bell day and Patrick Nielson yesterday and there was a really good joke when they got to the part of their presentation was that was about their own project amber was talking and Patrick stopped her and interrupted and said have we reached the Schilling point so my talk today is a hundred percent about Zi cash so it's like all shilling point but not in the sense of asking you to buy more to pump the price but to share a bunch of stuff that we've learned recently in cryptography and in regulation that everyone else can hopefully reuse and benefit from okay first of all can we bring up the house lights so I can see you better I can see these people all right well everyone please put down your phone and stand up for a minute you and Zizi 99 up there would you please put down your phone and stand up for a minute okay everyone except that guy have stood up okay good if you have never heard of Zeke ash will you please sit down okay great Wow okay so if you've heard of it but that's really like you've just heard of it you don't know anything about it would you please sit down so that's like a tenth okay sweet so then I can skip that part which is good because I was practicing my talk this morning and I found at Oh like the rest of you can sit down - thanks but don't get your phones out leave the phones out away yeah as pricing my talk and I realized that I put like an hour's worth of content into the slides and that we have 28 more minutes and I want a lot of questions so I'm going to talk too fast and skip a lot of the technical content but the goal is to say what we've just recently accomplished in cryptography a couple pointers to possible future work that other people might also want and then talk about the regulatory situation so what just now accomplish d'cach√© as you all know except for that guy and like 10% of these guys is a separate cryptocurrency that includes encryption and cryptography to make all the transactions private and it was launched two years and four days ago on October 28th so Z cache is two years old and that makes it like II theory I'm a grizzled veteran of the space and and four days ago on Z caches second birthday we introduced the first major upgrade which is called sapling or z cache 2.0 and the improvement so the first thing we did which most of you probably kind of know is we pioneered the use of zero knowledge proof s-- just real quick raise your hand you know what a zero knowledge proof is or you've heard of it or whatever great this is great what a great audience so I'm really proud that zero knowledge proof SAR so widely appreciated for what they could potentially do today because Z cache was the first application of them to anything in the real world as far as I know and that was two years ago but the first version we put out two years ago was not efficient enough it took 37 seconds on a like super computer laptop and it was not even possible on a mobile phone to generate the zero knowledge proof necessary to protect a single Z cash transaction so what we've just activated on maintenance and we've reduced the time from 37 seconds on the first version to 2.3 seconds in the new version really great because now it's possible for people to generate these on their mobile phone now no one's actually implemented it and made available there's not a client yet for someone to download and use but the cryptography has made it possible to implement that client and for every exchange everywhere to support these zero knowledge proof based transactions and so forth by query and Oh Cory's just getting ready because he's next so real quick the there are basically three components of the cryptography that we have worked on for the last two years we have a really really great team of cryptographers and engineers who've been working on this really hard for two years straight to get us this far so it's really a substantial advance that everyone else can benefit from because it's all open source all the science results we had to come up with have been published in peer-reviewed science papers we didn't apply for any patents and there's no barriers to anyone else we're using this for any other purpose okay the three major advances we had to do the first one is replacing the hash function inside the so-called circuit that you have to prove when you make a transaction and this is potentially useful for a lot of other people because hash functions are used everywhere great cryptographer once said that hash functions are like the nails of the internet they're used to hold everything together there's nothing you do that doesn't have at least one hash function inside well two of our cryptographers came up with a more efficient way to mate to implement a certain kind of hash function called a peterson hash inside of zero knowledge proof and all by itself this reduced the runtime by 75% which is a really great improvement you might be able to use this yourself but you have to be careful because sha-256 and peterson have slightly different properties so it's not just a simple drop-in replacement for every use and the result of like nine seconds per like per payment is still not quite good enough so we kept looking for a couple of other innovations that would improve the performance while being safe enough and practical enough that we would be able to deploy it the next one well this is a complicated slide I'm going to gloss over this but this is a bundle of a proving system which is a snark that's BC tv-14 which we upgraded to growth 1614 2014 and 2016 are the years that these science papers were published there's an elliptic curve which would be in 128 that we upgraded to BLS 12 381 and by the way we helped aetherium add BN 128 into aetherium in the metropolis upgrade so now we have different elliptic curves from each other but whatever that's probably fine and then there's the implementation which is just open source libraries that anyone can use the older implementation is called Lib snark and the new implementation that we wrote over the last two years and we've now deployed is called bellman the old ones written in in C and assembly except we never used the assembly because it simply is dangerous and the new ones written in rust which is even safer than C and all of this stuff is reusable for any zero knowledge proof system and all bundled together it gives you twice as fast which can be necessary for some uses and then the last thing is a thing called a split circuit design which I probably don't have time to explain but it gives us another 50% improvement and that's how we get down to 2.3 seconds for a typical transaction that's where we're at today okay next where would we like to go next well Z cache 2.0 sapling it's really fantastic it might be good enough for the foreseeable future but there's at least one thing that bothers me the snarks which is the proving system that we've started with all along it has this thing called toxic waste which why I call toxic waste cryptographers call it a structured reference string but toxic waste is a much better word because it makes it clear to you that this is a thing you should worry about if the toxic waste is a unguessable long random number it's like a private key and if you knew it you could Forge z cash out of thin air now that's terrible but but even if you knew the toxic waste you can't violate anyone elses privacy you can forge new Z cash for yourself but you cannot see or manipulate anyone else or anyone elses Z cash there's a limit to how bad it is but it still damn bad if you could 4g cache that would ruin the whole point so we went to this extravagant effort and did I'm pretty sure the most secure sophisticated cryptographic ceremony ever in 2016 to set up the system while preventing the toxic waste from ever coming into existence while making it making sure that nobody at any moment ever had a chance to generate that number and then we did a way way more sophisticated and secure ceremony last just recently this year for the new version so I'm really sure that the toxic waste can't possibly exist and a lot of people in this room actually contributed to that process to make sure that even if I were cheating and trying to steal a copy of the toxic waste there they would have prevented me from doing that and vice versa however this still bothers me because for one thing I can't convince everyone else in the world of this they can there could still be a Fudd where someone says I don't know I think maybe Zuko is saying that but he and a hundred other random people around the world were actually secretly in cahoots so it would be cool for Z cash as well as for other uses as your knowledge proofs if you could use one of the newer proving systems which have no toxic waste and this slide is all about how we can't yet in Z cash because we need all of the fields to be green for it to be efficient enough to put into the nakamoto blockchain design where the like the Z cash sapling design where every transaction has to have a zero knowledge proof generated and then the proof has to be transmitted with it and verified by all the miners that puts a lot of constraints on the performance and the new things like Starks which was a hugely popular overflow talk yesterday by Ellie Ben Sasse on who's one of the Z cash founders Starks take 45 kilobytes at least per proof string and that 45 a kilobyte is just way too much to put into the blockchain with every single transaction so that's a non-starter for now bottom line is there's only one row so far that we can do this with okay so but we so other people could use Starks for other things have different performance constraints and and we could potentially improve Z cash in legacy cash 3.0 with a few possible techniques that also don't really have time to explain here are four things that you should take a picture of cuz I don't have time to talk about them but they might be useful for Z cash or other zero knowledge proof systems for like the next generation and we have some very rough estimates of how much savings we could get so it's like mmm it's close it's interesting alright I'm just gonna scoot along here's something else I totally don't have time to talk about which is what if we changed the architecture okay I have to talk about it what if we change the architecture so it's not a simple bitcoin inspired Nakamoto consensus where you have to generate a zero knowledge proof with every transaction and then carry it along so what's good about is that we separated privacy from mining you know that all the privacy happens on the end-user computer who generates and encrypted and zero knowledge proven transaction and then all the rest of the consensus algorithm just deals with these encrypted blobs but what if we changed it to new consensus algorithm sharding maybe you can use your knowledge proofs to solve some of the problems in some of the currently unsolved problems and consensus algorithms and sharding anything like that would open up the constraints back here so we could if we had a much much more high bandwidth consensus algorithm then we could use Starks even though they have like two orders of magnitude greater bandwidth requirements and stuff like that okay possible changes not coming anytime soon to z cache because we're conservative and it took us two years to upgrade the cryptography it'll probably take another two years to me the next upgrade alright now I mentioned back here one of the three improvements that we've already vetted and gotten security audits and deployed and tested and then activated on main ed and now people are using it today the third one is split circuit design and it's specific to a payment system like Z cash it's not well I don't know if you could if you could apply the same kind of principle to other zero knowledge proof systems but I'll describe it real quick this is the old Z cash 1.0 core this is all the bits of data coming in and out that need to be proven by the zero knowledge proof you don't have to understand in any of it except for what these big ole things on the left zu t XO that's two coins that are being consumed and two new coins that are coming out so if you are paying someone you're probably going to consume a coin that's worth timsy cash and you're gonna give them five and then you're gonna give yourself change for five this is the so-called UT EXO data model from Bitcoin which is different than the balance data model from aetherium so the zero knowledge proof in the original Z cash 1.0 has to prove the correctness of all of these pieces even if you were only spending one coin you have to prove the correctness of that coin and a dummy which takes twice as long so the split circuit design is we'll have two proofs one proof that you're consuming a coin and a different proof that you're producing a new coin and that way if you're consuming only one coin you only you don't have to prove you're consuming two coins and that all by itself is a 50% savings but the and it's useful for all you TXO style systems earlier I said it's for transaction systems but the UT EXO style might also be useful for a theorem style smart contracts there's a new paper by some scientists that includes some of the Z cash scientist called Zechs ez exe which describes how to extend the Z cash style data model and zero knowledge proving system to through the validity of arbitrary smart contracts without without having the minors run all the smart contracts so instead of the execute instead of someone submitting a smart contract or executing a smart contract and all the minors run it and then they consents on the resulting output instead the first person runs it and generates a zero knowledge proof but this is the correct output and then all the miners just verify the validity of the zero knowledge proof that's that's the new paper okay oh good I'm gonna have lots of time for questions I hope you have questions because I totally glossed over all the complicated stuff in the last two slides you can ask me about those if you want alright finally about the regulatory situation so you have probably heard that law enforcement and regulators and governments fear privacy or that privacy technology like Z cache is incompatible with regulation and I'm here to say that's totally wrong it's not incompatible with regulation and the actual regulators are not afraid of it and are not trying to prevent it so there's this widespread missa like common myth that is that is the actual problem it's not the regulators there's the actual problem here's the current very simplified state of the important things in the world which is that almost everywhere the legal status of cryptocurrencies in general and Z cash in specific is ambiguous in China and in India it is all cryptocurrencies z cash bitcoin aetherium etc are all effectively banned and here's the really interesting little appreciated fact that I want to tell you in the United States there's a regulator called the New York Department of Financial Services which is the most important regulator of crypto currency's because even though technically they're only supposed to be regulating the state of New York but almost every company who wants to serve Americans does not want to exclude New York and this this regulator the New York Department financial services set themselves up as the the gatekeepers and the arbiters of all cryptocurrencies years ago when they made this thing called the bit license which says if you want to if you're a company you want to sell cryptocurrencies like you're in exchange or whatever you want to allow people to trade in cryptocurrencies and you're serving citizens of New York regardless of where you're located if citizens of New York are among your customers then you require our prior permission to do anything that's that's how the bid license works and so therefore all of the cryptocurrency companies have been queuing up to ask this regulator for permission to do all the things ever since here's the little understood fact that that regulator has approved like about seven different coins as being legal for people to serve to the citizens of New York and Z cash is the seventh one the most recent one yeah thanks it's really important and and they explicitly went so far as to put out a press release under their like official logo and the name of their official leader and superintendent and all that which expressly mentions the encrypted feature of Z cache and when I tell people about this they sometimes ask me what you know why did they do that what are they thinking and I don't know for sure because they didn't make a they didn't give a justification or an explanation of their decision in their public press release and I met with them in private to explain cryptography to them many times and they didn't tell me anything in private either cuz like they're the government and they're the who asked the questions but one thing I do know is that I've become very familiar with all the rules and regulations in the United States and in Europe and so on and one thing I do know is that Z cache and cryptography mixed with block chains in general is absolutely compatible with the rules and regulations as an exchange or any business that's dealing like the regulations the way that's currently done they apply to businesses like exchanges or financial institutions they don't apply to program software developers or individual users but as an exchange you can comply with all of the requirements while supplying encrypted Z cash to your customers that's that's a fact so that's something that the NY DFS the New York Department of Financial Services and my team discussed and then this really interesting thing happened where they called my team back to New York for another meeting I've never talked about this publicly before and I thought to myself I think we covered everything in all the previous meetings so it's not clear what why they need another meet maybe it's to tell us something and we all like filed into the official building in New York City and we all lined up on the opposite sides of the official table and they opened the meeting by saying the the leader of the NY DFS he was present in the room gestured to their colleagues and said we all agree that we don't want the pocketbooks of our families and the citizens of our communities to be exposed to everyone on the Internet [Applause] yeah so that's all they ever said with it I think that was why we had that meeting but I think it really shows that regulators and the rest of us in this community share a lot of values we want a safe and prosperous society and we all want a society in which the citizens have meaningful political participation and we want people to be protected from crime and fraud and encryption technology is compatible with all of that I'm reminded of 25 years ago now when I was playing a tiny niche role in an earlier round of this drama when SSL was being invented SSL TLS and at that time the United States one small faction within the United States government headed by the FBI and Al Gore and the NSA opposed the invention of SSL because it might like allow criminals to use the internet or something and that's funny now because 25 years later the US government requires you to use SSL right there's a ton of laws which say if you do not use SSL to protect your customers then you were in violation in a lot of specific cases and I kind of think that's the same thing that's going to play out with encryption on blockchains eventually and hopefully a lot less than 20 years all of the good regulators and all of the good countries will require this kind of encryption to protect to the people and lastly I want to say that I myself and everyone involved in the Z cache project is doing this just because we care about what kind of world we're building for our children and grandchildren to grow up in because privacy is a human right and it's necessary for political participation for morality and for intimacy and human relationships and it is not okay for our societies to continue careening into a world where there's pervasive and intimate violation of everyone's privacy by one or three centralized actors that's never been tried before it's wrong and it's dangerous Thanks and and all of us are part of our opportunity to change that and to make a world that's safe and healthy for our children to grow up in that's it ready for questions you got to come down to the or you got to acquire a mic so that the people on the livestream can hear the question thank you um thanks for your thoughts and I really like how you actually twisted that whole thing that whole thing that people often say about like think of the children right yeah but but in the right way right that's really good so I wanted to ask you what your thoughts are on similar privacy projects like one arrow and I also wanted to ask you about smart contracts and other features that you seem to have not focused on yet and if you have any intention to look at those well those are two big questions okay so first of all there was a really great talk by Z cash founding scientist Iain Meyers yesterday in which he laid into Manero and all all systems that use what he calls decoy based privacy so you should go watch the livestream if you have or the recording if you haven't seen it now the zero knowledge based privacy that we have has different problems but privacy is really really hard and I wouldn't want it to look like we've solved it but we've made a substantial improvement that everyone needs to learn from and I like to work with them when I row people on that and we both benefit from each other and the other question was about smart contracts yeah so it's something that we've deliberately kept out of Z cache and kept out of the public like discussion of the future of Z cash in order to keep things simple like in theory we could extend Z cash to execute arbitrary smart contracts and as of about three weeks ago maybe a few scientists that includes some of our scientists published a paper describing in a lot more detail how that would work and what the efficiency would be and what the security properties would be and so forth but so far I kind of want smart contracts to keep working on a theory 'm and just pure private payments to be the focus of Z cash but that could change hey um so besides just winning the or educating users about shielded transactions could you talk a little bit about the rest of the stars that need to align across governance business and technology to make that become a default whoa amber the questioner is a member of the board of the Z cash foundation which is a separate thing from my company I'm the CEO of the company and the Z cash foundation that amber is a director of is a completely separate independent thing and it sounds like a question that amber should answer what was that aside from its PI it's tied for me educating users governance and business oh can I have my slides back I have a slide about this anyway a major the major touch point between oh yeah thanks perfect the the premiere touch point between regulators and the technology and between users and the technology right now is exchanges right this is a map of all of the exchanges that already provide Z cash to their users and so they are actually the most effective both at educating the users and at educating the regulators note that there are none in India or China there are lots in US and there are lots in Singapore Hong Kong Korea etc one more thing that is really necessary is better UX as everyone I think has figured out we've all done this backwards by building the technology first and then trying to figure out how to put a user experience on top of it so now we have to fix that and make a really good user experience and then figure out how to fit it to the technology that's my answer any other questions yeah do you think a connection between Zika and aetherium is possible Oh a connection between Zika and aetherium oh that's a great question hey listen there's this e IP for Blake to a secure hash function please please contact your friendly neighborhood aetherium developer and tell them that you support the Blake EEP because that would be one way to reduce the gas costs of of etherium smart contracts evaluating the Z cash proof-of-work which might allow certain kinds of connection there's this whole crazy idea that is not is purely hypothetical but vitalik brought it up first so I can say it which is Z caching aetherium could just merge well so like I don't know how this would work yeah I appreciate the support but in the meantime I think people using multiple different networks and technologies for different purposes is the the practical the pragmatic thing to do but there are a few I Technol technical ideas for how we can have decentralized trustless cross-chain Interop and one of the details that would help is the e IP about blake - thanks hi I heard you saying couple of months ago in a podcast interview that it sound proximately 7% of all the transactions on Zika are shielded what's the state of the shielded transactions today and what needs to happen that technically we will see more of them right so very so Z cash I didn't get into this Z cash supported backward compatible clear text mode it's like HTTP and HTTPS for a long long time everyone still supported HTTP but then more and more people started supporting or even requiring HTTPS similarly Z cache allows the old Bitcoin style non private mode and the questioner was pointing out that most transactions used only the old unencrypted mode and what needs to change so the first there's two things first of all well three things sorry it's a lot but first of all the cryptography which is the whole first part of my talk is that we needed to reduce the computation cost from 37 seconds on a laptop down to like a couple of seconds so that that reduces the barrier by the way this also reminds me when SSL was new it was expensive and you know computers were a lot weaker back then and that was one of the reasons why it took so many years for SSL to become ubiquitous but the other one is all these exchanges need to start supporting all these exchanges need to start supporting the encrypted mode in order to protect their users and they need to understand which they mostly don't because of this FUD they don't realize that the regulator's are almost certainly okay with that they just need to tell the regulators this is user protection it's compatible with all of the regulations and we need to do it to protect users so after you contact your friendly neighborhood eutherian developer contact your friendly neighborhood crypto currency exchange and say you want encrypted shielded transactions like SSL instead of HTTP in order to protect you the last thing is UX like we're making a new wallet and stuff I didn't have time to get into any more questions hi thanks for moving this project forward so I have a question about society you are doing a service for the business where the business resolves their transactions payments and of course yeah there is a dis notion of privacy that you know counterparties did that different parties they don't know they don't want to know about like with who the business is done so perfect use case do you think that or up to your knowledge if on the top for the tax reasons some regulatory or tax authority could come and ask to the service provider so let's say in this case which is built on top of the said case to reveal all the details about like a certain entity okay I think I understand the question if you have encrypted transactions on a public blockchain like G cache can some party in your case it's a tax authority come ask some other party to reveal some of the transactions yes this is a really ittle appreciated fact about encryption encryption doesn't give you all dark all the time or no one can see anything what encryption gives is selective disclosure of data so Z cache is the first ever thing that it combines the blockchain properties of canonical of Hindle data with the encryption properties which is that if you have the decryption key that lets you see some of the data in the blockchain you can give that decryption key to a third party and then they can see that data in the blockchain see what I mean that's really interesting yeah so it's subtle but the bottom line is it's possible to reveal data to some parties without revealing it to all unauthorized parties in the blockchain which is good but that would require to share the private key no not not the key that allows you to spend money a different key that allows you to see the transactions but not to spend the money make sense hey Zuko you talked a little about the regulatory landscape and the ban in India do you have any like more insights to share or anecdotes from what's going on out there regulatory it's not too much my place to say I mean the the the government of India band banks from serving Bitcoin companies in India several weeks ago and then just a few days ago the most terrible thing happened one of those Indian Bitcoin exchanges which is one of the longest-serving Bitcoin exchanges in the world they set up since they were since the banks had been required to cut them off they set up ATMs that would take rupees in paper and give you bitcoins okay because that was like the only remaining legal thing for them to do and then the most horrible thing happened about two weeks ago is that they were arrested which doesn't make any sense under the law any law that I've heard I don't know what's going on so that's that's the last thing I heard about India so as somebody who thinks about privacy all the time and you paint a picture for us let's say you know projecting from today to end years into the future how would decentralized applications actually provide privacy for people not just on the transaction level but on many different levels yeah that's that technology it's possible technologically and there's this thing called Zechs easy exe which is a science paper that describes a technology that could accomplish something along those lines it's possible cryptographically speaking to have shared you know distributed apps which you get the the property you want I don't know the right word for it but the property is that you know the app is going to do the right thing and it can't be like subverted by the owner of the server since there's no server you can have a distributed app which when you use it you don't have to link what you're doing to anything else about you you don't even have to necessarily reveal the moves you're making within the app so it's a lot of work no one's actually implemented it yeah but scientifically it's possible why do you think the adoption of Zedd cash on dark net market has been almost zero and is that something that bothers you or do you not really care why do I think the adoption of Z cash on dark net markets is almost zero and is that something that bothers me I think my you know my best guess is so I mean part of it is I've made some tweets saying screw you criminals go away this isn't for you and and that doesn't really change the scientific or the open source code but I honestly think because I heard this from someone who studies like the criminal underground that criminals don't trust C cash because they don't trust me and that doesn't bother me I think that's that's good it's like the darknet markets are a shitty shitty early-adopter market because they're they're small you you wouldn't make they wouldn't be very active users it's a tiny little minority and then it would turn off the rest of mainstream society who would associate you with crime and drugs and whatever so it doesn't bother me so how the case is expanding in Japan there are some outlets which can legally accept currencies put on balance sheets are there any obstacles for wider adoption into Fiat world because of this privacy I didn't understand the beginning of the question how is you cash what yeah so are there any obstacles from regulators and other authorities to use the cash in Japan Japan yes in Japan where the cryptocurrencies are allowed to be used for buy and sell local goods there there is an obstacle which is the there's a Japanese self-regulatory organization which is the Japanese exchanges that have published a draft proposal for how they think the government ought to regulate them which says that the government should require them not to supply Z cash and I think that's a mistake on their part is that they like a lot of people incorrectly think that encryption is incompatible with consumer protection and an email kyc processes and computer security and all that so I'm hoping that they will notice the example of NY DFS doing the opposite maybe they'll even learn from the example of HTTP 25 years ago but that's currently in play so so Japan is gray on the map because it's not it's an ongoing conversation right now it's not settled okay no more questions thank you very much for being here [Applause] you
