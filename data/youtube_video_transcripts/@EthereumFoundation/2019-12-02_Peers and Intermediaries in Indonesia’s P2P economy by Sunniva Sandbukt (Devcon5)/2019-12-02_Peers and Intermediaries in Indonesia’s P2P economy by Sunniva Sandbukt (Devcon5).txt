[Applause] welcome to the stop all of you my name is Sarah segmented I'm a PhD student at the University forever member estroux technologies in practice research and my work is on the social infrastructure of digital payments some I call it which is looking at the people and networks that may belong to presentations so you can use of technology and how technology affects our relationships and this talk is going to briefly curse' findings from various research project on digital natives and Indonesia so finally I shouldn't work so for context at the gentleman watching we talked about onboarding using this - Lisa's I don't people in scripture and ideally others are using today and so this talk focuses on commercial items or in particular proprietary platform and looks its how users are actually interacting with this main traditional knowledge specifically digital law that occurs relatively recently and specifically I am interested in the relationships between Jeanine Aries and internet version that space and the potential peers of Morgan referred to as community famous so my research took place in Tunisia which hustle by position of over 260 million people and currently with doing really like the present a very specific profile about increasing digitalization or he refers to as Indonesia 4.0 bringing in bells are sound familiar yes so this is growing emphasis on e-commerce so what did the digital human look like in Indonesia well fragment infrastructures for connectivity and deregulation to the telecommunications industry has led to really rapid uptake of mobile phones because there was between the more affordable than traditional met lines 80% of each end users can access that by using their smartphones or tablets which is kind of a problem out of things you know anything a mobile phones less than half of us work for myself not access an infant many of those who do accidentally are also doing so with allocated gigabytes that are remaining targeting so here so for example [Music] Facebook users surveys come out showing that many which is something to think about when we talk about things like we've run coming out and if we're excited to that is that you might for pointed out that even though they can explain to me and he said why girl well came across them they don't actually use me because smartphones are social call these records they simply don't have enough space for more than one pin about and they would much rather forever types of so he needed UPS all the photographs and for Instagram so infrastructures of payment are also quite fragmented and how much huge lack of interoperability secure and the regulations where you see seven different card readers by are providing for banks to perform above a statements less than half of the mutant population has access to formal financial services and that includes it which associates them ability to actually get cash in your local community and of those only an estimated 11 percent of account holders have other parts so systems like this are still for the shoe low access to conventional financial services any person uses smartphones means the digital payments originally made for institutional gap community hope so this is why we see this rapid growth of digital pains in the data and particularly this path contract which is a video just for exterior flourishing and in parts Bank rules which jutted 1 billion dollar deletion so absolutely these allow users to top up your infrastructure memcache and it doesn't be an agent and they can use that app to make a digital transaction in a specific situation so many wasn't use a debt to perform these bridges important to show for GABA the web server the proxy banking banking lights each other in people's lives something that you can upgrade with to get more features such as - advocate or send money to your friends so this particular officer has a smooth healing service they're gonna call it that someone would come up 2015 normalizes math and to the 17th is developed this built-in wallets which now bridges an entire ecosystem of apps that range them to acquire to move food to go massage although we should pay inside the app using their wallets and the wallet of course is called cocaine just several theater so where I can be elephants well I've heard it said a lot of times here that technology is not a mission artifacts reshape it and it shapes us and the aspirations of the technologies creators tend to the implementing houses or other technologies that we make so forms of money also convey meanings and they tell us pollinator nice and this I think is a pretty familiar of thought or ethic when we talking the etherion community it also means that notices when mobile money transactions to not be concerns considered as isolated individuals decision to make about our purchasing her money behavior are not contact street there are affected by some expenses so what does project tell us about the communities we live in or the ones that they may imagine us living this is a stills from anatomies 2016 it's an advertisement that was made in the context of Ramadan so it starts to be done her mom her mom's mother rich is working for this app there's multiple clips she's driving to drone marches she's left her about Good Morning America and she goes for the whole package so she's driving around all day it's with hot passion just crank you their room and on the final pastor is he Orphanage as the driver watches of happy children which is stylis meanwhile help her daughter to move differently and inside there's a card for mother explaining that she can't leave home to break her bus if she has to make sure everyone else gets home in time to break the bus finally I should brakes if I suppose on the side of the road with a glass of water she starts to receive messages through the app from happy customers thanking her for her hard work given her a lot of Radiance so that presents to have a reason intended users there's the service provider and the service user seconding of the company itself is hardly present the role is intermediary only have curiam of the phones at the very end of that attachment and this is some users helping each other out through the sense of social responsibility rewarded by their thank here's the I possess the specifics level understanding of the I realize user performing set by social infrastructure roles while minimizing the role of interactions with me doubt these interactions are often being referred to increasingly as being emotion appear in Turkey so I regard you that too in this context is much more than just a directional message it's not just from here to here it's also a placeholder for the cemetery company and I would argue that the peas actually color really an adequate signifier for different types of user categories so originally a technical term if you keep describing a computer sharing files without a second server now thats increasingly seeing use to gain traction and a wide range of associated activity remittances lending watching and of course digital wallets the proprietor infrastructure governance practice by central in areas such as function in a social context when we use the word here or we associated with some quality something that they are for example leans heavily into and this I would argue is not really an accurate representation of the relationship between most peers that this app is trying to connect so many more like this the socio-economic cup so yeah finally socially mounted maybe the two in the PT represents the relationship but there has some company so not only do they in relationship to each other but else the relationship to the two so I asked drivers Indonesia about the relationship to my company the tires words explains to me that they are meets up meeting premise and during the focus group one of the dragon truck to the scene but we've never met just to be clear and this relationship which with Dragons leader is not in fact that you've encouraged them but they like to play leader from acacia material it for the company as the transactions made by the customers are profitable and thus the drivers become the tools to provide customers free services so in contrast the is magnetized some areas have specific mechanisms and interfaces in fact deliberately skew the relationship between the potential appears towards configured inequality there's incentivizing drivers some excellent tips and first one and is incentive tiers where they can achieve bonuses are called bonuses for artifact or the important element of the doing otherwise to be sustainable job so it's completely compulsory is reached in everyday items great drivers so what is the question of millimeters with my thumb to slap on can be the difference between continuing a job and being banned from the app if it's a book it on my star rating the apples assets roots of price and because of the mechanisms of quite a few seconds to decide whether not to accept them so drivers don't have a chance to make a decision about it and one piece one person pointed up because of my smartphone is some oh crap this interface goes beyond wreck you can see where he was going so I have to click before you know where this is going or how much on it finally cancellations drivers to maximum castle 25% of orders this means that drivers typically will ask customer hassle don't take the trip it's fine the app then it just a new but you're going pain did the try rested pencil when you're trying to pencil that and it turns out when you click it they will be suspended it doesn't tell you but they will be suspended they later on it's the Volta infer them to this entire and a list of pictograms which say anything from I reached the drivers drivers really far away you know a whole variety of different options for you to cancel with and basically a minefield about gold with consequences between you and the driver so not only uses which OPP conceal these embedded inequalities but it off the state's the role of the two into five in terms of the relationship which communities agrees so it's important to stress that users were not are selling passive consumers there are many examples of resistance to these out mechanisms a brief story about one man finds his brother died village to be a participant in funeral arrangements when it came back to junction where my research in place a journalist out that he found it wasn't receiving words not there driving around an entire day receiving new orders calls customer service and they told me there's no problem this is a journey just like carry on and after about 20 days of this finally and I gave up and stole his account for her all my tax dollars this was a pretty cheaper account because at the moment it wasn't receiving any orders but also it was in this dead brother's name which means he was able to change their way to make the contrary he also had to sell his ATM card to go witness extract insurance months later he recounted to me that the buyer had got in touch with Angelo in Rome and he finally managed to resuscitate accounts meaning of spiny receiving orders again the why I didn't come for they call therapy and brightly nurse affect health count their business attorneys where drivers to describe a variety of practices deployed to training algorithms that govern our institution with hot water so therapy is a permanent to mention it was also continuing practices maintained minutes accounts because it necessary for the job there Chavez government algorithms me so aside from the relationship brokered by the app customers in terms work together to grow up a platform in this informal arrangement they made ships offline so the drivers have worried the twenty percent cuts but the app takes on the trips they make additional booking Sedaris to reach that last point ear that they need to get their daily bonus they need my transfer drivers when drivers are waiting to take the order to get their order mr. Amerson is sitting like parents off which would come off like that buy yourself a coffee but that's kind of an interesting enactment that was period it doesn't materialize in the of itself so these are all strategies to be surviving within these proprietary platforms viable maintained and and a flexibility within this impose digital virginity beyond the fact that there is from the arrogant equality here there's also it's also for distressed that these two peer groups have not monolithic categories so not all pairs on either side there are multiple ways as well so not all diversity for conditions for participation may be lacking documentation or medica so many of the one rely on various vendors surrenders are a second floor and they allow drivers says Arne was registered in class for three reasons to get access to an online account Center and one weather like this could have a suite of up to a thousand drivers and they take it coverage we'd find a 30% range England depending on what kind of interests they also store all tracker data in an elaborate spreadsheet and then at the end of the day manually they had been transferred from that it comes to the driver's bank account or alternatively don't come back that should be their HP are some of you know assignments drivers are often members and communities for colonies which facilitate communication about how to access accounts so this is the business t3 injunction which has over a thousand members and here you can do membership singer sometimes like developing projects that building is base camp or for members in need which normally for whatever reason they brokered deals between driver services such as our repairs that are going to deal with amount of taxes these kind of services they show up in person talk about accidents by communicating excessively through they also help each passenger speak about losing cars because it really afraid opinion about reduce without the being accused of stealing something and of course there were market place for a country and even though they're voted as this particular ahead of this community even talk to me about me through the repayment system when they eventually operated from stickers to membership parts so that they be able to connect all these services that they have organized themselves the picture get somebody even further another site so also people who are using the services the other apps are not so people won't have smartphones or whatever other reasons are not accessing this counselor will have family or friends estranged to provide access to the platform as mentioned not everyone has access to an integer sorting so they will rely on going to public access points were my friends and they booked a mr. also to recharging stations such as this one and many my informants who will share their phones share their accounts their cars pins and other resources that they're using this absolute X us an example happened to myself when I must try to register the information I just chose a law but we can get a Superman so I found myself in a really frustrating situation of not being able to get a SIM card because they only had a passport with me that was formed no problem since the register remaining they'll be dealing okay so I got some current register than the stranger whose family are attending is they can come up to three great kids that's a lot of cards in register 1 enough months later my access completely denied because apparently found something else to do but number 2 so both service users and service providers remind agents to facilitate cashing in and cashing out so agents there are some ways to catch an amount and you can make a transfer in ATM if you connect into account to the bank you can go to the local mini-mart and pay a fee and alternatively the drivers themselves operate as agents that sell the digital balance for cash and might either as absurdly than according to the innocence of students of the option device over in one model go check drives on its face all hundred thousand rupiah which means they have a minimum two hundred thousand be available each state wants me my enviable this means that if you ask for less of that they're probably not gonna sell it to you and the other system a 20% cash back on my side you really can't sleep with us in wish this you should really say yes one driver also showed me what he had managed to connect his mouth without using this we call this digital token but basically what he had done and in himself to always have access to money on his phone meaning he had converted himself into sort of a poem about the joy needs them for users but also he converted his customers into compassionate allowance for himself because drivers need cash to pay for fuel and for food and all the other things that these products don't actually give him access to so all this and PC transactions on the surface digital transactions transactions that I've seen ones with streamlined or clean the messiness of the Cape's exchange replaced confined to the affordances of the user interface and the terms conditions set by the companies providing the pop world however the exchange of digital money is what farmer the financial transaction itself it contains this raises questions about how all of that current residents who fit into seamless ideas about new religious decision mediation trust business all of which are heavily part of this to summarize we presently include a few key takeaways intermediaries configure the relationships between users so configured for human access it's not a binary or a static I agree so contexts are not universal so you have to consider what experiences we are building for people will find ways to access the things that they need however many intermediaries is limited so success should be defined in terms of people's actual news not designers attacks so technologies that don't [Music] structure will be repurposed and appropriate it's need the real news abusers to address the problem to themselves define it slightly didn't all of that the thing though he was pretty  people support the flexible transition between digital and pension funds of money rather than necessarily talking about the illumination of cash or deal with it in a cashless society that's my 20 minutes this was a very brief for presentation talk to me [Music] [Applause]
