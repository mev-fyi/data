there is somebody has lost a wallet has been found there it is if that is your wallet please come to the registration do so to claim it secondly t-shirt sales closed at 4:00 p.m. today so go get them but not right now because right now I have to introduce Aaron Fisher and his talk on the colony reputation system yeah hello so I want to talk about the colony reputation system just gonna wait for the slides to appear here we go so you may know colony as a platform for organizing teams collaborating online doing work and that's very much what we're about its to use the blockchain to help us work together on projects that we care about we like to think of ourselves as the people layer of the decentralized application stack meaning that we're very much a blockchain company but our view of the world is not something like this but the blockchain front and center and people sort of as an afterthought of the periphery it it's about having using the blockchain as a foundation to help us coordinate and really do projects that we care about like that teams care about helping them work together to that end we want to create a platform for self-governance without a strict hierarchy that's flexible in in who controls and who influences what goes on and for this to to work we have a reputation system that allows us to wait our decisions it's not about voting per se but it's about people who put in a lot of work in a lot of effort earn reputation and then there's they have more say in the project at hand so what is reputation and reputation is fundamentally something subjective it's sometimes hard to pin down and we often talk about reputation in terms of reputation scores and so these here are not reputations these are scores that might convey reputation tell you a little bit of information so you might like a movie with a high tomato rating tells you a very specific thing and what that means to you is still subjective because you know you may trust IMDB ratings more than the tomato ratings and the information in each one of these ratings is very specific reputation really doesn't translate so you know if you have a high credit rating which is a type of reputation score what does that tell you about how good you are at tuning pianos very little right reputation requires context so it has to be more than just a single number like we cannot have no it just doesn't translate so the reputation system that we're working on today is we're going to talk about it's not just a number it has to be more complicated it keeps track of a lot of things your activity in the colony is what determines your reputation so it keeps track of the work you do but also in which domain so domains are like departments or working groups within a colony it keeps track of what skills you used what type of work it was how much you earned as a proxy for how big the work was you know was a huge task or little tiny fix how well you did your work what the other people thought about your work and more and more and more so it's very complicated it has to try to keep track of all of these different aspects so as an example suppose in our colony there's this top task called you know give our great talk and in our interface it might look somewhat like this so you can see up there I've been selected to do this task there's a bounty of a hundred tokens for it and it's been tagged with the public speaking skill the communications domain which is our communications department the DEFCON 3 server domain which is our working group for preparing for DEFCON 3 and if I do this task and I do it well then I'm gonna earn our hundred tokens in our colony but I also stand to earn reputation and I will earn reputation in the skill public speaking in the domain communications in the DEFCON three working group and so on and so on and how much I earn still depends on how I do the hundred tokens give us a proxy for how big the task is but if you give me a standing ovation at the end of this talk I can upload a video of that and then I earn extra reputation points for having done really well so I'll get back to you on that later the reputation that I earn helps us in the collective decision-making and what we want why so this system is a civil resistant decision-making mechanism you actually have to actually do work to earn reputation it's also meritocratic not plutocratic I mean what we mean is you have to do good work that your peers like to earn reputation it's not something you can buy so it's not the person with the most funds who has the most say within a colony on this level and although I'm not going to go into it too much I want to emphasize this is not about repeated rounds of voting this is more an implicit decision-making mechanism and votes are just a last resort so it's not bureaucratic and we use this for almost all day-to-day decision-making in a colony that asterisk by the way is refers to our last year's talk at DEFCON 2 about token weighted decision-making which still has a place for questions concerning tokens so token holders must have a say when you're deciding to dilute tokens but for the day-to-day activity it's your reputation that counts so you can get reputation as I said by working on tasks but also doing administrative work administrating tasks evaluating other people's work all of these things could earn you reputation and also policing the colony that is if you see people abusing the system by trying creating wasteful tasks if you go around flagging those that might be valuable you can earn reputation for doing that if you abuse that system and somebody else Flags your flags and essentially initiates the dispute process they could also earn reputation so we're trying to balance all these different actors and if you participate in the reputation mining procedure and that's something I will talk about later in this talk so reputation is an amalgam of all these inputs and it has to be this complex or let's call it nuanced to be useful to be truly useful we wanted to keep track of all these different aspects so the question is is this too complicated and what I mean by too complicated is that on the one hand we've got meaningful reputation scores and they're competing with the gas cost right the more complicated the calculation is the more it's gonna cost to interact with it on the theorem blockchain and that might make it less useful but even more so we're competing with the gas limit right there's a maximum cap for how complex our reputation update calculation can be and I'm gonna let you in on a secret what we're trying to do far exceeds the gas limit like this is not something we can do on chain so does it really have to be on chain does a reputation have to be on chain the easy answer is yes of course it does if you wanted to have any effect on decision making in the decentralized contacts on payouts or anything of that sort it has to be on chain because it's that's where this consensus relevant but our answer is it doesn't really have to be on chain like it's not necessarily to do the calculation on chain as long as you can prove to the smart contract what your reputation really is you don't have to do the rest on chain and the system I'm gonna describe scales nicely because no matter how many colonies domain skills or any other tweaks we put into the update formula we're only going to need 32 bytes to be stored on chain so the way that works is the following we have all of these reputations here so maybe our zero down there might be my reputation in our colony for the public speaking skill and our three might be I mean these are all the different reputations if they were on the blockchain the contract could read them what we do instead is we hash them now if those hashes are stored on the blockchain then no count the contract of course would not know what my reputation is but if I supply my real reputation are zero in a transaction the contract could hash it check it against the store hash and then it would also know that what I'm saying is and the next step should come as no surprise in this conference where Merkel trees are mentioned five times a day we hash them pairwise and pairwise and pairwise until we get to a single hash and that's the only thing we need to store on chain and referencing that anyone can prove what the real reputation is so the only thing we left to do is figure out a way to calculate the reputation route hash and to submit it to the blockchain so how does it make it to the blockchain and that's this reputation mining procedure so anyone can calculate the correct route hash everything that goes into changing reputation happens on chain completing a task administrating a task you know taking part in the colony so calculating it is not that hard but we need to figure out who can submit it to the chain and make sure that the submission is correct so the first ingredient is a little bit of game theory you can earn funds by submitting the hash and you can get punished for being wrong and for that to work we need to be able to prove something wrong so the key inside is you don't have to be able to do the calculation on the blockchain and figure out what the correct hash is as long as you can prove that a wrong hash is wrong and penalize the submitter of the wrong hash so suppose you want to take part in reputation mining you just simply set up your mining farm actually no you just take your laptop all you need it's a small calculation in the off chain world it's only hard in the context of aetherium you need to stake some tokens our colony tokens are needed to become a miner then you run the colony mining client and the colony mining client will monitor the etherium blockchain and collect all of the little events that happen that influence your reputation apply that to the reputation tree figure out the correct new route hash and then submit it to the blockchain having said that all miners of course want to be the one to submit it to the blockchain and we don't want to spam the network with too many submissions so there's this competition going on we're at the start of a submission window very few miners qualify and as the time goes on more and more miners qualify until all the submission slots are full and cycle will start yeah and then miners earn token miners aren't earning tokens is the paradigm in this space so that's no surprise that happens here as well and so that's the that's the overview of this mining procedure and I want to say just a little bit about this seal and why token so that you don't get the wrong idea by thinking this is all it does any colony has a token to do its internal accounting with and the seal and why token is a token of a colony the so-called common colony which it's a special colony it's it's the one that's responsible for managing the colony network once we're launched in a fully decentralized way it would we don't want to be like us as a colony team want to be responsible for maintaining the network indefinitely we also want to keep that decentralized and there is a special colony whose role it is to maintain the contracts and so forth and it's the this colonies tokens that are used in the mining procedure all other colonies pay a small Network fee to the common colony for the services provided the maintenance of the software and also for mining and if this network is profitable if the common colony is profitable people who hold tokens and reputation could expect a payout so there's an economics involved in this entire network that's more detailed in our white paper okay so let me talk about what happens if someone tries to cheat for our reputation mining to work all we require is a single honest miner which is good but if there are several submissions then one of them all that one of them we assume are wrong and how do we determine that so if there's two submissions all both parties have to submit a justification for what they've submitted which takes the form of another hash the justification route hash and these indices down here are all route hashes of a reputation tree so our h0 down there that's the route hash we agreed on at the end of the last cycle so we're all agreed on that and this one down the other end is the one that the miners submitted the one they claim is the new route and each step from RHI to arch I plus one represents a single update of a single person's reputation applied during the update period so if you agree on the very left and disagree on the very right at some point there's a first step where we disagree and what the contract does it challenges parties to prove the inclusion of a single specific reputation update step which is small enough to calculate on chain and by looking at the merkel proof it can determine where the discrepancy is and after a few iterations either one party will have to stop responding because we found out that they cheated or we actually determined a mistake in the calculation so the wrong hash gets discarded and whatever is left in the end is is correct and this is fully automated so if you run our mining client you will never have to deal with this this is all completely automatic and it also doesn't require a challenge response protocol of different actors the challenges come from the smart contract and is fully automated and that's because the reputation update while not being able to be done on chain is completely deterministic based on inputs from on chain events okay we released our white paper recently in September which just goes into this whole process in far more detail and also describes the economics of the network so why did we spend so much time on this we spend so much time on it because reputation really allows us to fine-tune the incentives we've heard a lot about crypto economic incentive systems and they often involve paying people to do things or penalizing them financially to do to try to get them to behave in a certain way but the reputation system also allows us to reward and penalize people in a lot immediately financial way and we can really fine-tune what we mean by good behavior and bad behavior and tweak that as we see fit and that's especially important because in this context of trying to avoid voting on everything we want call needs to be very fluid where for example if a task is created and I say I want to do that task if nobody objects it will happen there's no need to ask my team members so if you think of the teams you're working and most of the time you are agreed in agreement amongst yourselves and if every little action required a vote it would be a or in this headache so it's designed not to use that and if somebody goes in and forces a vote all the time they might they they might actually lose reputation based on abusing the system if they if you do it in just those moments where it really counts the system could pick up on that and you could be rewarded so because the calculation is off chain we can make it as complicated as we need to really fine-tune all the incentives of the actors in the colony and it's much more than we could ever do on chain and yeah one of the aspects that we really can't do on chain is the concept of reputation decay so reputation in our colony is not forever you earn reputation that means you then have influence in the colony but over time that influence decays away and that's a protection against people early on in the colony amassing massive reputation they have a lot of influence but it should not last forever so when you join a colony later you can assume that the people with the most influence now are the ones who did the most work in the recent past and that really evens out the imbalances over time so we think this is a key feature so back to the task that I'm working on right now when I upload the video of your standing ovation I'll get points for that for the talk last year at DEFCON 2 with Elena I will have I still have some points because that was relatively recent Jack right here gave a talk at I've con won his points have completely decayed away if he wants I mean really come up here and tell us some more about colony soon thank you so in summary the points are earned for doing good work and good is something that we can tweak and fine-tune to get the incentives right and these the the reputation ways your decisions all throughout the colony but we tried to keep them as local as possible again in the call in the interest of keeping making things as unburrow Kratt ik as possible keeping them within the small team within a department and don't always go to the full colony for every little decision and maybe importantly I haven't mentioned yet reputation doesn't translate from one colony to another and that's because there could be many different colonies and we have no idea what your there's no way to translate from one to the other what it means to do good work in one colony might have nothing to do with another and it relates to the various tokens so if one colony has a great work and this token is worth a lot the numerical values of the reputation might be quite low elsewhere they could be completely inflated and meaningless so it's within a colony but the reputation mining process updates everyone's reputation in all colonies in all departments in all skills so that's one global system within the colony Network this is our team our team has grown quite considerably over the last year and this photo was taken at our last off-site and in fact it's already out of date we've added more people since then it's a great group of people we like that a part of this team so I want to leave you with our advertisement for our blog the blog dot colon dot IO has a lot of good content that goes beyond just colony we write about regulatory aspects token sales of sharing equity agreements in in this decentralized space there's a lot of good content please do check it out find us on Twitter at join colony and I'm now ready for that applause innovation to prove that I've completed my task [Applause] hello the next session is building a decentralized court system to arbitrate to snatch contracts by climmob test the mic works so uh everyone can you have a mouse on the screen thank you so hi everyone so today we're gonna speak about arbitration of contract and the centralized quote so first let's start with a simple example you have Alice and Bob who met on financing platform and they agreed that Bob will make a website for Alice again three user and at least space Bob but Bob give a shitty website and Alice is not happy and wants her money back but since there is no charge back with crypto she has no recourse so to avoid that she could put money in a small contract if she gets a website great she sign and the contract baseball boom but in case we dispute Bob say no I've made website if you want something better you'll have to pay extra and both things that are right so they pay arbitration fees the dispute goes to an arbitrator and I will trade rock n roll which we trigger the previous mail contract which we move the phones the first catch is all cool the arbitrator know what this mark contract was referring about so to solve that the first when they created contract input the ash of the plain English contract and this way when the dispute they can show to the arbitrator what was the contract agreed in plain English and if there is no dispute its privacy preserving and no one has to ever know about what the contract was actually we can even do better imagine we have a contract with four pages pages one and two are on one topic which is three and four on the other one and you don't want to reveal both the topic of the contract if you only have one topic which is important for arbitration so use the Merkle tree and you just have to read all the pages which are linked to what you are disputing and the thing is that the arbitrator can be everything it can be a centralized party a multi seed or even it Dow and that's what clearance is I've given an example which is very simple which is use transfer money but in practice we can have way more complex way more complex dispute an enforcement as long as it's enforceable by a smart contract so with money with financing ecommerce crowdfunding you will have you have autos ICO the raise money but if the token buyer and not appease they have no way to get the money back so we will have my stone and when my son is rich you unlock the money and if the token order and the team don't agree that's a dispute online-gaming cheating social network you submit will you submit content which is against the chart you have a dispute you lose you remove the content and you penalize the party were rewriting the world intellectual property we've seen a nice example in the Def Con with ENS you have someone registering your trademark well you go to a DNS system to have blacklist you have a dispute to dispute is okay this is my trademark I don't want you to use this ENS and I want it to be blacklisted and the result of the arbitral contract is a blacklist of the domain if the one claiming the intellectual property is a sin as correct by the arbitrator or insurance this event occurred and does the insurer have to pay so we can abstract that and have to kind of contract arbitrator smart contract which are responsible for enforcement of ruling and arbitrators which are responsible for giving the ruling and the goal is 12 every where's my contract I'll be troubled by every arbitrator contract so this way if your contract developer you can easily switch from one arbitrator to another so let's go back to Claro's the idea of kleros is twelve crusin Jarosz so first we could say okay we let everyone adjuster and everyone into draw well that would be quite impractical because you will either need to pay everyone arbitration fee or everyone would get peanuts so in both way we have an issue so we can just roll some of them which will look at evidence and vote and get a relation fee but not all but there is still a problem since we don't have a way to be sure that someone I just won online on chain identity someone like this guy could register tons of time and be almost the only one drawn to solve that instead of during jurors with were tokens so you activate you token prohibition we get to random number with one of the method I talked about yesterday from this one we can get multiple ones every one was a token drawn is an arbitrator so we had the incentive to arbitrate which is get the written fee but now we need an incentive to arbitrate correctly and honestly but unfortunately we can't really Monsieur honestly in an algorithmic manner we will say ok it's another dispute this arbitrator rule honestly or not but some kind of chicken and egg problem so the best thing we can have is qur'an's as a proxy of honesty so in this example you can ask you a new audio the evil cheat for Bob why isn't majority but it for Alice so Zeus Jareau say we lose part of the token to the draw over cheat currently that's inspired by game game theory and shading point it is basic example if you vote the same way as user you win something otherwise you do something and if we remove all the leather we can see a matrix which is symmetric for a mathematical strong point there is no reason to vote for Bob or for Alice both of them could be seen at the same but fortunately we are blabbered and in the absence of other factors we have some solution which can emerge which we call the the focal point and in this case the focal point has to be honesty so why would you vote honestly because you think that the author will vote honestly or prize because you think that's all the thing that's all the think that they will vote honestly in practice it goes up to three level and that's all we can get one is for teens they receive some attacks one could be okay I vote before everyone else iPod Bob no both of the other parties as I know that you've divided Bob's the acquirement so even if Bob is not the honest answer the cool bad Bob so ought to avoid that is to use committee Revilla so instead of voting directly you generate your number or one on one locally and you commit ash of this number and you vote and in a second phase you will reverse the number you vote and on chain we can verify that it was effectively corresponding to a sh you submitted you could say okay I'm gonna reveal my number and my vote was a party to influenza so to avoid that we have to penalize this behavior so if someone weevil the number and the vote through the party this party can show that on Shane invalidate the world and seed part of the coins so this way you can't influence other trust Leslie you can either say okay I'm gonna vote for Bob but I don't prove it I don't show you I could be lying or you can say okay I'm gonna Dodd for bulb I'll show you the proof but now you have the right to see my coin and in village my vote so it not trust last one way or the other another attack pragmatic will be bribing and thus particularly problematic with auction is my contract because you can make bribing contract which are trustless which will automatically pay the bribe withdrawal vote the way you you asked so to avoid that you need to have an app in system so if someone managed to bribe jor-el at some level do all the parts he can appear and get more and more jurors and if you are in zone as majority assumption it will be highly more expensive for the dishonest party because most of the and most of the round he will lose and even in the round you will win you will also have to pay bribe why is it different I just have to pay a peer fees so that gives a huge advantage to the defender another problem which can arise is okay I props I don't like freelancing dispute I don't want to arbitrate Zeus I want win with weight insurance so for that we need an arbor essence of quote which are increasingly and increasingly specialized so when you register to build raw you don't reach to the quote you lose a pass to unquote so for chief it's a general ecommerce in financing so we can be drawn in a log series but we can add okay or do we make auto quote if we were to let everyone make support that will rapidly and in a mass of support which no clearance so that's why we need governance and we've seen produce governance system like the Dow that we have a huge problem which is most of the token order they just don't those so oh can we count the vote of people who don't want to vote that source will liquid voting so look at voting Israel you vote and everything works as which was indirect voting or if you don't and you've designed before a new chosen before an adviser you vote the same way as will adviser and in this advisor as an vote but also as an advisor you vote as ways advisor will advise or vote and in can't go to the point that you have one party with effectively voting and now we we've seen the website dispute and we see we have done the website dispute so why not make a quote specifically for Zeus we can also have some other kind of problem which is its arbitration it's not just right or wrong that could be the case for Oracle if it's something with the president yeah you either lied or you tell the truth that's easy but for for dispute it can be more shady so where do we draw the line if you just let your vote like that some juror would vote honestly but be still consider as increment so we lose token will be frustrated so to reduce this problem we'll have policies a policy is something which look like a law is basically guideline of auto arbitrate one example of policy will be a few cents sell some good and you sell it at distance and it's worth more than one user and you don't use track shipment and buy a claim he has not receive it we assume that the buyer has not receive it so the one is impossible to know we could do that follows your point one one four ten and it may not be consensual between the juror so for them to know all the should rule should have guideline which can be bought through governance another problem is the 51% attack what if someone buys more than half of the coin and keep forgiving the nice rolling accepting bribe that will pose a huge problem that's also why we need some specific coin because buying half of the coin of Cairo's would be way more expensive buying half of the ether which will be using Carol's because of market dev if you want to buy alpha of the coin of a one coin type you don't just have to pay for alpha of the market cap because okay the first seller you pay the market price but you rapidly run out of seller at market price as the price increases so perhaps even with a value which is higher than the market cap you might not even be able to buy alpha zhuzh moreover if you wise whose coin you do some attack and you accept bribe you're dishonest well you end up with a design squad and you won't is dispute to be arbitrated by you dishonest quote no one so your token will rapidly become worthless you can fall hit even and make another quote with only the honest party but even in that there is still a catch which is a contract which were created before they don't know the cool becomes dishonest they don't know that they have to update to a new quote and a new token and they will still be under the arbitration of the design escort but one could argue that it's the same with issue young and connected object box anywhere if someone by our faulty sir and each one is an attack always you object relying on blockchain they don't know there is an attack and they will sit behave the way the attack chain is behaving and in the first step I've shown you some really simplified version of what the incentive could look like but in practice it's way more complicated so you have some part which is a token redistribution watching the same way as the other we also have the honesty of the decision because if the quote given as decision your tokens are token on the squad and in this hold is variable so the value of you two can increase a bit and it's a cool givenness ruling you value decrease abit and since the token a log doing 3d cases you have no way to sell them before but we will soon catch in the other sense which is you're not a computer you can't just like get evidence process them in one microsecond and give a ruling it actually takes times you have to look at a paper wall cut images at the argument of parties yeah time is money so it has a cause for you so you could you say okay you know that's may not be I will just watch randomly to get the fees so depending to the value of all this variable in the incentives we can have multiple multiple points where party could always vote this way and each one will be a square and as the other but some would lead to his own escort some will lead to honest one and some will lead to quote just giving random results so what we call juice its Nash equilibrium it's a Nash equilibrium when everyone strategy is in such a way that after everyone knows everyone a strategy no one regret is own strategy and changing from one strategy to another does not have a lot of sense if you don't think that the other party also gonna change your strategy so that's why it's really important that at the beginning the quote even s ruling because this way no one will have an interest in changing just for him strategy to a dishonest one so oh can we verify that's two also can be recited by that it's which experiment are cryptic armies so at the beginning you don't link that to real contract which we asked Macintosh investment but you still have general and cielab incentive in term of token redistribution you take a set of dispute that you know are already solved but that you don't feel for to draw and you look at what the result will be compared to what you call your own growing truth which is a the result of the dispute you had before and you can use metrics which are inspired by machine learning to evaluate all the running of the quote is actually rated to the running of the booing truth so basically you do machine learning as with human as classifier so thanks everyone for listening if you want you can contribute we have a basic version of the quote some Abbott over smart contract you can interact with contract and test net and we are still building the WebSphere interface to actually use in a nice and user-friendly manner thanks [Applause] thank you very much if anybody has seen my private key for 0x d EAD lying around can you bring it up odd very much like all the money that's stored in it the next session is building a decentralized sharing economy on top of the theorem with Christophe ginge for the slides digital screen okay okay so thank you very much for having me here it's an honor to speak at Def Con so I remember I've spoken since Def Con zero they've got one too now suis and I see the crowd is really crowing like doubling every year it's really great to see the crowing of their if you make community so I want to tell it a little bit about what we are doing it's Lockett so our goal is to build a decent life sharing economy and since last year I was speaking a lot of things have happened so we have done several projects one which is worth mentioning a sham charge this is a project we did for energy and help building it and this is a platform where people can rent out their private charging station for electric cars that other electric how users use them so it enables to to help that we will have a lot more charging stations especially in Germany and they're already 2200 charging station life and a public is the room chain this is backed up by a large corporate such as energy in Germany I think it's one of those rare occasions where a large corporate is using the public key theorem chain to to connect their assets to it so I think this is a really great project another project we are part of its energy Bev foundation you will hear more about it later today from a talk so I would not go too much into this another project we did last year we did we use the DAO framework and in another setting and at Siemens this is a large copper in Germany I guess you all know it there is a live cow running there with a lot of people participating inside the siemens company so seamers employees and they are using this for donating to a charitable causes so it's similar to a charity ow that they yeah use the funds they gather together and make voting's together and send it to some places so we are working hard with larger corporates and Germany to make them use em and help them learn how to develop technologies on top of this but this is just one part of what slogged is doing the more important part in my view is our work on just so-called Universal sharing Network so what is this about our goal is to connect smart objects to the blockchain by managing the access control in a smart contract to see who is allowed to use certain devices so we know that the number of connected devices growing and growing you have smart locks you have smart plugs and a lot of other devices and we want to control the access to them by a smart contract which can be a payment can be another logic behind this so let me show you the architecture of the universal sharing Network so first you have the USN Registry and this is completely based on the es you could even say it is DNS because we just use domain there which name resolves to access control smart contract this is another part here and the access control smart contract has the logic inside to rent sell or share things or even pay as you use connected to a payment channel or just have a white list of friends and family which are allowed to use the object but every smart device can be registered if you ascend with a nice human readable name and then pointing to a small contract managing its access control of course another thing you need is an actually access control device because most of the smart objects do not have enough bandwidth and computational power to actually run the zoom even light note so and for those who do don't don't have it if you have built an access control device that she wants in a film light can't light blind it can run an IP FS node and it runs a library for home automation so it can be used to connect to all those devices at home I've also come to this point a bit later this access control device is then connecting to the smart device or door lock or other things in sending a Bluetooth you're set wave signal to control it so that's the basic architecture then of course you have to mobile app a mobile app has the purpose of managing the keys helping vistas covering objects could be something with your clothes tools NFC or scanning in and QR code or something you're not close to just showing your map and you can discover those objects so this is the channel architecture now I want to go explain a bit more about each of those points so first the USN registry which everybody can use it has false following the following format so it has a device name an optional device counter because we often found that you is one smart contract to manage a lot of devices you of course can have one smart conduct device but it's not very efficient also when it comes to gas costs and often you have one owner renting out several objects so therefore you have the device name optional counter and then the contract name and a contract name then resolves to the access control smart contract on it on DNS so it can look something like this a city bike number three and a pill and bike rental thoughtyou is underneath this is the ID of this small object which would then be resolved to the smart contract and can be managed from there so we're very thankful for Nick who developed a TNS is really a create system very well thought-out and very usable today so let's come to the access control smart contracts there are a lot of different use cases and you cannot have them all in one contract so actually those small contracts have only one required interface which is similar to the ENS it's just the supports interface function and they are you'd say which in the face of supported which can be several something like the rent functionality which is the most basic one where people can pay a deficit use something and when they are done they return it they get a deficit - - costs back and the costs go to the owner this is one interface another interface could be to put something in the future and we serve something for you you can have white listed groups which pay nothing or can get you can use it with a discount or you can just pay as you use and in this case you can resolve to an address which managed a payment channel missus pay mentioned you can pay directly is out going through the small conflict all the time and just pay us to use so those are the access control smart contracts the excess control device the Samsung we have played around this a long time in the beginning we just use raspberry PI's they are nice we can use them for a lot of things but they also have their weaknesses just not an industrial-grade device which everyone has used them for a while knows the SD card can break and lot of other things can break and so we have choosen the samsung artic 7 as a very good chip for our use case it has an eight core 64-bit ARM processors has Wi-Fi Bluetooth SIG pthread everything on this little chip here it has one key about a from forgiver of flesh and this is enough to run an ECM light line very stable in this device and also you can have the ipfs node running in this his enterprise class security and has a hard fair secure element in it which you can use for stowing the keys but you can also use an SMT so d2 on the chip to do this software as I said the light line we have how home open-source home automation software running on it and of course our use and access control logic as the other script on OGS code so it is actually the stuff I showed it here but some of the devices this is a sweetie printed box where we have this I never show you in a minute how does hopefully works and live demo but let's get to the user interface so we think use under phases are very very important if you want to target mainstream so if you hired a very good designer helping us building a nice use on the face so let's have a moment switching to my phone here see if this works so you should see the screen off my phone which is connected seems like it has a very week's aratus I'm glad it worked so this one I show you now is not the real life app this is the design of yep and afterwards I'll show you what we have built so far which is about 70 or 80 percent of the stuff you're seeing here so bad I thought it's important to show you also the design to get a feeling of how people can actually use the system so in the beginning you have the screen showing you what's some filters like available now with 0.5 kilometers certain kind of things so if you go into this it makes them suggestions let's say I want to drink something morning well I'm not a coffee drinker so I actually may have on to have a bike ride to the office for example we can switch to the map view to see what's available in my neighborhood or close to me and so let's say I didn't want to rent something I can also search for stuff based on time or just based on which kind of object I want to use so let's say I'm in the morning I want to take a bike to get to the office so I can go for bikes I can check out for the current location it shows me several bikes which are close to me shows the price shows also when it comes to reputation like how many people who used it like actually liked it you can click on the bike and see some information about how far away is the bike who's the owner is he verified so this person for example is verified to ski-base but we are very open to also use other mechanisms such as you port or pick up some parity it really doesn't matter the user can see how he's verified if you can trust the system or not which features all this kind of things and then you can click on rent you can see how long do I want to rent it 2 hours or maybe even several days let's say let's go for 2 hours here when it comes to payment of course either it's the preferred way of paying it but we are aware that not everybody wants to use either as a currency to pay it so we also say we expect a Bitcoin or US dollars using PayPal or credit cards and how it would work in the smart contract and this then needs someone it's a Zenda proof that the money is received this also can be just the owner if the owner says yes I will the money I can call it a function is smart conduct as yes I received it of course you have not all the features that you would have if you would have paid an ether such as the depositors hold by the smart contract and only released once you return it those features you only have of course if you pay an ether so if you go next get a summary of what's the bike the date how long the payment including a deficit in this case and then you can just like rent so the rental successful I can then go in the future me all the stuff I'm currently renting which is the bike and also rented a place in a co-working space and live what up on the bike it would open the screen to actually go in front of the bike sending a Bluetooth signal to open the bike lock so let's go his for exam to office space which I also can use let's say I took the bike I did talk away to the office I'm India now and so what's next how could you also use it there's also a way of just looking for objects which are close to me so I could check for QR code or even NFC so vertically let's say that is a nice 3d printer I want to use and office I once I want to use it I go in front of the the thing it is locking and able to have a nice locket logo on it your code you click on the near-field communication it is showing your device because you're standing in front of it it's a 2d printer you can have a look and you can rent it so it is it's just an idea of how this app looks like and now I want to show you the diversion which we have right now it's just a moment it's loading so let's see so that we have this map view we are here in Cancun just go a little bit so we of course put some objects here so this is now the wheel app and we want to use this microwave here this is what you can see here if I click it it shows me the white microwave which I can then click on it shows me device 0.01 our shows with some features of the microwave and I can now rent this lock I can ask how long it shows me to calendar I just want to hit one day not too long they even nine hours a long time again just select the ether account I can of course have several ISA accounts in the app a few days a movie there's the microwave the renting time nine hours the price total costs looks good so I can now rent the object this is sending now a transaction on the blockchain and you can see this device here those nice LED lights going up so what this box is in there we have this access control device if you have the power plug power supply everything in one box then I see what you can do with it you can unplug something in such as a microwave and then close it it's actually key to change the stuff your plugin you can off if we actually would like to show a washing machine because the washing machines the really nice use case was just too heavy to get here and so that's why we choose the microwave but you could think about like sharing a washing machine in the shared apartment you have like a students living there one guy is buying the washing machine every time somebody wants to use what he pays and this is just completely without even talking to each other or having a shared calendar or something like this so if I can go in a few on/off the object I can see all the stuff which I'm renting here so let's go on a popcorn microwave which I am renting so it shows me to turn on and off so let's turn it on let's see if this works this is the real-life demo yes it is Queen so it got a signal so let's use this and make something in the meantime so this is the microwave which I just paid for using it running so let's show some other stuff go into discovery mode you can also go look at the list of things without bikes of course there is an apartment which I may want to rent this is this locker Department Wi-Fi is very slow so the pictures are loading a bit slow but is this apartment from out in hometown Madhvi de germany so it's remotely now controlled I can see the price and features where it is and also of course went this lock I can set the date from today until start here those three days payment I'm using ether show me the summary yes everything looks good can render object so now it's also signing a transaction this is the our office and advisor very nice place so when was successful and now I have control over it so this is the smart log you can see here I can maybe put this a bit up so we are using a new key smart lock so we are not a hardware manufacturer of smart locks they use existing smart bug infrastructure to connect to so the smart lock here is now because it's not smart enough to run a client in there we have this access control device here which is just running one of those light lines connecting to the door lock so let's see if I go now on the salaka department I have control over it since I am rented it moment still loading yes vote so this is right now locked I can now push the unlock button this will send a sign message to this box saying I want to unlock it and then the Lifeline needs to verify that it actually work so nope try this again the Wi-Fi is a bit shaky yes okay now the lock opens I can enter and uses apartment okay and then on later if I don't use it anymore I return it so I don't have access to it anymore okay I think also the microwave should be done now so I just sort who wants some popcorn it's here get some popcorn to enjoy the presentation you're welcome okay it's a bit small but well so what I wanted to announce today is that we want to start the minimal Viable Product now we it's still not perfect so it's not a public release of a product that everybody can use it yet but if you go in MVP dots lock it you can register to become an MVP user and try the system out so that's what you want to do now for the next coming month and see get some feedback optimize the system and TV feel it's really stable those users the MVP users can use it reliably and once we feel it's safe then we are ready to release it to the public that everybody can use it but please register the MVP dots lock it and try the system out so all of this cannot be done alone because we want to integrate this as much devices as we can and so we have a lot of partners and friends from smart block manufacturers also of course people they film ecosystems such as you port or ether risk and many others so we're very thankful for all those people we can work together with and of course also I want to mention a trusted IOT aliens which we are part of which a lot of pride people which are thinking about how we can secure IOT devices today using blockchain technology by giving them for example identities and that you can security trance act using the using the blockchain and of course last not not but not least I want to thank my team I have a great team of I think this is all picture of you about 17 people right now plus some students and freelancers so in total up to 20 and working for on the system and I have we have two sanctum for building all of this there create team a thing the next couple of months more next year we can release something which everybody can use we have mainstream users renting out things and connecting Smart Objects to smart contracts I think this is something where a theorem is very good at because maybe mainstream users will not use ISA as the main currency maybe maybe not but machines don't care and to pay machines this is something we can really use it for and machines can verify the payment and act accordingly that Samsung we want to build together with you so thank you very much for attention [Applause] [Music] thank you check-check Thank You Christoph next up we have Vaughn McKenzie with Jack a new engine to power the web of content give him a round of applause alright that works hello everyone it's me here so where I'm for Mackenzie I'm from Jack if anyone knows us we are in the music and media space the name of the presentation today is a new engine to power the web of content and I just really wanted to start first by by kind of acknowledging that you know in terms of music there are a lot of music blockchain startups in the space thought it'd be a good idea really to just kind of recap why we're in the space and why we really think that music and blockchain really do make sense and yep pickle works so first of all what is the problem and I think that the way that most people as consumers experience music is that we just think of a song as an mp3 so when we play a song or we hear a song playing we just think that's a song play the song that's what I need to worry about the problem with music is very hard to figure out who to pay and that's because a song is actually kind of complex so let's say that a few people get in the studio and it start working on some music you actually are creating a very complex ownership structure the reason why is the song which actually is not represented in the music industry don't really think of songs they have completely other terms to describe things songs are just for consumers but you have this thing called a recording there's a copy right now and that copyright is normally created when an artist makes a recording so if I go in a street and I record something I'm now I create this thing called a recording and that is not only owned by a label labels own recordings and in compositions you can think about recordings being the implementation of a composition so a composition or as according the us of work is really just the the nuts and bolts the mechanics of how this song was made the lyrics the melodies and so on and that's made by writers so producers you make the instrumentals or obviously the people who just write the lyrics and that's normally owned or represented by publishers and every single time when you publish our a writer comes in to attract so you could have five producers ten producers five samples all of those things have their own ownership structure these are like micro businesses everything one of these are there they're argued in in by lawyers and figured out by managers and accountants to try and create this structure and nobody has a real picture how this works now this is one song on Spotify there are over 30 over 30 million songs so you can imagine how complex that is to try and keep track of and the way we keep track of that is with proprietary databases now this tries to explain how when we think about how music goes from people in the studio crazy all the way through to a consumer listening to on the other side it's actually quite complex because the song itself is a collaboration it's then pushed in the metadata in the music becomes separate as they always are and then they move down the supply chain in different ways now on the work side there is a standard identifier called a nice that we see it on the recording side of standard identify culeros is our see people like to apply these things willy-nilly they just applied all over the place and it really mapped down to the actual unit we're trying to describe and as we want to keep sync between these databases we create these exports and we just send them around so these flat files flying all around the industry and this is what we're kind of using to sync right we're just using these flat files now as we were saying before the problem here is that we end up with complete information asymmetry one person saying one thing another person saying another thing anyway to keep those two things together is to send this flat file and that means this fragmented quantum rise across all these databases and that means that even inside one organization which could be global and owned and controlled different things and assets in different territories it's quite hard to keep an internal consensus in that company and really the only way the music industry has known how to solve this is just to create a new database so we end up with more and more and more fragmentation and really we ended up with more and more databases and end up with parallel data reconciliations so again most things are traveling around via XML and spreadsheets and getting delivered to FTPS there's not very many API is either so actually syncing is very much manual and that's problematic because we are using proprietary databases and access is ownership if I want to tell you what I own I have to give you the data so it's quite hard to build out kind of one single database however one day the music initially did try to do that there was one big global database and it didn't really work for reasons we won't go into you but centralized governance is problematic if I have ownership I have control and really that's why block chains are great solution to this problem they help us avoid it we have a network of unbounded parties we have the need to collaboratively maintain a single data set and we want to do it without putting in a central authority this is why blockchains a great fit so what Jack what we're building is an open data network and we've kind of start to coalesce around inside there of a single source of truth and think about block changes single source of true systems and actually thanks to incentive structures blockchain is a highly effective single source of true systems and a great our highly effective knowledge production systems so when we think about single source of truth we typed I think about it in the way that it's always been defined and enterprise and that is say if any one of us are working with an enterprise or a consumer we're known in an enterprise to one department as say a customer and a different person CRM cells and so on and Enterprise Service bus is helped us to kind of create a single source about who that customer is that's what we believe block chains can help us to do around rights so using the system and web the infrastructure we can power a new paradigm for content on the web a single source of truth for content rights built on top of an open inclusive based network which I call meta now when we were coming up with this we ran into a few problems the first is a single source of truth we have to define truth and truth is pretty subjective in the music industry because data changes all the time and on actually really knows if anyone is right he was on that song I wasn't in the studio how do I know so that creates a problem and what we've tried to do is kind of a kind of a proxy for truth and what we've kind of moved to is Authority so Authority requires really robust identity structure which kind of led us to building out this thing we call meta ID so you'll see here on the left we have this single net ID and message basically an open data network that can be used to build decentralized databases based on mass IDs where participants are incentivized to provide trustless services to the network such that they can be automatically penalized by providing proof to a smart contract if the surface hasn't been provided if any of you are in the swamp talked earlier on or the one earlier in the week you've heard me talking about sorts of swindle and a service layer of a structure that's exactly what we're we're implementing here so with the mess why D the provider can convert the database into metal objects and push them into the network as meta streams then anyone can provide generic indexing services that's what the validations are doing here they basically enter into a service contract with it with a smart and they provide service in network and using Merkel proofs a node can just check that the actual information they provide as a meta stream is included in that index therefore without graphical API we can basically query that graph of objects and serve it up to adapt now the interactions between contributors to the media graph DB so moving ahead a bit quick in respect to music media rights information we can use the method network to implement a decentralized database which has a defined schema and it's maintained by validators where ordered with the integrity of this specific database the interactions between contributors to the what we call media graph DB here which is basically possible to insert or update data into this database and validation is governed by a swaps where loop game rather they just put up a stake which can be claimed or burnt if they fail to perform their duties much like proof of stake now what that allows us to do is build out this object which we call smart content using message media graph we basically create a new index which is called smart content and the validators work to basically make sure that everyone conform to that schema and it extends the media graph schema to include assets licenses metadata and anything required to facilitate transactions so you can see here we have our graph and basically this is a swarm manifest and it has a kind of a Content link that we can just find it and it returns the right information the type of right the percentage the actual owner which is a Messer ID and you'll see that we have these checks here and checks basically just to show us that the person who actually owns this thing has signed it or some delegate thereof and that's really what the indexes or validators Herat do working to maintain to make sure that this thing is adhered to so this structure facilitation license licensing using small contracts and service guarantees using swearin Swindell contracts where we get usage analytics and automated real-time payments for free so what are we working on at the moment a few things so if you've heard before the Jag team has been contributing quite heavily to swarm and we start off by working on PSS slide earlier in the year PSS being a routing protocol which again is being spoken about just lost this talk in the breakout hall and PSS is a routing protocol so meta nodes can communicate to each other and broadcast updates across the network we also worked on a network simulation simulation framework which allows you to view the nodes that are in a swarm and then we've also begun work on pot and put is basically the infrastructure or technology that will be behind swarm databases or swamp DB and we'll be working on that alongside a few of the other projects who are engaged this home team over the coming months we've also been working centralized applications what you're seeing here is an application that we were calling Jack for reciting naat is really called the smart content app it's basically add app that allows you to build a smart content and manage it so theory would be you enter into the network with your Mester ID and you're able to load up any of the assets you actually have already built in and then you can customize them add licenses at assets so on and push them into the jack network and it uses pretty much many of the components we've really discussed small content indexing media graph index messer swarm ens andy theorem just kind of trying to use the entire stack so outcome releases first thing is the metal white paper we've been working on it for a while now some people may have really seen a first draft already and that really defines the structure that we're talking about here in terms of the service level agreements between nodes which which is quite powerful because it would allow things like licensing where you just enter into a contract with the license and come provide all kinds of services including the actual storage serving up the streaming of the assets again use a little live peer people talking about that as well and this kind of framework really I think will drive out all of the next generation of that development the second part is the meta deed up and the meta ID really allows you to create a public address and then connect all these other authorized providers to it so you can imagine signing up as an artist with a mess or ID and then being able to connect any of the other Trustee providers like your label or your publisher or you know your Instagram anything where you like to dock your identity and then the meta test net which will allow you to start building these decentralized databases we plan to push that in early eighteen so you'll actually be able to try this stuff out obviously I'm the CEO I'm building all the stuff so I just wanted to let you know the people who you can speak to if you're interested in learning a bit more Fred and Victor obviously my co-founders Fred's lead application engineer on Jack Victor obviously the architect working on Jack and Messer Lewis Marshall who's heading up Messer he's a best present to speak to about all the stuff I just described and Oren as well he's also working on Messer let me have Lewis who sees the developer working on P SS and Luke who's who's heading up metal idea so again if you have any questions and you do wanna reach out those guys please you just go and reach out to them and you can find us on we do have a github get home comm / meta - network there we have most of these things defined conceptually we have documents we also have the mess ID framework the first version of that which is open source we plant open source more things over the coming month so please do check it out we obviously are on guitar so again just get on with the same thing / lobby and then if you want to join us some slack and talk about things that may be less technical community not metal - network dot IO and you can just jump into the sack there and it's because any of the guys yeah that's the end of my presentation and thank you very much [Applause] can i watch up next we have Serio learner with the blockchain virus can a blockchain pay to replicate okay my name is Senne human learner and i'm if you find and if you part of the human community since its beginning and when I did the first security audits of the theum code and design and currently I work for a company called SK labs which is developing an assumed compatible sidechain to Bitcoin but today's talk is about a research I did a couple of years ago that applies both to aetherium and towards K and to any other blogging platform so the dog's name is the blockchain buyers can a blockchain pay to replicate can a blockchain itself pay for all their seed it needs to survive like a norges organism or it could have been called how to war full nodes or it could have been called how to create a reward based peer-to-peer file sharing system control entirely by smart contracts by no additional blockchain okay so first of all I'm gonna talk a little bit about the centralization because we wouldn't be here if not because we appreciate the centralization and any attempt to build a cryptocurrency or smart contract platform in the past that was centralized just fail okay so this is what we must stand this is what we must try to to to keep so why is this in transition so important well it brings back the power to the people so did means a lot of things like people being able to audit their payments disintermediation having open access no central control no monopolies no central point of failure and of course censorship resistance and Russian resistance these are very very important properties of our networks so how do we promote the centralization well first we have to identify measure it and then we can see how can we improve it so one of the ways is increasing the number of independent implementation developers full nodes okay and another way is by reducing the cost of running a full node because as the network scales the cost of raising a full node increases so if I have to depend on a third party to know about my transactions then the network is going to be centralized and last the actual full node topology is very important if I take a node out and then the network's disrupt or disconnect then of course this is not a good decentralized network but we can see that in all kind of ways that we can improve the centralization it's very very important to have full nodes we cannot live without full nodes and have the centralization so what is the fool now anyway okay a fool now it does a lot of services to the network it broadcasts blocks transactions it also hides the nodes IP so we don't give an attacker the possibility to gather all information about the network and do partition attack sauce denial of service attacks also an old provides filtering services for light clients and of course the most important function it has a copy of the state and the blockchain to serve to new notes that want to bootstrap and you know sync with the network but what are the incentives to run a full node currently there are not okay so currently is quite cheap so we do it but in the future we don't know so anything we can do to reward nodes will foster the centralization so how can we do this well there are very simple ways but most of them do not work for instance we can create peer-to-peer pairs pay services like creating a microchannel from one node to appear then I can easy or probabilistic payment which also works and then I can't just ask for a block and then you give me the block I make you as very small maker payment well the problem with this setup is of course that we can have proxy nodes and proxy nodes can you know charge a little more and just forward the request to another node and so they just are there to you know they don't know contribute to the centralization it just make the network be more expensive some other cryptocurrencies some other networks rely on some calls something called master node of course this master node regulary ping nodes so they can vote so which nodes have to be rewarded this of course has a lot of problems with centralization these nodes are centralized and also these nodes gather a lot of information about the I piece of the nodes which is something we want to avoid so I will present a third way of doing this and the interesting thing is that this is a communication between smart contracts and full nodes without any other user or external system intervention so basically there is a smart contract that will say something like this give me a proof of work that proves with high probability that you store in your own hundred hard-disk a copy of the blockchain ok or that you are so irrational that you are willing to buy a lot of hardware just to fake this proof but you will spend more more money than just buying the hardest to store the file ok and I will tell you if nobody else finds that you have cheat so if the fool node a submits a proof in transaction data then an our full node can come as you know this proof is fake and the smart contract can ever write this proof this proof must be able to be evaluated with very low amount of gas and can keep a pretty posit a spray deposit and reward B for providing that useful information so in um to summarize we want a node to be able to prove to all remaining nodes in the network that is storing the blockchain okay so the benefits are obvious we can detect proxy nodes we won't pay proxy nodes and we don't require any special change to the network for the knows that what want to participate and maybe the drawback is that we are not actually proving we are serving the blockchain we are proving we have a copy of the blockchain but since we have a copy of the blockchain we are in sync with the network almost sure we are serving it and the cost of serving it will be small so to to manage to do it we are need we need some cryptographic protocols okay so these are the previous attempts to do these kind of things so we have provable data possession which allows you a verifier to send some data to a server and then challenge the server to see if this data is still there also we have proved over to ability where the thing very fiery can also have certain assurance that you will be able to recover this information in the future these two are called proof of storage so I will present a protocol very simple protocol which is a called proof of unique blockchain storage that is the proof of storage scheme but also allows you to ensure that the other party the server has an actual copy of this file okay so that means that this file will be related to some some identity okay so the same file cannot be related to two identities so it is interesting that this year file coin presented as very similar proof that they call proof of replication and that I also publish a couple of years ago and it's kind of the same idea but it's worse and I will tell you later why it has many problems so in a nutshell we take the file we want to prove possession and we will encode it together with an identity and this identity will be generally your node address your film address or air skaters so what we need is as decoding is fast it should only be fast enough you know for not to interfere where your network operations on the contrary appending and updating will be a much slower operation but again not slow enough to interfere with operations the property is that when you encode the file and you code a second file there is nothing to share in these encodings so the server will engage in a channel small protocol with a verifier and he will use the encoded data not the ungood decoded data but just encoded data and we'll it must be irrational from the economic point of view to do anything else like relate to another party or like having a supercomputer or whatever so this is how the peer-to-peer protocol goes without without smart contracts so there is a harness verify say give me the cache of and cellular randomly selected blocks of the file and that have been encoded with your node address and please do it in less than one second so the holes prover has the information just put the information to memory and hash it and it works now if there is a malicious rumor you can think of two things okay first he can think okay I'm gonna relay the same query the same challenge to another party but the problem is that there is the response he will receive is related to another identity so he's not going to get paid she's just going to be paying another party if he wants to redo this encoding it the problem is that it takes a lot more than one second okay so in a sense he cannot fake a proof so to create this asymmetry we need we need something I call practical and symmetric time encoders or parties so we have a program which is an encoder we have another program which is a decoder for a certain Turing machine and we define the steps this program performs the number of step it requires to run for a random input until it halts and we will ask that this steps function is mostly uniform so we we said that we have two programs and we said that decoding if you if i encode an input and I decode it I get the same input so we define the asymmetry ratio as the number of steps it takes to the code divided by the number of steps it takes to encode so the desired properties at of course the program must be small and if I if there is any other party that encloses a mapping then this function this sorry this encoding must be relatively equally efficient efficient okay and to guarentees we need to rely on some complexity assumptions or number theoretic assumptions to make sure that the encoding that we peek is one of the fastest encoding Possible's for that mapping also we want as I said that the coding and encoding this piece will be practical for our application and we want the highest possible ask me to rate you because that is going to protect us from the attacker trying to encode on the fly well there is a function that has these these properties it's called the pollak Hellman cipher private key cipher is a very very old one of the first number theoretic encryption systems it works like this - well in this case it's the opposite decryption would be like encoding but so to decode a value we just rise it to the third power modulo P Prime and B prime and to encode it we will rise it to a value you which has approximately and bit which is the inverse of the three models P minus 1 so we get this encoding decoding property so using the standard Square and multiplayer algorithm encoding will take 1.5 times n multiplications while the coding takes only three multiplications so the asymmetry ratio here is and divided by 2 okay so we can make this asymmetry ratio as as large as we want just by taking a prime which is you know larger so what are the practical parameters that we can choose that serve this purpose okay I tested it in my laptop with a lib GMP so for N equals 2048 this is a bit little technical but please follow me exponentiation takes two point eight milliseconds while three multiplication takes only 3.6 microseconds so the theoretical estimate to reach you is approximately 1,000 what I measure is approximately 7077 so now think about the Bitcoin blockchain okay so we get one megabyte block every 10 minutes and it takes only 11 seconds to encode it so it works perfectly for Bitcoin and it works also perfectly for arrows kay and if I receive you and the coding is really fast you get third 71 megabytes per second so that is not going to interfere with your node operations if you want to get a higher symmetry oh you can take an equal twenty K and and you see RB in the bones that you can still use for encoding your blockchain so this this is the one-time blockchain encoding step you take your block chain or your file and you split it in and beat chunks and then you scramble each one with your node address and this scrambling is can be very simple can be just soaring with a full domain hash of the of the node address and then you encode it with your slow function so this is what a typical proof of storage looks like you have some kind of memory bone problem because you want to prove you have a lot of love data and you transform it into a disk i/o problem like this you take a seed the verifier will will send you a seed and from that seed you derive a number of positions in the file and then you will just access those positions and and build a hash okay well the problem with all these constructions is that they depend on this technology so if I use SSD the parameters are completely different if I use a Hardee's and also these disc characteristics properties change all over time so this is what we really do we first do the step of encoding and creating this asymmetry and then we receive from the verifier in this case is the poops contract the proof of unique blockchain storage contract we receive a c0 with this is 0 we will take some parts we will derive some indexes some parts of the blockchain or in the file and we will bring all these into Ram ok so we are independent of the technology the disk access technology and this is the challenge response preparation phase now we have we received from the smart contract like 20 seconds later and second seed against it 1 and well from seed 1 we will derive these indexes of RAM where we will take these small pieces small blocks and hash them okay well we have transformed this memory bound problem into a CP ball problem well there is some important problem here that we cannot do this from a smart contract is that the block interval can be about 10 seconds 20 seconds so the number K the number of pieces we have to hash to prevent an attacker doing these encoding on the fly' would be very very high okay like in the order of 20 20 thousands or maybe more so the proof that we get is very large and this mark contract won't be able to you know with the gasps limits to to evaluate if it is correct or incorrect so we change the last part and we transform a CPU bone problem into a memory bus IO problem and this has been done this has been done in Parma coin for instance the same the same procedure so instead of taking a large number of blocks to hash we take only 40 but we request that the hash that we obtain has a proof-of-work okay so we will try many many times like the right new seeds from the seed one and a nonce tribe a lot of times maybe 20 seconds or 10 seconds until we get one that has this property of the proof of work so this is how the whole protocol works and it's very very simple so in the step zero we have this one time encoding but we also have that who knows we'll register with these proofs smart contract and this can be they don't have to reveal their IP they just have to register RSK or receive your address to be paid also they will do some pre deposit because they are going to be penalized if they present an invalid proof so in step one the proofs contract will derive the seed zero from the block cash and we give the notes enough time to bring all these pieces or a big piece into ROM so in step three because the proofs contract will derive as it won and now the competition begins that it's not a competition it's cooperation actually but the full notes will try to get this proof of work will try to get from all proof candidates we try to find one that matches that has a time much that whose cash is lower than the proof of work target so they will submit these proofs to the blockchain in normal transaction there will be plenty of time like six six blocks are head to prevent censorship so that they can do that and in step six that there is a deadline for this and then an external challenge phase begins in this phase who knows we'll try to see if the other nodes are we are cheating so they will pick the nonce and then the hash that has been commit from other who knows and we'll reevaluate their that those proofs but since there are only 40 elements then it takes about 100 milliseconds so they can just Emma right every every other full knows with commitment if one of them finds that ham someone has cheated then it just says a fraud proof to the world chained to the poop tsmart contract which is just this full expansion of these of this roof foosh which will show if the original commitment was correct or incorrect so in step 9 there is a end deadline for proof submission for fraud to submission and then there Wars has been paid of course they are they're only going to be paid to the nodes that are behaved honestly so because that were what is going to be shared nose-to-nose are also incentivizes incentivize to detect cheaters now what's the difference I said before that this protocol can be used to prove any file not just the blockchain the blockchain is the easiest one because the node already has a copy of the blockchain maybe so it can more easily evaluate things but it can be used to any file to create you know a file sharing system that you can reward node just to hold the data for you and multiple copies you can just create a contract that creates a hundred copies of the same information but there are some difference between the file code roof of replication and proof of unique file storage proof of replication depends on the success time so it's difficult to tune for all kinds of discs and it gives you typical symmetries of about 10 to 100 so it's very easy that technology changes and then an attacker is able to to to fake proof on the contrary proof of unique file storage does not depend on access time and has typical asymmetries between 1000 and 10,000 and also you can combine them so you get 10 times more you can combine 10,000 of a symmetry a tier of proof of unique file storage and combine them we'll know 10 times more for proof of replication well the summary is that well the central asian the centralization is very very important in these networks and increasing or setting of a full reward for the first time we can incentivize the creation of new full notes and keep the number of full nodes even if we request them to store 10 times more information and this proof of unique file storage and proof of unique blockchain storage allows you to prove that you have this unique copy of the file of the blockchain and the important thing is this can be done right from a smart contract with almost no gas consumption and also the proofs are very short it's just a hash and a nonce okay so this could be implemented in any fume or in our CK tomorrow well we are working on implementation and so when we open source you will be able to to to play with it so thank you very much and the organizers all right up next we have Andy Millennia's with dice table coin give him the hand hello everyone I'm here to talk about maker Dow one of the oldest and most ambitious projects in all of etherium that seeks to create a stable coin those of you who don't know a stable coin is a cryptocurrency that is stable with respect to fiat currencies making it a more useful form of digital money so what is maker at its core maker is comprised of two tokens the first is called die this is the stable coin it is an asset-backed hard currency this means that every die coin is backed by some kind of valuable asset and this is because die is a permissionless credit system and all die are issued when users lock up their valuable assets in this permissionless credit system an issue died against them the stability of die is maintained a system of dynamic autonomous interest rates that automatically react to emerging market conditions and change the fees and incentives associated with using this permissionless credit system the second token is called MKR it is the administrative token of the system and its holders comprise a decentralized regulatory body who use token governance to decide what type of assets are truly valuable and can be used as collateral to back the dice table coin in exchange for those services MKR is used as the fuel for the credit system and when people repay die and reclaim their collateral from the system they must include some mkr as a fee which is consumed by the system so what have we been up to over the last year in a word refinement this last year has been all about removing complexity adding simplicity paring down the code making it easier to understand this is not easy stuff a good day at maker last year a good day often involved putting one line of code on trial and scrutinizing it and thinking about it and at the end of the day removing it we have used the UNIX design philosophy to great effect in the maker Dow system now I talked about this a lot yesterday so I'm gonna sum it up simply today and say the UNIX design philosophy encourages programmers to write contracts that do one thing do it well and to write contracts that work together what I'm talking about is a modular approach to system design focusing on one component making sure it's right and then composing these to higher order systems this is not a new idea this is a decades-old idea and we have leveraged it to great effect in the maker Dow code we have also sponsored the creation of a ton of interesting developer tools and repeatable smart contracts all the stuff I talked about yesterday we pretty much exclusively built in the pursuit of our goals for maker Dow and so all of that cool stuff is just one cool way that maker has contributed to the broader development ecosystem and it's something that we're very proud to do here in aetherium something else that we're very proud of achievement we're very proud of is the creation of the purple paper the purple paper is our Haskell reference implementation of the dice table coin system and it has been invaluable in the design of dye the reason it has been valuable are three the first is comparison it is well understood in computer science that creating multiple freestanding implementations of a system is a great way to verify your assumptions and see what kind of behaviors translate between one on the other in fact the etherium community has leveraged this fact to great effect in the create in the diverse client ecosystem that we all enjoy and in the creation of multiple implementations of the casper algorithm similar sort of thinking there we did this in Haskell and was very very valuable the second reason is for verification Haskell has a very advanced type system especially when compared to solidity we can achieve more expressiveness and we can specify the behaviors a lot more rigorously using Haskell than we were able to achieve with solidity and it has helped us to think more clearly about the design of the die stable coin system and the third reason is simulation when you have when you design something like this a separate programming language you can actually run it but I'm look what you're looking at here is code of course so the purple paper is actually a model of the dice table coin system and we can use it on the command line to simulate the system and test our economic hypotheses it will help with the administration of maker over the long term so all of this stuff is refinement there's a high standard of quality investment in our tooling the purple paper all of it over the last year it's been culminating it's been leading up to something leading up to me standing on the stage right now it is my great pleasure to announce to you that the first release of dye is coming in December of this year so long we've been working towards this for so long I'm so excited I'm so excited I might faint I'm so excited I may explode on this stage now I'd say this is the first dye release because this is the first major step on the road to formal verification and all of the important dye stability features that we need but make no mistake this is a major step the landscape of ethereum the dab the landscape of dabs is going to be changed forever when we have consumer grade stability everybody knows that and we have been working towards this moment for years and we're ready we finished our audit just two weeks ago we are currently responding to feedback and we are getting ready to launch this thing I'm gonna go into some detail about what is coming in this release let's dive in and talk about the credit system mechanics this will be especially useful if you're not as familiar with the dice table coin system so I spoke before about how users lock up collateral assets and issued I against them this is done in what's called a collateralized debt position a CDP and users issue they create CDP's issued I and use it for whatever and then later they repay that died plus a fee and reclaim their collateral but as you can see in the diagram it looks like there's more value in terms of collateral than there is in terms of died why is that it's because the system enforces it and the reason that it enforces it is because the value of the asset the collateral fluctuates and it always needs to be backing the die because die is an asset back to hard currency so because the collateral value can fluctuate the die system needs to protect itself now if the value of the collateral asset fluctuates up if it appreciates in value that's fine for dying doesn't matter but if it fluctuates down and it loses value die needs to take steps to protect the integrity of the entire system and what it does is it liquidates the CDP it reclaims the collateral and it sells it off or die to reclaim the die that it needs to get and make sure that all the books are balanced you can think about it you can analogize it to a margin call where the CDP owner made a bet here they were wrong and they pay the price so what type of collateral is going to be used in this first release of die it's called pooled eath and it allows us to back the system with ease and protect the system in the event of extreme market volatility in the next release of dye and in future releases we will use the mkr token to protect the system in the event of extreme market volatility downward volatility but in this system because it's simpler to do so and because we are still working on that aspect of the system we use pooled eath so let's go into a little bit how it works we call this a bailout mechanism let's go into how this work mechanism works at the high level path is very very simple you just put your ease into a contract and you get path out and path can be used to reclaim your eat so if there's 100 Eve and 100 paths and you put any Eve into the system you will get one path maintaining the ratio between pass either but that ratio is not static it is dynamic and the reason it is dynamic is because paths have text the system with this bailout mechanism in exchange for that service half of the fee from the CDP is used to bypass and burn it destroy it so if you think about it if we're buying path and destroying it taking that CDP fee CDP fee and destroying it that means that the remaining path has greater claim power on the eath here you can see it can claim 1.5 Eve where before I was saying it claimed one Eve that ratio is increasing and it's causing paths to appreciate in value this is what happens when the system is experiencing normal levels of ethology leti but what if the blacks want the dreaded Black Swan event happens a Black Swan event the price of eath rapidly loses value faster than the dice table coin system can could eight positions and will we wind up with is an insolvent CDP an underwater CDP this means that the totality of the collateral that has been issued against this die is lower than the value of the die itself something needs to be done we need to collect this die somehow and the way that it's done is by minting paths so here this red area on the diagram would be minted path and it's minted and sold for die in order to keep the system solvent so we're accessing the value of the pool of ease in order to keep the entire system solvent and balance the books but as you can imagine minting paths means that the claim power is diminished here we can see now one passed claims 0.66 is causing the value to depreciate this is why in times of normal volatility should appreciate and only Falls and value in the event of these snap moments extreme volatility the next feature is the governance fee as I said half of the fee is given to holders the other half is given to MKR as a payment for their service administering the system and choosing the important security parameters that keep the system safe this is paid in MK r as I said it's denominated and die and here we will have the first main use case for this vision that we've all kind of thing been thinking about when it comes to token is this vision of decentralized exchange whenever we think about tokens we often think about the user buying them and not even realizing that they're buying them buying them behind the scenes automatically without thinking about it without even knowing about it we have developed this technology for this use case so users aren't gonna have to think about em care but they're gonna automatically buy it in a decentralized exchange like Oasis or ether Delta or 0x automatically and use it to close their CDP's this.m care will be burnt consumed by the system the last feature is called global settlement this is how we wind down the system gracefully and it will allow us to upgrade like I said be graceful this is an orderly process when the system is globally settled by the MKR holders a few things happen in order the first is that Dai becomes a claim on e on the eath collateral at a fixed price so it is as if your die which is an actively managed stable coin suddenly became even just like that the fixed price next CDP holders will be able to free their excess so if I put 100 Path $100 worth of path into a CDP and I issued $80 worth of die against it and then the system was globally settled I would get my $20 worth of pets back and whoever I gave that $80 worth have died to would get the other $80 worth of eath simple orderly and then last the path holders can exit to eat and whatever rate exists for path at that time whatever claim power it has there are only three conditions upon which the system will be globally settled the first is in cases of bugs this is a safety precaution you can never be too sure until the system has been formally proven the second is extreme events of market irrationally we're all used to this in crypto currencies it's something that we are quite certain won't be happening and die both of these things bugs and marketer rationality but it's something that we're prepared to handle nonetheless and by market of rationality I mean something like an unstoppable amount of demand for dye that threatens its very stability and in the third case is in terms of upgrade in cases of upgrade this is definitely going to happen because as I said we have another release of dye coming which is gonna have more important stability features and this will be an orderly way to go from the old system to the next system so what's coming next a lot of exciting things we're gonna be working a lot on exchange integrations this means that you're gonna get dye trading pairs dye is gonna be a great base pair to trade against and we hope to get our CDP system integrated into exchanges so that you get safer borrowing with much lower rates margin trading up 1% sounds awesome the last feature is of course the last aspect they're gonna we're gonna be working on is of course the importance ties stability features I mentioned a few here there's a few more that I can't get into but we're gonna be heads down over the next quarter working really really hard to get the next release of dye out there which is gonna be even better and even closer to ready to the to the final formally verified product we are so excited that we've been working for so long on dye we're so excited to deliver a working DAP to you this is something that we're really really proud to put out there and I think that it's going to like I said completely change the landscape of ethereum getting consumer grade stability if you're interested in learning more please visit maker.com there's a lot of information there you can join our chat chat

you very much [Applause] good afternoon everyone my name is John Garrett's I'm co-founder and CEO of oaken innovations formerly project token and I just want to start off by saying how excited I think I speak for the rest of our team when I say how excited we are to be here in Cancun at DEFCON 3 on this stage speaking to you and when I say you I mean the community that we've all been a part of for a number of years now and we're really excited to tell you kind of the story Volken is what i'm gonna start with over the last year and then I can hand it over to Lex he's gonna take you through a few of the technologies that we've been building out and then we're gonna wrap it up with a video so again my name is John Garrett's I've been in the space since about 2014 very early on in etherium years one of the first projects I worked on air lock was on proof-of-concept three so very very early years from there I was able to secure a developer's grant a dev grant from the etherium foundation for embedded which was essentially taking the etherium client and porting it to ARM based resource constrained devices and that allowed me to start to build relationships in the community and many of those relationships are now my co-founders with oaken innovations this is our team we have a fantastic team I'm so proud of what we've been able to do in a very short amount of time many of you are familiar with Hudson Jameson but we also have Laney Fisher James Johnson Lex and Daniel is the most recent addition shout out to Ethel Lance Daniel was a recent hire we went through the process of Ethel ants and so shout-out to someone else in the community we've used their tools and has worked out very well for us so this is kind of the story of volcán about a year ago today you know the majority of us knew each other but we hadn't really worked together and so we got together about this time last year to enter into a couple hackathons the the kind of result of that was a judges win with a hack ether camp and then from there we built on to a first place finish in the Dubai virtual blockchain govhack in first place was $100,000 all expenses paid trip to Dubai and our project there was a proof-of-concept that we referred to as Tesla and Tollbooth and what we were able to do is install an etherium client in a Tesla and install an etherium client in a mock Tollbooth to demonstrate the true period true machine-to-machine transactions with no human involvement that game does some traction from one of our partners initially Toyota Research Institute which we moved on to build-out proof another proof of concept for peer-to-peer car-sharing and that was something that we debuted in May at consensus 2017 and essentially what we're able to do is install an etherion client in the car connect that to a fob and through a series of smart comment escrow smart contracts rent out our short-term lease that vehicle and this is a all these proof of concepts that I'm speaking to our functional proof of concepts these are things that we have built out that are up and running you know not in a production environment but up and running nonetheless from there we've been able to be involved in a number of other projects I guess MIT Media Lab we're really working with Toyota Research Institute to start to facilitate some kind of an open blockchain mobility ecosystem and so we you know in the past we've invited other automotive manufacturers to come to the table and we've been at least successful in starting that conversation in we're based on a Dallas Texas so we have a strong relationship with a lot of the universities in that area as well were involved in an open data initiative with the Texas Department of Transportation or TX dot and we're also talking to a few toll road authorities both in the US and we're a member of the trusted IOT alliance this is a we're very excited to be a part of this group there's a lot of active members in the trusted IOT alliance we're still kind of a small group but growing fast and ourselves we've been able to contribute MQTT T which Lex will talk about in a little more detail shortly and if you're out there and you're working on IOT and blockchain and you're interested in becoming a member please go to trusted IOT org trusted - IOT org and check it out sign up and we'd love to have you on board and kind of learn more about your technologies so it's not my pleasure to introduce lex Shuang Liang Lexa's our CTO and he has some prior experience Lex and I met in Guelph Ontario Canada which is close to my hometown and you know we we kept in touch after that initial like a connection Lex did some IOT internship work for eros industries which is now mon acts and joined the team just prior to the Dubai event so please give LexA round of applause yeah so our body so I'm from Orion Chinese liang shuang you can call me Lex and I got my master degree in computer science at Temple University in Philadelphia so I'm glad to be here to introduce some of the technologies we are working on recently so yeah so personal I want to introduce you to an qtt trusted and the second wine the micro tab and also we have a hardware security model we are working actively actually ways to build some secure hardware for the IOT platform yeah I'm Kootenay trust really it's a transistor trust in the world of Mac MQTT so it's pitched down the iMac utt library and history library MQTT is a very lightweight Papa sub paste the motion to motion communication protocol is very popular for IOT applications and it's designed for very low bandwidth communication for some sensors or telling my telemetry devices and the feature we want to bring into this machine to machine communication is from ECM global likely and unlimited the identity system and also it's Trust trusted without the centralized control and we can use Beauty easy just a algorithm to get the signature of the messages and embody the signature to send to send to the receiver so here is the flow from the sender side it put a plain message and I'm QT GT library build some packet lactis it has from and to field which is based on the is room address and we can we put the timestamp at the pro footage to see to put too much content of the apparition of the message also the heat load and the sequence number and after that we'll use either the primary key of the user room or hardware tsukamoto to send the message and put the signature into that message and at the receiver Saturday its person can't recover the address of the sender and pasted on some web Webster library are you serving library and it contract checked the permission of the sender from the smart contract also we can do proof of provenance of the data or access control based on the identity of the sender so there some issues we want to solve from Tisa library its interoperability there are some problems server if the first one is signature can be messed up if the sender and the receiver use different libraries to stand on the recover the message and the second the issue is this part of the property is another standard so we want to probably standardize this machine to machine communication scheme so it will be either for your reader to talk with microwave are some talk with your car so they are all compatible with each other so because of these issues we want to collaborate with the community with trusted LG allowance to build some standard for the machine to machine communication also build some semantics on top of the serum blockchain and this protocol so the next one we want to introduce the macro tab so you can see from name is small whirring of the decentralized application videos Raspberry Pi for our hardware platform but we can also put our stack to other embedded system like Pico bone and other embedded device so we use extreme light plan for the small contractor and up here first for the data storage and to MQTT library to support machine to machine communication so this is an example of the architecture we are working on from the top layer is the central application for designer for IOT use case and we have three components it's the first vanity centralized data storage API and to transmit machine-to-machine communication interface to the to the application and also the smart contracts so in the meet middle layer we have up here price but you can actually plug in other decent rata storage or libraries like the swarm and so i'm qtg the historian blockchain actually we we are trying to build like to support other blockchain applied forum under the lowest layer it's a hardware abstraction layer we can step out Center data and how to our secure model as IOT wallet and here is the example of the Mahadev service to interact with user using the mobile web app so here the boss has had access choose certain blockchain and IP efforts for data storage but it's not like pure centralized infrastructure based you need some like server to unload the computing tasks of the impacted us to the servers here we can reuse MQTT broker on the server side also we need some server to uploaded like serum gateway and ipfs gateway to support the country in the device so here you that reward example we build with to you top of the cache area you centralize the car sharing application so you can see it's not like a traditional server based design didn't paradigm is really like peer-to-peer didn't per them all of the cars have our macro tab services running and they can communicate with each other through the qtg machine to machine communication and access to the smack contract so we have the video to show the real app and the user experience later on I'll go quick very quickly about the hardware model is we built this hierarchical model with requirements we want you for the IOT and production application first one is the way we want temporal 4-2-3-1 to the attacker like physically attack the device and we want to very secure key storage and we walk the key when we detect some attack intention also we want it to be plugged in compatible a quick send using the hardware model and using and the signature compatible with Webster library our other serum libraries so here is our printer company accomplishments for the hardware model we can send offline transactions and we can send personal personalized the transactions also we have this nutrient library to access the functions in the hierarchical model so there are still ongoing work we actively the web like here we want we are developing the physical temper detection with collaboration with some hardware companies and we appealing this Kirky story based on the secure elements yeah today are like ongoing projects we are actively working on and we are like community dreaming and like to talk with developers if you have questions you can go to this website and stay tuned we may how more released like time-coded city to the community thank you thank you everyone so as Lex alluded to we've been in as much work as Lex has done on our on our back-end systems we've really been focused from the get-go on the front end and really making sure that there's a good user experience in fact some of this was born out of necessity for us to keep that user experience at a level that were comfortable with and so we're just gonna play a quick video for you now this was first launched at Monday 2020 last week in conjunction with Toyota Research Institute and kind of gives you the our vision of the mobility future hello from oaken innovations we're excited to show you what we've been working on with Toyota Research Institute earlier this year we debuted our proof of concept blockchain enabled peer-to-peer car lease application at consensus in New York this application allowed consumers to lease a vehicle from a car owner using a smart contract on the etherion blockchain file storage on ipfs in a mobile application to lease and control access to the vehicle prior to our car lease model we developed a blockchain powered automated toll road system with connected cars this project won us the top honors among the entire world at the UAE international blockchain hackathon these applications allow for instantaneous remittance between the transacting parties they do this without the need for payment processors by using logic coded to a smart contract the hyper secure block team based IOT controls at a level of security not currently available on the consumer market all while reducing or eliminating the need for server infrastructure open innovations wants to give you a glimpse into the mobility future we envision we use the blockchain for application logic and data storage replacing traditional server infrastructure here we use the blockchain to store vehicle identity along with GPS now we add road and mapping data and allow trusted entities to update this decentralized data layer smart road sensors can also feed this database this allows for a complete view of all vehicles and infrastructure with current construction and traffic conditions while allowing third party applications to be built on top of this data let's amend that vehicle data for leisure ride-sharing services this now allows consumer mobile apps for ride-sharing or leasing using this blockchain services layer in arrived share or lease transaction things get very interesting using blockchain technology instant value transfer and micro transactions are now possible within one smart contract transaction is instant remittance to several parties including the vehicle owner and driver insurance provider toll road Authority and road tax entity why is this valuable the automobile owner and driver received guaranteed and instantaneous payment of funds micro insurance policies for each rider lease transaction can be paid to an escrow contract then remitted to the insurance provider once the write is complete with the balance of that escrow going to the rider or lessee we can use an escrow contract for autonomous toll payments and even eliminate toll gates from the toll road infrastructure as we can prove the location of the vehicle using GPS we can even have smart toll road infrastructure where roads are only charged during peak hours as consumer behavior moves away from purchasing fuel in favoring paper write mobility over vehicle ownership Road and infrastructure authorities will face a shortfall of tax revenue that currently funds the construction and maintenance of roads included in the mobility transaction is a usage based tax to replace this lost revenue even short trips where a fraction of a penny is needed for Taxation all of these parties receive the benefits of instantaneous remittance all included in a single transaction user experience all without the need for payment processing intermediaries let's go further with this blockchain platform in an autonomous driving world we get to go beyond rider mobility into other applications solar energy production is highest when the sun is shining the most that's typically in the middle of the day energy demand typically spikes in the morning and then again in the evening time that solar energy production is weakest during low mobility demand times automated vehicles can store solar energy during peak production times then deliver that energy when and where it is needed also since we have the automobiles equipped with 5g connectivity we can provide a self-healing mesh network across large areas as well as a partition consumer Wi-Fi service all while the vehicles receive micro transaction reimbursements for sharing their internet can thank you for your time and we hope you enjoyed our version of the blockchain powered vehicle future for more information please visit us at oaken innovations calm in blockchain - Mobility org thank you and Brendan Playford presenting the energy blockchain in 20 minutes they're presenting it now but it takes 20 minutes [Music] [Music] [Music] my name is Gary McDonald and this is Brendon Playford hi guys and we're here to tell you about the overview of that so today we just would love to take the opportunity to talk to you about a couple different things first of all we kind of want to frame the situation of the state of energy markets today and to find the opportunity for a new energy paradigm and and public infrastructure is generally incompatible with with the energy infrastructure today and how we're building a new infrastructure that will enable that transition and then give an example of an application that will run there so energy infrastructure today was largely designed a long time ago and a lot of regulation that applies to it today which cycles the innovation was put in place about 100 years ago and has been lobbied for to keep in place since then so there's massive inefficiencies in the entire ecosystem and infrastructure and the control and distribution of energy today is actually quite antiquated and so there's a lot of regulation that's preventing us from from implementing a new system so it's super important that we work with the current incumbents to integrate this system and aware of how your energy what process energy goes through to get to your home right now do you even know whether you're a deregulated space or a regulated space there are certain states in America hands up really if anyone fully understands the process through which their energy goes to get to them so one go over here not many people here so the the infrastructure we have right now is pretty antic yeah pretty antiquated and it's set up for a sort of centralized highly capitalized market system whereby you generally have monolithic generators on a network the transmit power directly to a consumer in Europe that's changed a little bit with deregulation and certainly in the US markets where you've got California New England Texas deregulated which gives the opportunity for more competition little bit more exposure for other players to come into the market and offer unique products and really you know there's there's there's limited opportunities for new players to come in there's limited opportunity for new technology to be embraced for example novel gasification we obviously have a big rush for solar and wind right now which is being very very well financed but also a lot of light small-scale projects yeah basically energy units that are generated and intended to be used by a consumer only 10 of those actually get to the end point and when you something like this is actually ridiculously low and enables the system then we can really increase yeah and I'm just gonna add science that really quickly as well the International Energy Association by 2050 is planning on getting 57% of all renewables to kind of give global supply of energy so 57% of the total energy produced will have to come from in euros now an interesting point to note about that is when you look at renewables technology a lot of it is decentralized distributed power small-scale stuff which doesn't really have any links to a network right now so if I've got solar panels on my house yes that's great I might have a grid tie I might benefit from a feed-in tariff but there's a whole host of other tokenize sort of derivatives that you can take from that model which can unlock a huge amount of economic abundance from already distributed systems in order to coalesce all of these things together we can do that really well on blockchain so I'm gonna leave Garrett to talk a bit more and then I'll come back to those points we need to do every single device that's able to consume or produce energy is connected as a node and that node is an agent that's aware of all the other nodes in this locality and can react dynamically according to the current market conditions how much energy is being sold for weather what time of day it is whether there's an abundance of solar power that needs to be consumed to not flood the market or flood the power lines and it is actually quite a difference between interacting and physical infrastructure like this and something like finance where here if you mess up some numbers then you can actually cause fires and that's it's not just a simple rewrite so it's it's actually very very critical infrastructure is completely secure and when you're looking at how these bits of hardware infrastructure get financed so obviously in the interest of the actual utility operators so the actual generator on the network to finance that and create a sustainable way of getting return for investors on those big capital projects again going back to the fact that renewables are generally distributed systems in order to bring about an unlock value and create more incentive for people to either crowdsource or pull together of resources or small groups of community investors into I don't know like a biogas or a wind project in Africa giving a platform where people can come together to actually finance that giving these distributed systems where at the moment you can take a renewable energy credit for example for a small solar installation on your house and participate in the rock or the rec market which for small independent people with solar panels on their house is not something can do you generally go through an agent you generally bundle these wrecks or rocks up into one package and send them out to auction so we're looking at creating like a frictionless way of moving value around this system and that's moving value not just of energy it's also ways in which smaller producers and smaller participants in the network can benefit from getting value from what they already have and I think that's like that unlocking of value is really powerful here with what we're looking at it's gonna get people a much more frictionless experience and able to do more with what they've got yeah absolutely so here's a little demo that one of our partner companies made a good singularity that just shows a simulation of a local energy grid where all where each section of the network is able to dynamically act to the others and it just shows an example of pricing and if you turn off the power plant how the house is in that network react so you can see that when the power plant is turned off that the houses will dynamically adjust their consumption and production loads and and basically just react to that so that way in the event of an actual outage in a real power plant the houses will be able to still consume power locally and produce it and interact with each other and this is gonna be a huge resiliency improvement for energy grids all over the world once this is implemented so of course the infrastructure today doesn't work very well for that so we're building a new one and it's called the energy web blockchain and we have our test net live right now and that sets page is live and we just open sourced it on the first of this month and it's everything is accessible there we can do 2500 transactions a second right now because it's proof of authority the authorities are energy companies that we currently trust to keep the lights on so we figure that it's reasonable to trust them also to validate blocks correctly and right now it's open network and it will always be an open network that anybody can use freely and run applications and transact value in the etherium smart contract of course is completely compatible and can run on the energy of penetration blockchain and interchange communication is something that we're very much prioritizing and we want to have that coming really soon so for instance projects like polka dot will be very high on our list to implements that way we can interact with the etherion public blockchain as well I think I just want to reflect on a way that I'm involved in this mix where the project that we're working on right now is called the Aurora Network and what it is it's an open-source Hardware project where through these mechanisms we're building we can actually deploy hardware that's innovative and otherwise wouldn't find funding so I've got a really good example biomass gasification particularly small-scale biomass gasification classically is pretty much unheard of unless you're on a commercial scale and when you look at the way in which going back more yeah - this - this whole household model here when you're looking at for example solar there's a supply demand of which you've got seis this massive abundance of solar energy during the day currently not sufficiently deployed storage batteries to take that power offline and our usage is generally out of whack with that like we're all at work during the day the majority of the actual power consumption isn't until the morning or the evening you get this dull period and we're all used to getting cheap electricity in some regions through the night you get the economy saving between like 1 a.m. 7:00 in the morning that's because big power stations have to keep running they don't just shut down shutting down costs a ton of money so by implementing this system whereby you can take energy as and when it's needed from core parts and understand what equipment you can bring online and when so for example in the time of high demand you have a bit of equipment that would otherwise cost more to run or more to cut like produce a unit of energy that may come on in these times of high demand and you may have a variable pricing model for that so that energy can be used in the quiet and sort of leveled across the network but you're effectively smooth and this is like a smart grid effect so all of these companies are kind of moving towards this more smart grid and again this vision of a more distributed power network this beautifully supports that when you're actually looking at tokenizing for example the energy on the network you need a high transaction throughput to do that the rate and volume of which you're planning on scaling to to make this be a very impactful global sort of infrastructure that allows this transfer of value and flow of markets globally says you can take abundance in one area and maybe deploy that in an area where there may not be the infrastructure or the actual drive to develop in an african community for example so California is a great example California there is an abundance of walnut' shelves that are supplied by walnut manufacturing companies so where do they go right now those walnut shells are dumped or burned there is no value being created by that by-product so take those walnuts shells put them through something like a gasifier on site have a grid tie try that back to the network and actually use that energy in a way where you can either sell that directly to a consumer using your tokenized model and link with more of the smart meters were seeing like there are these inductive smart meters where you clamp them onto your incoming feed of your house and it will do a Fourier transform on your frequencies of your energy and it will tell you after about a month of learning your fridge is using 60% of the power your toast areas using 0.1% whatever that mix looks like and if you analyze that data you can actually start incentivizing good actors in the system so I can make an assessment of what the usage in this house should be if an actor is overusing that they pay a fee if an actor is underusing and coming below a threshold they get paid that back so you're not just incentive izing smarter energy distribution you're incentivizing good behavior in your ascent advising better practice on the network whereby the participants contribute overall to a lower demand and that's done in like a fluid an organic way because everything is so static right now for instance in California sometimes their events we're in the middle of the day on a hot summer day there's a bunch of abundance of solar power that the market just doesn't need the rest of the resources are not flexible so they're not able to ramp down production fast enough to actually utilize the solar energy so the utility companies sometimes ask the solar producers to turn off their panels so that way the abundance of electrons don't flood the network and so this is obviously a huge waste and not effective utilization of our solar industry so yeah basically enabling the all of the resources on the network to be a lot more flexible will enable a much higher utilization of all the electricity we're generating from renewables especially especially the ones that vary yeah I think this vision is well for the more IOT connected sort of state so where you have these feedback mechanisms into a smart grid where it understands exactly what to switch on and off when it's really kind of that utopian vision of a really efficient marketplace where you're again going back to allowing a nice flow of value so when you unlock value in systems that isn't currently used you know our vision is to then use some of that elsewhere in the world to make an actual impact so take that station that's really abundant and producing revenue and using a portion to develop other you know other infrastructure elsewhere invest that in more kind of skunkworks new development open-source hardware which does exist out there that currently isn't getting the attention because it's hard to monetize hard to justify costs and incumbents just would like to continue in the current paradigm yeah exactly and so the ecosystem within energy applications that are seeking to use blockchain infrastructure and some magnitude is expanding super rapidly this is a smattering of companies that are that are trying to accomplish this some of them we have agreements with already and we're working actively lyft we've spoken with all of them all of them have shown interest in using they do have blockchain for the purposes simply because you can have a lot more transaction throughput and so on so and some of them have gone to the point of purchasing tokens in the energy web blockchain which are used as gas similar to ethan ether any etherium so yeah i just wanted to say thank you very much it's a huge honor to be here thanks for thanks for having us and yeah we do have a couple more minutes left so if there any questions we're happy to take those thanks guys Thanks [Applause] did anyone have any questions if you don't that's fine if you do yeah right so in your presentation there is a slide where you mentioned that energy demand fluctuates throughout the day and that doesn't coincide with energy that's produced through means like solar my question is what role do technologies like in house batteries think tesla powerwall have in addressing that specific problem yeah absolutely so basically the idea is what the tesla powerwall is if you and if you have an infrastructure that supports the leasing of batteries on a short timescale like for instance over the course of a day then if there's abundance of solar on one home for instance if we just go back to the simulation there's abundance of power on on this home because they have a lot of solar panels and only two batteries and this one doesn't have that but maybe he has more storage capacity then basically you can lease out the battery and use that solar power throughout the day to power everything during the night when it's not there so that way you're shaving the peak a lot so batteries like that play a tremendous role and actually utilizing the solar power more effectively even though you have a of obvious decrease in efficiency when you store electrons in a battery you lose some but the gains over just use lighting and utilizing the normal grid is tremendous yeah and I think something I'll add to that as well is not just to be too narrow in solar is to also look at a lot of the other technologies that are out there so in the UK there is a system called the Triad Network and what the Triad network does it is a bunch of distributed diesel gensets very very big substantial ones tied to the grid in strategic locations around the UK between the hours of 6 & 7 p.m. they will switch on they switch on they provide a very expensive kind of surcharged power which balances this load so I think it's about thinking about how you can also bring on more novel technologies like you can use recycled cooking oil that's been reprocessed in a diesel genset as a biomass fuel in a strategic location the infrastructure that costs a little bit more but if you are able to switch it on at the right time of demand and only use it when demand is high then that can help balance that though so it's a combination of storing and finding dynamic load in the network that can instinctively switch on based on the load balancing that's kind of in the smart grid to bring that power on when it's needed so you've got this nice blend of battery which is going to take some time to kind of get affected on the network and novel technologies there to boost it but focusing on renewables for that I guess I'm curious what the change in efficiency is between the optimized version and normal market if you know sorry in terms of like yeah thanks yes if you're good to repeat yourself I didn't quite hear the between the wish market the other day yeah who essentially had everyone sort of bid and schedule stuff and I guess it sounds like it's sort of a real-time auction so I think what you're asking are you asking between the future vision for a network like this and what we have currently is it just an optimization exercise where values coming from efficiency savings because we have a little bit more fluidity in the network is that we're saying hey yeah well thank you for the talk I had a quick question about distribution because you talked about production and also storing at the local nodes sure but isn't there an issue of a distribution still being somewhat centralized and also in waterfall pattern which would prevent peer-to-peer send and or cell energy to my neighbor kind of thing because there's no connection there yeah right now the distribution grid is definitely centralized and the idea is to work with them and bring more and more distribution grid owners on to this network and then eventually will be able to decentralize the ownership of that of course that's what we all want we want a completely decentralized system but enabling the current incumbents in the market to start acting with these technologies and profiting more from these is the first step to getting them on board to a really truly decentralized system so then yeah you're completely right that it is still centralized in that there's generally one monopoly in that state like most of California or the state like Colorado where one company often don'ts the entire distribution grid so yeah we hope that'll change over time yeah they're physical the mutation by the fact that you can't actually even send energy from your home so because there's no so it depends I think we're saying is so there's we've got deregulated markets and regulated markets which will allow generators access on or off the network and that is split into you've obviously got the generator you've got the transmitter which is your do you know your local operator which is your power lines you think got the utility on the amateur retail side of it now what you're saying is that bit in the middle which is generally controlled in non deregulated markets in regulated markets the likes of Colorado that is something that if you want to supply it directly then user you can't if you want to supply it direct to the energy provider and they will pay you a pretty poor rate for that energy then you can also do that and it's then bundled up in their package what I think this is going to do it's going to increase competition in markets where there is already deregulation like Europe like the UK like these particular states in California and what it needs to be it needs to be a community effort to influence and lobby as well through relationships like energy whoever doing like bringing together a consortium to all view this through the lens of this is the future these companies all want smart grids they're struggling to understand how to do that and if you can place their weaknesses with giving them sort of power in areas where they currently don't have it where they have these deficiencies where they need to top it up it's all about working together and understanding where to start and like them where to influence to move forward but I think there'll be more power at least from this in the hands of the operators that are building infrastructure like independently than what they're currently is I just had a quick question about the proof of authority chain sure how are like users expected to pay gas costs why would they get ether to pay for the gas costs right now users in the test network could send it out for free of course in the full network we're still figuring out the governance principles and stuff we're not launching the domain network the genesis flock will be in the beginning of 2019 we're still in an exploratory phase figuring out exactly the best mechanisms for that but right now the idea is you you purchase it like you'd purchase either okay thanks okay got you great all right well thanks everybody thanks guys [Applause] [Music] the next speaker is Robert from mysterium talking about protecting user privacy in the blockchain ecosystem [Applause] hello everybody all right nice to meet you my name is Robert I would miss you MTM and I guess this this Def Con has been a lot about privacy and you have seen a lot technical talks about privacy and this is ending DEFCON is ending so I would love to leave you with some fundamental thoughts about what privacy means what does it mean in our daily lives what does it mean in our every day use of blockchain and internet apps and if it's even possible to protect it so let's start off what is privacy what is anonymity are they different are they the same and how do they apply in our everyday life privacy well what does it mean to have privacy when you engage in an activity let's say an online activity you log into your bank account you log into your Facebook account you log you you you talk to somebody you go into the bathroom when you engage in an activity privacy means having control of who has access to that activity together with you if anybody when you're creating your private keys for the wallet you don't want to give access to anybody unless I don't know it's your wife but when you log into Facebook you give Facebook the right to change things but you trust Facebook to not change things beyond what you tell them to like clicking on the like button and if there is any entity third-party entity unauthorized entity which is monitoring your actions that means you've lost your privacy and if that entity can monitor your actions and even change things like block you from going into Facebook if you're in China for example well that means you really lost your privacy unanimity on the other hand is a little bit different concept anonymity means you go out into the world and you want the world to see what you're doing you just don't want the world to know who you are and like like we're sending eaters on blockchain we everybody can see those eaters being sent nobody knows who is the person sending them or who is the entity doing that and both concepts are really important privacy is there for us to be calm to calm down and anonymity is there for the society it's a it's a catalyst of change without one we would not have freedom of speech or at least we would be very afraid to do so so on the fundamental level anything that happens on the Internet is basically communication right entity a is talking to entity B and they create a communication channel and over the last couple of decades this channel has been well I don't know how to say breached to be the least you can monitor what's happening and sometimes even even in interrupt the the communication let's let's talk about the same example Facebook app to Facebook server when you're on in certain countries you just can't reach that server why because somebody can see that that communication channel being opened up and they cut it right there so the question is is it possible to even protect this channel between those two entities and those two entities can be anything it could be a device talking to a server after app the server server-to-server anything so is it possible to protect to protect identities of these two that would mean unanimity and to protect the content of the of the communication happening between those two that would mean privacy and we believe it is and that that's what we set out as a mission for ourselves to protect the identities and to protect the content so that no third-party unauthorized third party entity could take a look see who is talking and understand what they're talking about so protecting privacy and anonymity the question is of course how to achieve this and we suggest to do it in couple phases as a phase one we're gonna be building a decentralized network of VPN nodes which means basically that anybody can become a VPN no just download an open-source app run it on your computer and that's it anybody can connect through you if they need that communication and you'll be paid to serve this service on top of it we're gonna add a couple errors for example a decentralized discovery mechanism so it wouldn't have a single point of failure a an anonymous identity management so that you would know like if entity a is using those three nodes they would know whom to pay and of course an anonymous payment mechanism so that again it could not be tracked in this case entity if they want to talk to an entity B that's a Facebook app server they would connect our first node and let's let's imagine I don't know capital and situation and let's let's let's think there's a bit of a crisis taking place right now and if the communication would be blocked so they would connect first node somewhere in the Catalan then the connection would be encrypted and that the the contents would be hidden identity would be hidden from this note it would go to the next note I don't know here into Mexico finally to the third note right next to Facebook headquarters and then right unencrypted in this place all the way up to the third note the traffic is encrypted and after the third note third note has the keys as well as entity a they decrypt the traffic and it goes to note B it's an amazing technology it can open up borders it can go around I forgot the word basically you cannot block content anymore because you cannot see what is what is taking place but of course there is a little bit of like the final stretch is still not fully protected because you still have like for example a third note can still become the node that's rogue and can contribute to the cause of tracking data and blocking data and man-in-the-middle attacks and and and and all the other things happening and between this node and and the final destination there could be an ice piece which again act as malicious ones and vice versa so is it possible to completely protect the channel between a and B so that it would not be possible to see who is talking and what they're talking about and we believe it is and that's what we're offering basically afterward after phase 1 when we're building this infrastructure when this is done what we're gonna do is we're going to open up a protocol and any app developer who is wishing to protect their users talking to each other to protect their servers talking to each other protect their users talking to servers will be able to do so by integrating this protocol and at this stage network the messages going out from the first place would be encrypted here shredded sent through multiple nodes recollected at the exit node at the destination place with private keys which a and B have they could be reassembled into a coherent message and consumed a and B trust each other so they have no problem of sharing this information everything from outside would look like lots of gibberish every node would have for example note 5 would just see node 4 as as some node and they would relay the message to B without ever knowing if B is another node or the final recipient and and the same way goes for the note for note 4 would never know if a was on just another node or Ori original sender in this case what we would have is we will have a private privacy protected because of the communication content is not recognizable for any third party not even a note not us not anybody anonymous because identities would be protected because only them would know who is each other and trust less because no note would ever be possible to take this information and make any meaning of it so yeah this will enable any app developer to integrate this private communication channel entered their apps and making well making an unstoppable app so that's it thank you and let's work together [Applause] if there's any time left maybe you want to ask some questions I did forgot to tell of course that it's an open source platform all the code is on github already so yeah hello I just had one quick question who's asking but yeah so you spit up the messages into the different nodes I think this is a dumb question by the way but I mean you split the message up into different nodes yeah what happens if one node goes down and the message doesn't come together at the end exactly there's of course we don't have this working yet so I can't really give you an definite exact definite answer but what is possible to do is to it's possible to break down into an overlapping messages so that we've lost the graph but so that the same part of the information flows through different nodes and then gets reassembled yes of course there is a certain amount of waste but but then you're secure hi I have a question to my knowledge I think was the GCHQ launched up a whole set of like tour notes for instance and if they had sufficient Thor knows then they knew okay well we're getting a message we're sending it to one of our other nodes and one of our other nodes and eventually they could the anonymize tour that way if you incentivize them along the path though even if you do scramble it aren't you afraid that that would actually just pay them to do that process pay them to do what how stop a heck of a lot of forwarding nodes and then basically draw out the topology of the network okay well you can probably draw the topology of the that's a good question you can draw topology of the network but still you don't like an int or you have the exit node which is decrypting the final message and they have some meaning even if you're using as a cell but they still have some in here they wouldn't they would just know the next next destination just the next destination but they don't know who is there is that the end receiver or is it just another note there just act as a relay yes I understand that but the idea was that they launched up a heck of a lot of notes and they actually became a like a large part of a completed circuit but I had to do that out of pocket be users when paying them for it okay that's that's just an interesting question if you know more on this I would love to work on on this I just don't have an answer at school in your face to example you're talking about the message being broke so from node a to node B the message being broken up and carried through a bunch of other nodes I'm wondering why you would do that because if you're trying to preserve anonymity you want to hide the fact that a is talking to be at all not necessarily the content of the message I'm wondering what what breaking the message up and putting it through this network accomplishes well first of all if you're talking from A to B and if there's a let's say an ice P in the middle they would know where the messages are going and in case you break down the messages and the chunks and send them through different relays and as proxies you get lost you don't know who's basically that's protecting identities of of the messengers because a and B they're not nodes they're they're their original message and the recipient I think he was saying if we imagine like a passive monitoring attack sort of observing package traveling the network if you break it up and send it multiple ways it's easier to monitor I think and he was asking if that's true is that correct yeah I'm sorry I kind of look kind of so int or the you know the unknown enemy is preserved because you have a route that's encrypted so the right person along the path can can see that I'm assuming you're you're doing that in phase one so in Phase two where you haven't broken up that just results in more nodes carrying traffic from A to B and so if you have you know have an attack where somebody is by being several nodes along the path able to you know statistically correlate traffic and stuff I'm wondering what breaking it up what it does I'm not sure myself that's a good question yeah it might be yeah we need to model it more maybe it's enough just use similar to tor just a few hops from from from notes and finally getting to the destination eventually the final node doesn't decrypt the message so yeah maybe that's not even worth it it's it's it's it's something to model we're not we're not interface to yet so we're still building the the first phase one so thank you [Applause] thank you does this one work yeah one more talk and I'm just gonna do a quick announcement and the loud speakers outside to invite people in for the last talk and then we'll I'll introduce the final speakers [Music] almost ready this is Akasha unveiling the next experiment with me hi Alesi and Marius Daria the real a Cancun what an epic desk on this was can we agree let's give it up for a tearing foundation and everyone making this happen yeah thank you so let me okay so before we begin I would like to ask how many of you have heard of Akasha before can we see a show of okay that's that is impressive and I'm just curious how many of you have actually tried the Alpha Wow okay so we have quite a few alpha veterans thank you for taking the time to play with the app for those of you who haven't heard of Akasha before as a word it comes from Sanskrit and it means eater but it also stands as an acronym for advanced knowledge architecture for social human advocacy and what we are trying to build is a peer-to-peer alternative in a world where the social media networks are modeled after the Napster architecture where the user depends on a server or a server operator or an entity and we want to tackle this problem from a different perspective using different technologies so in a word we want to showcase the potential of aetherium combined with ipfs to solve all problems using new technologies and the thing we want to achieve is a shared and persistent information Commons that can help people put the key that can help we gained their collective memory and freedom of expression back from the claws of corporations that monetize each quick and pretty everything it's really bad so to put it visually the Napster web apps are Napster like web apps rely on the server admin or the server itself and if for some reason the user does not comply or respect whatever the server operator once they lose access to the service in the Alpha we took the hardest challenge we could find which was to build a fully decentralized a stopped-up meaning that each user when they downloaded and installed the Akasha application they were actually installing bundled an etherium node and an IP FS node so in the pattern thanks to hard work of the team we will also introduce a fully functional web version which will remove the need to sync with with a chain and the users will then rely on meta mask or any other battery service provider like status or or missed and when we say that free speech is embedded in software what we mean is that whereas the user can be kicked for whatever reason from the Napster like web apps on Akasha the users are in full control over their identity and the content they are posting so our story began on May 6th mater 2016 on World Press Freedom Day and this is when we basically announced that we've been working for quite some time on the Akasha alpha it was a total shot in the dark for us we weren't sure exactly what we expect so it was kind of a test to see how it will be received among ourselves before we released the website we we talked and we say ok man what what would we consider a success you know just to have some some numbers and Mario's here said like 30 people in the first 24 hours would be cool Roxanna here more optimistic 50 people and I was 24 hours later we surpassed 200 I now switch was like whoa and then in less than a month we surpassed 2,000 people so it became clear that we weren't crazy or that we weren't the only ones so Disney these numbers might not seem much at first but it's worth mentioning that every single person that sign up for the Alpha reached organically our website so we just published blog post linked them on reddit or tweeted them so what we wanted was to measure the real interest in the application and we felt that paid advertising would attain those results we would end up measuring the efficiency of targeted ads rather than the real interest in in the application and idea so fast forwarding until early 2017 one year after it helium we launched the first public version of the Alpha and it was called into the ether it was received very well by the community and I suppose you guys also tried it hope you had a pleasant experience when when you when you tried it and basically in the Alpha we tried to have a basic functionality you find in a social network which was to publish something to comment on something to read something to vote and to follow people combined also with things like since we are using aetherium one of the side effects is that each identity is also a wallet so people can also send resources to each other and so forth and after the release one of this is actually a screen from the Akasha application a comment and on the first row you can see that someone it was like excited that there's a tab that normal people can use and for us I was like exactly what we were aiming for but I think the big point here was that with all these people you and the others that might be watching this this conference we proved that it is possible it is possible to have an application that does not rely on servers for people to communicate among themselves and thanks to your playfulness in your time put into testing the application we identified some bugs and we also identified what can be done better and Mario's now is going to explain one of the lessons we learned in alpha and that we applied in the beta Marius thank you yeah so what is this yeah I think all the Alpha users got stuck at a given time in this loading loading screen this was happening because of the way we used to load the resources we were trying to get all of them at once so if given time one of the resources would would be unavailable the other resources would have to wait for that one to become online before fetching them to the user so in the beta version this was one of the biggest challenge we we had to solve we've done this by loading every single resource individually as you can see in this demo so it comes with a great improvement on the UX side so enough with this another highlight of the beta is the first token experiment in the Alpha we had a eth which served as a placeholder token and I just want to make something clear this is there is just one token which is this currently in nicknamed n-eth we are open to suggestions regarding the name we want to avoid confusion with other projects like it area okay and this is just an experiment to get the power running right so we fully assume that we are we don't have all the answers but we invite everyone to collaborate on finding them so to give you an overview of how these token works on the surface a a th is in an ear C 20 compatible token it works pretty much as you would expect from an ERCP token you can send and receive but there is a twist you can lock it for a predefined amount of time and this will give you some something we call mana which acts like a regional crypto field that can burned inside the application Maurice will cover this in more detail afterwards and essence is basically mana that is burned and if the quality of the content is deemed as good the authors and the persons interacting can consume this essence to mean new tokens in existence and not Leslie karma is our experiment on the proto reputation layer and Mario's now we'll give you a presentation of the token flow of the states and how everything ties in together so so starting from the beta version every user we have to burn a small amount of mana to interact with the application so how do we how do we get mana the user can get some mana by locking his Akasha tokens for a period of time during which he gets periodically the man replenished the man I used for the mana burned for doing actions in a cursor can be collected afterwards into two specific resources called instance and karma karma will serve in Akasha like some sort of proto reputation which will unlock specific features like creating communities and so on which will require to be above level of karma the other one the essence it's interesting because this is the first idea which came to us we incentivize the users to create content on Akasha because it can be consumed to mint New Year c20 Akasha tokens and we spent afterwards also at any given time the user can unlocked their money magnified tokens and afterwards it will go to the Year 320 state by passing to a delay time which we call it a cycle yeah so let's see new basic flow so we have the publisher which post an entry on Akasha the readers afterwards can express their general feeling about the quality of the content by voting after a voting period the entry will generate a small amount of essence which afterwards can be claimed by both publisher and the reader by specific we were starting to feel good about ourselves like yeah man I think we're on to something here Vitalik did it again so then just a few days ago Vitalik published this this entry so he basically pointed out that there are more than just so a good talk and economic system requires more than just a way to insert units of that particular currency into circulation and you know this is quite interesting because following a couple of days the media started to digest this information and started calling the tokens invented until this point as tokens 1.0 and you know if you think about it it's pretty accurate since we are still barely scratching the surface of what can be done and we are still trying to understand the basic pieces of the puzzle that make a good token work and then things kept snowballing and by by the end of the day we had like this sort of stuff is like everything you need to know about cryptocurrencies so you know 90% of startups in general fall so maybe it would have been more accurate to say that with a poorly designed token 99% of the token startups will fall but to focus on the positive the question of how do we get to talk in 2.0 started to take shape and since metallic thanks started this I figured that it's best to just show a short video of a short segment of a recent video done by veturi so without further ado the nice thing about cryptocurrency I think is that it just makes it so bloody easy to create one of these economic mechanisms you just write it up in code but it just makes it really easy to just sort of service an economic experimentation ground for doing these kinds of things and so you know that's sort of the whole point if you cannot make an experimentation is sort of coming up with these sort of clever clever little tricks that sort of combine together incentives and sort of put some little put things together in this nice way that gives people the in the inside have to do the right thing and you just you there's probably quite a lot to be done it's just really we're all getting started I like to focus on that right it's still just ear 2 after material and our approach this thing to maybe answering this question is that just as a theorem had during its frontier the theorem Olympics where we're developers from around the world were invited to identify parks attack vectors and basically if you can break it go ahead and we'll learn for it from it will become stronger we invite everyone here and that's watching the presentation to join us in breaking and reinventing and breaking the token proposal and basically with the I ETH proposal and what we showcase today we want to just get the prototype in the world and then in a sort of cypherpunk inception like fashion to iterate co-create in the open on akasha itself so we will use tags to coordinate and later on if we still have time we will show you an actual demo of how this this will work but basically what we want or hope is that if we approach things from this perspective maybe people and and startups can think of of tokens as this dynamic adaptive systems which involve multiple pieces that you have to roughly put together rather than a graph going from zero to the moon right so I think together if we will title this this question we might reach some emergent shared understanding because no one has like the full idea of what is talking 2.0 but a thousand little half-baked ideas can come together in something completely new and the cool thing about this is that this is a code I really like is that the mind won't stretch by an idea never returned to its original dimensions and if you want an example just remember that in 2014 a theorem had the ether pre-sell which led to around eighteen point five million dollars being raised to fund the development of the platform and it was number one as in the most successful crowdfunding campaign in the history of the internet and now a couple of years later over three billion dollars have been raised by companies using icos as a form of raising funds for their projects so just one idea huge impact so now the big picture of what we're trying to accomplish is like we're not trying to compete with the big boys I mean they have billions of users would be nice but let's get real we want to have a real alternative inch in place to keep them in check and this is not like paper or plastic back choice we want to offer people a fundamentally different choice when it comes to each person's digital sovereignty as human netizens and I think we can all agree after this beautiful Def Con that watching history in the making is cool but we think that writing the future self is even cooler so on this note we invite everyone to be able to join us in building together in this decade a pattern ology architecture for the next century and we actually have all the tools and we have like a pretty good idea of where things can go and the future is not a place we get to visit the future is a place we get to create and I would like to announce that the beta signups are open for everyone that wants to party to pay then subscribe just go to a cache odd odd world insert your email in a min and in a matter of weeks we will send you the invite and we will start released the better and since I see we still have two minutes I will now show you a demo of what the beta looks like and this is basically the dashboard view in which we have like different streams and different columns which can be customized by the users and here we had a column which is a tag and in this case is crypto Olympics so people can coordinate on the ideas brainstorm these are proposals they can use the entries and the comment section as counterproposals or to discuss various ideas and this is like an example which is all a con kun or a Def Con how it works to publish a comment as you can see the UI has changed quite a bit also in the back end we basically are now looking at a completely rewritten decentralized application from dub so it would be more correct to call it like version 2 but since we started with the Alpha we will name it better and here on the left side desired what we call boards for now and basically offers like different windows into specific topics so if we take the example of Def Con one of the car of the poor's could have been like events presentations workshops and people could have coordinated better rather than checking already 10 discord rooms one slack you get idea to jeeter's and and so on so I would like to thank you all for your attention and it's great being here hope to see you on arkasha soon [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thanks Mihai in a crash shop and I wanted to thank everyone here DEFCON three participants presenters panelists sponsors attendees remote viewers volunteers event team members and at this time I would like to ask if there are any volunteers and aetherium team members please come up on stage so we can say close out the show together Casey Hudson anybody here everybody gon come on up come on up Joe come on up it was not without effort to execute such a conference for our development community but it was well worth it and we'd like to do it again and we don't have the whole you know we don't have the team here but I'd like everyone to come up who's been involved Joe come on up and vitalik you're in the house come on up thank you all very very much Clem foundation step on three 2017 [Applause] nice nice thank you [Applause] thanks everyone have a great night [Music]
