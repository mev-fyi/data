you you what is carbon vote basically it is a gauge for human consensus it collects information and opinions from the community for usually for blockchain Bay blockchain governance related issues we are I decentralize the team from the Chinese community I am from a stone ledger which is a consortium implementation of etherium that connects to end compatible to Chinese legal system so we have a booth outside so if you interested enough to learn more come to us and other teams member from Constance labs grip tape and eth fans so I think we have all our members here today so guys if you are here would you please stand up and say hello to everybody daniel from consent celeb did most of the heavy lift hee hee buttes the web sites within like a three days so yeah Thank You Daniel so as a stone ledger at the carbon vote we we believe in people we think machine service human and carbon / silicon that's why we are called a carbon vote not a second vote so human comes first right we are based on what we are based on we are based on carbon and machines computers are based on silicon's so our goal is to reach consensus from the mayor from the community you know you know fishing in a efficient way so when it comes to consensus we think there are two layers of it the underneath layer is the Machine consensus and the upper layer is human consensus the machine Leah refers to consensus mechanisms like proof of work and approve estate why are human consensus is more closely related to block chain governance and offering it comes with the soft box and hard Fox we firmly believe that machine consensus is just a tool for human consensus its main purpose is to foster late for the human consensus so that's what we did so what we did with the carbon vote against many of you have seen this photo here you're in the debate of the door hardwar had a hard work we did a poor from a community to measure whether the community wants to want a hard or not so basically there are two addresses one is a yes address and the other is no address if we want to vote for years you simply send a zero if the transaction to the yes address and all you're either in your local account would be casted to the yes voting by doing so we lured both technical Barry and the mental Barry because here you you do not need to send users out and you're either is not locked locked in any means so in the end we got about five a five percent of total is a voted and the 80s of eighty-seven percent of them voted for yes so what we learned we found that consensus enforcement is very hard in the real world decisions are enforced by violence wiring our word grip toward everybody is free to choose and what prochain to live on right I do believe we have a better world but we gotta split with a coexistence of et Cie right the space is in terms of price talents and resources if you look at the price of ET cie it's a has it has been hovering around the 10 to you know ten to twenty percent of e th and it it's a pretty consistent with the with the voting result about future plans we think they are something suitable to vote and the other are not community wisest taking effect issues are probably worth a voting yes or no to controversial hard Fox and so Fox and fundamental overhauls like POS and other wild wider affect issues like whether or not to charge a rent for for smart contract instead of a charge for a big chunk of a fee in the beginning and let the small country live forever there's something that we think are not suitable to for voting something too technical and something no not essential enough to you know to what our time so to wrap up blockchain governance is really hard and the voting results are not likely impossible even with the super majority support so in that tense deal with caution and that's all I want to say and a lot of our I will look forward to see you on peluche and make up and vote make your voice heard thank you
