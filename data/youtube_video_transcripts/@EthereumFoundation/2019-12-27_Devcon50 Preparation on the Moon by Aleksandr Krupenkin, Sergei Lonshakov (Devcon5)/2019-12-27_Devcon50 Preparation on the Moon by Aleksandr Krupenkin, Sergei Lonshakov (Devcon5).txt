[Applause] their use sis please she get hugged upon such error ah DEFCON five and five requirements for this version of unity linux for all service anatomist and installed ipfs client for other videos you just can watch what happens in sleep and okay so to start my name is Sergio Chaco since undercooking we are for developers or anonymously from project and [Music] in the next 45 minutes we will will give you a short introduction in the history of our experiments because we started on 2015 is our first experiments after that we will show you a demo installation process and we will try to do together first steps to connect you this assimilation of une heure workers to build moon base and the last time we will try to to do everything what we need in our scenario to feel invested before the computer so first start a little bit about us I was involved in printed card projects eight years ago but from 2014 I started working on the basic theorem ideas and 2059 matrix under and we focused only on using a theorem in robotics fields with antinea how we can control robotics under here computer because if you know for us it's the first destroyed world of computer and if it's computer we can use it to control our budgets in physical world so this is our first experiment in winter 2015 it's a funny little so I recommend you can see speaker cortex two minutes to Worcester he saw said Russian winter and you can see in an example Stevens and sharing center of the field and create first error smart contract between human and machine after said we spent around three years with the different type of currencies where we used a funeral to control robotics we use water currents Hawaii drones self-driving car simulations sensors industrial liberators and model of whites our factories under the control and in the result of selves we prepared robotics welcomes its means we don't only prepare experiments and push out our source code on github we tried to build common framework for engineers who interesting to use a theorem on robotics fields so if you want to connect sensors turns some o some focus you are services from NASA standards you can use what we have now on github so it's means mother mix it's a first open source platform which you can use to connect your projects under Imperial control and in our vision it's important today because you know in many countries news you see how speakers say about future of the cities about smart cities and in many cases see shows the same feature but in this place they show cooperation systems so I can different targets under god I mustn't go out to Google so in our vision we can be used as choice a technologist person not to connect small sensors but in robotics maybe you know we have a definition for cyber physical systems it's much more complex systems like not drawn by the drug-based not a sensor but sensor networks not that one doctor manipulator but smart FET so it's built you don't need the blockchain or smart contract to send signal from one hand to buzzer man but when we have a communication between self-driving car and some soar panel a gas station or some situation you get economical communication with the technical between two cooperation or between physicals equipment and companies and in these cases in our opinion if your own computer can be interested so now I could examine an introduction or accent hello everyone my name is Alex hello alla programmers and they will have any technical questions please ask me and I explain details of ergonomics technical course so let's try to be in toward playing our the cup structure how many developers here is take your hands not so many yes so much network is a little bit complex thing and let me try to explain the good point for beginner is Error repository but have great documentation and you can try it's a Linux distribution that contains so many packages for us and for a party system that you can connect with zero bot and the try going or tutorials if you are this is how applications developer let's try to look into organize J's library helps generate your centralized application is robotics network and all the open project is open source and you can find it in the story let's try to start again the first one he needs is a open or import my pear phone in our repository we can take whatever skill account and start to roll over gave me instructions how many you people's [Music] before okay so it's unreal before we left up and tried to do some description so as a first step you can open to accessorize application with the repair process for shop it's a Moon Bay statistics and if your oven is in [Music] what you can find you with him today we will try to build human base with the three type of work first is the construction work so in the next step you will download una worker simulation and you will show you would choice select what type of work you want to do on movie construction work by support or is very important for any conference about greater repair bravery or so to understand what is the next light go to the next step and downloads is under worker it's around five megabytes and on the next step you can [Music] so yeah [Music] so if you try to launch one on working without any options you you will see message about you missing options where you can choose construct the life of rabbits so I think you understand that is one option please what we saw before so you can select for example life suffer and enter and here's you see your robot and simulation idea what will be needed to for communication between your application and run simulation so now you need on the next step open other application is a standard lab animals network application where you can send signal from your side to robot and wings if you don't mind but you don't need to and others you just need sign message is Yogi from in Natomas you need to you need select from multiple children for selected before title for here and put here aroma tasting and just push your casino but as you see negative sign message maybe you used before series or subsidize other projects where you use mathematical force and transaction but assignment messages and after you push party broadcast signal side message you will find in terminal information here for for example your simulation will receive information from you and send signal from the terror site and after some time you will see on other spam transaction and this means epidemics network providers catch information from your site from Hermosa site and send transaction to the theorem network for tool for watching reporters so if we go back to statistics we will find one executed one executive program so in this portion of what we advise you to try do that and try to do 20 times construction about ten times so I've suffered for and five times greater and this is I think simple simple tasks but you can try it and understand how you can use purposes under Imperial control where users don't meet the guests others to get forget where your signal will be collected from these urban honest and from providers and providers who will send transactions with your network to follow on your voices so yet so we will try to do it sometimes and try to Oh I'm trying to give the Bible is which other but if the victim lost because we don't have a binary for 100 minutes [Music] okay so it's after three for our parties to doing some problems which we store in because I hope it's only it's only solution for payments between machines it's not the solution for if you need to send program from user side versus I do not enough IO because in context never done as a proof of payments and second please we see is not a computer for us it's very important to try these experiments with to complete or something or headset solutions with the smart contracts or with smart contracts because we have a more opportunity to do something more complex than simple machine to machine players very soon [Music] people yeah because we don't use only theorem as you can see on this part it's a great lesson so when you store program in ipfs and from user site design message where you say I can play this 80 20 tokens for execute and ask you some business passion and from other side are what is engineer say my robot can can execute this and this type of job they killed here in IVFs publisher subscriber layer information about sign the month from users for executions of some programs and in this case you don't have any securities because first you can't change programs what you want to tell you to tell opposite side second is you don't have a single point of flair or Viking koala place the system it means your Y robot control it by a theorem and I be first it's place where he can be intrusive the whole program exactly what he came to [Music] sorry in case you want defensive the access to teachers in some cases for example car sharing example how car sharing is now important you have application you try to find some car you just push button porters this car in and what happened doctor said your signal go to God God identify you and send transaction car with a hero and romanovitch network comes a little more you will send Society message to network car will send offer for the smart contact will be created and after that card will be know your account and you can just go to car and scenting mesh network any messages from your key so it's means you can interact with different type of relatives not only in what you put in it be really smart contrary in Italy smart product you can put basic requirements contracts unlike when smart contracts created user can do existences functions but this functions will be work from in mesh networks from just sign so if you need cancer program you need to use a light what I say now if you just need to send a transaction where you don't want to have opportunity to cancel cyst and for example I don't think you do have opportunity to cancel your ancillary services in two or five minutes period from one because distance for example so in these cases you just can't push which appears coordinates in smartphone absolutely not but if you want to grant patron and use it in one day period you just can't create smart contracts the owner was this drug but drone movement doesn't know this account my owner only one day and he never some functions it is his day and how functions can be used from during communication without go change instead for example you can find smart factory as a service is approaching and you can find teacher where someone with a tablet try to sign some comments for manipulators for basel time and equipment but this equipment is he's not alone nurses it's for example smart factor the service like their over the service doctor comp factory can use properties from practices like cooker and sends air robots to factor it but factory can cannot advices this is road but only rent in this cases you need to give opportunity to communicate with this rubber part when agreement exists survival if effective sent acquaintance transaction to cooker you have options to use this we're part of occasionally going to right part of the competition when we want change we're here one problem now and it's a very popular problem if you want to use our banner mix network on robotics pills today your transaction cost around one dollar fifty cents and it's a big price in many many many many cases so before charging before we will see less price of gas we I said we don't have cases in car-sharing for example because if each transaction comes in to cost around one door not another good dress after the other price we will I see quite part of the computation alluding point computation side exactly we just restore in smart contra only address of user address of robots and hash of program in high office that's plagiarism but you talked about using a drone yeah so if you have a collection material you have 15 against they can't even solve the latency issue exactly for us it's not the problem I can see is not a problem because to you in our cases you as I said before you don't use a zero percent signal from one hand to other so it still you need understand transaction one time when you ordered transy liver cells into order drums in ourselves you can wait one minute for example but after that of course went wrong why he cannot use a theorem as a wasteful computation to find best road for his movement so it's miss you you can use a theorem computer for communication between humans and machines or between machines in order when you have economical communications between two sides when you can want to order some goods from vector or you want to have a subscription for sensor networks data for example application in your phone to have some information about weather in your season on sensors network you can just create one smart contracts in months and after that you will have information this is out of any computation our competition happened on their boats aside after after kuratas we all know old information from my deafness he doesn't like these you actually thought about that no it's only because from who we are guys from robotics button from space industry but and we never tried to think more about space problems how can we intercept but the same time I think you understand if we start thinking about lunar base Mars bases in this cases we came up to use real-time systems and to use it using some whiteboard chain with most of informations I think but I never find many articles scientific papers about albicans working space industry only one project like Tom and I are going to collect money for some place projects but any commercial interests or some one of the most interesting case what we found this hero computer and her buttocks now it's using sensor networks environment of an Isis sensor networks to use this information as a base base for very finest month for example carbon credit markets we have last three years with the project from Dublin grain markets I was two times in United Nations conference around quite a changed with project where we show how you can use IOT devices information to issue come on credit somebody we have a positive is named how I decided now is I I decided I own project so it means and what other kids is interested smart building today some innovations were leukemia you can change what type energy you want to use green energy standard energy but this technology is what we showed before even we have a green SS carbon credits inside of chain and we have iris assistance in smart bill because it's Cardinal tournament can use offset mechanism visible chain is a transparency without humans someone who say also next one etcetera but as a service there's a service as I said before it's the case when when we here with two parties first it's a vendor of permit six sentences of factory who use this robotics and houses parties don't have a trusted okay because factory should pay for our operational sources industry robots but it's the same thing they need to be shoes one city of the separation exactly what they expect so they need some way to distributed system where vendor and factory as the same system and they can use smart smart contracts to control the straw boaters much more eases and trying to be the same without in here you started by talking about like differentiation allowed to be like financial or like famous networking theory of artists like missus logical is it the initiator also in the case of business logic also the type of economic interaction but I'm ordering something there's like a fable to be played that's surprises like trigger yeah passes yeah by in financial transaction you need to put technical debt you don't enough on this for example you can event officials but right where I'm located you need just it's not enough to pay robber because from for me it's my basically to you before if you was life bitcoin is not only first global financial institution for me its first money forever because before people you cannot go to bank and say here's my urban operating but though you don't eat ask any one person your permit can empower money can sense this profession as an owner it's some sophisticated some philosophy see what it's in heaven we don't need the government's approval percent robots can have a boil it's not by Elizabeth Smart wonders it's a really good way to use robotics as a service because now we are the next Industrial Revolution where we don't want to use robotics as a tools you want to use our voices as a service in season so if we try to use services as a service we need to kylo communication helps me to trust this year and we you of course and with the trust you haven't many problems as I said interpreter services when we have a supply chain information transparency beautiful options is very important for for example digital vestments many productions now say we can issue digital passwords but well this cube into obeisances as they can change information system password in a pub if fetcher who put the about password in gorgeous a never changes information and this can create a digital way three years [Music] almost wish what is the model as a small note as well as extensions as I showed before you don't pay answers from destroys the vacation and from rapid society don't you don't need to have answers to our bottom is network providers center section and spend answers but these providers ask you to select some right you if your startup in Smart City concept or RIT concepts you want to use if your own computer you can create an autonomous solution where your customers will never play anything other than your top it's built payment by outsider but your promise your vending machines your cars or other assistant who pay her bundle instructions to pay for gas right [Music] first of all first two years we we use our own money because as you understand I many times object community I was spent my employment I say okay we and we was one of the first miners of ethereal means Thursday so we earned around 100 as our season search true identity as possible very good night and in 2015 we did the first stage of initially directly collect 5,000 others and spend all this money to do this question but also making money for public relations and doing so far trying to speed using our action this out who would might be some guys we need diversity so you're like so the metaphor talking that's where a yeah yeah yeah using this pencil like you're like everything your but I think so many people's can work [Music] because it's complicated you should prepare about six and keep it approached a man to say that we now have many strong developers in inferior strong today or Cindy theorem and eager boy six in the same I don't know many teams yes but in the next two or three years I think time to which I just say give it a couple years because back in the states like robotics clubs are all the rage with the young kids so I imagine there will be a fresh crop of folks be incredibly interested in that field that would probably dissuade we decide to for example we have made we spent a lot of time with academia we have articles scientific papers and we think for us most interesting to prepare educational courses for Kosair or relatives of other places where we can find Clara guys for example then why are other guys collect 1 billion dollars to spend for startups but what happens is saying I have 1 billion for startups you hope you will try to defend from cheaters and Posner guys can earn money but when you have a good technologists and you have a good education it's a bit background you can prepare educational courses and find Clara gasps there are engineers who just want to know something it's something like dream from outside my mind I hope it can because once they are in ginger cost 1000 [Music] so [Applause] you
