foreign [Music] so it is it is a a lot of hard work that goes into these projects they don't see success they stick to their guts and they keep continuing forward um we don't want this to be something serious it's just fun and it's just supposed to signal to the community the community that we appreciate their amazing work so there's a few of our categories uh that we would like to highlight the first one is the Trojan unicorn award so this is basically a project that kind of broke through to the mainstream and did not lose its core values within the ecosystem the next one is a ethereum Educators award so ethereum education or education onboarding for web 3 is one of the biggest challenges and projects that are working on this are quite imperative to the success of the ecosystem as a whole and we'd like to encourage more projects to be kind of involved in this ecosystem as well and then the most important is The Cypher Punk award so there's a lot of issues and concerns around the the core values of the webto ecosystem and we want to keep sure that there's projects that are working on privacy that are working on census super resistance and that they get highlighted in some Manner and that we keep encouraging people to kind of keep that core of web3 close to their heart and the last one is y'all really thought we wouldn't award this is the project that was delayed and delayed and delayed and this beat expectations of not ever shipping so we'll start with the Trojan unicorn award as I mentioned this is supposed to Signal the project that has the largest impact on bringing Mass adoption to the ecosystem and not really letting go of their core values that are close to the ecosystem and really breaking through so the nominees are pull up open c e and s and uniswap so all these projects have had quite a few moments as far as their break over success you might have seen everyone in every event that we went to using Pro apps even at Defcon everyone's just taking that opportunity to scan each other open C regardless of how other people in the ecosystem feel was one of the biggest breakouts over the past few years as far as getting normies or people no coiners to encourage and engage with our technology ens so coming from a very small team that was working on this core technology for x amount of years six years just sitting in a get a channel then a key base Etc to see that every celebrity in the whole world was now having a name attached to them was amazing even swap the amount of different ecosystems that kind of branched out from that organization and how many people were engaged with D5 and trading was amazing to see so please put your hand together for the winner ens I'd love to welcome Nick and the ens team to come up on stage and accept their award and tell us a little bit about ens congratulations thank you so much thank you this is amazing it's uh yeah yeah thank you anyone anyone from the team uh please come up and and show them show everyone um Alex what are you doing come up here um so it's it's been five six years since we started ens it started off as a part-time project in the ethereum foundation it rapidly expanded to consume all my time uh the EF made the very wise decision that we should graduate to our own project uh it gave us very generous funding to get started and even so it's been a long road to get here but if you saw my talk the other day we've had wild success in terms of the the popularity and the adoption and more importantly the the usability improvements that's allowed to the point where I think everyone just assumes ens is everywhere which has always been our goal um and so yeah I'm absolutely delighted to get this I couldn't be happier thank you so much thank you very much so the next category is education and developer onboarding so as we start to scale our ecosystem we need to make sure that people are that are coming into the ecosystem understand what the technology is meant to do what they should be aware of when what they should be focusing on and as we get into different ecosystems and come to Bogota come to different regions we understand that our understanding of ethereum and the webto ecosystem is drastically different for people who could actually benefit from the technology and there's a lot of work that needs to be done as far as language as far as people understanding the core technology people understanding what they should be doing what they shouldn't be doing and we really need to as a community come together and make sure these resources are put together in a way that is understandable is accessible and it's friendly and able for any individual to kind of get onboarded and attract the right type of individuals who aren't motivated by the wrong incentives so the nominees for the ethereum Educators awards are ethereum.org hard hat remix and speedrun ethereum so as mentioned a lot of this work has been done around creating developer resources making sure that onboarding and resources are available for people to get involved make sure they're testing things and then also make it playful and fun and the winner for this category is speed run ethereum so Austin can be here but the build Guild is here to accept the award as a core team and they've done an amazing job making sure that getting onboarded to the developer ecosystem is fun playful and easy to understand so thank you um yeah I wish Austin was here I know he would have done a better talk than what I'm going to be doing yeah yeah but it's been great to be part of the build Guild and work with developer onboarding um and yeah I'm gonna keep it short but basically our message is always to go to speedrun ethereum.com if you're a developer or if you know developers to tell them to go there and yeah yeah for sure so basically Austin created a starter kit called scaffold eat and this is basically a decentralized application starter kit where you have different components involved and after you kind of get the basis of okay like how do I create a starter kit application on ethereum then you can go to speedrun ethereum.com which walks you through a set of challenges which are a bit more advanced like you go from building your staking application multi-sig and kind of like get the sense of how you create applications and yeah and then come and join build Guild so we're the build Guild which is the group on top of speedrun theory all right the next category is The Cypher Punk award and I think as different individuals coming to the ecosystem the core values of people coming in and working on the technology changes time to time and it's important that individuals that are working on this core technology for privacy preserving censorship resistance and making sure that we have complete ownership of our data are highlighted unfortunately due to legal reasons and us not wanting to dock some of these projects or the individuals that would be coming on stage uh we just want to kind of highlight all the individuals and the communities and projects that have been working on this stuff and will hopefully be able to encourage you and encourage the people that are sitting in this room to continue some of this work but it's very because it was very important and we're very very aware that it's under attack by different forces whether it's government agencies whether it's different organizations Etc so I would encourage everyone to make sure if you do or if you are and aware of these projects to appreciate them and whether you send the messages or you utilize their products make sure that they feel appreciated and then that that were hoping and we're wishing for their success in some capacity so thanks to every project that's working on any type of zero knowledge proofs or anything that preserves our privacy our data security and anything to do with moving this ecosystem forward towards the ethos that we believe in so I would hope for you guys everyone to kind of join in and appreciate anyone that's been working on this technology as a whole and then the last category is basically y'all really thought we would an award so this is basically a project that the ecosystem has been waiting for for a long time and time and time again it gets delayed people don't expect it to come together uh people hope it doesn't come together from different ecosystems and the story goes on and on and on and on and the nominees are serenity ethereum proof of stay ethereum 2.0 the merge the docking and the winners are the merge [Applause] so I'd like to welcome Tim Trent and Danny on stage if they're all in the room I'd appreciate it no it's coming we're gonna hit it soon cool I just got here the people say stuff it's been a long time coming you know uh yeah so first of all this is T T and D um ctd has arrived but the uh the tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny subset of the effort that went in here so um there might be more in the audience and they're certainly having intense technical conversations all throughout this venue about the next stuff um and I always thought it would happen I I know there's some haters out there but I I had no doubt you know ethereum was going to transition to proof of stakes so it's just a matter of time and the time has come so thank you any other uh yeah no no thanks all the client teams researchers um I gave a whole talk about this on the opening day so everyone mentioned that talk another thank you um and thanks for the prize that's really neat yeah so as mentioned all the nominees
