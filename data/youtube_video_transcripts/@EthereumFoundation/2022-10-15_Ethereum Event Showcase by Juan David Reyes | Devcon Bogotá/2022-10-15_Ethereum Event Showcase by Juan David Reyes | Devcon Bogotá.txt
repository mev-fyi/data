foreign [Music] it just makes absolute sense for me to just keep the flame alive and burning in Amsterdam and to create a conference hackathon dedicated to privacy we have a situation right now in the Netherlands with Alex of tornado cash being in jail and I want to dedicate this event in the spirit of the cypherpunk movement and make this a very special event for the Amsterdam community as mentioned by Tim Baker on the first day we need to know integrate these developers that have a difficulty attending conferences so I would like to extend the invitation to all core devs who have worked on the merge to join me um in Amsterdam May 2023 for eat them thank you I am buenos dias good morning GM Brazil um foreign because I speak Spanish but we can understand a bit Portuguese so she

organizing Malaysia's first ethereum event it's called Eve Malaysia right so uh if Malaysia is inspired actually by Shannon and Joshua Peters who organized Eve Denver so if Malaysia is going to be a fork of Eve Denver it's going to consist of a hackathon which we are in talks right now with sozu house to run the hackathon and so that we can they have very interesting ideas to basically increase okay the quality of the submissions of the hackathon also it will have a conference and you have fun activities as well the location we is going to be held at the Petronas Twin Towers uh which we took six months to secure it's going to be surrounded with a lot of greenery and we want to really make a big statement okay uh to in in Asia for this event so um the goal is to basically onboard new people okay in in Southeast Asia and to show them and put a focus onto public goods that web tree is more than just about you know just price action and uh we only have one ask okay one asked just one ask which is that um my teammate one of my teammates is here this is uh her name is Bowie right and this is her first Defcon that she's ever attended after attending the opening ceremony she fell immediately in love with ayam miyaguchi right with her her speech okay about subtraction philosophy and I think okay that I know it's only eight months I know it's eight months away but I think it would really mean a lot okay if we could if the ethereum foundation is here and can show us how we can invite her and confirm her as a speaker on our main stage all right that would make Bowie really happy thank you very much everyone see you in Malaysia next year so yeah so spaghett teeth was born last year and we had the first event spaghetti what is spaghetti spaghetti is basically an umbrella for and uh like an accelerator for the Italian communities in general and we will we started last year in Milan but we are planning to do each event in a different uh city in Italy to include all of

free engineers and um we were surprised about how many Engineers we polish Engineers we met in Lisbon turns out that there is a huge community of web free builders in Poland but we didn't have a chance to read them so we decided to build a community for the web free builders in in Warsaw the community was really fragmented and uh I think Warsaw really deserves a place on the global map on the global web free map so that's why we're doing uh eforso and uh marching will tell you more yeah hey everyone my name is Marcin and yeah we are after the first edition of iforso which happened this September some of you have been over there I heard couple of good uh feedback even during Defcon which is extremely rewarding you can see like our team is super engaged in the web free community even

like their support was extremely valuable for us but okay we don't stop over here so what's going to happen next we are going to have like in real life monthly meetups every month a meet up mostly like with a dedicated topic let's call it ZK Singh ZK Roll-Ups dowels and so on workshops for students but not only like mainly technical ones you know like polish developers are Top Notch and yeah like next year 2023 we are also going to have our main event which is if Warsaw or maybe even Warsaw blockchain week this time we have a huge interest so might extend it even more it's going to be
