yeah okay first question how do developers ensure that users of the decentralized applications dubs have access to a siren and ipfs clients if you create an an awesome dad how can you be certain that everyone who uses it has a reliable connection to a theorem or ipfs this is one of the things that makes programming on a theorem tricky your app will not work without running a film client after all the hard work you make and all the effort you did can you afford to let a problem like that get in the way that's the users if you know have to be local many of us sort of assume that you need to run and steal your client in your laptop or in any other machine is that really the case does every dub you sir also needs to be a sysadmin should users need to read documentation to use a DAB today we understand the importance of user experience and forcing users especially non-technical users to read documents can be a death sentence to your project is it possible for devs to be installed with just one click it's 2016 everyone expect apps to be installed that way how can we make this possible for depth and finally how will the community develop depth over the next few years what are the needs of the ecosystems and what kind of solutions will be created to meet those needs to answer those questions we created in furor in philip revised the word with secure fault-tolerant and scalability denotes no more worrying that the users won't have an athenian client to work with your dad no more worrying that the chain needs to sink for a while because they closed their laptop for a few hours you close your laptop you want to do a quick transaction you open your laptop you need to wait 10 minutes 20 minutes synchronize no more worrying that there is hidden clang of the stock and it's a restart no more worrying that they are running an old version of the client all those issues let's go away if you like has been designed from the ground up with security in mind its robust and stable and it scales if it is here to make your dad succeed if Philip provides the same type of the pendulum constructive right TFS which is a project to build a distributed web as many developers have already discovered ipfs is a perfect complement to a film with creating dubs and just as it does with a few clients if Philip provides reliable ipfs notes on your dad so you have access to a centralized storage in fewer less reducers focus on the dad not on the things that that needs to run last if Philip provides a service called theremin this is the special sauce and the secret sauce of inferior this is where inferior really shines theremin does the stuff you couldn't do if you were just running your own node it provides advanced routing of request load balancing caching fail over and analytics this is the aphelion and ipfs and asteroids trainer from an architected perspective in fury consists of server lies of software as you can see at the top we have double users and their devices also servers next is in for a front-end which is the entry point for all the requests from those devices from their ferryman takes over to make the service ultra fast ultra flexible and ultra-intelligent finally we have the Finland and ipfs nodes which are the workhorses of this decentralized word they are the ones talking directly to the Athenian air PFS networks we are planning to add many features to make in fura even more valuable for developers and users among other things we plan to support various flavors of Athenian clients so that developers and users have the option to select the preferred client we are working also on a fork early warning system a fork early warning system which will sound the alarm with the film network experiencing problems with ipfs we're working on a content pinning service you will be able to accent fuel tube in certain files and you won't have to worry about them disappearing from the network we will also provide a hatch verification API so you can quickly check that a file ipfs hash is what you expect it to be in fira will also be supporting the IPTV network we have been designated as an IPTV caretaker finally but not less important we have some really cool plans related state channel networks and state channel networks monitoring to try out any furor and stay up to date with your progress go to our website if you later die oh and our twitter in fira underscore io many projects already pressing furor to provide them with a rock select a trillion an IDF s infrastructure every day in philly serving millions upon millions of requests I really want to repeat that every day in fury serving millions upon millions of requests it is my hope that in fira helped to make your data success so that the world the whole world can participate in a decentralization revolution I will leave you with some closing thoughts about in future on our mission thank you very much
