[Music] yeah thanks also for inviting me to speak we have some discussions around lunchtime for those who don't know me and I'm German I started the blockchain up here in Berlin and share the co-working space and so what we do basically is blockchain advocacy and sometime early bath summer I got caught up in the doubt and was one of the curators together with you and Fabian and a few other people and I guess that is the reason why I started thinking about all the problems around the unknown unknowns and block J's and this is why we're here today because well most of you are aware what happened and we will talk about to talk about it today we're also seeing what's happening in Bitcoin right now when the block size debate and so I'm hoping that we can have a joint discussion around those thoughts that I had and yeah so it's the first time I'm talking about this I hope it's not too incoherent so basically what are the thoughts we all grew up around the promise of the blockchain and words like trustless trust and disintermediation and so I guess why I was got interested into blockchain in the first place is because what I saw from the very beginning was this this really potential of that technology to disrupt governance and we saw the first use cases Bitcoin and it really is an impressive use case because it's the first decentralized autonomous organization or corporation it's a it's a bank without central banks and bank managers there is no central entity that controls it and that is impressive we've never had such a thing in this shape and form so why can't love changes like governance because of the the fact that machine consensus on the peer-to-peer network can radically reduce the transaction costs of of corporation and by that also it Medicaid's a huge dilemma that we've always had and who still have in this world is what we call the principal-agent dilemma that you have in companies as well as in government where for those who don't know the term then the agent for example the manager is representing the interests of the shareholder or the or other stakeholders the principle and if there are informational symmetries there is a potential of moral hazard on purpose or not on purpose so there's time lag information lag in decision making in traditionally top-down organized companies and will be very often have these principal agent problems and we have the same problems in in in politics and in representative democracy and with bureaucracy so when blockchain came around that that really gave the potential because everything you have the rules in the code but only until something goes wrong or only until we need a system of great so I guess blockchain is really really good to reduce bureaucracy radically but only in the cases of no notice and known unknowns but never in the case of unknown tunnels so one of the use cases of course was a very good example last year with what happened with the Dow however we would like to call it whether it was a hacker an attack an infiltration or fault or something happened and there was no procedure of how to react to it and so machine consensus is great but it has limitations and three instances and I welcome you to to criticize this or to enhance this list so conditions that change over time we're seeing that for example a very good example is what is happening in the Bitcoin community when it comes to the block size debate for example or what happened also with a advent of mining pools we were talk about this later human error that was something that happened with the Dow it was human error obviously there are tools around that formal verification is a very powerful tool to to make sure that this doesn't happen anymore but formal verification has also its limits within what the system can find so we have yeah we discussed about this quite a bit and AI one day might be a solution around this but I might also be the source of the problem because there's always better AI to exploit potential attack vectors and then information of symmetries and I think this is very very important because the assumption in there in the very beginning was that everyone's interests is well aligned but in in the Bitcoin network is a huge network with many different stakeholders and certain interests are well aligned but other interests are not so well aligned and as we can see for example in the block size debate so in complex multi-stakeholder environments like the etherium network or the Bitcoin network where mining miners or mining pools have very very different interests than for example a company like consensus building on top of it they have different economic interests one one's transaction cost costs to go up and another one one's transaction costs to go down so oh I'm sorry I'm going back okay so the question I guess the question is always hard fork soft pork or no pork so many people say you know pork in many ways but in many cases so in the case of the Dow and post daletech aetherium hard work my question to you how many people did really understand the ins and outs of what was discussed whether - not for well that was quite easy but - soft work or too hard work and how to hard fork it was that five people really understood all the details was it maybe 30 people I don't know how many people would you say I mean two levels understanding right and the first level transactions and the the first main transaction or not a transaction either and it's shift yeah that's not that yes but the question is like there was this huge discussion around to fork or not to fork and if you were counted for so how many people would you be comfortable to say really understood the ins and outs of the whole debate over this 35 days that we have until the community had to come to a conclusion we had to decide whether to be on the side of the chain or the other side of the chip so that really is a question so probably we cannot actually conclusively my guess was talking to the few people maybe 3 to 5 people fully understood it a group of 30 people understood it very well and certain aspects of it and the rest was trusting the school the student is that character is there any opinion on that in the room Kavya any opinion how many people really understood the whole post Bala attack if the Army impart Forks off 40 no no pork discussion 30 percent of the people understood or maybe so my assumption was 5 to 30 people 5 people really fully fully understanding everything and 30 people are you standing ok that's a very long story I'd like to explain it to you maybe later yeah that's that's not okay so why am I asking the question okay maybe let's go to the next one the current incident the implications of soft forum there we can definitely say that too few people understood it because yeah was yes yet it was a very important part of the decision-making process to decide that the soft fort why a soft word wouldn't be viable and so too few people you mean how many people would that be who really understand mmm Tiger there yeah beginning perhaps two people and after that okay so the question here of course is having the promise of the blockchain being a trustless trust and a decentralized of course is how how decentralized is assist if currently and that might change in the future only five to 30 people in this whole network really understand the ins and outs of such a brief discussion and which is fine and which is fair enough and which is part of the process probably because blockchain is dealing is very early stages but the term trustless trust we have to be very careful when we use it because it's true until as long as everything is okay it's not true anymore as as soon as we need the system upgrade or there is an edge case where we need to take action because in this moment we need to trust the experts same as for the Bitcoin block size debates yes you are here what do you think how many people really can follow this whole debate I don't know I mean you're a developer really so you would say only 10 or 20 people in the whole Bitcoin ecosystem okay now I thought that it would be a bit more than in etherium because it's an older network I'm a bit surprised that you're saying but in any case I mean this is an estimation right but it's it's really just a handful of people [Music] so in the end what I'm trying to say is in the beginning we didn't need consensus in the beginning when Satoshi defined the white paper and then it was implemented there was very little need for consensus as the system is growing and the stakeholders are becoming more and when you over time see that you need to change the protocol you need consensus but this consensus finding process not everyone is an expert so we still need to trust real people theirs will be centralization around the experts so why is it important in the case of unknown unknowns when unknown unknowns occur when conditions change over time when unexpected things appear we still need to trust the design architects of the blockchain networks and the few developers who understand everything and we can try to make an educated decision but we still need to trust them the next question is I'm sorry so the myth of trust less trust we will still need to trust experts then there is always the debate whether blockchains or public blockchains they're open-source so based on meritocracy if you put enough time and effort to understand the code you can understand or learn coding or learn the blockchain protocol and the languages building on top of it you can understand it but there is a limitations to meritocracy because as long as we don't start teaching in coding and in kindergarten there is only a limited amount of people who really have the skills or the talent to understand what is happening in this field and so yes in theory the code is open source yes in theory there is such a as meritocracy buzz about in reality you need to spend most people would need to spend an enormous amount of time and effort and maybe lack the talent to really be able to do that especially based on our current education system so all I know is logic I think that's why we're building block chains because they're very very powerful why you define a bull set and because it is Auto enforceable it is very powerful it reduces a lot of transaction costs but it reduces those transactional costs because we have the transaction layer we have the peer-to-peer network and on top of this the transaction layer this is where we define the rules to the game in the economic models based on game theory we define which actor gets which incentive to do what in the network in order to model this consensus layer we need to make certain assumptions about the behavior of the network participants and these assumptions can be true or not and mostly they're probably some standardized assumptions and you need some fault tolerance tie to it what if these assumptions are not true what if what happens in the case of unknown unanticipated or irrational network behavior of the network participants and basically and I have a lot of discussions also with black about like the homo economicus like him you need to make some standardized assumptions and the assumptions are made mainly based on the idea that network participants will make a rational decisions based on profit maximizing their own interests as a network participant for example the miners and but if we for example look what happened with Bitcoin bitcoins consensus layer was originally designed by satoshi based on the notion of simple game theory the idea was that every miner running a computer would brought maximum profit maximize his own interest based on running one or two computers the consensus layer bitcoins consensus layer does not account for cooperative game theory what happened after a few years of the existence of the network that we now have my ankles so the reality or what bitcoin was designed to be much more decentralized than it is now because the assumptions that were made on the consensus layer turned out not to be true because now we have mining pools and a handful of them are concentrating almost half of the network so this is one of the unknown unknowns that evolve over time so the term should pop up the policy and consensus I see like one of the biggest dangers in my opinion around a blockchain state-of-the-art the mob chains as they are designed today is everything is okay as long as the protocol runs but the moment we need to modify the consensus layer the moment we need to upgrade the system the question is who gets to vote and who has a stake who has the power to to vote for an upgrade now that's very different in Bitcoin and in theory is very different it depends on whether we're talking about the software or a hard work and it's also very different in the etherium ecosystem when we look at decentralized autonomous vote for organizations and the token governance rules they are very independent from each other and particularly for the most cases more money in the fiat world buys more voting power in the Bitcoin world and it might be indirectly well through through through hashing power the more money you have the more national power you can buy and the more boaty have enough work discussion so in the case of unknown unknowns and given the fact that we come from a world from extreme wealth inequality what does it mean from the decision-making process in such pieces and it means that certain people have more impact than other people is this the kind of how do we do want to deal with those situations and the last thing that probably we saw that decentralization or trustless trust in is a myth to a certain extent if we don't have necessarily centralized information communication and transparency tools and we saw for example during the Dow hack in a very short period of time decisions have to be made we were communicating on social media networks like Twitter like reddit etc etc and a lot of discussions were happening in parallel some different networks very often it was hard to distinguish the troll from the expert and we were using social media tools from the web to to make decisions in the web 3 so it would so one of the biggest problems was to decide who was an expert who's a troll and the next friend so for for many of us for insiders it was a bit easier if you know certain people who you might call Bitcoin maximalist or who have certain stakes in other systems you might understand that but an average token holder may might not know that so it's really hard to distinguish and in the decision-maker making process in the discussions happening on the difference of human channels who's an expert who's at all information aggregation is a huge problem very often I remember we are now curate your side Channel and we're do 12 people there even among those 12 people a lot of the curators didn't know what another curator had posted before because it was like the information and the opinions were all over the different networks and it was really hard to keep up to date with the discussions even among the curators and so if we want to make blockchains happen and and work well for for situations of unknown unknowns we need to put the centralized information aggregation and visualization tools where you might get like pie charts where you get information of okay expert opinion is highly distributed but you know like with one click you would know that 50% of the experts said no horik 30% said softcore than 20% of hard work and then you could keep diet maybe into their blog posts and read up on why they said what they said we don't have those tools yet and it's the Wild West of information and it's hard to make an educated decision especially when you're not an expert so why am i doing all saying all these things I think botanic wrote this excellent blog post on the meaning of decentralization and what he wrote was he tried to break down the different levels of decentralization so the question is how politically decentralize is a network meaning that no single entity controls it how is it architectural a decentralized meaning that no if there is no infrastructure or central point of failure and basically block chains are politically decentralized more or less and depending and and I didn't actually be centralized but block chains and this is why they are so powerful in reality a logically very centralized because code is centralized and it's deterministic and and has really no it is really hard to to write code for unknown unknowns so currently we're in the situation where we deal with these unknown unknowns with on-the-fly human intervention as we saw with Tao and the post Dowell hardcourt as we're seeing also now with the block size debate in Bitcoin and hopefully in the future I think in order to really be able to say that we live in a decentralized world where we don't have centralization on around expert opinion we need to make sure that we visualize power structures in these distributed networks that we have mechanisms for governance beyond code and possibly also governance mechanisms on the blockchain level and we need better information and communication tools and we need the centralized arbitration systems and I think this is very important because if we don't have these things the coders of today will be kind of the trust of third parties in the decentralized network that we have to trust so we need to make sure that we make these decision making process is much more visible and code better understandable and yeah I would like to conclude that if we assume and this is a bit what I'm saying that seeing that blockchains are might be the future constitutions of our future societies as citizens and as consumers alike the more services will start building on block chains the more the block chain protocols will become our constitutional foundation so we have to make sure that they're flexible enough and and stable enough but also inclusive enough so we can really talk about it he centralized and trustless yeah decentralized the world I wouldn't talk about hustlers trust because I would assume that doesn't exist really okay thanks [Applause] any comments or questions what do you mean we're making code instead of Oyster River for any people they could tell or relation I guess both so having better human readable code would be great or discussing this at lunch time I don't know how possible it would be great to have human readable code but the problem also with these huge networks is that the code is very complex even if you can't read it there is a limitation to fully understanding all the implications of all the different modules and aspects of the code how hard is it you from your point of view to to fully understand the interaction of a smart contract with the etherion virtual machine or how many people could really understand it the more I think more complex of smart contract yes it depends on them on the complexity of the smart contract and I think it's not enough just about being able to understand but I mean even if you're able to understand extent I think that's the time and read it and so this so the problem is also a so when you're talking about this navigation so delegation of time so even if I would be interested or if even if I could understand the code even if if I were interested to learn it what do I want to invest the time to a learn it and then study every protocol change that is being discussed I mean it's not that because you always trust people because you can't read every single small contract and sing a program based on that metaphor but the difference now is that you can choose things because now but nowadays you can be your name and probably even in 50 years but everyone is using what chance that everyone will you would be its own bank because people would choose to trust centralized services but if you really want to you can be your SmartWatch it is the same if you really want to you can read the whole contract it you can understand it and you can and maybe program you like you always have trust some under the difference is that nowadays you can choose what he said before like in many cases for example in a new contract you're talking about the bank now but the legal contract I read it I think I understand it but it's it's code it's just fuzzy semantics where other people study seven years and became lawyers and then they had to practice another a lot of years so right now in theory I also have the possibility in theory I should understand what a contract says but in practice or I could write my own let's say contract if I want to buy or sell a house yes I don't do that so how is this system that we're creating now so much more different apart from where it really doesn't immediates and makes clearing if there are certain instances where blockchain really intermediates it gets rid of certain I would say agency problems principal agent problems but it creates new principal agent problems and I guess this is what I was trying to say we shouldn't be so naive as to think that we are this is the the tool to solve all problems that we have around human conflict we will be able to radically reduce many many many transaction costs but we're creating other principal agent problems that were very often probably not even aware of yep thank you let's start with you is that a piece of testing approach to verify the system which on which level you mean the smart contract adjusting on the bottom level yes Educational Foundation it's really hard to test attacks before your contract is attacked because you don't know how it will be attacked so you can any obvious solution that would be complete but this better but it's obviously better than what we have now and he flew a democracy but I guess where I mean blockchain really isn't it's very very very baby step so what you're referring to we need more sophisticated governments rules on chain and off chain as well I think everything that you do on chain especially if you do with on the consensus layer is too rigid so I think we need to learn from the current political world or a system that we have where we have a constitution and the Constitution just in most countries is very like has is a very limited rule set defines a very limited rule set the basic rule sets of how to interact each other and everything else built on top of it so I guess this is what partially the the blockchain ecosystem a consistent resolved trying to make the simple laws on this more concrete layer and the the code the I am the consensus layer of the globe the ethereal protocol is kind of the Constitution the question is maglev expert enough whether the protocol could be even regulating even less because every time we need to make a system upgrade we need super majority consensus which is really hard and some people say that we should yeah Forks are good so the minority protection happens by by for the people who don't want you to to upgrade they stay on the old chain but in reality that is not an option when you have vested economic interests on one side of the chain so a lot of people will go on the other side of the chain in spite of the fact that they're against maybe the decision because they have vested economic interest they would not stay on the other side of the chain and I wonder how like in mind where do we protect minorities on the blockchain I don't see that yet liquid democracy is the thing that you were referring to I think we need to have more liquid democracy tools even on top on top of not changes I yeah we will see that happening I mean for the now there was a liquid democracy proposal never happened but we're already seeing the first proposals to have such installations there was another question around here somewhere no I have a rhetorical question to the audience who who remembers [Music] so what does that well yes that's true yes physician and whatever the thing is it's not only a different system thing is if you really don't trust the airplane you don't have to take an airplane but a constitution of a network so I think here's where we need to start to get a bit more realistic of what's happening so in the very early stages of blockchain it was an opt-in system and it still is so first I was Satoshi he wrote the white paper and for many really for many reasons many people thought that was a cool thing and they opted into the system and it was better because it was money without banks without bank managers without central banks etc etc etc but as the community is growing in the Bitcoin network in the hiriam network and many other block chains you have more and more people who are not part of the system they're stakeholders and they opted into a net into a certain code but when we're talking about protocol upgrade because time changes and there are conditions changes or all of a sudden there is a buck now you have to come to a consensus it's not an opt-in process anymore you're already there and how do you reach consensus and how do you make a decision in a system where you're already you're already in the system on the airplane you just if you don't trust the airplane or the technology behind it you don't take the airplane but when you are already in the system when you're already on top like block chains are the virtual nations of our future I would say and we're probably going to be like citizens / consumers of various block chains and I don't think that the decision is quite fair then I put a question because you said we clearly need them then assistance and so my question would be and looking back at the tower and the postal box do you really think that that how the events unfold was such such a bad system because and in mind you we get quite a bit constructive discussion whatever and then after that we had convergence there were some people who were not and I knew that if they saved on the old book chain and now they have why I would never use that so so we even had you know everyone was was happy so is it such a bad system right now no I'm not saying that's a bad system I'm not saying it's a bad system at all I mean I think it's it's we're experimenting with a great tool that has a lot of merits but it also has limitations so what I would like to discuss more as an actual limitation system has in order to be yes in order to also build good workarounds or improve the system and recognizing the limitations that it has and having better governance tools and information aggregation tools around it so when we need to make decisions about protocol change we can actually make a decentralized system because the promise of the blockchain was to create a decentralized world yes we're seeing that it is much less centralized that then we initially would have liked it to be it's true for Bitcoin and for other reasons then it's true or aetherium aetherium many people would criticize or have criticized the etherium foundation to make unilateral decision and that decision making was entrance and it was done behind closed doors and I think no I don't think that it's true but I think because of in transparency an average token holder or an average user or an outsider could have this impression so we need to make a better job on making these decision-making processes more transparent more inclusive and then it's really also more decentralized and we really need to rethink the token governance rule says if we want to create them identity based or token based because if we create them token based we're creating a world where more money buys more influence so this is definitely a discussion I would like to have because this is not the centralized in my opinion is good just by gun industry well isn't that the claim of blockchain it's useful well I'm not saying it's good or bad but it's the claim of blockchain trap and unstoppable machine that no single entity or no small group of people can take down or manipulate I mean this is what I understood was the claim I'm not saying it's good or it's bad I'm just questioning whether the reality of data of the artwork chains is true to its promise which was actually to be very decentralized that's it the realities are saying these people using those remains of control yes I fully agree but I'm not sure how that that's a different I mean I agree with you is not too many yes there's concepts but I guess you want to have a ratio of how many users or how many stakeholders do you have versus how many people that make decisions and probably the data is there they must exploit that the small contracts in a way that it was installed right yes so surely any debate about any constitutional structure there in the area network should be one of the most debated things in history well it was very debated during [Music] this is what I'm trying I need this is one of the reasons why I'm writing this because I feel that we are creating this very powerful tool which can be used for good as Sinha has been just stating it could also be the ultimate controller and I feel that we are not and there's already so much economic interest building on top of it right currently we're everywhere in Google concert stage there is no really running applications that are so what is happening right now and is that a lot of money is pushing into the let's say ethereal network in that case for the sake of this argument I feel that a lot of companies are pushing a lot of money and they're building more and more currently they're just testing it but as they are building critical applications and on top of that and it's yes and we're not even done building the constitutional layer or the foundations yes but lastly is is is the one potential answer to move towards a multitude of base watchings and more log base watching there are the this is a possibility so I guess nobody knows what will happen but the way I'm seeing it unfold is that we will probably live in an Internet of different blockchains and there are already some startups building some blockchain interoperability cosmos polka dots so we'll see that probably it's going to go into that direction but there are consensus it's even more critical yeah and I don't know who was at the polka dot where they watching meet up a few weeks ago when cosmos and and polka thought was pretty we're presenting I felt that basically only Gavin understood what Gavin was presenting and two people understood fifty percent and the rest maybe ten percent so I don't know it doesn't need to be instructions is I can't believe you mentioned anything about when I buy to organize science or watching over us in currency I am agreeing to a consensus but this raising about options is very easy to convert to know more about currencies know so the whole pervades approaches that I can easily find it like well the consensus is really changing I can easily go change if you if you only have crypto currencies yes you can easily change if your company issue but if you're I don't know if you're a company I'm thinking of consensus one of the biggest players in the area micro system they have a lot of startups building on top of etherium so I would I would think that when a card for it happens and the more critical those startups or the more advanced those startups become and the more critical the services are that they're building on top of it I think they won't be as flexible as a simple token holder who can opt-in and opt-out by simply selling the currencies so there are different Network participants with different vested interests they can build applications unfortunately must away I mean they did consist of chosen to focus on the blockchain but I'm not quite sure how easy that is yep we have very easy obviously rootstock allows you to possibly but in general I think what you're saying is you have to be question one our decisions made in groups of people this is an age little 2000 euro question right I think we're still figuring that out the other thing is what you can do about that decision if you said that right so is gentleman up here brought here brought up not choice this system so for example if you know the devil feasts or love which can be looking as it hats on your transaction right when that task goes up to another network now if your task was up on your property and you live there you can ride up to another country much harder to do yeah so if we had dropped these systems in your local choice and competition against the world coming from your vast experience that's why we see continual growth and of course the decision-making aspects still need to be some level of improvement but with natural ease you can do what he said now no I fully see also I mean blockchain definitely is an improvement over the current systems we have here isn't also clear point about the reputation yes since there is to basically two layers to smart contract layer and a nonsense later maybe a lot of people can read us my contract and it's easier to understand but far less people could understand what's happening the consensus later so to your point it's probably gonna keep centralizing in that fashion so but what are your thoughts on the reputation should work in a sense in the sense of in essence how can we is it a subjective thing that we that we trust someone because maybe we read their blog post or something or is there any thoughts on making that reputation like well I mean I mean the cool thing about blockchain is that we can now start building identity based reputation systems but this is all in also in the making so I'm hoping that as we have better reputation systems we will have better solutions for like three decision making but I don't distinguish between the consensus layer or the application layer who will need I mean a lot of the problems that we have in the web to nowadays all this debate around fake news is because we don't have a reliable reputation system so we need to really start building them I mean the internet already promised decentralization and it did to a certain extent the centralized information but now we need to start building this other layer and a reputation is key to that are there any ideas of how Oh consensus like lighter a lot of identity providers that are already also building on reputation systems and you often write in here you look home I see like yeah okay you should talk maybe to create open later they're also building it's it's not pure blockchain based it's linked data and blockchain but reputation is probably also something yeah you should you guys should talk okay last question is there any other question and one more common question and then maybe we should some in terms of reputation and Bowie obviously just people look at sort of hedge fund fall Bridgewater associates is a long attention on the world they have a great system where they have a matrix of believability based on track record obviously that requires you have identity so over time as people make decisions or make statements their believability is increased or decreased and that comes with weighting factor on it so it's essentially so if you figure it out we have to have both centers on one side to make decisions about governments and we have tools on the other which are essentially people don't know nothing on internet don't know anything about what's going on they have a very good system with yourself and become the largest hedge funds in the world what the default again Bridgewater associates Bridgewater associates and Ray Dalio has a paper for mobility matrices I guess we can actually can be directly assess the impact of a decision on so cool that's my first comment at the second comment is one look you go be in a blockchain and I mean what do you want to optimize learning you want to go that's not Peter right well it's simply making a decision right so if you're a hedge fund you say you know do I definitely euros gonna go up and unless they come together before this decision is made and they say I believe that the hero's gonna go up that's my boat they record that boat and then as time pass the euro goes up and those analysts over time develop our track record of being accurate and that's terrible the ability that increases in their boat waiting increases it's a system where you can determine what that person makes completions in that case with financial markets yes prediction but he didn't hear an inventor or a software engineer have a design decision right you have a conversation that goes on with other engineers being able to get this feature did we do this I believe we should do this because of this I believe we should do this because of this and over time people Google's decision-making process whether their talent or skills may be either proved to be prescient and their believability they move up and believe it a little dangerous really but what you're getting a sentence but this is like this according to his processes might have produced suitors all over say 40 years I think he's talking about [Music] [Music] [Music] the caves are made everybody so that's a consensus but obviously is within that reigning this specific Hedgehog that was you know if you have higher okay thank you very much [Applause]
