[Music] [Music] thank you [Music] oh no [Music] I don't know yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] problems [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] cameras [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign foreign [Music] thank you foreign foreign [Music] I think I'm gonna stand over here I don't need to ever be there but you're not gonna you're where are you gonna go yes [Music] [Music] cell phones yeah don't worry [Music] thank you thank you foreign foreign thank you hola we almost start yesterday foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign I hope you are all having a fantastic day like my name is Anna Anna Belen and I'm very excited because this is the first day of talks in the tropical Sunset and today we have the talk of ethereum business Readiness in 2022 with Dan Shah and Dan Burnett thank you so much thank you all the dance uh ethereum Enterprise how you have to be called Dan uh so hi I'm Dan Shaw from the ethereum foundation um you know I I work with the uh Enterprise uh big businesses back in 2017 uh at the launch of uh the ethereum the Enterprise ethereum Alliance the eea uh you know vitalik called for collaboration amongst private and uh you know public um uh you know to to be able to support Enterprise needs and um you know I I joined back in um in 2020 to come in and support those Enterprise users uh you know when I came in uh there were some you know sort of big blockers for uh you know going on on mainnet um you know concerns around privacy gas prices and you know regular regulatory risks of holding assets um over the past year and a half I've been really happy to see a massive sea change away from uh only uh a private chain and you know gradual introduction of uh real real mainnet adoption but I really didn't know you know what was going on uh and I'm really happy to share what uh Dan Burnett and the EA have been working on uh you know to really you know give us some proof give us some data uh and uh I've been really surprised at uh at the maturity of what's going on things are farther ahead and farther on mainnet than you might think so Denver net thanks so much [Applause] hello oh there we go all right okay thanks um and I may ask you to put the notes font size back to what we had agreed to um all right thanks uh yeah all right so anyway what I'm here to talk to you about today is a report that the eea issued earlier this year our ethereum business Readiness report so you know in the media all the stories are focused on uh you know popular media right all focused on crypto speculation nft speculation uh big collapses and things like that but as the ethereum ecosystem matures more and more businesses are actually adopting the technology unfortunately that story is not as visible to the general public okay and um it's as as an organization that is committed to enabling uh other organizations to adopt and use business uh ethereum uh in their day-to-day business operations uh we thought it was important to shed light on what's actually happening in business use of ethereum today so behind the defy nft and so on headlines now there are some challenges to this in particular day-to-day projects are all happening behind the scenes okay many of us know about them or those who are sort of crypto Savvy but those outside of this room outside of the the crypto bubble are definitely not aware of them so our our goal was to find them and quantify them and that's that's what we set out to do so we did a a mix of direct interviews case study development surveys and also the other uh important part with this particular report was to be able to educate business decision makers about how to think about ethereum-based deployments so the work that we did is based on both quantitative and qualitative research we did the quantitative research where I'll talk about that a little bit more later but the point is that we focus primarily on the qualitative our goal was to was to do storytelling based on case studies and interviews and when I say storytelling I mean stories that make sense to businesses one of the reasons we focus so much on case studies is you know everyone in this ecosystem likes to ask well what are the use cases what are the use cases what are the use cases use cases are for sellers case studies are for buyers buyers don't want to hear what you could do buyers want to hear what works today so that was one of the the important goals that drove what we did um so just very quickly I'm gonna I'm gonna walk through this part this is something that's in the report we from a business perspective we describe kind of the the history of the ethereum platform as having three main phases in the early days of of course there's a lot of excitement experimentation with you know decentralize all the things and there's a lot of great experimentation that's still happening of course um but there was a realization pretty early on that there were some limitations from a business perspective in using the public mainnet and in particular the three that we always talked about the three p's were privacy permissioning and performance those were things that the the broader public Community was not interested in focusing on at the time but but for businesses are just absolutely essential okay and that actually led to a focus on private blockchains private Consortium networks um using ethereum or or other other Technologies now as we all know there has been a great Revival of interest in public blockchain and this is actually from a business perspective also that's driven by of course what we've seen with consumer defy which is uh demonstrated that decentralized business models can work um also nfts but also some technological improvements and I'll I'll talk about that a little bit more later on so um before I um before I talk about what's on this slide I want to mention that from this point on everything that I describe is being viewed through a business lens okay so when I when I show Circles of certain sizes and so on this is based on our particular data set what we did is we we collected a data set that was restricted to down to about 118 business oriented ethereum projects these are projects these are companies or projects that are active now have live teams and are developing solutions for traditional business problems so the data set is somewhat small and eclectic and keep that in mind when I when I draw some conclusions like I do on this particular slide um yes please reduce the font size back down one or two thank you on the notes um okay stop there thanks um so uh okay so on the left side here what we have is the business projects organized by industry and the Lion's Share of course has been an infrastructure and fintech unsurprisingly we're basically still in in the stage of building the platform and selling picks and shovels okay I mean that is really where the industry is particularly from a business perspective now if you look at use cases on the right side most of the activity is in software development and fintech which of course aligns with what I just said and so again it's still early stages there's a lot of Need for building core materials yet foreign so I just wanted to throw this up some people like looking at logos this is a subset of the companies and projects that are in our database I'm not going to talk about it this isn't exhaustive but just to give you an idea of of uh some of the the companies and projects that showed up in that list of 118 now one of the things we wanted to do was uh well look if we're gonna if we're going to put out a report on business Readiness of ethereum we have to Define what business Readiness means okay so that was our first goal was to figure that out and through the interviews that we did we came up with a way to define it that we believe is is useful for business so our goal keep in mind with this report is to always to do two things and education is one of those parts so we wanted to make sure to educate people and we also wanted to give businesses a tool as they evaluate uh ethereum technology and deployment possibilities so we developed what we call our ethereum business Readiness framework um and we think this is the first attempt that we're aware of to do this in an in a neutral way okay so we're not selling anything in particular other than ethereum of course right um so what we ended up with is seven technical criteria which you'll see in the the coming slides and three non-technical criteria with some detailed definitions again who's whose goal is to educate a business audience and through this we believe that businesses can learn a lot about what is important and what to think about as they um as they're considering deployments okay so down the left side here and I know this is an eye chart I don't expect you to read it I'm just going to describe some of what's on here so down the left side are our seven plus three criteria they are quickly Network cost network decentralization security scaling privacy sustainability usability interoperability and then regulation and compliance ecosystem resources and ecosystem robustness and from our perspective and all the interviews we did those captured the factors that businesses cared about it was particularly important to us to make sure that we included decentralization because a lot of businesses today just still don't even understand why that is something they should care about okay so anyway if you look at all these criteria on the left not all businesses are going to Care equally about those criteria so the goal of this particular chart this particular uh item this section of the report was to answer the question which of these criteria are actually important to me so what we looked at was four different types of businesses as we call them large corporates small and medium Enterprises startups and then there's government which is not a business but they're they're a category worth considering in uh in this discussion so um there are two things I want to highlight so on the sustainability side and again I know you can't see all of these but I just want to talk about a couple of them so almost all businesses care about the environment but governments and highly visible corporates care a lot because they can face very high and costly reputational risk okay if they screw up sustainability nowadays on the security side all companies of course want the best security but corporates and governments uh interestingly they have a lot of resources to ensure security whether it's Financial Resources legal technical whatever and so in some cases and I know this is sacrilege to say it okay but in some cases they're willing to centralize to sacrifice some decentralization in return for scaling but that's not true for smaller businesses in particular one of the main appeals of blockchain technology is precisely the security against technical failure attack manipulation and so on that Network decentralization offers so they may be less willing to compromise in that particular respect now we did this because we wanted to show this before we got to describing different architectures and where we think they fall okay um so what we did then was we we basically evaluated those criteria against four different deployment architectures you'll see we called it Network archetype in the report what we're talking about is basic deployment architectures the four categories are five columns but there are four primary ones is the public mainnet mainnet plus and L2 mainnet plus a side chain and private Network the second column is mainnet post upgrades because we put this report out of course before the merge and there's a lot of other great stuff coming and we wanted to make sure that people didn't look at the lighter uh the lighter boxes here which don't look so good for the public mainnet and say oh yeah that's always going to be the case no it's definitely not and as we do this report each year we're going to continue updating it in terms of where where we're actually at so a few examples here from a network cost perspective the cost to to actually operate a private Network can be very low even when you're running your own infrastructure the the actual operations cost can be quite low um and we know the main net is expensive today okay um and that's being worked on we know um in terms of ease of use by businesses uh layer twos or side chains uh actually have the most support interestingly because the ones who are building those layer twos or side chains provide a lot of information and a lot of help on how to make use of them uh if you do a private chain on the other hand it's all on you right so it's not easy at all if you want to do a private chain you have to do a lot of the work yourself from a compliance perspective a private Network it's the easiest to implement you know controls such as kyc um and on you know the mainnet is of course fully decentralized on the other on the other end so most of this shouldn't surprise you too much but again this is written for chances are it's written for your customers the people you're trying to sell to and who needs someone to explain this to them in a way that they can understand um that did not do okay all right so one of the things we did was we wanted to give examples of how you might use this framework for a specific use case and again I know it's an eye chart you can't see all these it's all in the report but um we basically analyze these criteria against um the deployment architectures that that I talked about so for each of these architectures we scored the criteria as very poor poor neutral good and very good where good is out here and poor is in the center on these radar graphs um so I'm just going to hit a couple of headlights so the upper left one is asset tokenization and then payments Payment Solutions is just to the right of that so for asset tokenization mainnet score is very high on usability and interoperability for tokenization um but you know if you have a project for which high performance and Regulatory Compliance are priorities you'll want to be working with an L2 or Si chain or or you could consider building a private Network on the payment side for payments use case ethereum is a payments Network essentially out of the box I mean you know Finding information about how to do uh how to do payments with ethereum or something built on top of ethereum is not at all hard but again if you have high volume you're going to want to work with a layer 2 or side chain particularly if you have uh if you're if you're addressing retail customers now interestingly if you actually have a wholesale business you might not need to go to that and you could actually do a private Network more simply today more simply more cheaply if you have a a wholesale business okay um I said that we did interviews um we actually have way more than six interviews but I just wanted to give a few examples of some of the people that we spoke with uh we spoke with people who actually were building these projects we also spoke with some well-known people in the space and probably some of the people here in the room and I just haven't seen them yet um but I just want to give you an idea of this within the report we actually include quotes throughout because we found that the quotes from these people are the thing that are are the they express this better than any of us could because they're dealing with it uh every every single day so I've got um I've got three examples here um and the one that I'm gonna uh I'm gonna actually call out is is in the middle uh from Benson of acre Africa acre Africa provides parametric insurance for small holding farmers in Africa so what they said is we could have done this on our own with a database but we wanted public proof that those triggers that the customers signed up for when buying are still the same ones used when it comes time to pay out that is a great example of the transparency that you get from a good blockchain solution so anyway this is there's just a few we have a lot more um but these interviews really helped us with the insights which is what I'm going to get to shortly um so we took that 118 projects and whittled it down to 12 for a super deep dive okay so we were looking at doing case studies on on 12 of them um nine of the projects were ready for us to include them in the report and three said we want to be there but not yet talk to us next year okay so we ended up with nine that are in the report I don't have time to go through them I wish I did too short a presentation today but please do read it in the report because there's a lot of great insights for each one of these we did a detailed case study and also put the key takeaways for a business audience again okay um so after all of that we tried to distill everything that we had heard into some some insight so if you're going to take pictures of anything it's probably this slide and the next one so there is a growing appreciation now um publicly right of of an ability to use the public blockchain that is new that's a that's a really good thing to hear and decentralized business models are beginning to make some sense because defy right so people realize there's something there they don't know how to do use it yet they don't know how to how to make it work yet but but they know there's something there that's important um technological advances ZK proofs Etc are addressing the privacy concerns and a variety of the the upgrades coming or have already happened in in the mainnet are going to be addressing the remaining business issues over time but now of course we know that you need to use multiple uh multiple layers or multiple networks in order to address some of the performance and and permissioning I want to talk about private and public blockchain for a moment there are still as I mentioned some good use cases for uh for private blockchains but we're beginning to see the use cases merge much more strongly than we've seen before we're also beginning to see some hybrid options where people are using private for some things and public for others and that's that's that's an interesting uh an interesting result as well one of the things we heard very clearly was that l2s and side chains are no one expects those to be a temporary solution so even with everything that's planned in terms of upgrades for ethereum no one who is actually building projects today believes that l2s and side chains are going to be temporary they're expecting them to be here to stay to you know to remain okay um when we first when we did the the research here the number one blocker that was listed was sustainability across the board this of course now that's not the big blocker that it was because of the merge so the second one is now the top one and that one was regulation and that's not probably not going to surprise this audience um but it's interesting because it's actually not a blocker for all use cases and um if you can you can see some of the use cases where it's not in the report or catch me later and I'm happy to talk with you but there are some for which it's not an issue yet and um hey nfts are really making people aware of what digital assets are and can do so that's that's pretty neat um and then the final comments I want to make are that look we believe this is going to sound obvious right we believe that the ethereum ecosystem is ready for business of course we're going to say that no actually here's the caveat the caveat is it is not yet out of the box ready that's the key result that we got um okay don't scroll that far please um all right um so anyway the good news is there are a lot of different options right there are a number of different architectures and they're not bad I know that this community is trying to push the the edges at the EA we're trying to move the middle okay and so it's helpful for us to be able to explain that there are alternatives today and um and those Alternatives will get you moving and you don't want to wait there are good reasons to explore decentralized models okay um of the you know and and to take advantage of the processes of the type ethereum makes possible um one of the quotes that we heard was since what previously relied on faith between two or more parties can now be proven mathematically on a blockchain any situation which someone has to say I have to trust you is an opportunity for a blockchain based solution today we increasingly see this being put into practice going forward the opportunities are as numerous as the Myriad business challenges that depend on this kind of trust okay so here's my eea slide um on the left is free materials on the right is what members get I'm not going to walk through all of it but I want to talk about on the left side we have primers that we're putting out there basically if you remember like the college you know plastic two-sided sheet sheet sheets or for algebra or whatever else that's what we're putting out and they're targeted at non-technical business people c-suites in general we want to make sure they understand the trade-offs of the things that we're talking about they are free to download and use they're under our resources tab we also have a large number of educational webinars blogs we hold events and so on one of the things that we just launched this week it's brand new so hit it hard and expect some problems but we do want you to try it on our website lower right corner there's a chat a chat icon um look at some of the options that come up but the reason we did that is that's intended to be a help desk it is a help desk for business people one of the things we heard most often from businesses was look I can call anybody that I do business with but how do I call ethereum that is literally what they said how do I call ethereum so our goal was to create a front end that makes it easy to answer some of those initial business questions that people have our goal is not to steer them to a particular provider but to help get that initial understanding out of the way so when they come to talk to you they have some idea what they're talking about all right and the last thing I want to put up here is uh there's lots more in the report you can download it for free that QR code will take you to that URL which takes you to our website where you can you can download the report so with that I'm going to see if Dan has anything he'd like to finish with great thanks Dan um so you know uh for 2022 we got through uh 100 projects and you know got down to you know just just to uh just a few of them um you know kind of the call to action is uh you know if you have a project that you're working on um grab a Dan any Dan will do uh probably one of these dance uh or anybody at the uh the Enterprise ethereum Alliance the EA and uh yeah we'd love to uh you know hear about your project and uh you know potentially included in uh next year's report Yep this was the first one keep sending them in so we can we can do more thanks thank you okay thank you so much for this amazing overview of the eea it's been impacting the Enterprise adoption thank you so much and so uh should we leave now yeah but thank you but there's some few minutes okay maybe if there's questions uh yeah well we have either of questions so we can start there hi we are going to give you the microphones yeah yeah for the people that I so um can you share some specific examples of specific businesses who are implementing ethereum today on a public or private uh chain because you give like more of a general overview but I know curious of specific companies that are doing that right I understand and they've just taken away my my list with my notes where I left all the companies so I could answer that question with a whole bunch but it's okay um so um one of the uh one of the companies that um that we know of is Alia they did a a public uh placement I'm sorry private placement using um using blockchain and that was that was very successful um Microsoft uses nfts to track components in their Azure server Farms so they basically do supply chain uh tracking using an nft for every single component not because and and by the way they're doing this essentially privately okay they're doing it on a private network but the reason they're using nfts is because they found them very convenient as a as a holder for information that they needed to carry along the the process um I mentioned acre Africa that's another one of my favorites um oh gosh let's see so one of my favorites is uh the again it's a Microsoft Microsoft UI uh you know they've been uh you know really really great partners and and doing a lot of good work um they have taken all of um the Xbox royalties that they would um you know potentially give to EA Games and all all the network that that are a part of uh you know the Xbox network and they've tokenized that and what used to be uh you know Financial reconciliation that you know took months uh you know now as as a uh you know spark contract driven uh instantaneous project process that uh um you know it goes through the entire supply chain large and small uh you know Partners down the line uh you know automatically get get there uh get their fair share and uh just a fantastic example and use case for for uh for blockchain and there's a lot more I really do mean you know download the report you'll you'll get a lot more from that thank you okay thanks but you can ask for sure more things here thank you thank you so much so don't miss out in a few minutes we are going to start about abstractions like case for smart contracts wallets with Joseph J and naeem so see you in a couple of minutes [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] obstructions a case for a smart contract wallets go ahead [Applause] hey everybody um my name is Joseph this is Naim we are from Project called pawn and today we are not going to talk about Pawn but about something that we developed for the community uh because it's important to us and to our cause um so we are going to talk about asset rights abstraction our case for smart contract wallets um so I'm the CEO of Pawn whatever being a CEO means name is a smart contract app so he's the he's actually the guy who is going to tell you the interesting stuff I'm here just as a staffing um so first do I um so why did we started uh start developing a smartphone wallet in short Pawn is a is a generalized borrowing and lending protocol um but we also need like a whole bunch of tooling out there in the ecosystem and since it wasn't available at the time um we we decided to develop it ourselves um so in Pawn our kind of Holy Grail what we want to see what we want to build in the ecosystem is um seeing long-term Loans mortgage type of loans uh being issued uh on chain so we're looking at like 5 10 15 years uh contracts that should last on chain and should be actually um you know perceived as uh as legitimate like today what we see in D5 is mostly short term or something that will you know get set up and can be erased like 30 seconds later uh but we kind of want to get us to the point where people will be able to uh back their long-term mortgages with digital assets and this is a important piece of the ecosystem or like piece of the tooling that we need um so uh we decided to dive into into smart wallets and kind of allow using the assets that you that you own um while you're using them to to back alone uh but our case or the case for uh for our smart wallet is is much wider so uh today we are going to dive into that um so most people I guess know smartphone wallets as um as a multi-sig or something that allows you to operate a wallet or operate an account as uh multiple multiple users but there is much more so depending on your level of uh you know technical knowledge or just like the the time you spend in the ecosystem just a quick rundown what are actual smart growing wallets uh so contract wallets are essentially smart contracts that are creating a proxy um between a user or like an end user account uh and another contract uh with some extra logic added so there are some uh some examples uh why would you use it so first you can you can enable you can create like more events automations or like call wrappers or multiple contracts uh and do like more things in one transaction then you would otherwise be able to do a good example for that is you know this is safe or safe uh as it was recently renamed uh which uses it for multi-sync interactions or another great example is a device saver um smart contract wallet which makes it easier to operate um in the in the default ecosystem another example would be just general identities uh so there's a lot of talk about uh decentralized identity standards and a way you can use multiple keys in one smart contract and essentially like use the contract as your on-chain identity there is a whole bunch of whole bunch of attempts around the did or there's also the Urgent wallet which essentially does this very similar thing um now smartphone wallets aren't definitely useful for for everything they have they have some downsides so that's especially the gas overhead because again you you're using an extra proxy you have to do more computation in every single transaction that you're um you're using it for uh and secondary uh you may require some level of integration so EIP 1271 for sign messages would be one example of like what everybody everyone else has to integrate in order for smart contract wallets to work just as like a user account would um so in our specific case like why do we want to mess up with uh with asteroids um as I mentioned we want to allow the case where you kind of can have your cake and eat it too where you can have um Assets in your custody but still create some sort of a deed some sort of a right uh for another person to eventually be able to access those assets and and kind of like take them um take them with them so um the very basic case for us is essentially creating a hook in the wallet in someone else's account that allows uh you to essentially drain the wallet uh if a certain criteria is met and obviously if the other person consents to it so they would actually like sign up for that in another contract um why is it good what is it good for is that you don't actually have to move those assets that you have in the account you can just create this like uh right that will allow someone else to access those assets uh and if some people state from the previous talk uh from like EA or just the Enterprise ecosystem this could be useful for even like kyc assets because or like assets that require kyc because you don't have to move them from wallet you can just wait until the point where you actually have to move them uh and that's the point where you can kind of like start dealing with kyc because the actual asset didn't you know didn't move nothing nothing happened to it um so again for us the the case is the D5 mortgage where we just want to allow someone to um you know buy a piece of decentralized uh lock it as collateral keep that in their custody still like allow them to use it but use the value of the assets asset as a backing for loan another example would be you know like Dow voting rights again like you still want to use those but you might want to utilize the the value or that's that's kind of backing uh the particle token the same goes for gaming items or ens names are again a perfect example um another useful thing is that you can also allow asset renting you can just reverse the case and essentially just give someone the right to uh like transfer the right to someone else but keep the token transfer right and keep the ownership of the asset um and withdraw it later if certain criteria is met again so this is the basic intro and now finally uh now is the interesting stuff so passing the word over to nime uh thanks Joseph hi guys my name is Naim uh before we start for those who don't know me uh beside I'm being a smart contract I'm also a contemporary circus artist so I'm even though I'm used to performing in front of people I am not used to speaking in front of people so I'm super nervous now and uh I was thinking how can I like make me less uh nervous so I decided I want to perform you something uh unfortunately I'm jumping on a trampoline which is uh which cannot be fit here so I'll just show you a video of me being shot from your human cannon thanks guys yeah it helped me it helped me a lot so back to the topic uh let's define some requirements for this uh for this contract wallet obviously it has to act as a normal contact wallet that means that you have to be able to call arbitrary call later on on any address basically and the nice feature enabled tokenizing asset transfer rights we want to enable tokenizing these rights to fungible non-fungible and semi-fungible assets uh uh and one of two things it means is actually to enable the ATR token holder to transfer uh the assets from owner's wallet so you don't own the asset but you are able to actually transfer it and the second part of it is prevent the owner without the ATR token uh uh without the ATR token to transfer it so yeah you are not screwed if you are a token holder uh so high level design first after some prototypes we try to implement our own smart contract wallet uh which is something we realize we don't want to do because we'll be basically Reinventing the wheel so after some research uh of uh gnosis save we realized they have two very nice components one is guard and one is module for those of you who don't know uh the safe ecosystem that well guard is a is a contract which you can basically link to your Save which will check every transaction made from your save for uh at the like before and after the transaction in our context uh it's a guard which will basically enforce the transfer rules okay so uh if if we see that the the save has the ATR token minted but it's not the holder will basically revert the the transaction and that's the responsibility of the Guard uh the second component is a module uh this enables to execute the transaction without actually reaching the owner's threshold which is also something we really want because we want the ATR token holder which is not the owner of the save to be able to transfer or start the execution of the transfer from someone else's safe so yeah that's cool with these two components which I was like very surprised they have we were able to build this ATR smart contract on top of agnosis safe which is really great uh we encountered obviously some challenges so we will talk about them right now first is approval issue while minting an ATR token uh it's pretty obvious that you don't want to Mint an ATR token and have approved addresses at the same time because if you if you do the approved address can transfer the the asset without even triggering the the guard or the module so this is obvious like a thing we have to we have to solve uh next is something we called stalking attack it's basically a type of attack where uh I as an attacker will create a malicious asset I will tokenize its transfer rights I will transfer it to my victim's wallet and remove it with some non-standard way so let's say the asset can be transferred by the owner I'll I as an attacker am the owner so I'll be able to uh to withdraw that in that case the victim's wallet goes into uh Interstate where every execution will fail because the guard will not have the proper like sufficient tokenized balance so it's also bad uh then we have challenges like EIP 1271 where the input of the function is basically just hash and signature so we cannot like uh enforce the rules if we don't know what is actually like verifying uh then there is a gas overhead it's a contract wallet it's always will be there always will be some gas overhead plus there is a lot of checks for every execution right uh then there is the non-standard assets uh we have we currently support just the standards we cannot support non-standards asset because we are actually enforcing the the the transfer rules right uh so yeah that's one challenge and not possibly not possible to use the delegates call because then it will alter the logic of the smart contract and again you are you are able to to transfer it or do whatever you want with it so let's talk about the first one yeah uh approval issue while minting ATR token uh uh we need to check that the the asset which is going to uh the asset which ATR is going to be minted uh doesn't have the approved address currently there is like four types of of approvals for erc20 it's approval amount for ERC 721 it's a proof ID or set approval for all and for ERC 1155 it's a super just set approval for all only one of these approved function has actually a getter for the address uh so it's it was a big issue at first but after realizing that all the approval exit or all the transactions which are approving the the assets are done through the wallet then we can basically just track all the all the approved addresses and uh on the time of minting we can check that the asset is not uh doesn't have uh An approved address so yeah cool we need to we need to check the approved addresses the stalking attack how I described previously uh it's it's the malicious asset which is transferred from the victim's wallet by the non-standard way uh it would revert on insufficient tokenized balance and but we don't we still want the ATR token holder to be able to transfer it to any asset so because of that we need to basically divide the transfer function into two first disclaim where uh I as a ATR token holder and transferring the asset to my wallet which is cool the there is no possibility of stocking attacks so yeah we'll let you do that and the second is the generic transfer to any address but in that case we require the recipient permission uh in this permission uh the uh the recipient can actually specify what type of asset is going to be transferred by whom uh some expiration stuff and so on and so on so it's much harder for an attacker to actually execute this talking attack it's still possible but it's much much much harder uh but still because it's it's possible we need to implement a function uh to recover the safe from from that attack which we did that's a good one so uh after solving some challenges uh the the final design looks like this we actually uh right you can see the the ATR token or the ATR module uh here is the here's the guard uh it's implemented as a proxy for basically be more future proof If there is some widely adapted ERC which we want to we want to like support we don't want to force every uh like safe owner to deploy new ones will will basically do like a force update for them uh then you can see the operator's contacts this is a contract responsible for tracking the approved addresses uh per safe per per the collection and uh our Ponce Factory just to like be sure that the address we are interacting with is actually safe and then there is some uh some like agnosis save agnosis save contract and uh and the owner because of the of this proxy still we didn't solve all the challenges so open challenges are enable EIP 1271. it uh will be possible if the wallet basically pre-approved the hash in that case we can actually check what is approved and if if it doesn't like break any transfer rules it'll say yeah okay you can this hash is approved so every call for the uh is valid signature will return to or the magic value uh for for this hash uh guess overhead of course we want to have a we want to have the gas cost as low as possible so currently minting the ATR token has a constant overhead which is night which is nice uh and transferring the asset via the ATR token has linear overhead because it's like it's depending on number of tokenized Assets in the in the safe uh because we need to check that every tokenized asset after the execution is actually there and that the tokenized balance is still sufficient uh then there is an issue with non-standard asset I think this this issue will be there like forever because uh yeah that's like we can work only with the honest assets uh so if somebody is trying to give you his ATR token for some malicious asset which is not standard they find some like approved functions or transfer functions we cannot basically like prevent him to do that and if you accept this ATR token then yeah you're screwed sorry and the possibility of using delegate goals there is actually an option to like white list some addresses uh to be able to use the delegate call or to call the delegate call at uh but we cannot do it like generally we cannot say hey you can you can call delegate colon any uh any address because then it's a it's a huge security issue for us yeah and I think that's all so thank you there was me and Joseph thank you so much naiman Joseph and thank you for I also think we have two more thanks to show though there are two slides where yeah two more slides I'm sorry yeah or maybe it's stupid to put two more slides after a thank you page but you know stuff happens uh if you can go to thank you one as actually oh yeah number 18. yeah cool so I I realized like maybe some of the some of the graphics weren't really visible here so if you go to uh pawn.mirror.xyz there is an article about the the pawn safe where everything should be described uh also you can just check out our website on Pond XYZ uh where you can see our audit see our repos we have a bunch of documentation uh for users or or developers as well and finally well here's our pop-up yeah thanks for coming and I think we have six more minutes for questions is it right yeah so if any of you have a question anyone there we go yeah thank you uh good afternoon uh how are you going to handle the I don't remember we were the the EIP the correct AIP but there was one that will allow you to approve and transmit at the same in the same transaction have you any plans for that I think it was 12.71 or something similar come again if we want to support standard that can approve and call in the same transaction yes there I believe there was one of the eips that uh that allowed you to sign a transaction at several same several transactions in the same uh in at the same time if I understood it correctly there is one EIP I think it's 1373 something like that it's a token standard which implements another set of approved functions these approved functions can basically approve and call arbitrary data in one transaction uh we are actually supporting that so beside these well-known 27 721 1155 we are also supporting 777 and these 1363 I'm not sure about the number now so I hope I answered your question or it was something else anyone else thank you um lending out nfts is always a bit tricky and you mentioned you can lend it out without using collateral uh how is that realized and is that compatible with any existing wallets that would display nfts uh well the idea about not using collateral is that you will use collateral but the ATR token so basically if I want to lend you some assets some whatever asset I will first tokenize its transfer rights I will send you that asset and I'll keep the transfer Edge to myself so you are stated as an owner of that asset in the whole D5 ecosystem but if you stop paying me my installments or whatever I'm still able to transfer it back from you even though normally I'm not I don't have the rights to do that so it's not like uncollateralized in like very technical sense but you are not using the asset itself as a collateral you are using the transference instead foreign else hey guys thank you so would you elaborate a little bit about the account rental you were talking about the the like account rental or so and the bribery attack for the account Trend also if I have if I understand call it correctly then will will be allowed to rent our account under usage of it so how yeah it was about specifically the assets but now if you want to take that one as a printing case all right well so essentially what what Nam did which I didn't realize when he was developing it uh but I thought it was super cool is that um within within the realm of um the the sales which have this particle guard and module enabled uh because you generate them using a specific like uh Contra Factory uh you can still uh transfer the asset uh to essentially like any safe that's that has that particular Guardian module and the asset token uh the the ATR token will still be executable and you will be able to essentially get it from anyone anyone's wallet uh within within that particle realm so obviously like you have to you have to be um you have to realize like the particle asset has this deed created around it but it's essentially the same as like having real estate property and like having a deed on that property um and um then you know we can be like friends um that that want to like reuse our gaming assets uh we can have the asset token right generated I can safely like give my you know magic swords to to knives wallet uh I'll tell him to give it back to me in 30 days if you I can just claim it back and obviously you can you can put it into contract you can set your uh set kind of like exact parameters on like how the return should happen but the asset token the the HR token is basically the the thing that will execute a transfer later on perfect thank you 's name and Joseph [Applause] after this we are going to have a Max semenchuk who's going to talk about web3 in the Ukraine government so don't miss out we'll see you in a couple of minutes uh during the 2020 like the covet gave the opportunity to kind of practice it we all got get stuck in our homes and I felt like what was on fire so I needed to do something and we started to organize this social activist groups in the manners I used like I learned in web 3 like different Discord knowledge bases coordination and stuff like that so uh it felt quite good but it also felt like a drop in the ocean we can help a hospital here or some Elder people but the country is quite huge and the scale of the problems is always growing so that's why I recognized that I would like to kind of learn more about how like I already learned the governance of it and I felt like wow should I really try it in the like government and see whether those ideas can be applied there and now for two years I'm working with the Ministries newly formed so uh and I kind of would like to share with you some ideas about the ecosystem development in general you know about how you can take different people together align them under some Vision you know do some great stuff and uh how to build capacity how to resolve conflicts how uh deal with the con like Crisis and try to show it in the few case studies so uh when I just joined you know what what what did I see uh initially I was mostly working in the development so I was like specifically following my narrow field but when I started to look at the like country in general I learned that first of all Ukraine has one of the best adoption rates and for specific reasons like uh we don't have a Securities market and people don't trust Banks and so on but in the same way like the current situation as in many countries is quite like Gray Zone you know and the since 2012 or 14 there were like a bunch of tries to propose some kind of legislation or something that would guide this industry but all of them failed basically before this uh like new president came like zelensky and he had this vision of a country in a smartphone you know government there's a smartphone and they created this ministry which consisted mostly of the business people you know and young people which was contrasting a lot with the other other Ministries and bodies so I started to work there and what I learned is like basically we can propose something but in order to pass anything you know we need a general consensus and at that time you know now it's getting much better but at that time most people knew crypto for money laundering like drugs and hacks and stuff like that so it was like we needed to come and speak to everybody and explain this only small percent of it you know like dollar is also like used for the same purposes it doesn't mean we need to bond it so uh in order to like make this uh happen you know I saw some specific like problems or challenges first of all every Ministry everybody or every business they had their own agenda you know they saw what they want to do you know like the National Bank just sees the currency aspect of it right and like or like somebody is just looking at The Exchange Market on the mining Market but not all of that together you know there was no specific vision of how that all will strive and uh also another part is like the businesses and the like web3 crowd is mostly like crypto anarchic and they hate government they don't want to even touch it and I kill it the same but uh also like there was no productive dialogue you know like no attempts to to build this connection and also most of the like this Holy Verse you know about like somebody wants to do something in a position and all that fighting happened inside of Ukraine nobody thought wow this is like a global like movement you know how do we become competitive like worldwide or how do we think about it as like not just inside but but as general and uh final final problem was that was that was a middle of bear market so which was really hard to find any resources to develop it but even like to illustrate on the case even like with a project that really got funding you know like most of them didn't but there was this project and the ministry was developing like it passed the law on the what his virtual assets basically crypto you know like what is the key what is the wallet stuff like that and there was a norm that all of the service providers need to be in some kind of register so we should have some exchanges or Brokers like their license is registered somewhere and we got this task and this funding from the Swiss Embassy yeah please develop it's a nice stuff you know like develop this registry I got super experience the Consultants they proposed us with three options so one is like fully public system probably on ethereum but maybe something um whatever but then hybrid solution you know semi-closed and centralized and they did a comparison the balance scorecard you know like on the security cost of support the anti like uh corruption effects and stuff like that and all together like the ethereum solution the public solution was winning you know I was like they said like we propose this solution and I was like yes let's do that but we needed to consult with other stakeholders and the donors who sponsor that like we ask them what what do they think and they said well we will you probably have 200 companies do you really need blockchain for this you know and then we talk to the businesses like hey guys what do you think we should build and they said could you just do no registration at all or we will take our business elsewhere you know to other jurisdiction you don't want to be registered at all you know and the final like kill of this idea was from the lawyers they said well potentially we could use a blockchain here but due to the uh current laws all the information should be stored on the server servers in the country so if you would like to do that you need to change this and that can be like a five-year project you know compared to the small case of all like we wanted to do in half year so guess which solution we preferred and that's like the illustration before what's what I have to deal with so uh that's what led me to think more about the vision you know how do we create like even of course I I see the point like it doesn't make sense to do a 200 people register your company register on the blockchain but it's just a start you know somebody needs to do this change in the norm somebody needs to start building different services and information it's kind of open ecosystem and stuff like that but nobody stated that as a task you know we just solve this small solution here and there so I was in the search for the vision and one of my friends from the undps celebration lab he recommended to use the foresight and basically the foresight is the like it's a research method it's the Community Development approach it's like really hard to tell in just few words but what it isn't for sure it's not a prediction you know it's not about like okay last year we earned 1 million dollars so next yeah maybe it's two million dollars it's rather about the different trends that can occur and how like they can pay out together you know what happens if all of them materialize or none of them materialize what then would happen who will win and so on so uh one of the key ideas is that it should be like systematic and participatory so for that we took each of a kind we took representatives from every Ministry you know from National Bank to cyber police we took parliamentaries every kind of business social ngos economists I would even like ecologists you know because that was also one of the insights there and we got them together in a set of like offline events and zoom calls to speak about what do they see what trends do they see what future or like what needs do they have and the second aspect of it is like we gathered all of that intelligence about the future for our long-term Vision process so we said like it's not for a year it's like 20 30 you know 10 years but many people in the ministry planning for 10 years it was like can't do but uh we strive for that and uh the two key trends that we identified was like first of all the asset tokenization you know whether it would grow or not and uh control our personality and in the our audience nobody believed that it won't grow everybody believed it would grow you know so we didn't even consider those scenarios but where the real fight happened is in the between this uh personality control so mostly people spoke about on the one hand the values of the security you know protection of like customers consumers and so on but on the other hand it's like Freedom you know no protection like we can lose our like uh freedom but that doesn't mean that we'll gain protection for sure you know so at one moment we just stand it on the line you know from the like security to freedom and people stated some arguments and other could you know change their place at this and we ended up you know like somewhere in the middle but closer to the freedom and the scenario would the metaphor for this scenario we call it digital Venice in the way of like golden age of trade you know open trade and prosperity lots of bridges between all of these systems and so on in comparison to digital dictatorship you know where Mass surveillance of course some maybe big Enterprises can win you know but for the Innovation for the consumers and so on it doesn't prove to be the best so this was our like Choice there and after that what initially happened is people started to like they saw all of that Community gathered around those ideas and they started to propose different projects you know we started to see like who's gonna need to do what you know what the government needs to do what business needs to do you know that set up the initial roadmap of our operations where people really proposed something what they wanted and by the end of like this six months extensive work I was super happy and I was like I saw a lot of the stakeholders we established all this contacts we had this developmental Vision it had this road map 70 Pages report extensive you know education happened through this you know people discussed you know like in National but what is D5 what is nft and stuff like that but one of the key ideas is that people build trust you know I heard somebody selling like from the business oh this guy from the uh Financial monitoring he's like adequate and nice you know we can probably speak to him and government also like our mental workers they had like okay this Founders entrepreneurs they're like okay they do some nice stuff so it created the initial basis for like human relations in this process and we also established a project office you know with all those experts in 11 working groups some of them already got funding for educational infrastructure and I was like on the high moment of it at that time and but you could think is what can go wrong you know after that well uh on February 24th the day that most of ukrainians will remember for long you know the war started and now after eight months it's kind of like a new normality you can say but the first months I felt like would I really like would I have to speak to like speaking to my close one would I have a chance to speak to them tomorrow I wasn't sure and all of this nice developmental plans they were also doomed you know who will think about this Innovation at this time so this is also like I recognized the moment we recognized in our team that we can't also lower hands you know this time required us to act and to do something and what was promising really is that on the base of the initial trust the people you know talking together a bunch of projects emerged that started to you know collect funding and one of such projects is called date for Ukraine it was under the ministry of digital transformation brand and supported by a few businesses you know so government accepted crypto and send it to the different purchases the key idea there was that the supply chain requirements were super high if they would need there would be need in like quadricopter or you know a car you would need it tomorrow you know so you don't have time to do this bureaucratic procedures or whatever so it's speeding up the processes a lot and the transparency of it and yeah that was the one the biggest one that which collected around 60 million dollars from 50 000 people and you could see that ethereum ecosystem played a big role as well as like people donated just around 300 but guys like vitalik libertarian like in millions and so on so feel free to check it out and the other uh like projects were initiated by a set of like business owners they said like under our reputation we collect These funds it's just like important at the time many people like not only good actors activated but bad actress activated where they collected like kind of for Ukraine you know but could you know just take this money so the brand of ministry or the brand of like business owners and so on was really important for that and like and chained font they had this multi-seek you know they like we didn't have the time to build a full-scale you know dial for everything but we tried to keep the closest to that and you can see that the money was sent like for different causes you need to like be lean and agile there was many Grassroots uh you know initiatives that needed just small amounts of fun so there was like this people struggling in the other countries migration that they had no money to survive you know and uh they can't even always use their money for some reason so this help card so direct given was also a major thing and finally nfts nfts became like a real thing uh Ukraine dark of like one of the major they collected like more than six millions and they decided to distribute those funds across the uh like trusted ngos because like from the external view you don't know like who to donate to you know like we don't respect too much guys like Red Cross or somebody because they don't go this last mile to to the real you know like workplace and to help those people so the the like and for external they don't know where to give so they kind of created this connection where the Museum of War which connected both the aspect of like creativity to to the fundraising for the ministry we even got this crypto Bank we sold for 100k so first of all I would like to thank you a lot for as a community for everybody who supported it who donated who tracked who was with us in this hard moment after this you know nobody can say in Ukraine that crypto is like non-desirable or something so yeah just just for this moment thank you thank you so much I'm sorry do I have time yeah I have some time I'm finishing sorry uh so uh what I proposed to like what we can do next is like uh like let's keep hacking you know like currently the uh like we we got bombed all the time you know now they like aiming at the uh like electrical and like water infrastructure and so on but that doesn't stop people from like coding and doing their work you know they work like in the underground hotel they keep hacking just recently there was like a hackathon in Kiev where vitalik was and uh people were like thinking about the solution that can be just like now we need it in Ukraine but tomorrow you know who knows which country already like if you look at the security aspect of the DLT like in Georgia or Taiwan they already are thinking about the cyber attacks that can happen in our countries also like quite a big problem and uh it's also a bunch of migration challenges because of course like National Banks they try to like secure macro situation you know but also people can't always you know transfer money or like open the bank account and uh in our vision we're looking to to move all of this ownership right system to distrusted ecosystems and just like as a final note what what I learned through all of this experience you know what I hope you can use in your work as well is that uh without the vision you know that won't work you know we'll be still disconnected and what we do and uh what we achieved is like the sound sense of the shared future and the community who was like experiencing this shared future is like in the world we all became kind of dull like everybody started to work despite any conflicts and second is that uh well while technology can be neutral in a way you know like but uh with the same technology you can use you can build either a dictatorship or like Venice whatever like democracy so and for that there should be a demand like understanding from the people like currently just you know if you present one percent you know we need more people to really kind of request it from the politicians and politicians that they move it it's kind of a long process but without this like win-win interaction and consent consensus it just won't happen and in our approach we saw that raising awareness and education was key you know people just if if they don't get it they don't trust it so currently we're launching a program to get like by 2030 more than a half of ukrainians crypto literate and we're now education governmental workers how to use metamask and stuff like that so they will have practical skills they will see it so that would really help us in the like for everybody help in the crisis so people will already rely and know that so on that note thank you again let's connect you have an LA in the Ukraine government in me if you want to do something together please find me or connect I will be really happy to help thank you foreign thank you so much now and yeah it's amazing to see how people start helping a lot Ukraine around the world using the blockchain technology and for now uh in one couple of minutes we're going to have a panel so don't miss out we'll see you again out here [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign so today we have the first panel of the day here in the tropical Sunset scenario so I'm very happy to introduce you to Adrian Sutton ocean kind Paul honer and vasilicia pavolo [Applause] yeah they are going to talk about it's 10 pm do you know where your pneumonotic is foreign thank you very much everyone as some of you that can count might notice we're one short and a panelist but uh I think he'll join us um momentarily so I think we'll more or less kind of kick off and do a bit of intros and stuff beforehand um oh there's the man himself with silly uh okay um probably with slides okay sweet so today we have a panel on validere harmonics and their Pat and their security uh it's been almost two years since the beacon chain launched and there's quite a lot of people that haven't touched those private keys in quite a long time um over the course of the next 50 minutes we're going to look back at you know what's been done on the key security side for the last while we're gonna see what things are looking like right now in terms of validator key security and then we're going to look a bit forward towards withdrawals which I'm sure lots of people want to know about but before I get to that I would like to do a few introductions uh will this gonna work for me probably not okay I know it is um oh yeah now it's connected three so briefly I'll introduce myself my name is ocean kind I'm co-founder at oboe Labs we build distributed validator technology which is the ability to run one validator across multiple machines by multiple entities um and yeah that's my little quick intro um I'd like to introduce Paul next hello my name is Paul co-factor Sigma Prime I've been working on uh Lighthouse which is an ethereum consensus implementation since 2018. um yeah I've done a lot of the initial development of it and now I do a lot of kind of overseeing and reviewing and still some development I'll pass it on to Adrian hi I'm Adrian Sutton I'm with consensus and I started out on the basic team doing the execution layer side before there was an idea of a consensus layer side I spent about a year and a half pretty much full time on Basu and then switched over to techu because I heard that Beacon chain was the new hotness and techu is a consensus client so I've spent the last oh I don't know three to four years uh helping build that and bring the merge to fruition it's been a lot of fun been working with people like Paul and a lot of fun there um so yeah and varsity I'm Vasily techleto also which is probably more relevant to uh to this panel I used to be CTO in P2P validator uh so I know anything to do about managing keys for validation so three uh awesome so we're gonna like test that and figure out some of the good bad and ugly about managing uh private Keys um so yeah so the first thing I want to do is look back a little about how it started and figure out you know some of the basics about what is a mnemonic and stuff so I thought Paul would you explain to us what a mnemonic is oh yeah sure so I'm not sure I can get a textbook definition but a mnemonic is a series of words a phrase um say 20 12 to 24 variable length I think it's I think 24 is a standard in in F2 so a bunch of words easy to remember supposedly um and then from those words you can you can generate any number of uh validated keys so there'll be signing keys or withdrawal keys so the premise is that um once you generate this um string of words uh then you write those string of words down on a piece of paper uh and then um you use those words to generate your validator keys then you put those validator keys on uh on some Hardware on on your hot machines um and then you only keep a copy of the mnemonic um on paper um so that yeah so that in the future if those keys were to be like if those boxes exploded disappeared you could use that mnemonic to generate exactly the same Keys again thank you very much and I wanted to dig in a little bit uh you mentioned withdrawal keys and hotkeys I was wondering Adrian could you tell me the difference between them and do they have to have the same seed phrase uh yeah so the the hotkeys that we talk about are your validator keys and they're the ones that you will have used and seen so far um in dealing with ethereum and if you're running a validator so they're the ones that are on your node and your your validator client has to actually load them into memory any kind of secret key that's loaded into memory and hot on a machine is not as secure as something that's locked up in a safe so they're at a higher risk of being stolen you still do your best to to secure them and secure the machine obviously um but we wanted to make sure that there's a a big difference between those hotkeys that that run your valid and sign things and the keys that actually control the money and and whether you can withdraw it so from your mnemonic by default you would generate a validator key using One path and as Paul said you can generate multiple keys so from a different path you get a separate validator key and it's that validator key that you will use once withdrawals are implemented to set up withdrawals and be able to to actually recover your money again do they have to come from the same mnemonic no they don't you don't even have to use a mnemonic you can just generate the keys directly without going through the mnemonic process but typically it's a lot easier to back up one mnemonic and not lose it and etch it into steel or whatever it is and store it in a safe well then to have multiple keys that are you know being managed and able to be lost because if you lose your withdrawal key that's it it's game over you're not getting your 32 weeks back yeah that's kind of one of the things we're going to get to a bit further on so as you mentioned in the seed phrase thing um a lot of people that are homesteaker would have used the E2 staking CLI that set up you know one 24 word mnemonic that had both your withdrawal keys and your hotkeys um it's unfortunate we were supposed to have one more panelist Jim McDonald and he's done a lot of work in this specific problem but uh the reason that this thing is titled is 10 pm do you know what your mnemonic is is because some unfortunate people have had these mnemonics compromised over the last two years and I was wondering if you guys wanted to kind of explain what uh Jim's proposal is for for how we kind of straightened this out but yeah what's what is the problem if somebody has your mnemonic all right so basically if you used these the the same amount to generate the body data key and withdrawal key and withdraw credentials um which is most homesteakers users but it's um much less often happening for uh big operations where it's usually different Keys more owned by different people so if it's the same the same pneumonia was used to like what is going to happen uh is that now the um the malicious person who compromised the key they can um like you're in a race to who can slash the protocol like you've already data first which is if your small validator is not like really big problem you stop validation you get very small fine uh so let's selection penalty and it's not that involved but withdrawal key compromised means that they can um when when the validator exits and withdrawals implemented in the human protocol upgrades allows to either to get back to execution layer they you're in a race to understand who gets the money and if you're almost 10K you probably lose the race versus like a craft crafty audio sorry so we will uh follow up a bit more about that later on the talk but I wanted to ask a bit about light over silly and specifically the withdrawal key setup you guys use the Genesis so not the most recent one could you tell me a bit about like how Lido originally set up with withdrawal keys uh yeah a long story short the initial I think about like 15 or 20 percent of stake that Lido has has been deposited on a threshold uh signature uh on uh zero x0 type if I'm being exact for for people who knows basically uh um shouted credentials that are shared between uh 11 people uh very well known in the industry who when the time comes when the draw was implemented and rotation of withdraw credential is implemented they can issue a common to rotated though to the Lido smart contract address so yeah that was like we recorded it for half a year and uh uh we we've had a couple audits on it so like it was like hard to make uh because at the time there were no smart contracts or like even execution like a credentials option for uh for deposits hey thank you for teaming me up for my next question which is to talk a little bit about where things went wrong with the ox0 ones and there was like basically well there's your hotkeys and your withdrawal keys and there's like two different ones I wanted to touch on where there were problems the first one is stake.us and the hotkey issue does anyone explain what happened it's quite a while it was only two two years um there was 175 validated slashed because they were running the hotkeys in two different places [Music] is a big sophisticated or not operator uh they they run uh like I think uh maybe billions maybe hundreds of millions of stake a lot of them and they have sophisticated setups so like one of the the feature they used in in multiple protocols was they uh had implemented something like like in a something that in traditional world would be called like web application firewall so basically there's an implemented software that ran between the node and the network and it should have cached the the double sign wins and they implemented for S5 understand for multiple blockchains including them and put out put it up um uh for for the validation uh setup and ran multiple uh versions of the notes uh with like with the same private key that we're making blocks in parallel and this was usually caught by the uh the system um I'm not like 100 sure that because otherwise it could be it could have been that they I accidentally deployed it like uh to the two things in Parable not not like at the at the usual setup but anyway they did uh they did have uh an automated system for limits that at times could have run multiple validators with the same private key which is uh usually lead to slashable offense in in protocols including them and they had a system to uh that should have caught the the problems which is like usually people don't do that like right um in in not operator setup because uh liveness is not as important as safety uh slashing for for lack of for so for for missing a few blocks uh much much much lesser than uh slashing liquid penalties for for double sign it's like not worth it usually um so um that system didn't work and uh they for about like 40 minutes or like about an hour they had issued blocks in parallel and they were like really lucky that ethereum system is designed like a design because like they had I think about 70 million dollars take or something like that at this time uh and they only slashed uh like 15 valid data so like 27 I don't like really like rookie numbers right so um and that's the case because uh not a lot of validators had uh had issued the invalid block solid stations because um it's not uh like you you don't run the with your stake on a single note like in many other systems otherwise they would have like five percent slash or like 15 slash which is like much much higher and uh uh only after that they uh uh uh monitoring and the Learning System had triggers so like they're they're in this uh with this problem for a long time so there had been some problems in there as well I think initially described the setup is sophisticated I think that was a very kind way to refer to it I would I would call it dangerously over complicated but yeah I agree I think that these setups where you're running multiple instances of the same key in any place I think you you really like Wesley said you're just prioritizing liveness over um safety and it's it's I think it's really bad business it's not it's not good economically um it's really bad for your reputation uh and it's bad for the network as well so I really couldn't advise against it any Stronger Yeah probably the interesting thing particularly pre-merge I think is probably a little less likely post merge now but pre-merge you could run validator keys in two places and get away with it for a surprising amount of time until you proposed a block or until your node was just slightly out of sync or you just got that little bit unlucky because both validators if you're staying in sync and are testing perfectly they'll create the exact same attestation and that's not slashable so it's incredibly dangerous and you think you're okay for quite a while until one day you wake up and you've lost all your money um well you know you don't lose it all but just a bit of money actually because of how it didn't work so yeah yeah I know but particularly you know it's with no withdrawals not implemented it's really must be frustrating to have been slashed early on in the chain and still be waiting to get your money back out yeah for sure and then as you mentioned slashing you don't lose all your money but as you touched on earlier if there's problems with withdrawal Keys you can be like really in trouble there was one other very famous issue about two years ago as well by stakehound does anyone remember of what happened there with their withdrawal keys I had to go look this up myself beforehand yeah you might have to give me the background I remember stories and not names oh I I also know exactly what happened yeah I read all the passwords so yeah uh yeah so uh the thing is uh stakehold together with fire blocks uh has designed the system not unlike the one that lighter designed with threshold signature used for holding Keys except it was like much smaller I think they only had like three or four signatures out of which two two shots was in possession of stakehold and two shots were positioned five blocks and um nobody knows what exactly happened because like the the parties have like different interpretation of what happened but what we end like what they end up in situation when the two shares That stakehold was supposed to hold were not hold by stakehold and that could have happened like we don't know why that happened like maybe it was like problem on the software side maybe those problems take hindsight on Communications on like around backups system like that bullet and lawsuits I think right now so um I'm not sure about that but the end result is uh all that stake about 72 million by or something like that um I didn't check if it's operating still or not like if the I think it's operating still because uh like there can be a miracle uh I don't know uh someone always find transaction rewards now yeah yeah some some kind of like chance that you find like an old mnemonic in the old uh um jacket or something right I don't know but uh it's essentially unwithdrawable right now so this is how you wind up with your CEO sifting through the dump looking for quite possibly or yeah going through like any old bit of Hardware they can find um but yeah thank you very much visily for giving those descriptions and preventing me from having to do it but yeah I think we don't necessarily know you know what happened but what we do know is that if anything happens to your withdrawal key odds are very high that there's nothing you can do um so with that in mind Genesis happened in December 2020 and about six months later so there was a change to withdrawal credentials they introduced the idea of um what we know is 0x01 type withdrawal credentials and does anyone explain what they are yeah actually know that one that's good um so the 0x01 withdrawal credentials were introduced because we realized uh that the way we were going to merge and and move forward with ethereum too uh was different to what we first expected so we set up these zero zero zero zero Keys as BLS Keys matching what validators have um partly with the expectation of all ethereum addresses becoming the ls keys and partly just didn't really know what was going to be so we went with the tech we had um with the plans for the merge keeping the execution layer and keeping the traditional ethereum addresses we introduced ox01 addresses which are just an ethereum public address so it's a whole bunch of zeros and then the 20 bytes of of a normal ethereum address and the guarantee is that when withdrawals are implemented and your money comes off the beacon chain it will be credited to that address the catch with it is a is a minor one but important depending on how you write your contracts if you you can use any ethereum address um it can be a contract but the evm will not execute when funds are added to that so if you're expecting log events to come out they won't you won't have that opportunity um you need to write the contract in a way that it can kind of just handle being called one day and they're being more money in its account than it previously saw and Dole that out and however it wants from there sweet and then Lido when this came out um very quickly adopted it could you tell me a bit about you know what that process was like the risk of writing a contract for something that doesn't exist yet uh how did that kind of process go and the kind of migration you might say well there's no migration but the swap out uh yeah so it wasn't too hot actually like uh it's like we have done a stop that is governance controlled and that stop will be like sometimes like in the future when these are also implemented it will be upgraded and when the ethereum oscifies uh enough um it will be made unupgradable so the RC files as well um so there is like nothing uh complicated about this like just a smart contract that that is a stuff that does nothing except being upgraded implementing withdrawals handling withdrawals due to the fact that like you can't know when uh like you're not getting triggered when uh either comes in protocol is pretty complex and we when you add the liquidity like liquids taken protocol uh complexness on top of it it's um it's pretty hard research to to do it just right but we'll manage so sweet sweet yeah uh you make it sound very easy but I'm not so sure that uh writing like a proxy smart contract holding I don't know 10 billion dollars is super easy is that about right number wise like it's not harder than uh writing a contract that's called zero uh like right it's just like the stakes are higher yeah if you get it wrong it can be a contract that has zero very quickly see at some point it will just become dead inside like when you walk these three so I used to be a CTO for a validator like I had like 12 incidents in a year so yeah um so there's one other withdrawal credential that isn't necessarily in the spec yet and that's 0x03 does anyone want to talk about what that uh withdrawal credential is I don't know what that is I think I think you're probably keen on this but the oxo3 is designed to be a forced withdrawal so at the moment um you actually wind up needing both your hotkey and your withdrawal key effectively to to get through the full withdrawal process because while your validator is active your 32 Heath is remains locked up you need to exit your validator and then it can go through the withdrawal process and that's where the withdrawal key comes in if however you're staking so you're not staking yourself you've asked someone else to stake on your behalf and you've given them your hotkeys knowing that they can't steal your eth because you've got the withdrawal keys not a bad setup um you have one little problem in that you can't force them to exit your validator and actually get your eth back and so the oxo3 credentials are intended um to be a way of the withdrawal credentials being able to force exit a validator effectively um I don't know if you know the details of how that was planned uh so like there is no more details because like it's solder drafts but I think that zero x x zero three credentials are completely unnecessary they're just a feature that can be added to 0x1 um like the same way handled this much the same way as deposits to be container and like just like consensus lab processing messages from execution layer and it's not even too hot it's just like needs to be designed and Implement tested we are actually working on right now on design uh I don't think it will it can make uh it into Shanghai I'm like that's probably unrealistic but like the next Hunter after Shanghai is like doable I think the the interesting trade-off as a client Dave and designing some of these protocols when we're talking about withdrawal processes is trying to be fair with who controls which key and therefore what response what rights they have um so we've kind of set up this idea that the money will go to whoever has the withdrawal key um and the signing key is in control of actual signing and exit and as every time we go and change that you wind up with a whole bunch of people in quite unique situations that were built around that particular split of responsibilities and when you change the split you've got to kind of make sure that you don't break things for other people or introduce insecurities because of this particular way they've set things up I personally don't know anyone who built around the that like assumption so like who is actually relying on the fact that validators can exit and withdrawals cannot I I don't know yeah I think that's a fairly reasonable one that you know the base assumption is that you you are you know it's your money so it's your validator and you own all the keys um when you start to move away from that into um staking providers and so on you are moving out of the I guess ideal case um you know that there is a role for staking providers I don't mean that as in you know this horrible person on my right or anything um but you know it does it does the onus is almost on people doing that to to help with the security and manage it rather than on the protocol itself because it's based around that one key one validator type setup um so yeah I think I think it's quite reasonable to make a lot of these changes and and we can kind of push those boundaries a lot of the the actual expectations haven't been really formally and strictly set down either um we've kind of given a an expectation in many cases but knowing that we didn't have actually a plan for withdrawals when we set most of them we knew they were going to have to be changes and so there are kind of some really core things maybe that we've got to keep that you know like the money goes to the withdrawal key not the signing key it will never be the signing key that gets the money um but beyond that yeah there's there's a lot of wiggle room we do have I I had a similar concern I did mention my background but I also like previously ran quite a large validator and ran maybe 10 000 plus validators and uh at one point when they were discussing this you know new zero x01 withdrawal type and you know that would be the way that ultimately like money will come out if you are on the ox01 you'll need to like swap eventually before you can withdraw there was a moment where that was going to be the hotkey that gets to pick where the new ox011 was and I was quite concerned because all of a sudden that meant I was in charge of billions of dollars for a preview a small amount of time and then they were like okay no let's make the withdrawal can you make that change and I think that uh definitely for the better but on that one I do have a question for the two client devs when it comes to like I don't say keeping people happy but whenever like people have requests of how to build staking are you always focused on the homesteaker are you always focused on Enterprise liquid staking pool there's often come into conflict like who are you keeping happy and who are you disappointing Paul I think Adrian expressed a little bit of that sentiment his previous one um uh it's it's different for everyone I think I can't speak for all the client devs I can't even speak for my entire team I can speak for myself um I like to prioritize the home Staker I think I think that's kind of the base instance if you know what I mean where kind of all other features are kind of supersets of that um and I also think it sticks with the ethereum ethos of decentralization as well um but so I would say that making decisions that put the home Staker in an uncomfortable position is probably almost always out of the question if it's if it's to benefit the institutional Staker uh but I would say the other scenario where if we need to benefit the homesteaker and it's gonna it's gonna cause troubles for the institutional Staker I would probably be more open to doing that just because I have more resources there's fewer of them um so ideally we always want to support everyone we don't want to just like you know do things to like to disadvantage institutional snakes just because we can but my personal preference is for the for the little guy yeah yeah I think a part of that and almost probably underlying that is that it tends to be ethereum that comes first and and those core principles so I has talked this morning was really good in terms of talking about some of those principles behind ethereum and and decentralization is a key part of that and so that's why I tend to agree with the homesaker tends to come first they don't have someone advocating for them and they're the most decentralized form of validation um so yeah it does mean that that there are sometimes those hard decisions that a lot of people would say you know it'd be really nice to stake with less eth or it'll be really nice to whatever it is and you look at it and go but that's really going to hurt the protocol like it's going to cause too much system requirements and hurt decentralization or it's whatever it is it's going to reduce security or so on um enable more capture of different things those kind of principles mean that we won't always make anyone happy um because it's actually about making ethereum work well and work well for the long term yeah to add to that from my experience uh the only one feature that uh was uh like for big operators uh and not for homesteakers was uh actually an advanced key management practices and like we talked about with Sigma Prime about that I think uh in before before it didn't made it to become chained like we'll start and that was like pretty unambiguous feature like I I don't remember like even one case where this interest was in in opposite right the if homesteakers can run the node like operate big operators can run the node and all we want is like good practice of key key management and for that the only thing that is needed is a good standard of uh remote signer so like remote sinus can be written up uh like coded up independently and that's the only feature that I can think of that is like not usually used by homesteakers but almost always used by big corporators so that's it I think yeah absolutely most of the decisions we have to make are good for everyone and it works out pretty well the the external signer is a really interesting one because it wound up with a niche it's been used by a number of systems including dap node to make it easy to swap clients so you put your keys into the external signer and it holds them and your slashing protection and then you can change your validator client and Beacon note all you like without ever moving your keys so homesteakers have wound up adopting this technology that was really first built for for the big staking providers and that's kind of cool yeah the one thing you're describing in terms of where the protocol was changed to favor the little the homesteakers versus the like Enterprises was probably with Mev boost and blinded Beacon blocks um this one you know is one that we're probably seeing a lot of people kind of giving out about now but I think a lot of people don't consider the counterfeit which was if these were plain text blocks Mev boost and might not be like given to homesteakers and the fear was that if they were excluded from Mev um it would like massively impact their reward and would massively harm them so you know we now have this world where people are giving out about like you know centralized relayer censoring and that was kind of the trade-off of going for the blinded blocks and stuff but yeah it's definitely a tricky one and I I sometimes am grateful that I can just ask tricky questions don't have to actually answer them most of the time um so the next thing I wanted to do a little was look a bit forward on kind of where we're going next in terms of withdrawals um so we talked a lot about like the like withdrawal credentials but we haven't really talked much about how it's going to happen you might say and I'm going to try and not ask like when withdrawals but can I ask um how do withdrawal spec has changed over the last six months we started with kind of a pull-based system and now we're at like push to Adrian Paulie do you want to like talk about why they swapped uh yeah I didn't follow it a whole lot um whilst whilst in in the previous uh pull method but I do know how the push method works now um and I think it is a lot simpler so the method that's going to happen now well not going to happen but it looks like it's going to happen um is a system where the beacon chain uh automatically without user input will scan through the validators and look for validators that are fully withdrawable withdrawn and then it'll just pull their eighth out and then put it on the the execution chain it'll also look for validators who have excess balance above 32f and then just pull that excess balance out and put on the execution chain so this is um kind of so it's it's an automatic process where uh you don't need to go and withdraw F you just kind of end up with money in the smart contract which I think is really really nice I think it's really good for users because um it means they're signing less weird messages I know anyone who runs a validator could probably um empathize but the idea of having to go and touch the keys on my validator client or do something with my validator client apart from just leaving it alone it's just terrifying and it's horrible so I think it's really good to be able to just like have it happen automatically um yeah there's gonna be I don't know if I so this there's going to be a complication though and it kind of it goes around these um two types of um withdrawal Keys we have so it's been mentioned there's a zero X zero zero Keys which is a BLS with throttle key um and then which was the like Adrian said we did that in the early days because we didn't know what we're going to do uh and then there's the 0x01 where we um don't have a BLS key we just have an ethereum address um so if you're on a Xerox zero one ethereum address then this automatic withdrawal system is gonna is just gonna work for you it's just like when the hard Fork happens you're gonna start getting some some fresh eth um but if you're with the BLS Keys what you're going to have to do is go and dig up your withdrawal keys from wherever you put it um and then you're going to need to use some sort of tooling um to sign a message um to say okay I'm now moving away from this BLS key that I'm proving that I have and I'm switching over to an ethereum address 0x0 one type and then the automatic withdrawals can kick in so yeah I think it's a shame that we have to do this we have to make I would say most users um go and sign this message um but I think it's unavoidable but then after that it'll all kind of happen automatically so knowing that that is very much in the pipeline and looking like it's going to happen where I know Lighthouse deciding to implement it I think techu is it lots of the clients are keen on it I would say if you're creating a new valid editor today I would be using 0x01 I would be using an F address I think it's gonna make your life a lot easier and I think just managing I think managing ethereum addresses is much easier than managing bail SKS just because we've already got tresors and everyone's familiar with it so yeah one really important point is that once you have switched to an ox01 key once you've got an ethereum address whether you started with it or whether you switch through this new system that's it you can't change it again um and there's concerns around that because if we want to change it but generally the reason you'd want to change it is because you've gone and lost the key to that or you've typed in the wrong address or something don't make that mistake it's like transferring money to that address right it's gone there is no way to get it back if you don't control the key because as we talked about before it's the withdrawal key that has to own the money so if you tell us that ox000 the null address owns your eth well now it does and you're not going to get it back and there's really very little we can do about that well there's nothing we can do about that for sure I think um we're going to see a lot of work and there's actually a talk by a test and just briefly beforehand where it's now that we can have like solidity contract addresses you can program your like change of ownership in there and not like at with some cryptography or any sort of like multi-sig or anything too weird yeah and that's absolutely a big part of the reason that we've gone with such a simple approach to withdrawals we don't need to do anything fancy on the consensus layer side because you've now got the full power of the evm um to to work with things and and have upgradable contracts or split contracts or all kinds of things there um that let you have this Behavior so think hard about what address you said is your withdrawal address I would say for most homesteakers it should be something like from your trace or you know your Hardware wallet that that is very safe and very secure and simple keep it simple you don't need to do anything fancy and then you know staking providers will use something that is a contract and probably upgradeable so they've got some control over it and then there's a range of people in the Middle where you you think about what your needs are and possibly use a very simple contract that could be upgraded but could also just kind of hold the funds and send them to you for sure yeah I think um the you've touched on one of the things that will show up over the next few years and this is the evm having more control over the consensus layer because as he pointed out right now you write an address and money will show up but like no code is going to execute and that's about it um how do you think that's going to change and what is the evm I don't know consensus layer API going to look like in three years time I'm really hoping it doesn't ever get a say um I'm really hoping this stays a one-way thing from the consensus layer pushing to the ethereum layer or to the to the execution layer um because it's dramatically simpler to get the evm to call out to the consensus layer is a big deal and a really big challenge we've kind of done it with deposits and it's the worst code in any any consensus client is tracking those deposits and we want to simplify it now we've merged um but there isn't a generic system for passing messages from the evm back to the can that census layer and it's a big deal to try and design it yeah definite rates but reads hopefully uh I hope that the consensus layer can start to push some information about itself into the evm so that you can you know do proofs that to Beacon State routes but I'm with Adrian um yeah I wouldn't get going the other way is it would be very painful for sure yeah definitely don't want to go the other way but uh as you said being able to read things about the consensus layer I think is going to become very important because one of the things that we look at with all of the liquid staking pools is for the last two years these were two totally separate chains and there was like no information passed even still post marriage there is still more or less no information being swapped but all of these pools more or less have oracles to say what's happening over in the consensus layer side and I want to take the chance maybe to talk to facility a little about about how does exits work for something like Lido because you guys are you know a liquid staking token and you're soon going to be able to offer Redemption for the first time but the Redemption queue is very bandwidth constrained so how does that work for Lido trying to allow people to exchange their sde for really at some point you know in the near future what's that going to look like yeah so um we haven't settled on the final design yet so what I'm talking about is the walk-in uh walk-in progress solution right um uh it's almost ready though for like presentation and voting in for photo Etc um but the gist of it the best solution we can do is to reflect the withdrawal queue in on the execution layer we like try like looked at multiple different approaches like calls uh auctions for uh for the like for the place in the queue um some kind of buffers for his roles etc etc and it told um I think is like strictly inferior to allowing people to place the like request to withdrawal and we put them in a queue on the beacon chain and this all happens and they get there there is Ross uh when they time in the queue passes so uh that's probably going to be it's pretty like it's pretty complicated uh because like there are multiple asynchronous processes happening like the withdrawal request the Oracle reports about what happens on the beacon chain like you said right we like the needs information what's happening in Beacon chain and we can't get in real time it's uh it's just impossible right so um Oracle requests and slashing side like we haven't had any uh you know lifetime Lido but like if it happens it's like 35 days process at least and somewhere in the middle it has an uncertain amount of slashing penalty which no one knows like until it happens how much it is going to be because it's like depends on the amount of Slash ones that like accumulated up to this point so when you combine all this asynchronous process and you need to like give people exactly the amount the uh like they they need to get uh it's becoming pretty complex protocol um button fire weather is just the same queue as uh on on consensus layer reflected execution layer as um like basically vouchers for for the place on the queue three um awesome yeah that makes a lot of sense and I think you're not going to be the only one that's going to have a lot of pain with these withdrawal cues very soon because everyone just thinks withdrawals known things withdrawal q and um that actually leads me a bit to the like balance skimming and this is another thing that Jimmer like fifth panelists is very like uh in favor of which is if you don't have any way to take the money above 32 ether that's accumulated all of the big um liquid staking protocols will just start to churn their validators take off the you know three either off the top and like set up a new one and the queues will be like perpetually full because you know why don't you just like go and like kind of skim and restake um can anyone tell me a bit about what you know skimming is going to look like because it's also changed a bit in the last few weeks yeah it's a it's a very similar process to what Paul described in terms of finding of scanning through the validators and just it it magically happens it's pushed from the consensus layer the the key thing is that there will be a limit to the number of validators we scan each Epoch to look for whether you've got money over that 32e that could be pushed to the execution layer the reason for that is that we've got to fit it into blocks and it's like another ethereum transaction that goes into a block but we're not charging gas for it it just happens and so we kind of have to have a rate limiting on it to make sure that we're not effectively just blowing up our block limit and and execution clients are able to process these these blocks in a reasonable amount of time so I think it's something like every two months we get around the validator set but I don't think the numbers are at all set so um yeah it's a those numbers in particular are going to go through some research and and seeing what the impact is on execution clients of this many or that many deposits um but it means that fairly regularly and it'll be in in that order of you know low number of months I think that we're aiming for generally fairly regularly whatever you've got over the 32 East gets swept to the execution layer so you start getting your rewards on top of the transaction rewards you're getting when you propose a block now gonna say I think um I think it's really good because the idea of a validator so a validator would say 33f exiting taking an F putting 32 back in is really bad for consensus clients because that extra validator slot um they they cost us we have to store that validator forever it's more in Ram um yeah it's really bad so so the ability to like for people to take their earnings without creating a new validator index is is really good for the protocol yeah there were certainly a lot of people Jim I think leading the charge being very vocal if you've got to have partial withdrawals before you know at the same time as withdrawals and you know as as core devs we try not to promise things until we're sure but I think all of us knew that was absolutely right and there was no way that we could could manage the impact on the chain of these churning validators if we didn't have partial withdrawals there is also an economic effect aspect of it uh if there were no scheming of rewards then um the B corporate like the the big State Controllers like protocols exchanges whales Etc they would get a lot of leg up against small stakers because they can afford to compound and small stickers can't like it's it's very hard to them so um yeah it's like it's very right move to uh make it like skim rewards a thing uh the the like the the slight drawback of this is working against the protocols uh that like stake in protocols because you can't really understand uh if the money you're getting on the result credentials comes from Rewards or comes from Once taking and you need to know that uh because like rewards you have to reduce you to stake us and unstaken is like something like someone was drawing something gone wrong or like ministration happened like you you need to uh um but it's anyway uh much better than the alternative yeah I'll also Echo the it makes much more sense from the compounding thing but someone trying to write like solidity to keep track of something you know don't know was this a very bad slashing or was this a skim so it is a bit tricky like that um I have just one more question before I go to the audience for a few so have a think of anything you want to ask the the panel here but um when the capella hard 4 comes in and we have this ox0 to ox1 upgrade how messy do you think it's going to be is it going to be over in two blocks and it's going to be 10 people is it going to be 50 000 validators I I suspect I mean probably the majority of validators on the network uh uh BLS credentials sort of will need to switch I don't think there'll be a huge rush um I think there'll be you know the initial burst and very likely what will happen is you will submit it and operation pools in clients will actually be full and it'll probably get dropped from the network and it just won't make it onto train at all and you'll need to submit it again so we'll kind of have to work through the the usability of that because if there is a big rush it's more than we'll keep in the memory pool basically um but I think generally it will be over time because people have got to get their withdrawal keys out it's something you should take your time and do safely and not rush in the first instant um and and once it's done it's over so it's it's fairly fairly one off yeah I think we'll have to think a lot about the tooling to easy people as well um I know the staking I was talking to Carl from The EF Kyle beak um and he was saying that it's likely that the staking deposit CLI tool will have the tooling to allow you to do it um and I think it'll be a little bit easier because it's taking deposit CLI now kind of like makes a bunch and then you need to put better at those um and that's kind of annoying in my opinion and I think what now that the apis have evolved hopefully what we can do with the staking deposit CLA will like you can just input your mnemonic and then tell it where a beacon node is or even a like a public node and then just have it publish it out to it like that so it'll be a little bit scary because you have to touch some crypto stuff but I'm hoping that it'll it'll be okay and I think that I think I'm Keen I know Adrian will be Keen as well to try and make it nice and smooth for people yeah and and I would expect there to be an offline option of that as well so you can generate a file of you know your your switch command the operation that you can then you know put on a USB stick take over to a hot thing and then send to a public Beacon node yeah you could probably upload it to the file to a web page or something like that yeah very likely and it's already pre-signed so it can't be changed it's not a it's not a risky thing it's just like you something you move up yeah my estimation is about 200 000 validators will like rotate as soon as humanly possible like safely possible uh the reason is like I know about Lido we have about 50 000 and every extra second is an extra risk uh on this on this credential we don't want to do that like uh we won't overload the network of course but like as soon as humanly possible we do it um it's it's very important and uh about I think like 150 200 Southern of operators are on BLS credentials uh that are managed by exchanges and this exchange they want to uh like to pay their rewards as soon as possible again and like convert it to liquid stake and derivatives for like custodial like coinbase doesn't CBS so um that's going to happen also very fast like the uh the protocols and custodian that uh uh aggregate users take they will and haven't rotated they will rotate like they will rotate as soon as possible because uh basically BLS 0x uh zero zero credentials are as useful as a potato uh the only thing you can do with them is like exit or rotate and like that's just not right yeah no I'm aligned there and I do think everyone will go and upgrade at like a relatively leisurely Pace um but the likes of the the lighters on the old ones and like I will block demons and they're on Oxo keys but the withdrawal keys are totally separate to the like hotkeys so I don't think there's bigger concern but I unfortunately do think and they've been people that have been posting on forums like admitting to this that they have their hotkey and they're like validating key on the same mnemonic and they left that on their like validator machine or something similar and that's been compromised and the problem is is you know I think there's at least 10 if not a bit more Jim has probably good data on it but um when capella goes live for those first couple blocks there will be an awful amount of Mev on the table for you know there'll be two people that can hook it up to a bot and just say like we need our transaction in first and we want to change this to like our Oxo lens to the other and I am of the opinion that I think it'll only be 10 minutes but I do think there'll be 10 minutes of 100 100 Mev blocks and stuff yeah it is purely first in best rest as well on that um there are proposals for you know a governance process to to select it and yeah I I can understand the concerns but it's not it's not the way it works if it's not your keys it's not your crypto and once someone else has your keys they have your crypto and it's really hard at 10 is sad but it's not um it's not structural it's not it's not that like it's terrible it's already here but 10 people and in 400 000. for sure yeah no I totally aligned there but yeah I do think it'll be a dramatic time and I'll breathe a lot easier if like two months after withdrawal if nothing major has gone on and no one who's compromised thousands of keys like shows up or something I I people ask me if I relaxed Jen I'm like no I'll be relaxed when withdrawals are finished I think yeah it's heartbreaking to to hear those stories when you're doing user support um for sure I'd like to open this up to the audience now with the last couple minutes um does anyone have any questions I see for now do we have microphones down there or do I have to hand mine out um thank you so much guys that was a really informative um for a homesteaker who might not be sure if their uh withdrawal keys are compromised or not uh what so what's the thing that you should watch um I'm guessing the switch that you're talking about from the BLS to the ZRX so that's uh they'll have to watch their some sort of a wallet I'm guessing Beacon chain the website like wherever there'll be different tools but like what are the steps that you should watch that to know that whether you're in control or you're not and what else can you do if at all anything um so for now you sit tight um but keep an eye on on the development and client releases uh there will be documentation around what you need to do to switch from the BLS keys to the Oxo one the youth address and you need to be in first so you'll want to know what that is those instructions are go through the process of creating you know an offline file and know how you'd upload it to your client probably the rest apis will be available ahead of time so practice it and it'll just go nowhere before the fork activates um and then be ready once the fork activates be the first to hit the button and send it in you can then check something like Beacon chain and see the validator and you should you can see the withdrawal credentials there and then you'll see which address it came up as and so once that switch happens um then your uh let's say you you did that then you're safe like after that the previous keys that you yeah so if you're if your mnemonic was stolen and it's used to derive your staking key as well you you have signing key I'd exit immediately as well right but focus on getting the ethernet address yeah the worst they can do is slash you once you can get withdrawals exit so they can't slash you either and get your money back and you can do a new validator then makes sense I'm always close to these cautious of these questions because I imagine that you're actually a hacker trying to figure out how to steal someone's out I'm sure you're a lovely guy but I'm on to you or it's the other way around where I'm scared of off you know foreign I think we're out of time yeah so so I I should can't thank us but um yeah thanks to everyone for being on this panel uh and thanks for everyone for listening it's been great fun [Applause] amazing thank you so much so in a few minutes we're going to have Dallas and Beyond Mimi Cree with Simona pop so so see you later foreign foreign [Music] how do you know [Music] hello everyone well now we're going to talk about those Arabia mimicry with Simona puap but [Applause] she does also have a PO app yeah that's what I was thinking I hope you have one um because I prepared this yesterday for selling point and because it was so tense I forgot all about it so um hi welcome um we're gonna chat about biomimicry and Dows because um I wish I had all the plans that I had yesterday at shelling point to kind of flank me because this is all going to be about that Vibe so um obviously we're all here we all love technology we all um love doing things very kind of well not always removed from nature but I think we tend to forget just how much experience Nature has in fact 3.8 billion years of kind of research and development when it comes to um being sustainable when it comes to being resilient when it comes to actually withstanding a hell of a lot of stuff and then sometimes we kind of you know we are humans we have a little bit of a touch of arrogance that we go actually we know better than that right well maybe we don't so biomimicry um for everybody who is just getting uh familiar with the concept or is hearing about it for the first time I'm sure there's a lot of people who are already really really into it like myself is the simulation of the models systems and elements of nature and how we may apply them to solving complex human problems because let's remember we are also part of Nature and part of the ecosystem that is the broader broader ecosystem not the ethereum one which is also part of the ecosystem so you know um so then by proxy just to kind of land this uh parallel with biodymium Korean Dao's is what are those there are these networks of humans organizing I mean you kind of know but this is you know it drives it home that actually complex flow networks in nature and Dows are really not that dissimilar and there's a big big correlation between them because this is a network and it does interact with each other with the different nodes that are part of it and it functions because of that so complex flow networks they exist everywhere right from the small to the broad in biology and we know this because we keep looking at things like mycelial networks and all of that but really they're everywhere right in every kind of ecosystem big and small and so from in these networks these connections between those nodes between the components and the interactions in the activities and states is what makes them function or not and thank you um and so similar to Dao's these interactions between cells organisms emerge from a predefined set of rules right and we saw earlier Dao's they are kind of connected because uh uh created upon a set of rules and then the decentralized process of self-organization because really there is no one unique cell that overrules them all right so that is in itself decentralization it's that interaction and those activities between those nodes and between those components that actually makes the system work and so here what we're really looking at in this kind of conversation of where by biomimicry endows might intersect might benefit um diodes douse from biomimicry is what complex flow networks feature that we can mimic and then how can we be great nodes in that Network right so you have the individual and you have the collective always it cannot be without each other because nature as we've seen 3.8 billion years kind of makes that clear um so the bio Network mimicry we have these clusters so nodes existing clusters and it's all about that inter cluster and cross cluster communication and as we know again from daos we definitely have to get that right because you know we're definitely in the process and yesterday we were talking about this shelling point in panels there's definitely work a lot of work to be done there right and we it's fine we're in the process of of hopefully getting it right plasticity this is very very important parts of the network react faster than others and that is okay you do not have to have the same speed of reaction the same speed of interaction between all of them and wanting to do that is just going to set you up for not failure but just like it's gonna be hard let's make things less hard for ourselves and then feedback loops so any deviation in balance in an ecosystem will be corrected by this feedback loop because it will always create this balance of the opposite response to get it back on track so that's the bio Network then the node mimicry uniqueness diversity breeds strength and resilience always remember that let's stop homogenizing everything and this is something that drives me crazy is that we keep wanting at the level that we're in now where we have done a lot of work and we've kind of made a lot of successful strides in our mission to make this a reality we get to this point where we want to get the uh corporate model and let's make it all fit in a tiny little box let's stop doing that that's not good coordination is everything connecting and collaborating with other nodes is key again in my mind authentic self-interest is increasing connection not competition coordination everything and then balance the strong and weak connections again it is okay that some nodes aren't as strongly connected to others and that's fine and making sure that we essentially enable the environment for that to be true is very very important for us to have a healthy a healthy Network a healthy ecosystem because balance is not a static condition so getting to this point where as we've seen keeping everything in let's say not in line but keeping everything within a good rapport with the other means this it is a constant Dynamic state made of adjustments we again in the Dao space it's okay to change things as we notice that things are not necessarily working or are not necessarily getting us to where we need to be we need to be in that motion we need to be in that engaged equilibrium to be very aware of what we're doing and what we're kind of balancing out and again speaking of balance and bringing it back to Nature this is what nature does naturally it has this window of optimum viability that exists in the middle of diversity AKA resilience interconnectivity and deficiency it's in the middle that the sweet spot is that's where it lies excess resilience of course gives us stagnation think of a forest which is too much nothing more can grow but efficiency extreme efficiency leads to collapse you're making things brittle when you make it too efficient think of a man plate like we re reforestation and then we plant things in neat little rows and then you light a match and it'll go all goes like versus a jungle you set a match it'll probably not Advance as far right why because there's diversity because they're tall and short and this and that and a variety of species what we do when we get to the diversity and all of that we go straight to efficiency completely bypassing the middle completely bypassing the balance think austerity that's what that is we have a crash we have like some sort of uh unstable situation we go we need to streamline this immediately because you know that's what we've always done well that is unnatural this is The Sweet Spot the window of optimum viability is in the middle so then what can we do with this Dynamic of okay nature is like that we're trying to build these things that are essentially hopefully going to replace a lot of what we have now and hopefully get us into a better place we have to emulate get that ethos of balance and of um diversity and efficiency sweet spot in the middle and then reconnect and the emphasis again is on learning and emulating these regenerative Solutions and hopefully translating them into this new economic system that we're trying to build because without it and without first unlearning actually learning yes but we first need to unlearn everything that we've kind of had drummed into us for so long that it has to be that way and there has to be this way and it has to be efficient and it has to cut out this and cut out that and cut out diversity and everything is homogenized we have to unlearn that and look into again what is always around us and what is always out there which is the balance which is the fact that diversity and uniqueness and collaboration and coordination are the things that make it run and we talk about sustainability so much yet again it's never going to work it's never going to work unless we understand that the way things are built is unnatural right now and we can do like gonna have all sorts of targets and whatever it's not going to happen and it starts with the monetary system but you know we're talking about desk um and then what I suggest that we take and learn and bring into the Dow ecosystem into our crypto complex flow Networks are patterns behaviors and habits this is one of the things and it's it's my view it doesn't mean that it's right but I think creating patterns behaviors and habits will help us have a baseline almost like a skeleton almost like a the flow of veins that we have in our bodies right have that Baseline that that we can build upon that and we can add flesh to it and we can like move at movement and add different environments or behave and adapt to different environments but I believe that this we should maybe have this Baseline skeleton because then what happens is we can start looking at things not from a perspective of let's how can we make this as efficient as possible but rather how can we make this move and exist in the healthiest way for the organism and what role does each node part play in its well-being because and this is Janine she uh you know she's the mother of biomimicry when we look at truly sustainable models the only one that has worked for so long is the natural world and I think again it's so easy to get carried away because we're constantly in this flow of more what we can do what can we do with more tooling yes let's put more Tooling in let's do this let's do this but why don't we just look and understand how maybe the information should flow who should it touch how should people interact with each other how should different clusters work streams whatever we want to call them how should they interact with each other should they have weak or strong connections is it okay that that one doesn't interact with the other and stop and move away from this pattern that has gotten us so used to and it is the corporate model that everything has to run exactly the same everybody has to behave exactly the same it is not a reality and it's not a natural state and that's the thing that maybe we can take pause and I always say this and I said it yesterday at trailing point that intention and setting that intention and figuring out how we approach this not from a streamline efficiency let's replicate the old stuff not fall into too much diversity because we saw that that causes stagnation Where is the Optimum window of viability when we talk about dials and what we're building and this doesn't just apply to Dallas it applies to the monetary system it applies to everything or the what we're proposing with uh replacing the current monetary model I even just pause and looking at what has worked and looking at what we can do is important in my view you may not agree that may be good um and that's it so I spoke really fast I've got like 10 minutes to go so if there are questions let me know yes how does it feel to be a good noun so I think I I mean it's it's great um so I think I think that mindfulness and being mindful I think that's where it all starts and I think again one of the well I already started telling you guys what annoys me so let's continue so one of the things that essentially irks me about a lot of people coming into this ecosystem now when we've seen this before during bull markets this what happens is that people come in without a sense of humility approaching something new and I remember when I got and when I got started what is it now five years whatever long ago I was so in awe of what the potential of this was that I wanted to be very mindful in doing anything putting anything out there or using this technology to do something meaningful and impactful and moving things towards something that is a better health for the ego ecosystem and for the world my intention was always how can this make things better and I think that intention is really really important because that will Define what you're aiming for what your uh what your project is aiming for how you influence it because again the agency with great response whatever with great power comes great responsibility and that is true the agency that we all have and the power that we all have that is very very powerful and having the right intention make sure that the communication is better make sure that you understand that that should not necessarily move like this or should not necessarily be based on patterns that existed before but rather on patterns that will make it better and keeping yourself in check on that all the time and I get it's so tiring to do that which is why so many people don't do that and why I'm so tired but it's a big thing to try to do that and that's an exercise and it's important and it's good to do that again in my view um any other questions so I have a yoga Dao and I have the vision of creating a wellness metaverse so we can have a global yoga studio for yoga and meditation teachers onboarding the yoga Community is not easy Under the Umbrella of pushing them into a web 3 space because they are reasonably Tech resistant any suggestions so this is comfortable actually so um we can sit in meditations so it's tough and and I understand it and I get it but then again I think It's So based on what we've been used to and the patterns of behaviors that we've almost been accustomed to because of the way it's being right and we also have okay let me let me start with a much more philosophical tidbit um any change involves loss people aren't afraid of change they're afraid of loss and going from what you're used to to something new involves you letting go of what was and that in itself and that will vary wild wildly and widely between people right and different people looking at things from different ways um you saying that reminds me of um one of my favorite projects and I remember it so well and I miss that um we did a cleanup in the Philippines at the end of 2018. and we onboarded a group of fishermens fish fishermen in Manila Bay onto mobile wallets at the end of 2018 and it was weird and it was hard and it was an interesting feat in educating from a baseline of we earn money this way but we could earn it like this and tap into a whole new pool of resource but we're a community that has done this for generations and now you're suggesting that we do this from a completely in a completely different way from a completely different angle but guess what some of those guys ended up doing other tasks and earning more crypto once they were onboarded it all just takes a little nudge and actually the super simple um solution for you is learning by doing is the best way give them something give them something to do and show them how much more it could do easiest thing proof concept show and tell the wisdom is so simple anyway but yeah give them something to do and show them figure out something very easy that they can do and then you know maybe they'll hate it but you'll know yeah anybody else yes uh so you've been talking about about information and communication um and a lot of the information for sustainability in nature is like sunlight and environmental like are there Predators around so what does that type of information look like for Dao's and how do we communicate it are you asking me who the sunshine endows is yeah you're looking at it um so I think but that's again something that you just map out right and it's okay that we don't know yet um I think to figure out how things flow and again how how things interact with each other is the mapping process right now we're at a stage where it's almost like we're defining and we're finding out what those things are and we're understanding what the relationships are because actually identifying what the elements are is always and most importantly followed by what the flow what the interactions are between them because like if you think of a lab and you do a culture of something right you want to grow some sort of bacteria or whatever it is that you want to grow you have to create an environment for it you have to create a soup of things for it to grow now if it doesn't grow it means that you messed up the soup the ingredients aren't in the right uh quantities they do not interact well with each other and they affect the organism and they make it grow misshapen or kill it identifying what the balance is of that soup is what we need and this is what we all need to figure out what that is what's the quantity of this what's the quantity of that how does that interact with that will they have like an explosive reaction or will they complement each other and that honestly that analogy of the lab is your the easiest thing to kind of wrap around and analogies are the best way to navigate all of this because otherwise you're like wait why how the hell are we gonna do this but it's that it's what are the ingredients and how they interact with each other is it going to be explosive and destructive or is it going to be nurturing and productive again in my opinion yes um so you gave the example of like my serial networks and um I think the closest parallel that we've created to that I think is like the internet um and if you look at mycelium and what kind of things it does in nature um the three main things like one is like uh information Communications like sending signals like stress signals between organisms and stuff like they get sent along these muscular networks uh and we kind of got that with the internet you know being this like Global Information Network um the second purpose is like Distributing like resources or like you know Carbon so trees a lot of the energy they get from photosynthesis actually goes back through the mycl networks to other organisms in exchange for something else so there's like a value exchange Network um through this mycl network and then we got that with ethereum um you know now we can have a Global Network of value exchange the third thing that my CL networks do that we haven't really like figured out or it hasn't like manifested in any way is like decomposition mycl networks are the way in which like things that die get decomposed in the nutrients of those things get like redeployed back into the system and that process is how nature is kind of like iterated and evolved and improved and how you know there's no concept of waste in nature waste is like a human invention um you know everything in nature kind of decomposes and gets recycled and reused so I'm wondering do you have any like ideas or thoughts on like what that could look like in Dallas and you know which bit the decompasses yeah like decomposition like if we did information distribution with internet and value distribution with ethereum what's the next thing that gets such a composition I'll try to give this for you because I have like 30 seconds 30 29 no um so I'll just count it down and not say anything but I think the easiest thing there is things don't make it they just don't not everything like it's in such a natural flow that some things will die and most things will die but what do you get the nutrient the learning that can be the nutrient that you take out of it and then in a new organism you apply that and you make it better and you make it more resilient and that's the evolution of it right because it learns what it's adapted to and what it does and how it then uses it to thrive and what killed that other organism may make this one Thrive because you're applying it in a different way and maybe you were just changing one small thing and it makes it like that soup in the lab you change one tiny thing and maybe then the organism thrives and the other thing that I was going to say about the internet and I know that I'm over time um is right now what we have with it with the Internet is that it is not intentional people have to participate in it right they have to in the beginning people wanted to now you have to and what that does is it removes responsibility from the equation and I was just at watching the Snowden keynote at the ZK house he said this if you're in a mall you don't really care about cleaning up after yourself you don't have that instinct of responsibility because you're there because you have to like shop for something or whatever and then you go away the agency and bringing back the agency to the people who make up the network who are the nodes maybe that's what helps also in the organism thriving so yeah that's it thanks everyone thank you so much Simona for sure there's a lot of stuff to figure out about human coordination but thank you I really like your point of view thank you so much so in a couple of minutes we are going to talk about the future of web 3 ux so see you in after four minutes thank you foreign [Music] giving me [Music] the ground [Music] [Applause] [Music] perfect so here we have Sasha tanasi whoo yeah she's going to share to us the future of web3 EX go ahead hello everyone that's not okay these are my speaker notes foreign ux designers here foreign hey guys how are you so we're having some technical issues just give me two minutes and we'll figure it out all right thank you for waiting we have Sasha here he's going to be a great talk so prepare yourselves [Music] is [Music] the ground [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] me for you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign okay so we can unplug we can unplug it you guys can yeah and I can read it from my laptop and I will use does that make sense okay perfect okay hello everyone we have encountered some issues but as designers and researchers we are accustomed to this basically we have iterated um so I am Sasha tanasev good to see so many new faces I am a product designer and the researcher I am one of the co-founders of the web 3ux user research panels and I am leading the ux design and ux research for the threshold Network which was formerly known as keep Network and new Cipher I am also part of the team who's building tbtc which is the first fully decentralized Bitcoin to ethereum bridge I like to say about my job that is to transform extremely complex products into palatable bits I've been designing for around 10 years now and um I've been in the ethereum space since 2018. my goal is to make explorative research part of all of the web 3 products yeah Okay so today's talk is about a new collaboration flow between designers developers and business developers it's a critique brought to the way things are currently handled we'll try to go together um over what could be the issues of the present building process how they affect the product life cycle and we will explore how might we collaborate better from the start and how to be more inclusive today's talk is an open conversation hopefully this subject will set the wheels in motion and I would be happy to hear any ideas suggestions on how we better the proposed approach okay so the future of Wave 3 ux why do we even talk about this is there an issue so anecdotally 70 of the user experience of a web 3 protocol ordap is dictated by the smart contract smart contracts are usually not upgradable so the experience should be Flawless from the start if you are not familiar with how this could be translated to then um the user experience in web 3 is made of the entire user flow and user Journey the number of transactions until the goal is reached which in web 2 e-commerce means the number of clicks the gas spent by the users and the displayed information so what is the current ux situation in web 3 the products are extremely complex and difficult and the development teams are more focused on solving the problems which are localized at the Smart contract um and there are many levels in between the smart contract and the user so this is what's happening the development team meets decides how to uh how the protocol or dap will work they write the smart contract um and afterwards they send it to the audit usually there are multiple audits done in average two to four and after the code has been audited and fixed it fixed the development team decides to bring the design to the table so basically design is brought when all the user Journeys all the user interactions all of the interaction experience has been set in stone and there is no way to go back at this point foreign so there is a tendency for technology to lead the product versus the other way around this means that there is a high likelihood of over engineering and unfortunately ux becomes the a byproduct tech people do not have the priority to put themselves in the user's shoes which is not really an issue unless the entire experience depends on them so this is the current flow and let's check what are the downsides of this flow so the teams are siled which means there is zero collaboration any findings from research design research that require redesigning the experience is impossible because the smart contract has been audited and fixed so there is no turning back design can improve the experience only by adding explanations and ux writing gimmicks design unfortunately can only cosmetize the product it cannot fundamentally improve the experience product building time is longer because everything is cascading and onboarding and retention of new web3 users is low due to the unfortunate and clunky experience and steep learning curve so we learned why most of the ux resides in the smart contract we learn the current situation in the ethereum product building and the issues of the current flow so how might we improve the state of web 3 ux so first of all we all need to be open-minded and flexible to replace our common behaviors this means stepping out of our comfort zones by changing this Beaten Track the deliverable the deliverable is the user-facing product not the technical not the smart contract not the back-end product so having a goal a Target to get to a desired ideal outcome is a great place to start from so this is not the product this is the product so let's try to find out about a different way of thinking first of all I would like to start from a process that has been proven to work very well this is the Double Diamond process the Double Diamond which was popularized by the British design Council in 2005. um this process is based on a diverge converge process developed by the linguist Bella vanity this methodology suggests that a product process should have four phases Discovery and definition which together make the explorative and Divergent phase and then development and delivery which together make the iterative and convergent phase so explorative design helps us do the right thing iterative design helps us do the thing right this is my Mantra and I think this should become everybody else's mantra so what could be a flow that respects the two important phases in a product development cycle and it can also respond to the web 3 environment needs so this is a product flow I am proposing that follows the explorative and iterative phases and which I believe with would definitely improve a lot the web 3 product development so what let's break it down so in the explorative Divergent phase everyone is brought to the table from the start design development and business a designer will facilitate stakeholder interviews and each team will map out their requirements the user needs technical constraints business goals they are all considered and taken into account user Journeys are created based on each team's insights and requirements evm constraints security issues user needs pain points kpis and business requirements all of these elements are Incorporated in a high-level user Journey map that will Mark each step a user needs to take in order to achieve their desired goal the user Journeys assumed needs and pain points are probed in explorative research by speaking to real people this is a very impactful moment in the process since we are moving from merely assuming things to actually spending time and observing the people who will in the end use our product so in this type of the process we're testing our ideas and this may be the moment in which we might need to Pivot we might find out that maybe this is not the way to go so afterwards all of the Unearthed insights and findings will be incorporated into the new user Journeys so research has been conducted assumptions have been probed findings had been Incorporated in the into the new user journey and all of the stakeholders have validated them now the interative phase can start so the new user journey is validated with the users and with the stakeholders on our are now becoming the backbone of the Project based on these documents and artifacts the development team and the design team can start working in parallel the design prototype and smart contract writing is a very important step in which the two teams will need to have constant check-ins and will need to accommodate each other's findings so basically the design team will test the Prototype will have some findings they will communicate them to the smart contract developers the smart contract developers will incorporate these findings into the smart contract and then they will find Solutions of course maybe some Technical Solutions will won't be necessarily perfectly answering to the new needs that have been discovered so they will also communicate these new issues and findings to the design team so there needs to be a constant back and forth in between these teams and there needs to be constant collaboration between the design team and the development team so the benefits of the proposed flow are the following the team is fully integrated and not siled there is constant collaboration and back and forth between the design team and the development team there are shorter building times and of course more time for research and testing so if this sounds like a good approach I invite you to adopt the methodology and adapt it to your organization we need to think of this proposal as a work in progress which will be shaped up by our experiences and needs let's consider this our explorative phase um if you plan to adopt this methodology and implement it in your organization please let me know what were your struggles which parts of the process worked and which didn't what did you have to do to adapt it to your own company needs what were the struggles or of challenging the status quo did you encounter any any resistance all in all I would love to hear from your experiences with this process because the goal is to evolve it into an adoptable adaptable and helpful process to the entire web 3 space so some great news from the threshold Network and the tbtc team my team was convinced about the benefits of this new methodology so it was decided to adopt it and implement it into our product development process starting 2023 and this means I will also share with you my experiences of adopting and adopting adapting the process um some thoughts of from my colleague Doug who is a great supporter of ux in our organization um he's talking about this methodology and he says there is no hoping and guessing only principled aligned movement that values the user Above All Else and some more good news um threshold network has open source its entire ux research and past ux studies you can find here user research guidelines all of the past studies that I've conducted for keep and threshold Network and different helpful artifacts never forget this love your users thank you [Applause] thank you Sasha amazing presentation so there's a few minutes left maybe somebody has questions yes I always have questions I how long would you expect this to take on average I understand it's an exploration by nature but do you have any Intuition or feeling for how long you would take an exploration versus iteration so you mean explorative phase what like okay so generative user research should take two three weeks at most which is not a lot and it's very easy to implement the findings afterwards so you need to start with this it can take even less than that but the most time that it takes is finding the the participants that are meeting the user profile that you're trying to to build for yeah so it doesn't add to the building process it's actually um it shortens it because you know what to build from the start and you know what people are needing and you know if your ideas are actually viable and I don't know responding to the market need yeah I have a question thank you basically on the face of integrating users what's your proposal for testnet versus mainnet of of inclusion of the users because we realize that when users are on testnet and we when we are on this kind of user testing the users as they are not integrating with real money or real assets their concerns are Way Beyond the when they are on my net but when you are on mainnet you should have already a functional solution that should work so what's your take on that so I think it's best to to do usability tests on testnet but try to make it as real as possible like what you're testing will be mirroring your product that you're deploying on mainnet and the thing is that if you're giving the users testnet tokens and everything and they will go to to the entire experience at some point they will forget that they are actually testing so you will get very good insights you will find what's fearful and scary for them because basically we are are designing for fear so I really I'm a big champion of testing on test Nets okay thank you yep yeah great presentation um is there generative research supposed to align with the Sprint cycles that a product team might have or is it something that goes like again like in parallel and doesn't have to match up with agile I think it it should be part of the Sprint cycle or it can be agnostic of the Sprint cycle so you would like start up a like a regenerative research campaign even if it's even if it's outside of the cycles of the product yeah yeah exactly I think it should be in parallel okay cool cool I have a question yeah I want to ask how do you reach out to the correct personas how we find them and how many different personas are you considering to make a research it's very difficult uh in my point of view so we don't have a huge pool of participants so first of all I think we should stick to the most important Persona that we have and then after you're building your user profile and you know who you want to build for then I think you should use a screener and also web3 ux which is our user research panel it actually started from this need and this hurdle that is very hard to find participants so yeah screeners and then a pool where these people are and try to invite them can't wait to talk about this more after the con okay sure amazing thank you so much Sasha thank you [Applause] so enough in around five minutes we're going to have Smart transactions with blood some fears so see you in a couple of minutes [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] from here [Music] hey so Vlad Samir some beers here and he is going to talk about the smart transactions [Applause] foreign yeah I'm going to talk oh there we go great oh yeah hey guys sorry about the weight I just uh in here hi all right oh great thank you so today I'm going to share some exciting research that I've been doing I don't know for the greater part of the last six months eight months nine months I don't know most of this year not not that this is the only research I've done is just the most exciting stuff the stuff that I want to blow your mind with right now so I had to cut out a lot of content from The Talk so I'm going to try to go through it quickly add it back in without slides because I don't think I'm gonna make it let me just take out my notes just in case I get there and then I need a refresher all right hey everyone so smart transactions sounds great it is a prophecy of a new paradigm it's basically a prophecy because it's not something like I decided I'm not like imposing this on you guys I'm like making a prediction that you're going to agree with me is like sort of a sound prediction and then the only thing that might be imposing is accelerating the timeline which is sort of maybe my fault if I'm accelerating it but it's not my fault it's going to happen this wasn't me it's like a pair I'm like the prophet here it's I didn't do it so here's the prophecy basically ethereum transactions will become smart which means yeah they're already programmable network but they're going to become context aware in this way that's like characteristic of smart products that like sort of like you should you know you go you walk beside them and then they start like breathing and like knowing what you're about to do and you know they sort of like act smart um in a way that's sort of more than just programmable network but actually like they're they're reactive to their context um and basically that means sort of over their actual impossible Futures in this context and also over their uh over like this this their context and we'll get into that a little more detail but like today relatively speaking I'm gonna say that transactions are dominant blind basically transactions today are not smart and they will become smart uh in the sense of like smart products which is like a kind of a kind of research in product design where you try to make products like yeah programmable networked and reactive to their context in order to you know in order that they act right depending on what's Happening to them actually so basically ethereum is and has always already been uh profoundly disrupted by unexpected semantics of Lee VM like solidity and the re-entracy or like just all sorts of weird quirks you know it takes a lot of time to become a facility developer because of the weird ways that ethereum behaves that you wouldn't think and basically this has come to a real real head now with Mev where sort of it's much very much not the expected transaction semantics it sort of like it ends up being like the worst possible semantics that could be interpreted for that transaction and sort of it ends up being kind of worst case execution reintermediation censorship literally and this is actually putting all blockchain communities into crisis into like a deep constitutional crisis so like what is a blockchain even like what is a transaction what does it mean what does this transaction mean because like all the different possible ways it could be executed in different contexts um and so especially what does it mean if it's not just sort of included in a block in this sort of natural simple way that we were taught in the white paper and like all the white papers even so basically transactions faced an evolutionary pressure due to these changing circumstances and they're basically like in fact de facto changing semantics even though in some abstract computer science sense like oh unless there's a new unless there's a change to ethereum and their semantics aren't changing actually when people when the transaction pool changes when the way people order them and blocks changes it changes in fact the transaction semantics and so and they're going to become aware basically at first slowly and then and then a lot and any of these search awareness basically we'll start and it's starting out as a sort of really minor uh little hacks and it's going to become sort of much more much more aware so basically today you know you might pay out Nev in a favorable outcome in the future you'll be much more actively and much less packively interacting with the search in order to get better performance and sort of a better even understanding of how your transaction is being treated during the transactions are on validation so that was the prophecy basically like because this same pressure by Mev transaction is going to become smart the semantics are going to be totally different than what we recognize today because basically um well I mean I'll get i'll get to exactly like how and why that's like a secured prophecy and not like a speculation so let's talk about the past like how did we get here so we have this um this Dark Forest basically we have uh I call them ethereal predators in the dark Forest because you don't always really know what happened in how this all went down um worst case performance freak liquidation is stolen Arbitrage hijacked hacks it's the stuff that we love to read about um but also stuff that really hurts people when they transact financially and just in terms of like imagine you're trying to like be a white hat hacker and then like your white hat hacking gets hacked by some like front running about it's sort of dark um and basically transactions went into hiding because of this they avoid the mempool they use trusted Searchers they basically try to eliminate their meth in order to avoid this this this treatment and this is like what I consider to be sort of dumb Behavior I mean it's a little bit smarter than getting wrecked right away but it it could be a lot smarter really um so you know we have also this concept of good Mev not all Mev is bad right um and I think this originated with Mev tips in bundles but I wasn't around so someone could correct me later that's great um and you know so that's sort of distributed power from the the sort of big bad minor who was supposed to take all the Mev two Searchers who are supposed to be like sort of the good guys protecting your transactions and giving them the ability to influence the block outcome without just sort of this pure extractive politics more like you know we pay for the thing to win as long as we win the auction you know and we're providing a good bundle that's that's good and then there's also this sort of really really I mean nascent kind of good map which is like the saving and out of gas exceptions which is sort of like a really classic thing that like Mev was sort of built for from the start we're basically like sort of the space really was for Traders who were getting wrecked in this uh gas price auction and so the gas production became Mev and then there was a good mad Mev as people sort of you know exploited and also try to defend themselves and use it as a sort of lever um and basically um you know I really have to power through here so basically you know I I sort of um picked up on this research um this this year right I read again got into the AV space basically when I realized that there's this thing called Mev time which is like sort of the time when the surge is happening when the time when the search for this like bundle or block is happening where you can actually interact with ethereum transactions in a sort of on conventional way uh basically rather than sort of only having um you know interactions with transactions you can actually interact as the Searcher with the transactions directly basically by you know the Searchers have been adding their own transactions to bundles and interacting with them to like sort of take our profits in the normal way um but sort of to directly interface with them via like an i o interface where you just like load values and they read values um it really opens up the ethereum transactions to a credible sort of semantics by basically letting you interrupt transaction flow do some stuff and then continue transaction flow as the Searcher in a way where you can sort of update Oracle values many times within the trace of a transaction you can do all sorts of operations in the middle of a transaction and sort of in some way violating atomicity but in some way it's not because ultimately you still have the same you know bundle of transactions just that the bundle was set up in a way where the earlier transactions are put in as a function of like what happened in the middle of the other ones so it sort of really just the Mev time interaction with transactions really opens up non-deterministic semantics of the evm now instead of having like you just literally have the evm choose arbitrarily and then like your the Searcher tells you what you chose and they have like an incentive if you tip them good to choose the right thing and that actually um not just lets you take advantage of these Magic not deterministic choices but lets you have more information in the transaction than you than you could before you literally just give them anything with like an oracle at any view time during the middle of their transaction execution and so this is actually [Music] um a tremendous uh change but however it's not really secure today because of the way that like bundles and like transactions can be reordered out of the search result that you find so you imagine you like search for this amazing interaction with the smart contracts sorry with the smart transactions uh excuse me oh um and then and then someone else Jacks it and changes uses different input values for the same transactions and then you sort of get wrecked on your execution um you know basically like the search is not secure that means that these Mev time interactions are not secure um but if they can be secured actually um uh basically anything a Searcher knows can be given to the transaction and they can use it they can become aware of not just their execution on this Trace but all the other counter factual timelines they have many possible presence Futures and pasts because that's sort of like what transactions are like before they're included in a block and finally actualize so basically you know um we have sort of with MVD time interactions you can transactions can become aware of like sort of this superposition of different possibilities and counter factual traces that end up being very very useful um and then and basically um we need these we need these searches to be secure basically like I was saying earlier and so basically I did a lot of research as a result into securing this this Mev search like how do we secure the search results so that it can't get checked that the transaction receipts can't change after you've sort of like finished the search like those are the ones and they can't change um thankfully I'm like happy to announce that I did succeed not sharing the solution I'll share an online um and therefore and therefore I could make this prophecy very very comfortably because basically if it's competitive enough viability is inevitability um basically like it's like strictly dominant over over dumb transactions it's possible we can do it and it's going to happen because like the the competitive pressure is too great uh and so this is sort of this argument I like to say underwrites my prophecy um sort of signs off on it um and and basically it's sort of you have to take it for granted or you have to believe me that I can secure the search but if I can secure the search I can do this Mev time interaction I can inform the transactions of anything basically and then they can sort of do this crazy stuff of like lots of like wild magic which we'll get to very soon so what is the state of the art in smart transactions today well this is sort of a state of the art in my tech research the economics and law and like other research has been sort of uh there's not enough time for for all of it unfortunately um so basically smart transaction infrastructure is basically a story of store transactions like pulling themselves up by the bootstraps using a little bit of awareness to get a little more awareness to try to get sort of you know uh through a very secure basis a lot of awareness for the transactions and so I split it up into phases that are designed to be sort of acceptable to our current normal trust model at first and then deviate a little bit only as necessary and then come back so that like it's a minimally politically objective objectionable for everyone so basically in phase one we save gas in this very classic way of like not doing those pesky out of gas transactions save one and it's phase one sorry um we we have semi-automacy which means like you can execute the prefix of a bundle you can't choose the suffix or like anything that isn't a prefix so it's like not not admissible you sort of I can restrict using the evm's rules only sort of that you can only do a prefix I'm using this thing I call cumulative validation it's sort of like a you know it's going to invalidate it if anything else invalidate it and also it's cumulative Mev to sort of like say stores up the map and then pays it only at the end of the bundle kind of kind of story phase two is the interesting one that deviates from like the current trust model that people have which is basically I'm saying like oh you know we actually need to like essential it's essential that we trust the proposal for a moment just for a moment just for like this phase two we trust the proposer and then in phrase three we remove the trust from the proposal by sort of locking down their commitments making it making them like unable to screw us so basically in phase two we sort of normally are very uncomfortable with because like the whole movie space has been set up to defend you against the search against the proposer but I insist it's necessary there's no way to do bundle protection without this if you try to do it without the proposal you won't be able to do it the proposal is so important he's either they're they're the they're the signature on the Block they make it a block you can't make a block without the stake validator it's just not a thing like they're important for building the block there's no such thing as a block Builder it's not a proposer no offense I'm sorry I wasn't even supposed to say that I take it back um basically the today we sort of had this idea we don't trust the proposal but we really got it we really got to in order to get out of my City full of atomicity and then we can lock it down and not trust them anymore in the next phase and then after we have the the atomicity of these of these search results basically and like sort of like the guaranteed like full inclusion of them fully or whatever um then we can open it up to basically all source of smart contract development all right sorry oh again oh smart transaction development virtual and the virtual Services was a very cool concept of sort of to the Mev server they're just extracting value from you to you you're getting a service from them but sort of like they're not a real service provider they're just they're extracting value from you from their perspective review for any perspective you're sort of hijacking that in the way that like for example like fruit hijack uh fruit eating animals in order to spread their seed as an example so here's um some more Tech City art stuff so this is an example of uh formal semantics of what I call Smart transitions so smart transitions is sort of like a idea that comes from Smart transactions it sort of generalizes it to like all sorts of different computer science um this is like a system for describing distributed systems that I'm doing all this notation in there's going to be a paper release about this should have been today but it's gonna be like tomorrow or maybe the next day like latest um so like look out for this it's going to be it's going to help you understand this but basically we have like a a labeled State transition message production system V and then I could Define another one or which has at least Special Operations duplicate speculate and validate which is going to do basically a speculative execution of this other system in order to see in the future whether the thing that happened was supposed to happen and then validate basically the current transition based on like what happens many transitions down in the future sort of violating normal transition semantics in a very very interesting way which I call Smart um and basically the the idea is like they can sort of look into the future but in general um you know far and wide all over the place so basically here's like the transitions so let's just like go through them quickly duplicate takes a state creates two copies of the state if you try to duplicate an already duplicated state it does nothing uh speculate basically it only works on duplicated States otherwise it does nothing this when it's on its own is on a duplicated State what it'll do is it'll apply the transition with this label L and this message m to the second state so the original state is left untouched and the second state is updated to the new state and then it outputs like a message in this like little temporary buffer zone um from that transition and so like it collects these messages and updates the state while it's speculating and then you can do a validate transition which will either do one or two things one of them is it'll it'll delete the speculative execution state or it'll delete the current like current state like the old State and so then when you do this validate step it's like a few transitions later at least one transition later and then based on the validity of that transition you sort of either revert all the previous transitions or you sort of choose them you sort of collapse this superposition of like the old State and the new state you just get the new state so this sort of is a speculative execution transition system based on like a one transition and basically the amazing thing about this is that you can sort of implement ethereum out of gas semantics sort of like just with this basically you charge an account gas you do a bunch of execution speculatively thinking they won't run out of gas if they run out of gas you throw out all those changes you go back to that just after the charge state and sort of you can use this as like justify actually that ethereum transactions are already sort of smart just with respect to the out of gas exception that is that the block is aware of on the sort of block limit uh transaction uh limit sort of uh um level I mean the block I mean it might be the validator or something you know and so basically but this idea of like validating based on what happens in the future uh sort of it could be done much much more widely than just out of gas you can just sort of refine those validity checks to add whatever constraints you want um you know you could you could have you know more than this amount of men of like better than this performance as you revert Etc and the nice thing about this is sort of okay that was one specular execution but we do the same thing where we do many many many specular executions where and then this could sort of very well encode uh at any research where basically you're just trying a lot of different possibilities and then you can validate based on the whole search whether you'll do any of those Transitions and which one you'll do and that's sort of like extremely powerful semantics um but that's just looking forward I mean like in this stuff really could look back and a different alternative presence either also which is sort of it's sort of a trip and sort of really really helped me get intuition for quantum mechanics randomly um anyways so use cases challenges and implications there's there's stuff from the slides I haven't read I'm trying to really rush through this um but some of it is going to come back up now I realize so basically there's a bunch of stuff that's used before first I'm going to stress again the infrastructure and the way that it's pulling Yourself by the blue structure bootstraps by like using transactions to make transaction infrastructure um and then also all all blockchain use cases I'm trying to say this is this is like totally dominant Paradigm um or basically like no matter what you think of you can do more efficiently with smart transactions except for maybe a simple send Maybe Jerry's out it's probably more efficient with more transactions anyways um but it's gonna be more like a smart smart operation or something like that so basically long story short or I mean here's a bunch of here's what it says oh you know we have these Access Control lists that don't really work because like you sort of might get outside of them and then you still have to see the transaction and then you just get it you just get less of a discount if it doesn't work it's like sort of a weird hack it'd be nice and we can do this to have access control lists that actually work without having to do any code analysis to prove that they work you just sort of try it and if it doesn't work it's great validation was amazing um we can save gas and pay without you this is sort of like classic stuff for Mev but the way that it's done in smart transactions is a little more Capital efficient maybe a lot more Capital efficient in some cases um rent as expected Mev to justify stated Ram this is sort of interesting thing we have like long problem in ethereum about State rent and statelessness and how people have the state why will they know to how will they validate my transaction like now like how will they search it and the answer is like oh if you have enough if they expect enough men have they they'll store it and they'll speculate on that in all sorts of ways maybe they'll even do it in a way that's sort of like public value as opposed to internalized value and so basically um rent actually comes in through the back door not through smart transactions but like Med in general but I think smart transactions in particular because sort of they can be metal they can be rent aware in a way that's sort of like a function of what is happening on the searcher's realm and what the serger's policy is for what they choose to put in their Ram and so it could be like sort of very specific um and very flexible compared to like all the men all the red proposals so far automated collective bargaining pretty cool right you have a bunch of transactions with a bunch of people in your little Union and you decide hey we're not going to transact unless we're all treated good very very good very very good stuff you know we'll get that we'll we'll get those beasts from the Dark Forest get our meth back um um direct economic interventions at all scales is very very cool you can basically use macro statistics micro statistics meso statistics and like just pay for those outcomes in a sort of very direct way that's sort of lacking today in like public policy or basically like helicopter Ben has a really hard time dropping money on people um but like sort of we see all the transactions on all the timelines like collapsed into one and sort of like can pay the Searchers to for whatever policy goal we want it's amazing um just in time liquidity pools it's pretty cool imagine the liquidity follows the different trades within your transaction around just to serve you better amazing can happen today because of the transaction uh timing and the operation timing doesn't allow for it um zero Capital zero credit trading this is very cool where you can do time travel to borrow profits from the future to do your trade now you wouldn't think but totally possible in ethereum today already um uh but just within the scope of a single transaction in the future it'll be across many transactions because you know an atomic block happens all at the same time which means at the end of the block have the same as the time as the start of the block which means you can sort of borrow the profit from the end of the block at the start of the block and sort of have it all work out amazing amazing um you can hedge quote unquote using exactly the cost that are incurred at the end of the block it's not even really hedging because you know for sure the cost it's like the most efficient it could possibly be for certain instruments and lots of other stuff but we have challenges still unfortunately unfortunately this can be very very computationally expensive simultaneously searching for all these Solutions at the same time for all these transactions especially if everyone's demanding them you know there's a lot of them uh it could be very hard who knows how the complexity grows in the search transactions depends on what they're doing I could definitely design smart transactions that do really bad um for the Searchers and they basically don't have Solutions the more you add to them like you know they might have a solution subtractively or a few but then like the big goes so bad like you add 10 more and then just you can't solve them anymore and this is why this dos and gas Insurance Market is so important because like you kind of need they need to figure out like is this a Dos attack is this a legitimate smart transaction is it something that is going to have a solution or is it something that's we're wasting our search on in order because um it just computationally very difficult to find all these Solutions also you know I mentioned all these counterfactual stats and claims and things sir the Searcher knows that but like why should your transaction trust the Searcher to give it the right values like there are sort of like challenge challenges with respect to verifying um these these inputs um especially efficiently um and then there's a multi-block issue which is like actually we wouldn't we don't want in some way transactions should like end in one block to finish to just finish validating everything you want to block it's sort of very nice to have multi-block transactions and to do this efficiently is a challenge especially composed with all the other search so rather than all the searches being sort of like this block imagine if you have searches on different timelines um sort of uh for different transactions that are executed in different timelines so and also there's a whole search organization problem around this like how do you organize the Searchers actually so basically but like very very interestingly that this sort of has actually a lot of implications beyond the sort of birthplace of these transactions as sort of you know this Mev space where basically you know you're responding to this meta search uh because actually like the smart transaction validation is sort of very wide it doesn't need to be validate anything to do with map and this sort of useful industry the systems in a broad way is in transactional systems in our very broad way and so I see smart transactions are sort of not just Mev Mev is sort of you know like an economic thing it's like only one side of the story they also have really amazing computer science Innovations not that the economic stuff isn't great I mean the risk management customer transactions do like that hedging that I was talking about earlier amazing basically can really really make things much more economically efficient and then sort of like um legally if you will it's very low liability to hire quote unquote uh or to be a virtual service provider because you're not a real Source writer and and so you're just extracting money you're just being sort of a selfish maximizer which means that you're limited in liability so basically unfortunately out of time this is my concluding slide and they're missing a will there or no they do they do actually revolutionize now ethereum is transactional semantics and sort of like that's like sort of um you know the prophecy and like sort of like the fact in the future which is sort of like I guess what a prophecy should do thank you so much everyone really appreciate it I have more I have more come see me later thank you so much Vlad sadly there's no more time for questions but I'm sure he's going to answer a all your questions over here um yeah outside the outside yeah outside thank you pictures so uh next we're going to have a great panel about Latin America about how Latin American cities are using blockchain to to bring solutions to their problems so this panel is going to be in Spanish but there's some translator supplies over there so you can go and pick one up so you can understand it or try and learn Spanish as well for sure so see you in three minutes [Music] I love you losing control tonight

[Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] hello again hi Well for now we're going to have three F quick talks flash talks uh so now we're going to have five defcons in literally five minutes with Thomas Barker [Music] [Applause] right is this thing on great well I hope you're ready for this talk um I'm certainly not this is usually this is usually a speech that I give half drunk in a bar somewhere to a potential Consulting client um I'm hoping it'll work here as well so five day cons in five minutes why am I qualified to give this talk I'm not very prominent I have to accomplished any great thing but I have been to almost every Devcon except the one that was in Gavin Woods living room so you can see here proof of t-shirts um I did think the obvious thing of just like stripping through them on stage that idea did not survive beta testing you you wouldn't appreciate that so um as with everything in the short story I'm going to impose a narrative arc on what I'm doing so this is as much perception my perception as in reality but I would see that they have gone softly going like this nerds met Bitcoin that was the very beginning within a grown-up technology very respectable we were rich and Fabulous As I remember 2017. it's not a point of Honor but it was fun followed by cry and build I would describe that stage as but it's still a time when a lot of progress was made and then people discovering Society so uh Devcon one was really small it was basically the size of this room except reasonably full um it had one line for coffee that was the only catering that we had um Casper proof of stake was first mooted here um a lot of stuff was said about the benefits of smart contracts and they had a sort of nice academic feel um the Dow was proposed there I think in the side events um and ethereum was denial of service attacks um you'll notice a theme on there and here is an example slide you can see it was a very very nice Hall Dev Contour is my favorite Devcon um because I seemed artificially cool because Shanghai is a confusing and artificial and scary environment and I'd already been there five or six times before so I looked like I knew what I was doing this is when it really became respectable IBM was there people had stalls people from Chinese local government showed up it was great um for very obvious reasons um Safety and Security were big things formal methods came in um it was still very much bring your own nightlife people just hung around the hotel or said they were going to certain bars vitalik was in I think the sheep's head Pub it translated to quite often um and it was it was it was very small you could just go up and talk to Joseph Levine it was very communal um ethereum classic were there if you want that story get me a beer later um the Dow was informally postmortem quite a bit um and in accordance with what was then tradition ethereum was denial of service attacked in the middle of the event um but it was a lot of fun as you can see and the catering was good it's also where uh Pookie boo bars string game started uh which had been a constant feature I'm not sure if he's doing them these years but if you see people with just bits of string and sticks Stars bits of uh strings I've stuck themselves that's because of him Devcon three if I want to leave you with one image from this talk um my timer stopped that's probably good um if only one image of this talk um it's me on a pontoon that's a golf club it's a party like for two hours without figuring out who is actually paying for it talking about mortgage security as well being brought whiskey everything was going to be great there were lots of people used to work in multi-level marketing the corporates were a bit more quiet a lot of stuff was focused on the use cases there are also a lot of zero knowledge of um side events um dexters came along um it was all pretty good Prague the money went away but there were lots of developer tools and Prague is great the beer was excellent um it's probably the first time I felt that we had proper tooling for what we were doing um so on the whole there were a lot of paper lies everywhere and blockchain's LLC was quite an event um there was a huge haul with this girl as a hologram I still don't know who she is how am I doing for time okay two minutes good I'm okay um Osaka I think Osaka was a point where actually the money hadn't quite come back but if anything that was a good thing a lot of people looked at ethereum 2.0 um there's a lot of talk about crypto law and that was actually something people starting to think about you know Society law the general world that was good ERC 721 came along foreshadowing the nft Boom a generalization of crypto kitties which is previously we needed these things you had to refer them as something kitties I did climate kitties for carbon credits at one point and uh Ava and Libra came along which was cool and Japan is generally beautiful um I skived off a lot to go to the castle and stuff like that Devcon Bogota is of course whatever we make of it um everything is still to be announced even the beer the coffee has been very good so far you'll notice I comment on that a bit and here are many thanks to people on Twitter who help me with things um the pictures you see that are um not mine are from them and you can see that in the speaker notes which I think will go up online I'll redact them in a minute um and here are some really good articles about things that went on there that I would very much suggest if you enjoyed this talk thank you very much [Applause] thank you so much Thomas like this this is fantastic because this is my first time in Devcon I don't know if for the same to you but for me it is so so yeah like in two minutes we're going to have the next the next style that is going to be about UNICEF okay okay so hey let's say hi to Sana that she's coming here right now thank you okay thank you so much hi everyone my name is Sana bedi and I'm here from the UNICEF Venture fund team to share with you a little about what we're doing with our crypto funds as well as our blockchain Explorations um and how that's doing at UNICEF uh so far so journey to get started um as we're confronted with new realities uh on how technology as well as how digital Solutions can impact the lives of children what we're really seeing is still half the world is not connected to the internet oops what we're also seeing is that when digital Solutions do exist in the digital solutions that we find in the market are not necessarily always built to solve critical challenges that are addressing children and their communities and and that that does become a little bit problematic also because when these when these Solutions are developing and when we are seeing digital uh platforms we developed we're seeing that many times they're at the expense uh of the most marginalized their voices are not heard their data is not reflected in the systems and they're they're essentially getting more and more left out in how developing in how digital Solutions are being developed and also when we do see digital Solutions exist so when we're seeing the right digital Solutions be present many a times they're blocked uh behind proprietary Tech which makes these Solutions more and more inaccessible uh leaving them behind and leaving them uh with not getting access to what they should be and so that's really what we at UNICEF are trying to solve we're trying to see that there is this missing Gap there is this Gap where uh Solutions can be made more accessible Services can be made more accessible and we're doing that by three things by piloting and developing solutions that are more accessible by ensuring that we're investing in entrepreneurs as well as in problem solvers that are often overlooked and third by driving Venture Capital to markets that don't see enough of such funding and so uh at the UNICEF Venture fund we really invest in early stage Frontier Technology Solutions and we do this to accelerate innovations that we see as promising for the lives of children and then what we really aim to do is invest in destructive Tech because we think that that's the intersection of technology that can impact a large number of lives and so our team at the ventures office at the office of innovation uh in UNICEF really looks at tracking emerging Trends and identifying new areas of exploration where UNICEF can make a mark and we do this by investing in Virtual and augmented reality drones blockchain of course artificial intelligence and data science uh here so here you'll see a map which has got to date we've made 124 Investments across 74 countries uh the pink dots in the map really represent the female Founders that we've invested in so 43 of our portfolio is actually female-led companies and as I mentioned the goal is to invest in these early State Solutions and make them fundamental open source platforms so the little uh check marks that you see are certified digital Solutions we have currently 11 of these in our portfolio and to do this we provide startups with funding in two ways the first is through our seed funding so that's a hundred thousand dollars the second is through our growth fund promising Solutions have the opportunity to get additional funding up to four hundred thousand dollars and companies are able to receive this investment in both Fiat as well as cryptocurrency and in its current firm we provide investment in ether as well as Bitcoin and of course the companies receive a one-year uh you know mentorship and ex Tech expertise guidance over a one year period and the funds investment thesis really then is looking at two main approaches the first is to invest in solutions that can directly impact the lives of children room son is one such company and you'll be hearing from the founder more tomorrow as well they've actually developed a digital cash and voucher assistance management system and they will be providing cash transfers with our country office to 1500 families in remote Nepal the second sort of investment thesis we have is that to invest in Solutions um that are really core infrastructure uh and statweek a company from India blockchain based solution is one such example they've really developed a end-to-end supply chain tracking system and with UNICEF the use case was really focused on tracking vaccines all the way from manufacturers to Consumers but they're now using the same platform to be able to track agricultural produce for the Indian government and so we're really seeing that our portfolio which is 124 Investments uh has been able to reach 31 million beneficiaries we're also seeing that fund companies have been able to raise 27 million dollars in additional follow-on funding after receiving that initial investment from the fund eight percent of our portfolio also made successful exits so what we're really seeing is while fund companies are being able to position themselves as key leaders in making social impact they're also being able to develop financially Sustainable Solutions which are you know positioned as open source Financial platforms and that's what comes to what makes the fund model unique we invest in local Solutions because we believe local Solutions are the best way to solve local problems we're seeing that our companies are driving private Capital to uh innovating for children as I mentioned eighty percent of the companies generating Revenue 70 million 17 million has been raised in follow-on funding just by the startup portfolio the 43 of our female-led companies less Venture Capital goes to women and we're happy with the 43 but we're really striving to get to a 50 gender balance uh we also have then the most important crypto fund it is still the only uh and the first crypto mechanism in the United Nations system where we're able to accept hold and disperse cryptocurrency uh through the fund to our startups and finally everything that we invest in is open source uh and that's because we believe open source is more scalable more adaptable and more accessible so the crypto fund was actually launched exactly three years ago at Devcon in 2019 with the long-standing uh of course the long-standing commitment and bold partnership with the ethereum foundation that made it possible we're now coming to what is the end of the Prototype period so it was a three-year prototype launch uh and we're really hoping to institutionalize operations from the crypto fund so that we're able to continue making uh and bringing these results that we've got so the crypto fund was launched as really a mechanism to help UNICEF build its institutional muscle memory on how to operate in crypto but also on preparing for digitally Finance future and we're really seeing that we've actually been able to come against uh and show results against the initial sort of indicators that we set up for ourselves we're seeing that a hundred percent of our transactions are transparent uh and can be tracked we're seeing uh also that we're able to make those transfers in a very less period of time and also spending less than a percent on transaction fees and so we've seen that 35 uh Investments that we've made in the past three years were companies that actually received investment in crypto and where hearing of course a lot on the benefits from this from the startups themselves as well on how they've actually benefited in terms of just financial reporting in terms of ease of transparency as well as just hiring the very best talent across uh across the world and so we will be also announcing a new uh cohort of Investments that will be receiving a crypto crypto funding later this month I'm also happy to announce that we have with us ex-cap it a gamified savings uh platform again a blockchain solution uh they are actually the very first contributors to company to contribute back to the Innovation fund uh while the the amount is not looking significant here for Unicef this is a very momentous time uh and that's really because we're seeing how a portfolio company can contribute back to the growth of the fund and finally we invite you to collaborate with us you can collaborate with us with your expertise and mentorship in building open source communities you can also provide mentorship directly to a select few startups if you're a startup we will be launching a new call for applications and this is going to be for climate Tech Solutions the call is going to be out later this month so stay tuned and finally co-invest with us join the Venture fund partner with us to really contribute in building digital public goods that can really impact the lives of children in more ways than one you can write to us directly at the Venture fund at unicef.org or else uh check us out on social at UNICEF innovate thank you so much for your time it's a pleasure amazing thank you so much Sana it's it's amazing to know how one of the most important organizations around the world is using the blockchain technology so congratulations thank you and in a few minutes we are go we are going to have eea Community projects a home for Open Standards development projects managed by Oasis here with Daniel Burnett and Taz dianans so yeah thank you so much thanks yeah all right so uh they're still filling in a little bit here all right um okay um thanks everyone um so we're going to be talking obviously about Community projects um and I'll just I'll just launch right into it I'm going to talk a little bit about the history and then Tosh will get into what we're doing today and and what you can uh what you can do uh through the community projects going forward okay so um so when we created the community projects originally our goal was to increase or improve the quality of standards in the ethereum community and and that's an interesting statement uh that's actually what was brought to us initially by um uh some folks who were concerned with quality and what they meant by that was eaps are great and eips have moved the entire ecosystem forward that's for sure but they often don't meet the quality and completeness level of standards that um that businesses would expect something you would see from traditional standards organizations such as ietf or w3c or Oasis or ISO whatever okay and so businesses and governments are a lot more comfortable adopting those kinds of Technology standards um then the uh then some of the ones that they've seen from uh eips and so the goal was to was to see are there projects that could benefit from this additional level of uh of rigor uh so we have a formal but Open Standards development process that includes input from multiple organizations and stakeholders and one of the goals with this of course was to reduce the bureaucracy okay so for any of you who've ever participated in any of these other standards organizations you know they have a reputation for being very slow uh ponderous cumbersome and so our goal is to see if we could put in the minimum amount of your bureaucracy to still allow us to get to a good result so um this is the the work itself is actually managed and run by Oasis open Oasis is a non-profit technical standards body been around for a long time they're actually known for a lot of XML standards and many others as well what they did is they actually started a new Oasis open program specifically for open source software and standards development so we created an oasis open project I say we um so it was the ethereum foundation consensus and the Enterprise ethereum Alliance in 2019 started this project um and again we've focused really heavily on the low bureaucracy piece it which of course I obviously represent with my my shirt here uh was founded in 2017 I initially focused um for any of you saw my presentation earlier today you know what I'm going to say we were focused initially on standards development for private chains okay and that's because the public chain wasn't ready for businesses to use it a number of years ago um but we have a broader Mission now at the EA to include much more ecosystem development work and ethereum advocacy so we're looking at moving well we've already been moving beyond private chains for a while now we're actually looking much much more broadly than that so in particular even though Enterprises in our title and we know that people sometimes hate that Enterprise word the reality is we are business focused and so you'll hear that more and more from the EA you can almost think of us as uh you know the ethereum business Alliance you know as far as the way we we operate um so we actually we like the way Oasis started the uh the open projects and uh decided that we would work together with them we particularly like how inclusive it was of the entire uh ethereum Community um it's important to point out that EA membership is not required to participate in the community projects and that's why they're called Community projects okay at this point I think I'm switching over to Tash to tell you what we're up to yeah so oh thank you uh so what do we look for in an eea Community project what kind of projects are a good fit uh ethereum first name ethereum first project says the name implies ethereum should be Central to the project although it doesn't have to be exclusively ethereum it can support other chains um we look for projects that want to do Open Standards development often from initial Source initial open source software so there can be a software implementation around which a standard is developed or there can be no implementation you just developed a standard first either one's okay but it must be open IE contributors most people need to sign a contributor license agreement that ensures that there will be no um all contributions or open sources no intellectual property no patents associated with the contributions to that standard so the standard should be completely open source and to start a project we look for at least three and ideally five organizations to sponsor a project so one company cannot Define a standard a standard exists when multiple or entities get together and hash out their differences and agree on something so we look for at least three and hopefully more than three entities often that have competing interests to get together and discuss and agree on something which we can call a standard so um how is it governed the eea community projects is governed by a project governing board and then each project has a technical steering committee so there's one project of governing board and there's a TSC for each standards development project the pgb meets every two weeks uh it it manages the tses it authorizes and makes rules for the tscs it does not make technical decisions it's just a kind of a middle level of governance between Oasis and the tscs Dan and I are the co-chairs uh and the TSC also includes members from each sorry the pgb also includes members from each TSC so each TSC gets a seat on the pgb and also companies that sponsor the eea community projects by giving us money get a seat on the TSC on the pgb if they want one yeah so each project is governed by its own technical steering committee so the technical steering committee makes assess the governance rules for that project they can be pretty flexible the pgpa has to approve the rules um so there is some degree of customizability for each project to set their own rules and get it approved by the pgb the members of the ptsc are typically the most active contributors to that project and the tsc's report to the pgb so what projects do we have or whatever we worked on so far Baseline protocol is probably the biggest one Baseline protocol is a standard that enables Enterprises to synchronize complex multi-party business processes with privacy and without moving data from systems of record using ethereum as a common frame of reference so basically it enables companies that engage in multi-party business transactions to do so in a way that doesn't leak any confidential information from their databases it also ensures that all of their assistant each company's systems are in sync and that each company is doing the correct thing and proving that with zero knowledge proofs um we also have a layer two standardized working group we just talked about that earlier at a different room so the layer 2 standards working group as the name implies is developing standards for layer twos which is I think very important there's been some work done on uh formalizing the standards and specifications for the Json RPC client API and we've been talking about a new project called token script possibly coming in token script is a JavaScript webassembly and XML framework to improve the functionality security and usability of blockchain tokens um and if you have an idea for a project we would love to hear from you we would love to hear it have more projects coming into the EA Community projects to improve the quality of Standards development within the ethereum ecosystem so we have sponsors sponsors have provided money to help us get stuff done um some big companies like ey Accenture and sap and also a lot of smaller crypto Focus companies so there's quite a wide variety of sponsors if you are interested in getting in in starting a new standards development project or participating in one of the existing ones please get in touch here's how uh and thanks for sticking around till the last last Talk of the day amazing thank you so much so [Applause] does if you have any idea some ideas to keep improving the ethereum ecosystem or do you want to join a project with them so thank you so much and thank you all this is the the last Talk of the day and a very amazing day for Defcon which this is the biggest Defcon till now we are more than five five thousand people so amazing I hope you enjoy it and I'm Anna and thank you so much have a great life see you soon [Applause] the ground [Music] foreign [Music] [Music]
