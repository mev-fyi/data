[Applause] okay so this presentation is about planetary the tragedy of the tragedy of the Commons a few words about me my name is Albert I'm a software engineer and I my license timetraveler I just got my license so I can travel like time and I come from year 2045 and as a proof I have this screenshot from sorry thank you so as a proof I have this screenshot from meter scan as you can see the block height of the etherium network is 62 million and the timestamp is around 2045 so if you just wait like what 26 years you should see this block hash at one point and some people ask me on how like the future actually looks like and so some people are taking holidays on Mars this is a friend of mine sending me like postcards from there I mean yeah it's it's cool but I'm not sure if I want to spend like a weekend there still I mean it's it's a good place to visit I guess then if you don't 2.0 is finally as being foreign leader like deployed in September 15th like 2042 and you take the photo ok good so I connect to the other one and another thing breaks it dissolves almost implemented so we have 15 days for it and yeah so anyway while we were distracted by all these technologies social media political stands like Instagram whatever we actually thought the up the planet so what does it mean it means that this is like the drama slide so suspense it means that by the Year 2045 the temperature of the world increased by 2 Celsius degrees and this has some like really really extreme consequences to like our our life for example the effects of this climate change we will have more frequent wildfires stronger tie phones and stronger like tropical storms and rain won't rain that much so it's actually quite earth is quite a up place to live right now so I decided my group that is socialist social protocol this is about logo more or less and plus sleep though we decided to come back to 2019 and play a small game with you what we developed is called like serious social game and this game is running on a theory on plasma raise your hand if you know what the theory on plasma is nice okay so if you don't know as people with brazing let's raise their hand and this game is called planet a the tragedy of the Commons and the it's open source and yeah it's developed like on get up so you can follow that link and you can you see everything and it works more or less like this oh now you see that the quality of my slides decreases a lot because I ever doing out here so I mean yeah but I mean I think they're still useful so we have a set of phase of the game and when you enter for example an event like this one at the reception you will get a QR code ok the QR code contains like a URL that if you scan will basically load the load of website on your phone and that looks more or less like this so this is a screenshot of the of the actual application I also have it here that is live and running and you will have the opportunity later to play the game so pay some attention here together with the QR code so if you open the QR code you you will receive like some balance in colors and a passport the passport is what allows you to play the game we have two countries USA and us be USA is United States of ambrosial while USB is United States of balloons and you also get some gaolers comma I didn't finish the slide dollars is actually the combination of girly and dollars so if you so that that's why it's called if you open the passport so if you tap on the USA Passport in this case in this case you'll get like your your password with their information so in this case I am a citizen of the United States of ambrosial and my name is Chevron and I have two other stats here I have the co2 that I produce in Gigaton and the co2 I lock so how much basically co2 am removing from air still in gigatons and then I still have the balance as you see just for major fun the name of the passport is basically it's generated by us and is associated to one to one of its associated to one of the top like 50 most polluting companies in the world okay so we have basically these nice database that is like the major like co2 producers this is a screenshot you can also find the link down there and yeah here you can see some nice tats so each of you after scanning the QR code we receive a passport and associated to the password you're basically playing with the name of one of those companies after this setup phase is done we have have actually the economy phase so what you need to do is take your phone go around and handshake with others hey so when you handshake what happens is that you create value okay this is a bit of an abstract thing but this is how the game works so you need to go around and and handshake with others and every time in handshake you get some dollars out so you will receive free money okay but the other thing that happens is that you release co2 to air for everyone so while the money is yours co2 is something shared among all players and this is how they like start and shake screen looks like and basically yeah from the UI you'll see a button with handshake you just press this you have the QR code and then you'll ask the other person to play the other button to scan it so we have another like big green button somewhere here on the top bottom right after you handshake you earn dollars and then the economy phase can continue so you can use the gaolers to actually buy something of value for example you can buy a beer or just a drink here at sea bass we have like both like 50 vouchers for you guys so you can actually exchange dollars for value that is a drink unfortunately they don't have quality beer like standing here after a while the people are playing we enter the tragedy phase and basically again since the the co2 value the the value of the co2 is shared among all participants if this value reaches a specific tipping point then the beers will start to cost more and more dollars so instead of 2 dollars will be like 3 4 6 10 dollars we also developed a nice dashboard that will be like projected here after I finished the talk so you can also see how things are going and as you can see over time the global value of co2 is rising and then there are 2 different values plus it's a bit small here but this is a plus 1.5 the other one is plus 2 degrees 30 degrees and if you are able to keep the co2 level lower than 1.5 a beer is $2 if the value of co2 fluctuates between 1.5 and 2 the price of the beer will increase linearly or exponentially so the game is not finished yet ok so I was too lazy to put the emoji so with that one I think you understand what I mean so we're still developing the game tonight we are just like playing a simplified version of it and so you will be able to handshake with others but you won't be able to lower the value of co2 and let's say it's a feature not about just to make the game a bit more interesting and so what we our plan is to basically finish the game and play it with a thousand of people like at Bally at baylin's Phi and the case communication camp 2019 and those events will happen at the end of August we are also we also have a grant on get coin so we already have like 8000 die pledged by each baleen and lip tau to develop the game and so if you have like some spare money like you etherium billionaires just put some some some money there as well did you take all of the picture of the URL this is very important I'm not kidding okay so it's your turn now and we will give you some QR codes like there at the bar I think we have someone there yes those two guys they have like you are codes and they will be next to the bar each QR code has again private key associated with some dollars and their passport and you can start playing the game right now with the after you scan the QR code you have enough you have enough dollars to buy a beer immediately so you have three dollars a beer is two so just get a beer for free from us yes and then after you buy beer you also before I mean that's not the right like order it's up to you you can handshake with others so you just go around and handshake handshake other people for profits and try to not everything up because if you're too greedy then beers will be too expensive for everyone also for you but that's also fun also yeah remember you start with three dollars one drink is $2 and you earn 0.2 dollars for every handshake okay so just to do the math you have three you remove two you have one goal or left you need to do some other handshakes to go to toggle arson by another drink and and I don't have a final slide thank you [Applause]
