[Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] hey everyone i'm superfist from the east staker community i'm here with a bunch of people that i like and we are hosting the road to defcon trivia in partnership with devcon um and we have skyler here from defcon hey buddy how are you hey hey how's it going great um so today's event is the culmination of the road to devcon um this is the the final event when we're going to host a trivia game uh the winner from this live trivia game will win um a free ticket to defcon there are a bunch of other prizes and we're going to go through those in just a few minutes before i go too far i'd like to introduce a couple of people that are with us on the east acre side we have uh anvedica hey how's it going we have colfax hey everyone graywizard hey folks uh lamboshi also known as nolan and i think patricio is hiding somewhere in there i'm not hiding um i'm on an airport in mallorca spain there you are you're on my second page of zoom so um yeah great to have everyone here and from dev con we have skyler yo yo and we have a couple guests um people we will introduce as we go um but the general layout of today is to host a trivia game um there will be a live game here on this zoom channel which many people are watching on youtube um but there's also a simulplay that we hope a lot of people participate in and that simulplay is administered through a website at play.eathstaker.cc in just a few minutes michael is going to tell you a little bit more how to use that simulplay site everyone who is here should walk away with a poep the smart people will walk away with two poeps and the farmers will walk away with a thousand coaps so congratulations to everyone um i need to tell you before we get into this game that uh the questions are developed in-house by uh an intern who we really don't have a lot of faith in so if and when questions and answers don't line up we regard that as part of the game the game has nothing to do with the actual questions and answers it is simply the name that shows up at the top of our list when we're done so you may answer all of the questions correctly in the quiz and still lose and that's part of the fun yeah so um that's really my disclaimer that uh we did a we worked really hard to set this up and i think it's going to be fantastic um but because we're here to have fun please recognize that things always go wrong there's always going to be a technical hurdle um and i hope you'll just roll with that and the the final results will be as they are shown on screen and nothing else um so with that i would like to shift it off to michael who's going to talk about simulplay and the poeps yep thank you very much fizz so let's go into the playlong app that's uh making its debut today on the east acre website everyone is welcome to use it anyone can use it it's accessible at play.evestaker.com those of you following along on the live stream there is a sequence of steps to follow in order to access the playlong app what's going to happen is when you go to play.easttaker.cc you will see an embedded live stream to follow along and then you'll see a multiple choice questions or excuse me you'll just see the answers with no questions so what it's going to do is force you to listen to the questions as we progress through them via kahoot and as we state the questions on the live stream you'll go ahead and answer those via the site if you play along and answer all 50 questions you are eligible for a devcon playlong participation poep and that comes in form of a qr code only after you've finished the quiz along with us so again that's play.estaker.cc um just a quick note here this is quite literally the first time we're using this so there are a few uh hiccups in the sense that um if we run out of codes um or anything like that um it's sort of like first-come first-served basis in terms of uh the play-along sequence so just be aware that if you feel that you you didn't get one during the rush please reach out to me directly on discord and we'll get you taken care of but that is the playlong app for e-sticker all right thank you so much for that um and next i think we're going to get to colfax to talk about the raffles oh yeah so i'm going to jump in and show you guys first how to claim the poep and i'll talk about the raffle that's going to take place at the end of the call so first in order to claim the plot for this call this is going to be your viewer poe app michael just talked about how you'll get the play along co-op but this is just for a viewer even if you're not playing along uh you'll be able to claim this one it's the normal co-op claim process that we have for lots of events and i'll just quickly show you guys how to do it so i'm going to share my screen here in a second there we go so here i am on the east staker

invite.gg east taker and you can join that discord and you can be on any channel here but on the right side you'll see this list of people if you don't see it just go ahead and click this icon at the top the people and scroll on down to the po app bot and what you're going to do is you're going to right click on the poep bot and you are going to click message you're going to send a direct message to the poep bot and then you will type in here the secret claim word which is i believe it's rtd in all caps so let's go ahead and see if i remember that correctly and it will accept accept it lowercase as well just so everyone's aware awesome yep sweet so here you go by the way you'll see my effort at solving uh logic beach puzzle yesterday was very fun i recommend checking it out uh but

is again for viewers and the play along you'll get after you play along and i just want to talk a little bit now about a poep raffle we're going to be doing at the end of the call so i don't know how many of you guys had a chance to tune in to our previous uh road con road to devcon quest quest two we handed out some pull-ups there as well and all of the po apps that were given out in quest two and all the pull-ups that will be given out today are going to give you a ticket to this raffle this raffle will take place at the end of trivia and what we're raffling off here are the top three people that win are going to get the builder discount ticket to devcon so that's a guaranteed spot uh at devcon you get a discounted ticket so that's super exciting um and so the more events that you came to the more poeps you have you get additional opportunities to actually enter into the raffle so i'll demo the the raffle entry process a little bit later once you guys have had a chance to claim your poeps uh but i want to let you guys know about the raffle so definitely stick around for this it's gonna be a lot of fun and without further ado i'll pass it back to super fizz all right um i think we are ready to get rocking on the game i will give a two second pause to see if anybody says wait don't forget okay um i'm going to start the game formally in my browser and then i'm going to start a screen share all right the east price falls and your maker dow val vault is under collateralized how long do you have before you are liquidated the i am already liquidated one hour until someone bids on my eat or one day also remember how quickly you answer the question affects how many points you get the correct answer is one hour and yes that usually is the tie breaker how quickly you you answer so all right looks like things are off to a smooth start that was fast lead always watching of course which of these people is not credited as an author of eip 1559 vitalik buterin rick dudley eric connor or hudson jameson i love the ones that i know makes me happy is this one of those the correct answer is hudson jameson oh i didn't know that one uh yes definitely us a strong organizer during that time but not credited as an author of uh 1559. ah switch up what is rocky portfolio tracker dex aggregator nft platform or venture capital firm ah it looks like most people guessed it was a guest knew it was a portfolio tracker i actually followed them on twitter but i i don't think i've used them in quite a while all right axis still up jc is the highest climber we know what he's doing which eth2 tests launched between madasha and zincon piermont spadina altana and schlesi sorry about my pronunciation oh no this is great yeah i spent weeks like practicing the pronunciation of those because i knew i would chop it i know yeah i'm the one reading the answers i should have practiced more yes no spadina i'm surprised most people got that was a tough one yeah yeah good question all right exit oh po-op god making a move have you played before exit i don't recognize your name from the leaderboard no no i haven't well congratulations on doing so well yeah awesome which decks has the most total volume locked on polygon i was gonna say liquidated you to swap sushi swap quick swap or curve correct answer there is quick swap nice good job and now is a great time for me to point out um so we do have a lot of people who know a lot about ethereum um and uh what i want to let you know is these questions like i said they may not necessarily be accurate from every dimension but as a game the ultimate goal is to get the most points not necessarily to get all the questions correct um megan are you here with us i'm here hey guys hey welcome so megan is ceo of vera ledger is that right that's right um and we're glad to have you today i wonder if you wanted to read a couple questions with us i'm ready let's do it great all right get ready guys axic maintaining the lead what scaling solution does nifty inc use polygon roll-ups x-dye or robstein this is one of my favorite platforms right now i love to buy art on nifty inc so i hope you will check it out if you're not familiar already really i've never heard you talk about it before well look i i helped this the right answer is x die all right and looks like we're uh same places everybody's holding on to their spot where was the first devcon held berlin london miami or cancun and was anybody from this call at the first of con that's the next question because of bitcoin miami right is that what you were no because devcon1 was in um london i think but devcon zero was in berlin so that would be the first devcon initializing the array got it all right no change in the leaderboard it looks like uh it's it's going to be the middle of the game before jc sweeps in which is the most rare type of crypto punk alien ape or zombie there's at least one ah yes oh good i uh i still haven't looked into crypto punks it just hasn't spoken to me yet uh great job everyone and still wow it looks like we're so locked in that's that's pretty interesting five players have an answer streak of four and question nine how much does the uni-swap protocol charge in fees for a trade point zero three percent point three percent zero or 0.01 e flat fee and we have a clarifying question in the chat for v2 or only one answer is correct either way oh [Music] trick answers and the answer's point three percent v3 is 0.05 percent for the stable pair all right moving along all right um five places apollo 517 is the highest climber still axic followed by poep god uh ramoid jeremy and i have a theory i think pop god has to be chasy ah that could be it that would not wait but we've talked to both of them so we know better all right yes and poep god did win an official seat one is eip1 gas usage adjustments a description of the erc20 rules on how to use eip for a description of ens that is a great question and i'm pretty sure i know the answer to this one i'm pretty sure i don't i could guess oh wow i would wow everybody knows the answer apparently except me were you correct yes i was correct ah i was thinking maybe erc20 but i know that came a little later all right if there were no rules on how to do that before that how'd that even create the first one inception uh oh it looks like we've had a little bit of a shuffle up um all right welcome james carly to the top five which bitcoin maxi did joe lubin make the infamous daily active users bet with peter mccormick dan held pierre rochard or jimmy song this is one of those questions where you had to be on twitter three years ago to know the answer it's jimmy's song still most people got it though pretty good i don't think all right they're actually resolved either so somebody should fact check this since you remind them about it how uh how we doing with the reading megan are you are you enjoying it yeah but happy too to anybody you got it we'll we'll give you a few more thank you for your help all right god back up on the leaderboard what was the first nft project to receive significant mainstream attention cryptokitties crypto punks moon cat rescue or hash masks all right i feel like this one's gonna be a slam dunk nolan i'm really impressed with your question quality especially that some not everyone loves all the answers but they are pretty challenging i know i was pretty critical of patricio's great job on his his great questions so i knew i had to bring my a game correct answer there is crypto kitties i think i i would have guessed that one all right justin second place i'm in for it still early plus representing what does dsr stand for in the maker down ecosystem die savings rate daily savings rate direct spending ratio or die staking return i lived on my cdp for about two years and it was the most stressful experience of my life all right good job james carly and jeremy up uh bacillus is the highest climber great work how many airdrop tokens did you get for making a trade on youtube four forty four hundred i love this question i'm getting a little audio interference i don't know if anyone else is picking that up it's patricio a dang busy airport all right all places held ken is back with a streak of three ken being an eaststaker favored to win or at least place high but playing from a tire shop so what category of scaling does polygon fall under optimistic role [Music] side chain or it's complicated do you want to uh i'll defend myself here before we go is a suite of multiple different scaling solutions right now they have a side chain up and running but in the future they're gonna have roll ups and zero knowledge proofs and everything else under the sun okay i feel like any time an answer says it's complicated it has to be the default like the correct answer i will uh i'll share nolan's private email with anyone who needs it after the games i got sources in in the in the chat oh mahalo alright um we got ramoy ramoid and hoap god moving up holding on to first place uh justin a respectable second and james carney holding onto fourth and combo breaker eight players dropped to their answer streak of three uh all right so i think megan let's give you one more question if you don't mind here yeah great which of these was the first dex on ethereum either delta kybur shape-shift or swappy oh i know this yes and it was a little clunky and i was like are ducks is really ever to make it and then look at uniswap now all right so i love these for delta oh i mean i loved it at the time it was it was the first place i ever wrapped ether and i was like wow i don't know what i'm doing but this is probably cool is it still around i believe yeah you can still rap ether there i don't know what else it does yeah i think it's fork delta now or something interesting and then they get the new owners exit scammed after launching a token right yeah not not for the ether delta specifically yeah megan thank you so much for reading do you have any uh any anything you'd like to pump with us before we uh switch readers [Laughter] and we're actually going to get more more to devcon planning and organization in in our halftime which is going to be after question 25. um spoiler we're not going to give a date or we're not skyler hasn't shared a date so uh okay all right thanks again for reading with us well i'll take over questions for now how many ave tokens will you receive if you migrated one lend 100 10. 1 or 0.01 all right the answer is 0.01 ave tokens for migrating one land 14 people got it that's an awesome question because it yeah split the field for sure taurus up yeah i got that one wrong top five was not fooled yeah uh d5 dude called up three places so he'll be up in the top five soon which scaling solution does poap use matic optimism x die or bsc i'm watching you guys a bsc maximalist all right nice most people got it xdi xdi is a scaling solution all right um and i think that um colfax will read questions and nolan will read answers for a moment sounds good our places are the same we have six with a streak of three axis still in first place uh justin laro in second ramoid in third james carnelly in fourth and jeremy in fifth looks like our spread is about 2 000 points which i think represents two questions what happens if you neglect your avogachi it dies nothing someone else can adopt it or it gets sad i wasn't going to say anything but i just remembered that i have an avogadro somewhere it gets sad oh that one split the field as well too you wouldn't want to make your avogadro sad super pissed yeah he's he's probably still out there somewhere um i i would like to again compliment nolan these questions are dividing the the clan so you did great dividing the field oh justin falling down shaking things up a little bit because he's that one nolan he's working instead of gaming give the man some credit true true which project was not created by larva labs crypto punks autoglyphs me bits or crypto kitties now that most of the questions the answers are and i'll ask if me bits is an actual platform what do you mean i've never heard of it ebits yeah oh sorry okay cryptokitties was not created by larval labs did you hear the disappointment in his voice i know i'm still feeling it it hurts i'm so sad i've got to go look it up all right they're kind of a big deal for a while there you you did a great job tearing me up though it was subtle subtle but deep james hardly knew that climb it up 400 pounds behind skyler is up three places there we go which decentralized exchange is based on synthetics quenta kyber quicksop or repair swap yeah i didn't know that and i i have played with synthetics for a long time but i've never used decks i'm i'm sorry i'm not supposed to acknowledge when i don't know them because nolan's going to be disappointed in me that ship has said oh james hardly james just enough this is okay so axe i guess missed one big all right you rebels entered the top five nice which emoji would you see when you found a block in the early days of ethereum mining a drum a check mark a brick or a hammer oh my god this is literally my favorite question ever i did this one just for you i'm obsessed with that symbol in my questions list my sources fizz said so i uh i installed fonts on ubuntu then just so i could see that symbol because otherwise it would show up as a as an ascii text string all right the hammer mind a block i'm surprised most people knew that they're all blocked man i guess so which of these is not an east acre initiative steakhouse the ethereum due diligence committee the east acre staking pool or ethereum study master i love this one it's a good one we're going to find out how well people know what we do or don't do ah wow still divided that's a great question that was a really good question so steakhouse is actually run by colfax who's here with us now they develop tools to make staking more accessible the ethereum due diligence committee is a committee that vets staking pools um and eventually other products to determine whether they are healthy for use by the community and ethereum studymaster is a platform developed by anvedica it's a study plan where you can read academic articles and take quizzes on them and earn a poep for understanding ethereum the east staker staking pool is kind of against our ethos of decentralizing staking um because if we if we ran a staking pool we would obviously defeat everyone it would just be terrible so too centralized congratulations ramoid what amount of eath was originally expected to be required to stake before 32 was chosen 1500 3200 3.2 or 100. i saw danny ryan's announcement of this on reddit and just like my heart broke for him because he had spent so much time on that original contract okay so most people knew it 1500 was the original requirement we were pretty high barrier yeah yeah yeah definitely good we got it down to 32. of course then 1500 ether was like 9.80 so uh yeah not really but it was still quite a bit sad wow silent 666 13 correct in a row wow that's incredible who was the founder of sushi spot chef nomi oh x machi joseph de long or sam bankman freed i don't know why i feel like sassel would have been a great um great distractor here we'll throw everything at him it's all his fault love the guy by the way so chef nomi was the founder of sushi swap all right so with that we have completed 25 questions i'm going to stop my screen share for a little bit and we're going to hop into another um phase uh intermission hey gray whistler tell me our plan for intermission please yeah so intermission is just a chance for the people that are participating in the quiz to take a short break probably going to be a couple minutes if you need to get a glass of water a cup of coffee use the restroom whatever just uh doing the quiz is pretty intense this just gives everybody a bit of a break um also we'll do uh colfax if you don't mind can we just get a quick overview again of the poep collection for viewers and then we'll also talk a little bit about what is uh coming next later in this event yeah definitely so in order to get the viewer po app what you're going to do is you're going to head on over to the easttaker discord which is that invite.gigi easttaker and you're going to find the poep bot user on the right hand side and direct message that bought the word i guess the acronym rtd lowercase or uppercase is fine so it's the normal way that we do a lot of events in the past i'll just quickly show you here i'll share my screen again real quick to show you how to find that user and then you're going to direct direct message the user you're not going to send a public message um so here i'll just show you quickly and this poe app is going to be useful later in the raffle which we'll talk about right after the post so here i am on the e sticker discord and here on the right hand side you just scroll on down to the po app bot right click message and you can see i've already done a b message rtd and then you'll get a link click that link and it'll ask for an address and it'll send you your poep all right so i want to draw us back to the reason that we're here um we're here as a part of the road to devcon series um which began with um the first quest which was an information survey and then the painting party and now the culmination our trivia game um and i know that everyone has lots of questions about the future of devcon and the future of devcon is obviously safe like it's not going anywhere but the pandemic has kind of thrown it for a spin um and so now it's a great time if if we can get skyler to just give us a broad overview i know that you don't have a lot of specifics um but just kind of give us an idea what's going on absolutely absolutely yeah so i mean i think everyone wants to know is when dem gone obviously um and sadly uh i don't know we can't tell you um we are still we're still evaluating much of the global situation um so both i'd say both globally and both uh locally in colombia um in bogota which is where we are planning for the conference to take place and we are still planning for it to take place in bogota colombia so we're super excited to bring it there um but uh but as far as timeline goes still up in the air so um i can't really give you any specifics because we're still inviting situation um you might have realized that some in-person conferences are starting to take place um so each cc coming up i think in two weeks or so in paris might seem to see some of you you folks there um and and thankfully finally we're being able to start to be able to have uh these regional events depending on on where they are in the world um but still for a global international conference that is devcon it's uh it's not quite ready for that yet um so we are continuously postponed um but as superfiz said um it it will happen it's going to happen and we'll be here before we all realize um so i'm excited to reunite in person there in bogota until then uh i hope to see you guys at some of the community events that are happening on uh both in person and virtually uh and um yeah i think i think we'll give you some more some more updates here at the end uh at the end of the call as well we have some some sneak peeks of of uh future quests and maybe even some grant rounds that we're going to be launching here from the dev con side um so stay tuned for those awesome um i i would love to thank you for just getting involved and giving us the chance to keep devcon in all of our minds um and you know this is a great opportunity to to let everyone know that we're all eager like it's not being put off it's just not time yet and um i'm really thankful for your engagement right when it's time it it will be a good one and i'm super excited for it i cannot wait and and hopefully things will be calm enough that my wife will allow me to go without like you know all of the anyway all right what i didn't say anything i'm sorry i would love to bring my wife um so we're gonna get back to the quiz i'm going to re-share my screen did i just say squeen i literally just thought i could reach my screen i heard it i heard it i don't know what's going on here um i thought about getting a beer before the call and i was like what if i say squeen all right so is megan still here she's like i'm done reading now um all right i guess we're going to see our lineup after the first 25 questions uh james carnelly is up the top uh who held for most of the first half is down to second ramoid has been up there the whole time am i saying your name right yeah that's okay you'll let me say anything won't you um i'm gonna do say will you say your name at least i'll get a little closer um right e rebels uh in fourth and jeremy in fifth so congrats to everybody um and i'm gonna read the next question and uh michael do you wanna read the answers uh sure yeah great you really i hear so many compliments about your incredible speaking voice i don't know if you know that i'm sure no i don't i don't get that at least down to my face i think you guys could find funny to know that ramoy there has been the cto of pop-up for the past two years so now we know um what was the name of the merge hackathon zephyr the merge hackathon altair or rainism radianism 17 people knew it was realism a very productive hackathon that uh from my perspective pushed the merge um back on schedule and very impressive event all right james carnelly in the lead axic e rebels j and oh it happened here we go yeah there's jc making his move what company is amin soleimani founder and ceo of auger mocha dao civic spank chain did you just say mokadao yeah i'm not really freaking it's moloch now i'm all locked out okay but it's also spelled a-u-g-u-r so it's you know ah spank chain which is so funny it's like it's the coin that refuses to concede like it's still around michael we can practice uh the answer pronunciation later together that'd be great what is spank change can you tell us because i'm not really clear uh i can't tell you let's move on let's move on yeah it's a family program [Laughter] james carnley holding first axic uh e rebels j and jc ready to swoop in so for anyone who hasn't seen or hasn't been with us in the past um jc always somehow comes out from nowhere and well actually he does very well but he has a a tendency to win these in dark forest what resource must a planet have to reach a higher level settlers mana silver or xp great question i wrote it all right 20 people knew it was silver uh dark force is a great game developed by brian goo you ought to check it out spend a few years your life on it you won't regret it it's the first compelling game for me in uh built on ethereum james carnelly in first axic and second he rebels in third j and then jc making his move what is the most popular eth2 graffiti tag powered by all nodes welcome to the new beginning uh bitcoin swiss.com or btcs zug validator what what was mr f's uh graffiti tag i think it was mr f was here right yeah yeah yeah okay welcome to the new beginning is that so i think i know who that is because i see the fish will someone confirm that for me i think that's who it is i i didn't really check though yeah it's take fish okay yes um the other three run teku ah taku uh all right what what does steak fish run uh did they run probably prism uh prism and lighthouse currently but we're working on it nice all right um and by the way that's ben edgington uh developer of teku um james carnelly in first axic and second e rebels in third jay and fourth and ramoid oh i practiced and i got it wrong um ramoid in fifth uh up from from now on the charts again congratulations i know which staking as a service company has been slashed the most times anchor staked us bitcoin swiss or kraken yeah and so as eathstaker we are very uh very alert for services that that bring slashing and we really want to um promote healthy staking and reduce the likelihood of loss of funds due to slashing and malfeasance staked us has been slashed the most i want to say it's about 117 validators or 125. no no i think it's like 60-ish was it okay 760. i remember counting that day when it just seemed like it was never going to stop all right staked us has the most slashed validators all right looks like our top group knew that on which day in march i can't read this in march 2020 did ethereum have its black thursday the 5th the 12th the 19th or the 26th if you were there you'll have the correct amount of ptsd to yes it makes me sick to my stomach to even it's terrible worst question ever the day the world shut down that's also that when the pandemic was declared all right great question good job nolan all right um somebody else want to hop in and read i'll take it back over okay that's great what layer two solution does synthetics use matic optimism x dye and they recently switched to this platform and i really love the experience there optimism is the correct answer and that means that fees for uh staking on uh synthetics are practically new actually they're subsidized right now by optimism hey james carnley 17 correct answers in a row good job wow unstoppable yeah axix axic e rebels j and ramoid which the following is not a feature of unispot v2 concentrated liquidity price oracles flash orders or erc erc erc20 erc20 pools oh it took me a while to parse the erc20 rc 20 pools it's not as complicated as it sounds yeah i thought it was a typo at first but no one's our intern doesn't make mistakes nola by the way is not actually an intern he's he's one of the smartest guys we work with so um okay all right as evidenced by the extremely complex questions well so again it's really good discrimination because it's about half and half so 29 thousand 466 points to james carnelly axic e-rebels jay and ramoid axe caught up on points a little there what is the most expensive nft sold so far crypto punk people pleaser beeple or nba top shot because sadly it was not on nifty inc yeah it was crazy to see us a cell on and people being the winner 69 million dollars on cnn and people i know were like wait this is really a thing james carmley exec e-rebels jay and ramoid all uh holding their places and all right what was the reason for the mure glacier hard fork add some new feature eips whoops forgot about that difficulty bomb set up for the beacon chain emergency bug fix oh is this a multiple choice that's a that was a good question mere glacier was just to delay the difficulty bomb everyone except eric connor forgot about it oh jc coming back up into the top five jc sneak up there for that late late in the game snag eric originally wanted to call that the ethos money hard fork but that was shot down pretty hard [Laughter] it's a good name for one after eip 1559 and the merge the total e supply is predicted to inflate deflate disinflate have a hard cap i'm gonna need everyone to get this correct but inflation and deflation they seem like contradictory concepts i don't know if any if anyone else struggles with that but hey great job there you go um that's right we should expect the supply of ether to decline or deflate after eip 1559 as tips or as some fees are burned and that's coming august 4th um and we'll be talking soon about upgrading eth1 clients for stakers in the next few weeks good job eath rebels a streak of 21. that's incredible james carnelly is packing his bags early teaser we're going to be hosting a live stream for that hardport for london just like we did for berlin so stay tuned for details for that hopefully it's not uh well i guess no matter somebody in the world is going to have it at an inconvenient time but for a lot of us might as well be us right yep you can actually uh subscribe to that it's on the e-staker youtube page the live stream so if you want to get reminded on that go ahead and uh check it out for the london hard fork yep coming up in a little under a month which city was the runner-up and the decision on where to host defcon 6. bogota buenos aires vienna or seoul where's buddha when you need him he's probably sleeping it's the middle of the night 29 people knew it was buenos aires all right uh accent shares a shower thought buenos aires would mean that hard forks would have a two-word name again maybe that's why it wasn't going to cyrus keeping it simple uh james in the lead axic and second e rebels and third jay in fourth and jc in fifth uh just for everyone who's watching we're planning to take a short break after three more questions why couldn't lighthouse connect to prism's topaz testnet they were not ready a bug in lighthouse a bug in prism it was intentionally made prism only ah that's a great question there are a few people who will know that very very well most people knew it yeah i was thinking topaz was a prism specific test net but i forget things it was um mainnet like specto uh oh i guess i remember that yeah prism had a bug in the consensus so got it no change i think jc missed that one very unlike him that it was a single client test net in 2017 what company's logo caused massive fomo when seen on a skateboard amazon tesla apple or intel uh back in the good old days this one is so obscure oh this is an easy one this is like wall street bets or something i don't yeah see most people knew i didn't know you guys don't remember when the founder of omg posted a picture of him holding a skateboard with an apple sticker on it and everyone just took it and ran with it and they were like oh omg's partnering with apple now i think that was my pre-twitter time and omg like tripled in value wow it's still it's still there right here okay we're gonna move on talk about fundamentals oh change currently nice silent 666 is on the leaderboard and i think we're gonna do one more question and then take a little break which of the following is not a tornado cash pool size one each 10 32.18 or 100 e if you're listening and you have a thousand tornado tokens and you know what should be the correct answer here or what is the correct answer why don't you go ahead and submit a uh a tornado cash governance request and have 32.1 eve added um because that is the ideal amount for someone who wants to run a validator all right great job most people knew it was 32.1 east which is really the next logical addition to tornado cash axic like james carnley the rebels j and silence666 with that i'm going to leave this screen here for a minute actually i'm going to stop sharing and we're going to have an intermission i want to remind you that right after the 50th question we're going to have a little bit of fun by celebrating the winners and we're going to have a raffle for all of the participants and we're going to have some closing words from skyler so don't shut down as soon as the raffle is over because we will still be mid fun and all right who wants to give everyone just a minute to chill out i like your t-shirt which one is it this is a bap zero this is the the bankless season zero apparel i actually i had three failed transactions that would cost a lot of money trying to get one of these shirts you have to do it manually worth it worth it well nice how you gonna share it on the on the stream i got my ethereum frontier mining shirt which my favorite shirt i paid 27 ether for it um and it was well worth every penny was it though it was at the time our peels are i see over there all right um we ready to rock and roll friends yeah let's do it i'm down to keep reading or if anybody else wants to jump and read questions uh make yourself known i'll uh i'll read some questions sounds good let me figure out how to share my screen again i'll do the answers unknown sounds good which project rebranded and became synthetics salt haven cash crash cash or searing labs if the answers are hard to pronounce in vatica you can just jump in and say them for me lots of people need that one there we go haven being the answer i do remember that ah dude is making a comeback with three in a row which infamous username is known for saying i accidentally killed it about the parity multisig wallet e underscore z underscore p under score z underscore newbie dev devops199 or i don't know michael you can take that one now you're on your own i love how nolan's questions like are all designed to drive a knife into someone's heart [Laughter] uh for if you don't know uh the parody multisig wallet locked up a lot of funds uh and uh a lot of people are still bummed about that today easy peasy being a famous redditor and i don't know the other two all right places stay the same terence has three in a row what is the main use case of curve general purpose decks flash loans stable coin specific decks or options trading curve is a stable coin specific dex congratulations to 23 people that knew that the rebels has a 28 answer streak that is absolutely awesome great job wow x6 back at the top if you had a git coin grant which option would you prefer a hundred people giving one dollar one person giving a hundred dollars two people giving fifty one dollars a thousand people giving nine cents we should map that out a hundred dollars a hundred dollars 102 or nine dollars ninety dollars yep who can tell you why why that's preferred uh having a thousand unique people give you a grant will get you a better matching fund yep that's the quadratic matching formula very cool it's a pretty cool mechanism to assess how important things are to the community so yeah and by the way we love git coin um if you ever have a chance check them out and uh contribute to any uh anything really what percentage of transaction fees is predicted to be burned by eip 1559 ah how many 15 59 questions is that now a couple justin drake right that's the answer yeah seventy percent of fees will be burnt by eip1559 where did the other thirty percent go miners slash stakers miners and eventually stickers places stay the same e rebels has 30 in a streak we have five questions remaining what was the first non-eth asset added to multi-collateral dye usdc usdt that or wbgc bat is the answer and that was really odd to me it because it it's not a you know it is a great program platform but it's not a top coin it led me to believe that that maker dow would suddenly adopt like thousands of of different coins i guess that's they just have a really strong community accept is in the lead james carnley e rebels j and silence 666. uh four questions remaining oh actually three who is the creator of the game dark forest brian austin preston van loon or mike and super fizz was nice enough to give away the answer for this one earlier did i say it yeah i did i did i'm so sorry well i mean i didn't know it would be a question congratulations hey see good job everyone knew well many people knew who's austin griffiths is that uh is there a collection that's a collective of austin griffiths there's multiple yeah they all work together on it oh you get so much done that's must be how he works he's so uh what's the word uh prolific what is dpi defy token index index co-op governance token yield aggregator index or 2x leverage define index oh man i'm like i know what it is i don't know what it is yeah that makes it it was i don't know about anyone else it's difficult for me to think through all of the other answers they seem a little like they could be okay uh dpi is a defy token index 28 people got it right how's that doing right now do we know anybody not very bad i don't know it's but it seems like a good hold doesn't it yeah axic uh followed by james carley e rebels j and silence 666 we have two more questions left um and so i would say it's pretty close looks like axic might pull it out how much did you need to donate to get a unicorn token from the ethereum foundation at least a hundred us dollars two point zero one four eighth point one eighth or at least a thousand years i know this because i thought about it a lot in the day and just couldn't do it oh that's well most people knew that that's not what i thought actually i thought it was a thousand heath that would have been a half a bitcoin of ether in the in the pre-sale so yeah anybody who knew it was 2.014 ethan knew more than i did all right our final question uh aksak is in the lead it looks like so interestingly axa casts 43 783 points even if james carmeli gets a thousand points for the next question it still would not put james above axic but that shouldn't stop you from trying which e2 client team was the first to release a public test net prism lighthouse tekku or nimbus see how strong the stake is in this crowd oh interesting was it a public test net because i remember running it on my android device but wasn't it a developer test that no it was public i remember doing it i put a guide for it on youth financer maybe it was ethtrader at the time i kind of remember i just yeah i don't know why i felt like it was a developer testimony but it's going to matter because road to defcon trivia podium e rebels in third place good job nice four three six ninety was oh james carly in second and axic is going to be in first with a complimentary ticket to defcon congratulations very impressive 47 out of

raffle here in order to get you your discount tickets we're gonna have to send you an email so we don't always require this but this time we're actually requiring your email address so go ahead and submit that in here and then it's gonna pop up a transaction on metamask and this is not actually a transaction sorry i misspoke it's basically just a signature so you're not transacting anything

up i want to give everybody a little bit of time to claim or sorry to enter themselves into the raffle and i'll just bring it back up on the screen just so everybody can see while people are entering the raffle would it be a good time to uh to cover some democrat updates or should we wait for that yeah why don't we definitely be thinking about that yeah i didn't want to put you on the spot unless you're ready but that's perfect perfect perfect cool cool um all right yeah so a couple updates here and we have some of the dev con team here as well uh uh akil wesley uh tomo i think there's a couple others tuned in here as well so feel free to jump in guys if i miss anything but um but yeah i mentioned earlier so unfortunately not going to be just giving any insight or alpha on the date as even our team is not yet aware of this or have decided yet so uh we are hoping it will happen soon it will happen at some point in bogus and colombia so stay tuned for that um and um and yeah so i guess this is the super fizz mentioned a couple times this is the last of the quests with easttaker that are planned but this isn't the last of the quests overall the road to dev con continues uh until devcon happens uh and so first a big a big shout out and thanks to all the whole eat sticker crew for putting together this quest and the last quest the the painting party one these have been awesome uh and much appreciated to all of you guys there um it's been this has been pretty fun um but we want to continue on with requests on the road to devcon and we are looking for community submissions so if any of you guys out there are part of our community or have an interesting idea whether it be an event a game or even some sort of web 3 application that you guys have built that could be a little bit of a fun quest or encourage people to do anything that really encourages people to stay involved in the community learn engage experiment uh is stuff that we'd like to promote um and uh we recognize the community's important part in this ethereum ecosystem and so uh we want to continue um organ guys getting everyone together as much as we can so um so yeah i guess that's the first part of the updates if you guys have any questions ideas feel free to submit them as a hint we might be having a little uh um past the torch um nft game coming through for the next quest so keep an eye out on our twitter and uh uh probably our twitter and the discord channel for more information there um and if you have ideas feel free to post them in discord or reach out on the forum or whatnot uh and then another thing i wanted to pitch also which we'll be announcing this week but for those of you here on the call uh and tuning in via the live stream a little bit of an alpha uh we're going to be launching a grants round uh for uh called the road to devcon community events grant rounds uh in the recognition that there are a lot of like so we we want to continue to encourage community events to be happening um until devcon comes along so we're going to be giving out some funding for community events uh to happen between now and devcon so that could be an in-person event if your region permits could be a meet-up it could be a virtual event um it could be a hackathon anything anything from a size of a small meet up to a larger event uh we'll be putting out an application this week for you guys to apply to uh and potentially receive some funding and get some publicity from the road to devcon effort so keep an eye out for that on our twitter at efdevcon uh and would love to see some applications come through there and some more community events whether they are in person or virtual happening between now and devcon um so those are the two updates i guess i wanted to put out there submit a quest ideas and community event ideas and uh let's see what else do they have i get it today um any other questions that are out there maybe i don't know if you wanna start the raffle now or if akila wesley or tomo want to speak up about anything um i missed then i'm just going to jump in here so uh we do want to quickly distribute the poep claims to the people that actually participated in the quiz because they will want to use them for the raffle that's going to take uh michael or and vetican me about probably three minutes to do so if you guys can keep discussing while we quickly knock this out that'd be helpful thank you akilah you had ping me about something do you want do you want to go uh yeah i think i can i can go for it but i'd need some screen sharing if that's possible sure absolutely there you go sir your coast so essentially the last time we got together in person was ecc and second since then pohap has kind of been a really key feature to the community bringing together each taker bringing together many other core communities in the in the ethereum ecosystem um but you would assume that considering the fact that co-app is supposed to be for events um the success of them within the clovis season is quite questionable so it got me thinking is there a connection between patricio and the fact that he was at hcc and the fact that we've gone into lockdowns um and then all of a sudden i see a tweet from him yesterday um two weeks prior to ecc being in paris so i was wondering who's really behind this pandemic at the end of the day and who really benefited from it um and i would i'd love to ask patricia what are you doing in pairs at this point so so um i wasn't prepared to be discovered so early i mean this wasn't something to remain hidden um but before at cc i was invited to a panel in denver and i was as i i was asked what were our plans for for 2020 and in our most ambitious stretch goal we wouldn't have grown the way we've grown uh because of the pandemic so so yeah i have to admit that i flew to china and i put some bats on the soup and that's how we might pop up the thing that is now and and something worth noting we no longer identify pov as an application for events because that was too limiting now we just do digital collectibles um some of these visual collections could be for events but now it's pretty much for anything you want to have a digital bookmark so so it was a good time for revealing these truths so thank you very much if you thought that you were spoiling something so i think one of the core components of patricia being in the ecosystem is his lovely red jacket but i think with the recent tweet we have to kind of take the opportunity and provide him the resources and come together as a community to provide him all the condiment uh flavored shirts for him to be the new uniform with any in-person events so if you ever see him at ecc or anywhere in the future please donate a condiment shirt to him that it will be his new uniform going forward um condiments are important so we'll be starting at down to get different condiments shirts uh funded for patricio um we do have a website up we do have a doll getting collectively created so if you do want to join the dao please uh go to condiment.recipes or scan the qr code and fill out the form and then um we'll be hopefully seeing parties here and a lot more condiment shirts moving forward okay guys remember when you see patricio in a dijon mustard shirt that's the top sell then so i've already bought him a sriracha shirt so we need more participants to get him the higher class shirts and then maybe we can create some sort of token economics around those stakes thank you thank you um my my closet will be really appreciative of this who won't be too happy it's my dry cleaner again just make sure when you do come back to paris bring another suitcase because uh hopefully with ecc there'll be an influx of t-shirts for you i think it would be so fun you look like a medium are you immediate are you a medium um i'm a small a small or a small small condiment t-shirts for trees protein up small condiment shirts i'm on it that was great akil thank you so much for uh for sharing some fun he had mentioned that and i was like i don't know what he's gonna do but akil always provides so uh thanks for your time uh if i can check back in with colfax what's what's our status look like uh we're getting really close um just almost all the way through the people that need claims here just following up the last couple folks so maybe another minute and a half we'll be done so now is a great time probably to talk about uh the london upgrade that's coming august 4th um the next pivot for each staker will be encouraging anyone who's running a staking node to upgrade their eth1 client and what we understand is that eth1 client upgrade updates should be available on monday that would be the 12th and that the ef is going to post a blog around wednesday the 14th when the ef posts their blog about that uh eth1 client upgrade then we're going to start talking a lot and tweeting a lot posting on reddit a lot about how to upgrade your client or the need for that michael do we have well michael might be working on something right now are you engaged i was going to ask do we have plans for an eth one upgrade workshop kind of thing because i i know even when i updated my my own instance of death the other day um i had to resync from scratch uh do we have an idea a plan for that uh yeah not formally but we're definitely due for another e-staker workshop to kind of go over some of those events um i see no reason why if not before uh months end uh early august we can uh post that so stay tuned to the e-staker youtube page we always pre-stage those events and also the e-staker website eastaker.cc when upcoming events are posted our event calendar is updated very regularly so check that out to keep posted awesome and you probably know that uh coin cashew and summer assat also provide guides for updating um the target time to do that would be really the midpoint between uh july 14th and august 4th which is probably going to be about july 22nd that's like the optimal time it means that clients will have had time to work bugs out of their eth1 client and it still gives you plenty of lead time before the upgrade if you're not clear if you run a eth2 validator you must upgrade your eth1 client before the london fork so just want to make sure that we we begin pushing that early awesome yeah i'm looking forward to that workshop michael i'm happy to help out with that sweet so in the next couple minutes while we finish passing out a few more poeps i'm just going to share my screen and show the raffle one more time and we can kick it off here pretty soon and i want to give anyone who's watching a heads up uh the raffle is our last event for this call um and probably in the next 15 minutes we will finish the raffle and wrap up if if you're looking at a schedule so yeah but once we kick off the raffle i'll explain the mechanism of how it works but it usually takes about 10 or 15 minutes to identify the winners and um yeah and then we'll wrap things up after that we're good so awesome so it looks like all the pop-ups have been distributed um and now we have 256 entries okay great so it's just about doubled and uh let's go ahead and kick it off so it's scheduled to go in 30 minutes since uh i'm the moderator for this i'm actually just going to start it right now can we before you hit that um i just realized that i hadn't joined and i want to make sure that everyone i'm hosting a call give me a break that everyone who who is watching knows they need to go to pub.fun 329 and hit join raffle um many people have done that i'm sure some people are have scattered brains right now maybe you're excited because you just won or something but um just want to give everyone like five more seconds to make sure they get there because i was feverishly typing away um five seconds granted make it um yeah and refresh to see maybe also maybe it's also important to just explain real quickly what what what we're raffling off here and so that there are they are um builder their discounts to uh be able to buy a devcon ticket when they are released which they are not released yet um at a discounted rate so traditionally in the past we've had these uh builder discounts which are which are discounts given out to community members that most people apply for but here we are giving them out to uh three lucky community winners who win the raffle here who have obviously uh been a part of the community playing in these various quests along the road to defcon um and so um yeah so it's a it's a discount and an opportunity to get a ticket because in the past they've also sold out so um it's sort of a double double bonus i guess yeah it's pretty exciting thank you skyler and i relinquished my paws amazing so now if you haven't entered yet you are you're out we're starting wait a it no participant hit refresh maybe yeah let me hit refresh on this so for anyone who doesn't know uh when this number one poep.fun is an open protocol anybody with poeps can create their own raffle and so this is like a demo you can go and do this anytime you want to this raffle uses the gas amount for the last block to select winners so it is hmm should i go ahead and click start anyway guys you should you should still be able to initiate it all right cool let's hit it boom there's all these participating co-ops great i'm very impressed that the animated poep at the very top of the screen shows up even in the tiny icon i know isn't that cool yeah that's that's awesome so uh logic beach is a a kind of a friend of each staker he's a a really talented guy who creates puzzles um and his latest puzzle is it's not super difficult but it's it's a fun one uh that plays with a nautilus image so you can find him at logicbeach on twitter i believe yeah soda oh no one of mine just got eliminated um to talk a little bit more about the mechanism that it uses to pick um as superfiz was talking about every block that goes by the amount of gas used in that block this number pops up here and the last number so this is six all of the poaps with an id that end in six get eliminated it's the next block that comes when we see it it'll be another number and it'll eliminate those so i had two now one of mine's already eliminated so i only have one left in the game and you see the leaderboard is uh being created here so it ranks everybody all the way from one all the way down to the bottom so just because you're here on the leaderboard doesn't necessarily mean you win you need to get one of the top three slots but you can see all these uh co-ops have been eliminated we're going to be eliminating a few more i'm already out looks like i'll be paying full price trying to pay full price i know the real benefit may not be the discount but the opportunity to buy a ticket yeah i'm kidding yep i'm out now too right both mines so who got the free ticket was chains then the second who was the run it up uh let me go check i do have it posted there we go uh e rebels was after james carnley and then j and then silent 666. uh do you want to do uh another tab and do like a side by side so we can do the leaderboard and the block number yeah why don't we do that [Music] one other thing that i'll actually call it here for poep so superfiz was talking earlier about how it's an open protocol anybody can create poeps anybody can create raffles there's lots of other stuff you can do it's also totally open source and so as a heavy user of poep.fun i thought of a couple enhancements that i thought would make it a little bit more fun for everybody to participate in like adding ens names in here so i actually sent them a pull request to do a couple small enhancements to pull up the fun and that was pretty cool they merged them like within the like i don't know 30 minutes or so it was uh very cool to be able to contribute a little bit back to co-op so if you have some some development skills and you think there could be some improvements i encourage you to try and uh send over a pull request and help improve the website and if you are new to po-op and this is one of your first you know exposures to it uh there is a master class video that logic beach hosted and is posted on the east acre website that goes through how to make a co-op how to interact with the major pillars within the ecosystem of po-op it's incredibly informative i would check that out as well you were great on that call by the way i was very very impressed i was making everything up on on the go that's how we do it i i would definitely recommend that poet master class video is that that's on e-sticker you said is that right yep that's on our youtube uh youtube.com i think we have a vanity url now yes we do all right so how we doing 59 left 59 left oh super face we're out no one of yours just got eliminated see two super fizzes eliminated skyler i'm gonna dm you [Laughter] special access to tickets is that what you're is that what can you add me on that uh but i guess so on the top of the ticketing at devcon so historically yes we have sold out of tickets um sort of similar to like what eats ecc is experiencing now um and we sort of anticipate that probably happening again but we'll see we did try to find a larger venue this year we do anticipate having a larger capacity we want everyone to who wants to attend to be able to attend um but there is obviously a venue in capacity restriction um so uh we are also trying something new this year in which a large large portion of our tickets will be distributed through our traditional ticketing system which is open source but it is not blockchain based necessarily by default um but we will be trying to um do an auction and raffle on chain this year uh which we did experiment with a little bit last year um but do an on-chain auction raffle for devcon tickets um when when we go on sale with the tickets uh and so so if you have 10 000 ether and you really want a ticket it'll be some it'll be some degree of a small portion of those uh auctioned off in the large large portion of this raffled off uh i think it's more fair that way i like i i personally prefer fairness over uh i mean the auction is the most efficient way to do it but i like fair um so we'll be doing a small portion of tickets on chain auction raffled off so there is an opportunity to uh and i think that's actually a more fair way to do it than than what we traditionally do is waves as well so we usually do three or so waves of ticketing where um we released a certain number of tickets on the first wave those sell out then we released another another set of tickets the second wave uh and what that preference is people who are awake at that time and who have the fastest internet connection maybe closest to the servers that's um to to where the servers are hosting the ticketing uh system and um and so that's also not not i don't think that's really i i like the idea of a of a raffle uh on chain where anybody can verify that it's uh that's done correctly and can enter um without rush um i think that's kind of a more interesting way to do we should introduce you to fun it's a great a great fair raffle system absolutely yeah i think it is really cool yeah i also i really like this so this uses the the the how does it like random the gas the gas limit of the last block and it uses the last digit or digits of that um i want to point out before i go too far that uh ben edgington may be uh he's he's rocking on this but um it's actually colfax explains this very frequently and so does michael but uh do you guys want to see it i think that's just explain it maybe it wasn't yeah i'll give it another shot so yeah it's the gas that's used in each passing ethereum block and so this is the amount of gas that was used so this last digit here is the important one it's a zero and so anybody so then if you see here the poep id so this one here for neil's that ethan's four eight five six or sorry nine six five this last digit if it matches the last digit in the gas then you get eliminated so you'll notice all these probably have the same last digit they're all fives because a five hasn't come up to eliminate all the people that end in five and so you'll imagine everyone's gonna have the same number at the end so then what happens next uh great question we moved over to the next digit in the poep id and so then we'll progressively eliminate more and more and i've never seen it burn through the entire poep idea i mean they're of course going to be unique numbers so eventually uh we'll get down to one winner sometimes it takes a little bit longer sometimes it takes a little bit shorter depending on uh how frequently numbers are repeated in the gas box but it's a very interesting source of i guess at least somewhat randomness it's pretty random not maybe not entirely random but it's uh a decentralized way to get some entropy which is cool very interesting could it be gamed oh it's the leaderboard coming there are 12 left and i'm officially eliminated unfortunately so skyler i'll hit you up on dms yeah i already see this patricio skyler asks if if if poep.fun is gameable one could argue that miners may have a small edge but it's unreasonable to think that miners could enable all the technicalities to uh to alter the results on something that doesn't have millions of dollars at the stake well they they vote now right for gas price or it's an average of of the votes isn't that right yeah but they don't get to pick who wins they only get to pick who doesn't win so it's not that they make themselves win they they couldn't yeah because also they don't get to click their power number so so it's extremely hard to game uh mathematically sure it could happen but at the same time also miners don't know which blocks they will be awarded so maybe they get eliminated before they have the ability to manipulate the gas limit so we are looking for a two a five or a six right now um we're looking for gas that ends in two five or six to eliminate the next batch so skyler not to put you on the spot here and if if this question has already been uh asked i apologize could sort of get lost in doing the live stream production uh but we're sort of you know this this sort of signifies the wrap up of quest three uh for road to devcon is there sort of like an alpha leak or or anything in the works for quest four coming down the road yeah so um so we are working on quest four um it will likely be in the form of a a little web three dap game uh largely i think built on scaffold eth uh austin griffith is helping us out uh and um if you think about the olympics and how there is a torch that gets passed from community community person to person uh on the way to the olympics um that might be a little hint towards what to expect in uh in this web 3 game um so okay so keep an eye out there for quest for details um and uh yeah we'll see what happens that'll be fun for an alpha version of that check out the the twitter hacky sack game that's just gonna say it sounds exactly like it we started working on it we started working on it long before and i actually gave an alpha to fizz when we did see the hacky sack so i think you guys copied us that's right we referred oh no but if you have any learnings from that maybe maybe toss them over is it still going on yeah well uh i i think the sack is is is on ice right now i'm not sure it it got tossed quite a few times and then we sort of uh found that some people were slower to kick the sack uh and so um i got my success from it was a really neat nft um by and i'm sorry i don't remember his last name but jonathan uh is a musician created an ft and i absolutely love it it's in my um it's on my nft gallery on openc under superfiz.eth but it's it's just a song with all of the people who who ended up with a hacky sack along the way um it it made my day so really cool thing all right i have to introduce you these are the winners these the top two when they're builder defcon tickets so congratulations
