we're live on this call for the Istanbul upgrade community call Annette take it away welcome everybody so III Magicians decided to kick this call up as we see there is a huge huge chance for the community to ask questions about Istanbul Harford that is coming very soon so we collected some questions from the community and the community output and we would like to present and get the answers on those questions on today's Hudson can you please tell us something about Hartford's sure so a heart for core and network upgrade basically is just like the same thing as it like what you would do with the software upgrade to make your software like the program you're using more robust have extra security features things like that but we're doing it on a blockchain I think there's a lot of people on the call today that can give us some insight there from the etherium magicians etherium cat herders and we even have a core dev on here who can help us with some of the technical stuff we may have some other people joining later so what we'll do is we'll go around and let's introduce everybody I'll say your name and then you just give a brief introduction and then I'll go to the next person so I can start my name is Hudson Jameson I work for the etherium foundation doing DevOps security and community coordination I also run the bi-weekly core developer meetings where a lot of the network upgrade ES and other things are decided I do a lot of stuff on Twitter you can find me at hudson jameson on there real easy and that's about it for me Annette do you want to go next sure so they're from magicians basically running the firm and we are collecting the outputs from the community and we are trying to explain for the community water use in Syria and thank you okay James my name is James Hancock I am a hardcore coordinator for aetherium I spend most of my time dealing with AIPS and as well as working with eath 1x okay puja idiom cat herders team I help all core developers with note-taking and coordination part and I spend most of the time with community interaction giving them updates okay Jim hi everyone my name is Tim I'm part of the Pegasus team so I work on their client hyper ledger base you and I'm also part of the etherium catheters awesome all right we got Helena hey I am part of the Department of decentralization as well I do community communications events all those kind of things great and then finally Martin hi I'm Rhonda I also work with it's very own plantation with minutes security or etherium security and also I'm one of the coders behind gifts okay great we have all the introductions out of the way and and that you mentioned talking about what hard forks are and what the effects they have on the ecosystem and stuff like that and I think James is gonna be the perfect person to talk about that and then if anyone else on the call has something to bring up about that then go right ahead but let's have James start out yep so as Hudson and said earlier hard Forks for aetherium is part of upgrading and the easiest way I like to think about blockchains is it's a bunch of computers trying to agree on this same set of data and all of those clients need to interpret that data the same way spread the data the same way and that and they have consensus on the data itself and how they process it so what it is you norm in a normal software cycle you can update something and then just send it out and people agree with and run the updates what is different about a blockchain is it sort of runs on its own that runs in consensus and whenever there's a change that affects that consensus then it creates - it creates a hard fork where you have the original chain going down one and the and the other chain going down another and and I think that's a pretty high level acceptable explanation I think so anyone else want to chime in on their view from what the expectation is for a hard fork yeah that was a really good explanation so there might not be much more to say let's see who wants to talk a little bit about Istanbul specifically and that do you have someone in mind or did you have something you had written down I would like - I think that James can actually start and he can said recap like how many a piece were included why eight eyepiece made it happen there are yes yeah yeah thanks James Andy IPS or aetherium improvement pizzas so what we do is we take the dough in the sauce and actually James will explain what they actually uh yeah a theory improve proposals I would enjoy it there are pizzas honestly and they come from all sorts of places like this last one we had some from stark ware or individuals working with stark ware and others and from people within the community and they submit a proposal and there's a process what we as core dads go through trying to sift out which ones make sense and then also which ones end up getting adopted so I think I'm sharing my screen you definitely are and so Istanbul now it ended with these yuppies here it started the process I think is December or November of last year is where we really started cracking down January February March we had a list of 35 or so VIPs that are all listed here that all applied to be in Istanbul hard fork and we we went through one by one and and evaluated them and did did such and some of them got pushed through some more some of them didn't depending on the community authors I mean the the authors of their proposals because a lot of this is driven by the community members who submit them and after here's another kind of a lot of these things depended on a lot of decisions on each other so we spend a lot of time working on on those as well until the end where we narrowed it down to these one two three four five six seven t IP s which is I don't know if it's the most that's been implemented but it's at one time but it's definitely getting there and do you want me to go into those or is that you want an over more overview of Istanbul perhaps maybe some more questions yeah I'm curious about why I think that actually Martin swanda is the author of that IP that was called as the most controversial so 1884 it's the one that is probably the most controversial what it does is that it reprise a certain operations that over the last couple of years have become pretty heavily mispriced and the reason that they have become mispriced is because they depend on the basically the density or the tribe they state try and the more dense they try is the more hopes the node needs to do in order to look up the data and initially these operations they were very cheap and we did the repricing at certain points and now it's basically time to do it again and this concerns the s load which reached a storage try and the balance which reads in an external well another account and checks the balance and there's also the X code hash so that these three are replaced but we're also adding the newer code called self policy so a contract can call it check is our own balance without paying 700 gas but only a five and yeah I think anyone without being extremely technical can actually look at the EEP itself which contains some charts and numbers and you can see how this imbalance has evolved over time and so the controversy regarding this is that the behavior will cause certain flows to break I won't say I mean there are different ways that a contract can break over that what this most typically will do is cause certain flows where contracts invoke each other and that might start breaking in some cases in other cases it's just the only real change will be that the end user who does the the the transaction will have to provide a little more gas yeah I think I think that's kind of the summary of it I don't know how far it I just wanted to like and those changes like if you can and so I think it's a couple of different things one is that deaf developers should not have default functions that do lookups in in the state right so they should avoid that as much as possible but that is not really so I think there's a large change change of mentality that is needed and I think that is right now a lot of contracts are pretty defensive about gas and whenever they want to transfer some ether from one place to another they use the solidity construct transfer and transfer does not pass along in a gas so the receiver will get the a gas of 2300 gas to play with and issue a log or something and this has been basically considered best practice ever since the world discovered we entrance e attacks and that's a bit unfortunate and I think a better approach going forward is to actually not use the solidity transfer mechanism but actually provide a lot of gas to the recipients and use basically mutexes or re-entrance of protection in some form to prevent reaction C attacks because relying on on low levels of gas to protect the country and Rosie attacks is a bit may it's not it's not a good way to handle that you should protect against reaction say but you should not use low gas as a primary mechanism yeah and I think this question actually brings a couple of other questions I've been seeing across the reddit forum where people were asking number one should they be concerned if they're borrowing on defy and like they are if they're borrowing on defy and they're trying to lend out money or use a DAP and to me the answer to that is it depends on the DAP but a lot of them have upgrade mechanisms that make it still safe to work on and any defy application that's sufficiently mature and not really scammy is going to have those things in place is kind of my answer does anyone else have an answer with that yeah I would agree with that and I would also say that I mean any kind of mature defy or basically any matured app has a couple of months to play with these rules on Roxton rinkeby and girly to see the effects see if it works if they use the flows still work yeah so there has been a playground available and a stable enable playground or several of them so I'm I would think that the current you know ecosystem o of mature defy apps are prepared for this yep having that sounds right to nothing said that I have not looked into the application layer on the defy application layer in and the depth myself great I thought that was a good answer and everyone on YouTube is seeming to understand it cuz in the chat people are saying oh yeah it's just making things more expensive than increasing the to safeguard the blockchain from spam attacks so yeah that came across really well let's see what's some other questions and that what's the next one oh we can't hear you and that if you're trying to I'm so sorry it was me so the next question is if - now that the process will be provoked stable stickers be able to stay various I think that's actually more of an eighth 2.0 question isn't it I'd also say that it's not some that minors aren't really the deciding factor as well at least are you are you meaning for a fork to be accepted but that the minors are deciding whether or not is that what you mean by that question I mean this was this was a question that came up from a reddit post but I feel like community still has so many misconceptions and they think that actually Istanbul is going to be still playing oh like in your heart it's going to be some kind of soup I know update which is not true so we should make this clear yeah so I think that question is basically a big misunderstanding from the beginning but having said that in the in the - dot Island which we're not at all talking about today in this call a Staker would not be able to stake on various Forks because that would be penalized ball behavior and if they contradict themselves which the minor can do now but I think we can basically it skipped that question because yeah I don't really understand what what it means I kind of understand what it means I think that like the stagers will be able to stake on various forks if like the blockchain forks cuz that's just how it works but with DES if there is a blockchain fork that minority fork that has less stay curzon it is that going to be more secure than the other one we probably not so that'll make it people not want to stick to that minority fork if that were to happen I think that's the answer than short security of the chain that doesn't make more sense ok [Music] let's talk about this topic because there is definitely some kind of the community side that okay now it's Berlin and what about the next Hartford and I stand next Hartford the Berlin was moved to I mean it was renamed to mine was here so I can go into that so we we looked at addressing the the difficulty bomb in or the Ice Age in Istanbul and we decided to not do that thinking that it would show up later than it did it started showing up earlier than we had expected and because of that the block times of aetherium are currently increasing and it will continue an increase until there is a hard fork that addresses the ice age specifically which Istanbul does not so with that in mind we have we put we're actually calling up your glacier after a glacier that's in the US that is receding and that fork will be specifically for addressing the ice age and that is it and it will happen four or five weeks like this second week of January for a second week of January and that will keep the block team from having from aetherium from having even more higher block times during that time and then Berlin will be what follows after that and that will include upgrades to the chain and such and the reason we didn't want to have Berlin be this one is because there are many upgrades that were trying to get many IPS that are getting ready to get into Istanbul I mean into Berlin and we didn't want to have a discontinuity and expectations from the community about what Berlin could contain so I have like a kind of a similar question or not a similar but an ancillary question for Helena and puja and Tim what what do you all think have been the kind of the difficult part of having these two forks so close together as far as like the cat herders generally contact exchanges and mining pools and stuff like that so how is that more difficult by having these two forks together puja you can go first if you have any comment yeah it is it is not very easy to put everybody on same page if the time is very less but yes we are trying to update them with our regular updates like we have aetherium blog update which particular version of the software that you should be going into if you are running on node about it and we are trying to educate them with subsequent post that this is going to be a shorter period but the heart folk the upcoming hard work will not be containing so many EAB so it would be not very difficult to upgrade you just have to move from one version to the another version and we are trying to clarify reaching out to these miners and people who are running notes there say would you like to have something on it sure yeah I think it will be like quite different than the previous upgrades and we really want to be sure that like people know that there's a second one coming I think in an ideal world there would have been two upgrades for this but here we are so yeah we just have to be really good at communicating that to the community that you know I think by the end of this week or next week we should have the clients ready for pretty much all all the clients so once we get that we probably want to be very clear about communicating that they need to upgrade - that's a flameless version and not just the Istanbul one I would like to add one thing here this is this is going into two parts just for the convenience not for the confusion so yes we are trying to create the clarity with the help of communication that we are sending out and then finally Helena real quick you said that you work for the Department of decentralisation so what is your perspective on how this is how this should be communicated and how people will respond based on how you all look like advertised for events before and stuff like that yeah I think it's just also you know I mean we're trying to you also from the cat had his point of view you know we're trying to put as much clear communication out as possible but I think you know I think it's important it's the community themselves or if anybody has any questions or feel like they weren't certain things clarified I think it's important they reach out to us and then we can kind of figure out how we can address this as well and make sure we're answering everybody's questions clearly great that was all the questions there's some questions I had about the communication strategy since I know that it's important for us to all reach out so yeah and that get us back on track sorry for putting us off track I wanted to say one clarifying thing just for people listening at the community once the your glacier is released you don't you you can just skip to that number so just get download get the latest version you don't need to go through Berlin you don't need to go through Istanbul and then your glacier just make sure you're at the latest version that comes out for your clients yeah thank you [Music] so question will any of the chances in Istanbul way to increase in TPS like a fruit roll-up this is like a crypto cryptography thing and what it does is it allows you to bundle a lot of transactions using zero knowledge proof and basically you can put like something like two or three thousand transactions per second within these roll-ups it's usually very expensive in fact too expensive to do on the etherion blockchain today but because we are reducing gas cost of stuff like call data I believe that that can be used yeah look extra them to go to the motivation section James down there the main benefits of reducing call data are that it would let me let's see we real quick Oh for layer two scalability for Starks and snarks as more data can fit into a single block so that's where I've heard about transactions per second increases anybody else so yeah basically advanced math will allow us to fit more stuff in there as well as do other really cool things about putting like having a Z cache bridge and stuff like that yeah I just clarify though I mean on the raw infrastructure level there there's nothing that enables more transactions per second but as you said there might be possibilities to do second layer solutions more efficiently in the reduction of gas it's more like that even though the transactions per second haven't been increased the capacity what those transactions are able to do because they have you can do more of these for example the call data's because they cost so much less like what you can do with the transaction is as far as smart contracts and codes are concerned it is expanded so in a way it's a throughput increase but without but not a transaction increase unless they totally got that wrong that sounds right to me that's the Muir glacier right I know what we talked about earlier with the Muir glacier hard fork where we're just delaying the difficulty bomb by two years while we figure out what to do with the difficulty bomb and yeah we'd so yeah that's that's pretty pretty straightforward what's going on there so what else is there here what does compatibility with sea cash actually mean so does anyone have any insight into what like there's one EIP in particular that talks about compatibility with Zee cash mahesh pow within an aetherium contract to enable a relay and atomic swap transaction between Z cash so there was a community question like this implementation of this ki IP this upgrade would we be able to move Z cash in ethereal auditorium in Z costume got it okay oh and before we answer this Thomas is here he is with the nether mine team do you want to give a quick intro Thomas yeah sure say was another mind we've been from the very beginning for DOF Istanbul with the other main violence if you have any questions for further Korea peace and what Harvey that means great thank you James did you I thought you were about to talk it I interrupted you is that what did you have any oh yeah so interoperability with Z cache as a couple parts there's our our side is this e IP 152 which adds Blake to B so that you can do bill so it enables to be able to build relays in atomic swaps which means I can exchange eath for Z cache essentially the other part is Z cache is also working on there and to add interoperability for aetherium and there they have a hard fork scheduled for early next year for the in the first like first quarter of next year that will make that possible and matt Luongo at is and his team keep key are working on that so they they they implemented this and then they are also implementing the z cache side and they're working on that kind of Atomics relay between the change so James I have a question here I'm just curious to know like is it extended version of the baby Zoe Project that V cash on aetherium Bridge project so it does this VIP gonna act as a bridge this AI p is preparation for a bridge got a thing between the two and that is being worked on yes the baby Zoe project was super exciting it was about three years ago yeah about three years ago now that the there was during an IC three aetherium conference or I guess the more technical discussion week and they made a contract and a pre compile on aetherium to enable the atomic transfer of atomic swap transactions between the cash and aetherium so you could basically have little Z cash tokens on aetherium so they called it baby Zoe because it was the first iteration of that type of idea between Z cash and aetherium and it worked in a very isolated setting but it was incredibly expensive to do at the time because we didn't have the right pre compiles so they had to build one from scratch now they're making it so that there's a real pre-compiled to verify the equi hash proof of work and that's going to yeah improve previous pre compiles to make them Blake Blake to be F compatible which is like super complicated but basically it's the kind of language that Zee cash needs to be able to be interoperable with aetherium this is great like we are working so much on interoperability I'm sure that all the blockchain working together will be making it more decentralized world I think a good parallel way to think about it is technically being able to do Blake to be as possible through software which is kind of like a higher lower level but if you really want something fast you build it at hardware and making it a pre-compile is sort of like plug like doing it direct getting things done immediately immediately compared to having to write something in solidity which would be too expensive and probably not even possible may not have been possible to fit into a block at a time yeah actually like Martin how would you describe what a pre-compile is yeah I think also describe it pretty well once upon a time or if it was Martin big PC back in the day when we had these early internet browsers and we had flash plugins that could stay you know VRML and do cool things and the pre-compliance are basically the flash plugins for blockchain so instead of just interpreting every you know a contract is just a stream of bytes and then we interpret each bytes and do an operation and interpret the next bytes to an operation and in a pre compile we can just come directly to a piece of code that is compiled on the on the local node the local machine that is running on and yeah skip that this interpreter through the EVM and just execute directly on that thing which we call a pre compile and when we do so we basically set the gas price depending on the input instead of depending on the actual number of cycles and things like that so yeah it allows us to use native speed computation instead of interpreter speed computation basically did I make sense yeah I thought that was really good I've never heard it described as the Flash plugin of etherium or the flash plugins of etherium rather that's a really good way to put it let's see what other questions are there oh I saw one on reddit it's actually not on the list that we have been adding them to but what one person said if I have my coins and my ether wallet or my crypto or an online wallet well I have to do anything for this hard fork which kind of implies will there be two different coins afterwards like there were four aetherium and aetherium classic and the answer I usually give for a fork like this and network upgrade like this is that because it's not controversial there's not anything you really need to do if you're using stuff like a ledger Hardware wallet a treasurer Hardware wallet or any of the many online aetherium wallets that you're trusting to hold your coins same with exchanges exchanges are being made aware of this and actually we can go to the Istanbul tracker I think the ether nodes one and it has a list of the exchanges that have upgraded but uh that's actually inaccurate right now of them I would like to add that yeah sure I mean even if it's a constant conscience conscientious heart Fork there's there's nothing you need to do if it splits then you have your money on to change and historically as far as I know and I might be wrong about this and there might be different cases I think that in the cases where there have been concerns is hard for us and there have been changed let's that exchanges have actually split it for you I mean so that if you had X ether then you later had 10 ether antenna you see but I mean generally shouldn't have large amounts of money on exchanges but there's really nothing you need to do in beforehand even if it's contentious if you have it on a wallet that you control and you can resolve it later if there's any need to kind of just do some kind of operations to ensure that there's no double spending across the two chains I guess the one exception I have in my mind and you can probably answer this for me because I've kind of been confused about this myself if I have like a ledger nano and it doesn't let me export the private key then if it does split into two and ledger doesn't have software to support the other chain then what would happen is that a case where I need to take my coins off or leave them on and hope that software is made these so we're talking about the example where where you don't have this replay protection because there's a contentious split no one who would happen real and what there wasn't a new a new fork ID given in that case yeah you it would be better to create a new private key of the device and make sure that that's that you get the new actually it doesn't really matter because I think if that happens like it did way back with with a disease but what happened on the ecosystem was that people implemented these Oracle's these contract Oracle's so you could basically send your money to one of these Oracle's and it would split or not and you could set okay so if it's only if this transaction is replayed on the e-2c chain then I want the proceeds to go to this wallet if it's executed on the ETH chain I want the proceeds go to that other wallet so even without replay protection is fully possible to do splits to do split and split your your assets up differently on the two chains and okay I didn't for you to have the private key although I I mean really you shouldn't have it on a hardware wallet which you cannot reconstruct the private key for Hudson yeah I guess you're right okay and I P 1344 I think actually specifically addresses that as well by adding in chain ID to prevent this replay attacks between different genes yeah I think the idea though is mostly I mean we have replay protection across change but it's not a transaction level we don't have it on the actual chain level so actually smart contracts currently today are not aware of chain ID and that is mainly problematic when we want to verify intentions by a signature so you have a contract and it checks not the actual transaction but it checks the signature that is passed along transaction and now we want to make sure that this signature was not only meant for this contract not only meant for this time but it was also meant for this particular chain this particular instance of the contract on this particular chain and now that can be verified which was difficult or actually impossible earlier so if you want to do a similar thing earlier you had a basically December big wait these by their address where which is also fully possible but a bit more work so for example we have for it for a gift we have something called the CH T economical hash table oracles which knows about particular hashes for block numbers and can tell notes which are thinking that economical hash for block blahblah is something and we have these contracts rolled out on girl in rinkeby and robson and we have them at different addresses and we want to update them we just feed them our signatures with the new data for the canonical hash ashes and they need to verify this is the signature by martin and peter felix and it's sent to me at this address and since we do that we don't actually have to verify the the chain ID because we know that we're there at they have different addresses of the difference chains but in the future we could have done is to deploy them all at the same address and then use the charity to design with big weight okay that works yeah you have this table that like has the just to make sure I understand it there's a table that's in the client itself that has the block hashes of blocks for various chains so you know which chain you're on did I get that yeah so we have the canonical hashes for certain period blocks so that if you do a fasting you can verify that you are on but you're landing after the canonical hash and that the carrier sinking is not just going away somewhere else and also helps the light clients to know that they are actually on the right chain okay great answer I didn't know that so the moral of the story is if you were running a node of grade your node and that's the thing to be worried about as far as worrying about coins don't yeah yeah that's pretty much what what that's exactly the moral of the story a net if you I know you have to leave soon so I know pooja posted some questions in the zoom chat that we could talk about or if you have a question that you want to pick up before you have to leave these questions are from the live chat of YouTube a user is asking about like is there any way to remove gas fee for ERC 20 tokens so I know you can abstract the gas via way so I think there's kind of two answers like is there a way to do this on chain like at layer 1 and then the second way to think about it is it's their way to do this at layer 2 or like human intervention so that the gas fee goes away does anyone have more I know that there's like gas station network and other things like that does anyone have any insight into that maybe Thomas or Tim or James or anyone who's heard about this maybe Martin first I want to say that it's simple isn't addressing this yeah that's actually that's a good core point yeah we can address this question any future upgrade another question coming up from another user of YouTube they say that developers behind major decline such as jet and parity have one week to integrate the new list of 60 IPS into software is this necessary to prepare the full code implementation of an etherion live robson test network so much so they have one week to integrate developers behind major each clients so they when the the client maybe I miss adore saying the question ro but but when the clients were released was when they were already integrated into the client so there isn't anything and when they are released maybe this will be kind of helpful is step back and think about for how some of our Forks works so when you're down we are downloading a new version of guess or parity or whatever it is that hat that has the Istanbul built in but it actually doesn't get activated like those EIP czar are written into the codebase but they're not functional until a certain block where they become active so they have already been developed they're already been tested they've already been in the case you have them like they're already have been deployed if you have that version it just waits until it's block for everyone to move to having those be activated so it's more of a process thing like we we already have had that version ready so it is not an issue for the developers to implement it over the last three months you know the major clients and the clients already supported on the tested network so the full support for Istanbul is there it's running on Gurley it's running on rinca by it's running in Khan robson test nuts and it was all successful and lots of testing an additional fast testing from all the animals down as well so then you have the list of clients and I think this will be it will be training t8 will be parentid will be GAF and will be nvm eyelets is supporting Istanbul and it was not a week it was around three months to develop yeah thank you for that so the bottom line here is that we should they should look for the right version that is published in the etherium foundation block or dzh block that we let people know that this is the right version and you would be updating see here what's the next question oh this was slated for an hour Martin and we're actually coming up on an hour so we'll probably wrap this up in a few minutes let's just take like one more question how about that where's the list of questions so I would like to in the meanwhile I would like to make a small announcement here like on behalf of aetherium Caturday team I invite all the community members to feel free to interact more with us reach out to us and get ur share your questions concerns and comments and we would try to pass it on to the developers or to the writing they are trying to make ourselves available for any kind of help that we can provide as a kind of bridge between the community and the developers although this is open-source it is not required but we are here for your help oh I have a good question right here is there a list of scheduled aetherium hard Forks after Istanbul as part of an eighth one X which is a comprehensive set of upgrades to the etherium main net intended for near-term adoption I know you've been involved on this but specifically James right yep so moving forward past this we're going to and this is a longer conversation so I'll just say briefly we'll be changing to an EIP focused where as eaps already then we will roll out Forks so we won't be scheduling we're gonna have this work at this time instead we will be working on the backend to get things VIPs ready and then once they're ready they will be deployed and it'll go through this process of being marked as eligible for inclusion then implementations are built there's testings then they get officially accepted and then there's a time for last call and all of that happens then here is where this hard fork would be scheduled so mirror of glacier is really the first one in that it is any IPU specific and they if you focused network upgrade and then moving forward it that is what will be will continue so there isn't there isn't a schedule there is a list of things that e1x are working on and focused on and there's a group that Piper Piper Marion has wreaked to get some of those things developed but there isn't a schedule for them all right I think that was a great last question let's wrap this up thank you everyone for coming thank you from the etherium cat herders from the well I guess and that you can talk to the fellowship of a theory magicians you got any final words also thank you finding that if you're in Berlin update your bio update your nodes everybody and reach out if you have any more questions - yes please do bye bye [Music] [Music] [Music]
