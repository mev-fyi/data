so moving on next up we have a series of small little lightning talks that will tell you all about each track and sort of suggest some things that you just should check out over the course of the week shall we will talk about scalability Sarah will talk about design Brian will talk about privacy Joseph about Prague so fine Piper is developer experience brian de sécurité reefs cover society and systems it's some lightning talks right midnight now first up a shy way here she comes [Applause] [Music] [Music] so hello everyone this is shower and one of the creator of scalability track thanks to all of you a certain community is growing fast oh so this is the eastern tabs gross statics from that's a state of the tabs so many amazing tabs are being researched developed and released every month every day we need Eastern the platform to be scale to support all these good innovations this year in Telkom our speakers will talk about those are scaling solutions and integration topics we have like the layer 1 in Arcola serenity and the shouting the upgrades of the best protocol and some there are two solutions like we have channels plasma side chains another important area is the some fancy cryptography can be used for scaling and moreover more integrations for scaling like we have the swarm like climb client optimizations and some technicality proof mechanism research could be used for improved scaling solutions so let's start from the there choose solutions Josh will bring us his talk making sense of lira true it's an overview that talks that helped us to compare the different types of skill there to solutions he will introduce the hosta trade-off and difference between them and solve them you can actually build a wave right now and more about the layer to tomorrow morning we will have the state to try now breakout plus the different types of them and has the use case of state rhinos and this remoting we will have the plasma breakout plasma is one year old now and the plasma researchers and developers they are here to share the plasma updates and what the developers needs to know before they actually using the plasma technology and day 2 we also have Rendon they work hands-on at holding workshop it's a chance that you can join the workshop hand by hand step by step and butyl does payment China with them and zero knowledge proof is not only used for privacy problem it could also apply to the scaling solutions you may have killed DK snog and DK stark very high head is here he to introduce his work with snag for scaling yes very high had Israel on his stand we're here and we can use the case not technology to have thousands translation per seconds right now and for stark this afternoon we have professor Le Pen session from stock where for the stock workshop so compared to snacks their stock has some barrier properties like it's transparent neurologic proof so it's hard to understand immediately so please join the workshop and to learn it so the last what's going on with serenity it's the real one protocol change Oh so today is more about the overview Vitalik just gave a wonderful keynote speech at least afternoon we have carrot head crypto economic a skill in this room they too is more about research so um two important requirements for the East - Oh shouting or serenity why is the p2p networking Yanik ruin and Kevin child will talk about the shotted network design and another important topic is the random number generator our core researcher judging track is here and she will give you an update of the randomness research d3 is more about a kind implementation we have route Jordan from prismatic labs he will introduce there : implantation and Robert hamper Meyer is here he's wrong thirty technologists who were introduced layer is Chuo implantation with the subtract library so sorry we don't have time to highlight every talk here so please check the agenda and enjoy it thank you [Applause] [Music] hello my name is hello there it is hello my name is Brian I helped organize the security track for Def Con this year one of the organizer the security initiative that we started back in May and collaborate on the security secur F developer guidelines currently work as a smart contract engineer before I found myself in aetherium I had worked at a as a flight that's a flight control software engineer and a company founded by this man Igor Sikorsky like many of you in this room Igor was a pioneer in a burgeoning industry often test piling his own aircraft including the first helicopter ever to fly those early days were full of much discovery and disaster but over a long and problematic history aerospace has found itself to be one of the most trustworthy ways to travel flight software in particular has moved from basic pilot assist to fully autonomous flight over the past 40 years and many consider it some of the most robust software that exists safely carrying millions of passengers a day to their destinations I learned a lot from working at security at Sikorsky but the biggest thing that I learned was that bug free software was a myth it takes a lot of work to make software that deals with human lives this required a transition of thought from a builder's mindset to an engineer's mindset understanding the system as a whole means understanding its strengths and its weaknesses while it isn't possible to make bug-free code it is possible to design systems with their bust tolerance to failure which gives a strong --gel strongest possible foundation for success from that experience I took away four critical aspects of robust design first the discipline to craft each and every line of code you write to the best of your abilities this includes following the guidance of those who came before you and using the best tools you have to fill in the gaps second to think deeply about the potential for failure and what you are building plan how you can best respond to those failures or how to prevent them from happening in the first place third to work with your peers as much as possible robust software is not designed by one person it takes many diverse viewpoints to be successful we should all be asking for feedback from one another and finally that experience is the best teacher when you are building something for the first time resist that urge to test in production if possible and if it is impossible limit the risks you expose yourself and others to make sure to share what you've learned with the community because this is the best way to improve our discipline we need to make sure that we reinforce this mindset as we grow to support the shift in mindset we design programming for Def Con this year that would help you gain exposure through hands-on experience over half our schedule is filled with workshops exploring smart contract vulnerabilities design and analysis using the latest state-of-the-art tools tomorrow morning we'll have a security review preparation workshop that you should attend even if you have never participated in a security review or audit before it will make you a better smart contract engineer by better understanding the processes expert reviewers conduct when they do a security audit on the main stage later today yep we will have an excellent talk about the security incentives and expose some major design flaws and how they can be fixed we'll follow that up tomorrow evening with a panel asking hard questions about some of the biggest issues facing aetherium security we hope this programming will help you along in your journey in gaining the skills you need to be the best at your craft as possible if we all guide each other in thinking critically about our security issues they won't be issues much longer also go Viper [Music] [Applause] hello everyone though does everyone know like it's Halloween today because I just found out this morning and I happen to have a full pumpkin suit from David s pumpkins so yeah alright let's get going I'm giving the overview on the privacy track just a little bit about me I've been in the cryptocurrency space for a bit worked at a bank now I'm at the etherium foundation co-founded oaken innovations in IOT company I have a wife Laura and three wonderful cats Vivian Fry and Leela all right so we got various definitions for privacy if you're not aware of what it is so I just try to make it real simple nothing too advanced it's just you know wanting to be left alone it's wanting freedom from interference and intrusion it's wanting your data to be private and held with yourself instead of it with companies and things like that so I think this is really important stuff I really believe that things like the Equifax breach and other major you know hacks and events really show that privacy is a very important topic and that all these companies have all this data that can be leaked really easily about you Thanks all right our personal data creates a picture our identity you know your go to Google and they you use cookies and other things to save what you're searching to save you know data about you and create this picture that they can sell to governments and corporations and other companies and we really need to take the web back and do something about it I think there's a lot of people here who doing a lot of great talks about privacy which I'm going to go over in a second and I think that it's just a really important thing for all of us to understand and learn more about the people here that they're building the future they really are so here are some of the talks that are going on we got snark Starks and more that's kind of a privacy cryptographic thing that's like black magic I have no idea how it works but it's really cool stuff there's gonna be Elly Benson who's an expert in that the famous Barry White hat he is here we got smart contract privacy including Stefan Gosling and Peter's exactly talking about how to hide transactions on the etherion blockchain and make sure that the metadata doesn't affect other things about it we got privacy fundamentals we got brewster kahle here the web we want it's gonna be an amazing talk go look at the description you're gonna be blown away and the hellhound escape game my most the most exciting thing on this is the hellhound escape game I'm pretty sure if you all know what an escape room is you have to solve puzzles in order to find a key to get out of the room and there's a room set up here with like a piano and couches and all kinds of like puzzles and clues that are all cryptographic cryptography related so you're to have a great time there's a sign-up sheet right outside the room you can look at the guidebook app to see where it's located I also want to just like plug the guide book app real quick and all the other stuff we got going if you go to DEFCON 4 dot aetherium dot org slash app we have this mobile app we also have a web version we also have a Google sheets version so whatever you like to do we got conference maps we got schedules you can add talks to make your own schedule we got all kinds of stuff you can even you know click on the location and it's sending to the right place on the map I think it's a great thing you should download it you should use it and I hope that everyone has a great time at Def Con I know the team's really excited about putting this together and yep everyone have a great time thank you hi there I hope everybody's having a good first day there Def Con I am Piper Miriam I lead the Python team at the etherium Foundation and today I'm here to talk to you about the developer experience track I'm part of a larger curation team which was either lazy or concise because we had roughly one metric that we were shooting for this year how we onboard the next million developers if we want to see the platform get the adoption that we want then we need to bring on a lot more devs a lot more people who work in this industry and in order to do that we need better tools we need better educational material around our tools and we need tools that we don't know that we have yet or that we don't know that we need yet so there is a lot of good stuff in our track there are tons of good talks we are quite Workshop heavy which was very intentional we wanted people to have hands-on experience to learn how to use these things so I'm gonna highlight two things which are sort of the same thing one of them is for people who like Python or who maybe want to learn Python some of the things on this slide or a lie like today is not Tuesday but if you went to the Viper talk yesterday the Viper workshop yesterday you learned a little bit about an upcoming language for writing smart contracts today there's a great talk from one of my teammates Jason Carver a workshop from one of my teammates will Jason Carver about how to use the Python web 3 library and then tomorrow there is a great workshop on package management which by the way is not just a python-based thing similarly if you like JavaScript you can do roughly the same thing again my slides are reliant is not too day but there are a lot of great workshops this week on how to use various of the multiple development frameworks available for JavaScript and similarly there is JavaScript tooling in the smart contract packaging workshop for packaging those contracts up and I'll highlight one more thing which is that these the package management workshop is not just for beginner type things if you are a member of a team with a product or with a set of smart contracts that you want people to be able to use show up and do this I may be overstating it but I believe that if you go to this workshop at the end of it you will have an on chain package registry behind an ENS name with your smart contracts packaged up and deployed and available for consumption over these new api's that are being developed again there are a ton of really good talks in our track look in the guidebook there is lots of stuff on all kinds of fantastic tools open source block explorers multiple development frameworks all of these different things so I hope to see you at some of them thank you [Applause] so I am Sarah Mills and over the past few months I've been working with Mamie Alex Beltre and Johnny and Tara to bring this brand new track to you so why do we need this why do we need a UX and design track this community is working so hard building and shipping and experimenting and I think we're all in agreement that a certain level of mass adoption needs to be achieved so how do we get there well after a highly scientific Twitter and Google search it seems like people are pretty sure one of the answers is UX we really just need to sprinkle some UX on this but honestly what does that mean you know how do we get there what does that look like the truth is everyone here is a designer design is simply the rendering of intent everyone here makes decisions that affect user experience it's really important that you view yourself that way as well now we have might have some people that are gonna say it's it takes years of training to be a designer and that's true to be a good designer there are processes that we learn and refine and iterate upon to make sure that we have successful consistent outcomes but we're not going to get very far by partitioning and isolating design and designers or saying that UX is somebody else's job and I think that we have a really unique opportunity in this particular ecosystem because there's so much to learn and understand and there's no one person that it was everything about everything we are always leaning on each other and teaching each other and so that's why we're so happy to be included here in the first UX and design track what are we hoping to achieve one to spur transformation by sharing insights and lessons learned to connect with each other create community and blur the lines between designers and developers to provide interactive ways of learning design methods for web 3 highlight tools people resources and examples a good design and our biggest goal is that everybody leaves defcon inspired with actionable insights and things that they can do right now to improve their dobbs user experience so I've grouped these talks and workshops and panels in to what you should expect to be doing in them and what you should come away with first is the how-to and process talks so what is a design mindset what should you know and what tools can you use to build for a better user experience next is learning by doing and you know that's one of the most effective ways to absorb not only traditional design methods but the new ways were coming up with for designing for web through users and testing your ideas stories are another excellent way of learning which behaviors and tactics to emulate in which to avoid so learn from both the successes and the mistakes of some of the more prominent products in our ecosystem you all probably know about some of the major stumbling blocks for novice users the things that we must fix right now come actively work on these all levels of experience are welcome but we ask that you show up on time to get the full experience and be ready to do some rapid prototyping but you can get help right now with your debt so in wisteria we have UX audits all week long and you can get help improving your general user flow but also with things like language and copy and onboarding and transaction experiences so you can sign up at this link or you can just go to wisteria and while you're at wisteria you can submit your death for the UX boards and ceremony for the awards will be Friday on the stage so it's an excellent opportunity to showcase what you've been doing submissions close Thursday at noon so again go to this link or just go to wisteria we want to thank the etherium foundation for having the foresight and inclusiveness to make design part of this conversation thank you [Applause] hello world what up so my name is Rhys and I'm talking about the system society and systems track but before I do that first I want to give a big thank you both to all of you for being here to Prague for hosting us and to Yosef who's gonna talk about that and especially to the etherium foundation and Mamie Mamie come out here she's done so much work for this let's give her a round luck seriously a lot of work so with that let's talk about first this is me that was my crypto Twitter handle I work for the MIT Media Lab in their digital currency initiative as a head of community and long-term societal impact and I'm here to talk about the society and systems track so what is this and why is it important I think I touched on some of these things in her talk but the main idea is that tech changes society right you can see this with some of our web 2.0 things and kind of a negative example here where you have the affordances of tech the zero marginal cost of information transmission plus the incentives of tech and the attention economy that pretty much naturally led to something like surveillance capitalism so you have that and you also have society changing tech where you have something like your creative commons it's like a positive example of this where you have a good mindset plus some legal frameworks that inform how how tech works so in general we can think of this as tech changing society and society changing tech and this is like the system that we all live in and that's essentially what we're going to be talking about in the society and systems track but I want to kind of put this in language that you might be able to understand with Biddle so we have Biddle this is the tech that we are all trying to build a for Biddle we have why Biddle which is a stupid meme and the idea with why Biddle is saying well why are we building these things what are our goals what are our values this is how society and our mindset can kind of change that's and shape the technology that we build and then on the other side you have in which again is kind of sad but the idea is similar where we say once we have tech how is it actually impacting society from a macro systemic perspective from like a micro a personal perspective what changes is having so in this track here at Def Con we're going to kind of bucket the things into those two big categories on the Weibull side this is asking questions like what are our goals what are the ins what are the outcomes that we're trying to achieve here and there's a great talk tomorrow by Liv Boeree who's gonna be talking about how to maximize your impact and a framework for thinking about that whoo then there's also we're gonna also be talking about the value side so these are the the means this is how you go about doing the things that you do and there's gonna be a nice values breakout later this week to chat about this and this is part of a series of we have a lot of cool interactive workshops that are happening so definitely check those out but so this is the Weibull sides is how will society change technology and then we also have the impact Bowl side and for impactful this is again this question of what are the incentives that we have how what are what are the technology allow us to do what are the affordances of the technology and how does that lead to emergent behavior something like FOMO 3d or kind of our slash place is an example of this and you can think of this from a macro perspective and macro systemic perspective and say hey these networks of value that we're building how will those co-evolved with existing institutions that we have in the world and you can also think of this from like a micro personal perspective we say how does this technology change our own relationship with the power with needs and with identity so we have a bunch of great talks that touch on these things as well and as I mentioned as well we have a lot of great people who have been thinking about how tech changes society from for all of our digital lives people like Brewster Kahle people like Stewart Brand people like Cory Doctorow so definitely check those out as well again how will technology change society yeah so with that definitely check out the track on the interwebs and please come to a society and systems thing because you need to know the direction of where your bidding and not just build thank you [Applause] hi my name is Joseph I'm organizing Brockie to meet up and this my great pleasure to to be able to welcome you here to brag kind of like numbers so let's start with few numbers we have a bribe blockchain we going on here it's kind of weird because well you know like weeks you'll have seven days but ours has ten there's over 60 events happening around the town and we're expecting something between 4 to 5 thousand people to be here surrounding the conference and like all of the events the most important thing is this is all community effort like all of the events are organized by you by like people sitting in a room so thanks a lot for that what should me miss during this week I mean like you already heard what is what is waiting for you here at Def Con all the tracks but if you if you just want to explore the city you can go to one of these websites if you go to Prague blockchain we'd see that it's kind of long but easy to remember if you go to guides tourists events or restaurants you will find some hopefully useful stuff there so I mean like I like def cons for all the tech talks but also kind of for the fun so I'm not going to bother you with more tech stuff these are all the parties that you can visit today today's Halloween so like crave corner artifacts are definitely going to be huge tomorrow there's a bunch of more and Friday is kind of like easy-peasy you know just drinks I mean this this was all of the important stuff now let's just have some fun this is a quick lesson of Czech so this is how it goes I will read English part then say the chick part and I'll ask you all to repeat the Czech part after me there right so this is how we say hi ho it's pirates thanks dick we well it was good another one please pero seemed quite good and something something useful for tonight - beer beers please to be a paper Christine it was good you'll do good you know for like special occasions when you want to when you want to just like chat in town with locals here's some more useful phrases [Music] you know the drill I'm a developer is Envy boyars I thought this one was tricky but you got it this one is easy to flirt flirt a lot you're good at this beat Travie this was kind of surprisingly good you guys have been practicing this to complain about prices a little bit asana I didn't go to all right so let's let's just finish this up with one kind of nice phrase that you can use tonight this will be tough but try [Applause] I'm a developer who flirts moke sweed and talks about prices Sammy boy asks of their to a goatee travaux am Rubio Tiana Krypton guys give it a try [Applause] all right that's it thank you so much for coming to Prague this is really a dream come true for me and for all the people from the local community thank you so much you
