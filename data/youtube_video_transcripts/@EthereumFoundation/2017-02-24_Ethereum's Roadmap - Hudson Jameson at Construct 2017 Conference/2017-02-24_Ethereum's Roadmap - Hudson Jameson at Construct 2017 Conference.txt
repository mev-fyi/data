good morning everybody all right so I'm here to speak on etherium what we've done so far what we're planning on doing talk about our ecosystem and community so let's get started so we're going to go through the etherium roadmap what we know so far the software ecosystem you know what tools are out there what tools are currently being developed a lot of them you're going to see in deep dive sessions and in product demos and all kinds of stuff throughout the day and then what makes us different what does the etherium community value and what makes us you know sets us apart from other crypto projects decentralized application projects all right so we go this way cool so where we've been January 2015 is when the talus boo Turin formally announced etherium at the North American Bitcoin conference that was kind of the start of people getting excited publicly about aetherium it kind of set things in motion we you know had a crowd sale after that and then in July 2015 we started the frontier phase actually that should be January 2014 my bad July 2015 we started the frontier phase which is when the blockchain actually went live so when you're thinking like as I'm going through these developments considered that the etherion blockchain itself is less than two years old March 2016 we at Homestead had a lot of protocol improvements so just a lot of things that helped kind of speed up transactions make things more reliable kind of coming out of an alphabet efface so right now what do we got going on we have light clients that are very efficient there is a lot of mobile app development and embedded def development going on so for instance status I am is a mobile Android 'i'm app that you can pretty much run any aetherium gap that runs on a website on status you can go in and also have incorporates whisper the decentralized peer-to-peer messaging system that aetherium has and it has just all kinds of really really neat features it uses light clients to make it so that as a consumer you don't have to have the whole blockchain on your phone you can just use external servers and even you know your own light client server on your phone to just get the data that you need the mobile and embedded devices there's also Raspberry Pi BeagleBone integration all kinds of stuff that stays very well updated smart contract safety and formal verification that's kind of some of the hot topics are the smart contract security because you hear about all these blockchain projects that have you know flaws or that are not properly vetted so we have an excellent team at the foundation and in the community that is going through and doing groundbreaking cryptographic research on how to secure these smart contracts and how to make it so that you know people don't mess up and apparently create smart contracts that can cause losers to not use the smart contracts correctly pretty much because there's a lot of things you can mess up when you're trying to do something from scratch solidity is a very new language so that there's a lot of development that's going to be happening over that's already happen and it's going to be happening that will make it a whole lot more secure and then interest from many industries aetherium has had a lot of interest in the enterprise sector we have a lot of banks energy industry you know tracking all kinds of stuff and use cases that have been explored and that people are just kind of getting into small groups and figuring out on their own they're starting to be more of a more of a like people getting together and trying to make consortiums their self and Joe Lubin is going to be talking later about Enterprise a fear 'i'm groups and just kind of where that landscape is and where aetherium have been so he'll give a more detailed talk on that so where are we going we're going to Metropolis so that is the next phase of etherium development so basically like we just went through frontier was the launch homestead was a lot of the upgrades and things that made the network more stable and then metropolis goes through and provides a lot more flexibility for smart contract developers they put things where smart contracts can you know pay their own fees so when you send a transaction you don't have to externally you know fund it every time as something as ran the smart contract itself can fund the transactions going forward initial steps toward aetherium abstraction to me this is one of the coolest things because what that means is that we're going to take a theorem and right now you have to you know download an etherium client and basically use that client and it has the blockchain the logic layer the storage layer the consensus layer all packaged in and if you want to change any of that you have to go in and you know do soft Forks or hard Forks and if you're an enterprise you have to go in and just mutilate the code and get your own consensus mechanism in there but what abstraction is going to do what we're calling abstraction is the ability to swap out consensus protocols within aetherium the ability to have you know different types of account security so right now we have to use the account security mechanisms that Bitcoin and that aetherium use when you're creating a public private key but later you can use Lamport signatures or you can use RSA or you know infinite possibilities within what your use cases either and like a private setting a consortium blockchain and combining that with all of the things that people are doing trying to interconnect blockchains makes it super super powerful I feel like that's going to definitely be the future and then of course kind of setting the groundwork for scale ability solutions including sharding which I'm going to talk more about in a second ooh ZK snarks that's definitely a hot word right now hot hot phrase so ZK start store zero knowledge proof so it is a way to have anonymous transactions of value right now the cash is the basically the first ones who have a widely known public chain became snark system they launched in December and their team has been super friendly to us we have a really good relationship with them so we're starting to do work to enable ZK snarks on aetherium and the interesting thing is that there's this collaboration even though we are different projects because we're really doing this for the good of you know having this you know decentralized technology and pushing the agenda forward it's not about profit or not about the kind of stuff that some you know blockchain and cryptocurrency projects go for we really just want to make really cool stuff and help you know society by making these things that support a censorship resistance and decentralization so on the technical side of that basically we don't have support for a certain type of elliptic curve cryptography method in aetherium so we're adding that in during metropolis and just kind of working out the details of that right now and how that's going to work we have everything else to support it already and then in the future you know with abstraction coming full force that's going to be even more possibilities around snarks all right super cool stuff after metropolis is serenity we know metropolis is going to be in the next three to six months we don't know when serenity is going to be but this is going to be when you know the really big stuff hits we're changing from proof of work to proof of stake right now we're leaning on you know the Casper consensus algorithm which Vlad Dampier is going to talk about in a deep dive session later today so what that's going to do for those who are not familiar with proof of stay proof-of-work you know is just like the bitcoin network does if you have miners that you know are using their computing power and burning electricity in order to secure the coins so proof of stake is going to do is you have coins that you kind of lock into these contracts on the network and you have virtual miners so you abide by a set of rules to lock your coins in and that makes you a virtual miner that on chain has the ability to approve of transactions and act as a miner securing the network without having to expend costly external resources and hurt the environment with a lot of this heat production and energy cost that comes with proof-of-work in most cases finish abstraction on aetherium so I talked about a little bit in the last slide but additionally what we're trying to do is have just a lot more flexibility with what people want to do there's you know sometimes big debates about you TXO transaction models versus you know what theory amuses and so having this abstraction from the logic layer and the storage layer you can put you TXO based token management on the etherion blockchain you can have advanced contract execution schemes so the ability to have contracts like I said pay for their own transactions which is a huge step and having smart contracts be more autonomous and not have to be activated by outside influence necessarily and then blockchain sharding what sharding does right now when you have block chains there's a single blockchain and in that blockchain you have whatever consensus algorithm and everyone's downloaded the entire chain so everyone has the same copy and so everyone can verify and everyone gets updated and relatively the same amount of time what sharding does is it cuts the blockchain and to hundreds or thousands of pieces so that each node that is running only has to approve of their piece that their shard of the network and that sounds insecure because it's like well how do they know about all the other pieces but what we're working on is a solution to take merkel roots so the thing that kind of structures a lot of the transaction receipts and you know transaction stuff in both Bitcoin and aetherium and we're going to make it so that every shard has a Merkel proof that can then compare across each other and make it so that it has a a strong sense of consensus shards can talk across from each other cross communicate and there's still a lot of research to be done in this it's definitely not something that's in stone right now which is why there's not really an estimated time for serenity to come out but the research is really promising it there's a you know some channels on bitter that we a lot of people participate in and it's really groundbreaking stuff from both academia and just you know normal people who have really good ideas or who are you know hobbyist cryptographers who come in and help us with a lot of this including the economic theory there's also some things that we're gonna do to decrease block time theoretically with blockchain sharding you can bring the block time down significantly you can also have tens of thousands throughput of transactions eventually when serenity first comes out it's probably not going to be that way exactly there's definitely going to be higher throughput of transactions but the goal is to set up a structure through abstraction to be able to iterate on each part of the etherium protocol in a way that's more simple that's not all interconnected and it allows for these type of innovations that I've described so aetherium software ecosystem what a lot of people don't realize is just how much is actually overwhelming sometimes how much has been done in the etherium ecosystem so why got right here little bubbles that describe what's going on in the etherium ecosystem from kind of a high level so let's start with clients aetherium does not have we basically implement a protocol standard and then the clients follow that standard rather than having a like core reference clients that everyone follows and that is the standard so what that means is you can take our you know protocol specification and implement it into a lot of different programming languages without having to rely on the core code base of any others so we have as you can see C++ Java Ruby and I actually didn't even list them all I think there's a few more Haskell included clients that you can you know take the code base for and just right off the bat connect to the etherium network there's also dev tools so I know meta mask is here and they're going to be talking during a learning session there's solidity which is our Marc contract language there's embark and truffle which are tools to create solidity abstractions and to help people create and test their smart contracts and then all the IDE icons are going and like text processor icons are programs that have aetherium plug-ins for Len ting and all these other things so really there's just a variety if you want to jump into aetherium development there's a lot of tools right there and it's real easy to get into the enterprise on the far left is going to be what the future of aetherium is going to look like outside of the public scope so we have block apps mon x10 Dermott JPMorgan's quorum you know hike o's project with hydra chain on the far left the mushroom looking one that's a really cool logo so they're what they're working on is having alternative consensus mechanisms so sometimes proof of stake sometimes different round-robin protocols because a lot of the time when you're working with different businesses you don't necessarily need like you need to have some sense of decentralization but you kind of trust who you're working with there if you have like 10 or 100 companies and you know them all and you know what their addresses are and it's not anonymous or pseudo anonymous you don't really need that you can kind of assist in that trade-off of trust and scalability so what they're trying to do is get a bigger transaction throughput they're trying to iterate on talking between different block chains and a ton of other cool things there's a few different enterprise deep dives throughout this conference we got dapped you port is here gnosis is here Oracle Isis here and then there's been some other kind of popular depths that have popped up recently including First Blood Akasha project oaken and then finally and probably most importantly we have a very very strong community we have a very active reddit we have dozens of github or git er channels that are all hours of the day people coming in and like I really got interested in the Sirian because it's super approachable like you can be on reddit and just you know in a thread be like oh hey core developer of aetherium or DAP developer what's this new thing that's going on how do I fix this we have a Stack Exchange that has hundreds of questions answered in there and we have meetups from all around the world some of them topping a thousand members in bigger cities like Berlin and London so generally you'll be able to find a meet-up in your city especially if you live in a bigger city or a metropolitan area so it's just a thriving community and we've been able to keep it that way a very focused you know non nonviolent I guess non Yeley non you know all that stuff toxic I guess would be the word community so it's really enjoyable to go to those meet ups and talk to people even though they're sometimes really awkward nerds who don't get out much and they're you know haven't seen the sunlight in a few weeks hey yeah alright so what makes the theorem different to me what makes aetherium different and a lot more attractive as a product one thing you know we get we have a track record a you know github history of going through planning and executing even if we're doing it faster than a lot of people you know think we should even if they're calling it unsafe we you know go fast and we get things done we have a blockchain that works it's getting battle tested we've had multiple attacks and other types of problems or issues on the blockchain that we've quickly overcome through cohesiveness across multiple developer groups and multiple client groups that you know generally wouldn't necessarily be friends we kind of all came out of the same mold and if you look on the left side there is all the groups of dev cons so at the very top left there's DEFCON zero middle of DEFCON one bottom is DEFCON two so you can see every Devcon we're growing a number of developers and attendees it's more than doubled every year DEFCON is our developer focused conference super cool event like it's it's not one of those kind of events where you go and it's all these businesses pitching stuff it's like super super technical protocol level a bunch of really shy guys getting on stage and talking about what they've been doing for six months with no one around so bottom right that's to me representative of the cross application and cross blockchain protocol support that we're trying to get into including snarks we're good friends at the Z cache team we're good friends with IPSS we're good friend we really have a really inclusive community like we are you know really happy to work with anyone who wants to further the decentralized nature of technologies and really push this movement forward and then yet top right is one of the meetups one of the more popular ones and in the middle we have Doge cerium so that kind of shows that like if you go into the subreddit or if you see a lot of like what some of our you know a lot of the more prominent members of our community Jeff who's the goalie developer Vitalik some of the more famous trolls of aetherium on twitter they're making jokes all the time it's late it's a laid-back environment you have to get through with humor you everything can't be super serious all the time so yeah we a lot of people and the etherion community really like Doge and that to me that kind of shows a sense of laid-back 'no sense of you know being able to take humor and things and you can make jokes about state channels and make jokes about silly things going on in cryptocurrency battles and stuff so lastly there's a scavenger hunt it's starting tomorrow it's cross blockchain it involves aetherium bitcoins e cash and IPSS we're going to be posting more about how to get involved in that it's going to be mostly digital but there are some physical aspects don't worry you're not going to have to run you're not going to have to go that far off site we can all still be lazy it's almost entirely digital and and it involves a lot of etherium smart contracts and other components there's a really cool Z cache method that J and Zuko and others are working on and helping with it's going to be really really awesome so yeah that is my presentation it's questions can that happen so anyone have questions I'll change you - ok ok there you go oh we add there microphone or oh yeah so the question was am I going to be posting the slides yep I'll post on my Twitter and my website I usually try to do that so yeah the slides will be I'm at Hudson Jameson and Hudson Jameson calm and yeah what other questions haider yeah so I saw on one of your slides you're looking at advanced contract execution schemes which is wondering if you could mention a bit more about that whether they'll sure an on chain off chain it's going to be a combination so there's obviously things that everyone's heard about like state channels and that's going to play a big part there's a lot of cool projects that are outside of earrings core development including Radin and Gollum which you're kind of Raiden is pretty much like lightning Network style implementation on top of the cerium golem is a distributed computation market so both of those you know powered by aetherium at their core and then within the actual core protocol there are some stuff that you can't really do very well so for instance a contract can't hold its own ether and know what contract can't hold it on either it can't like execute and send that either after the fact so you have to you have to poke it you have to say hey do this function and you have to supply the transaction fees as the user who is either using the contract or who wants someone else to use the contract so now with smart contracts paying their own fees it makes it a little bit easier for the user to not have to guess when they're going in and trying to initiate a smart contract and additionally it helps with you know keeping that nebulous part of what's the transaction fees going to be today put that on the smart contract developer and not the user who doesn't want to do that we want aetherium to be behind the scenes you should know you're using a theory emesis if this is in the real world it'll be a back-end system that's going to you know connect everything we just we don't want it to interfere with the users we're going to make it as user friendly as we can next question the question was what kind of events trigger contract execution and what was it again and the next version so metropolis it's not there's not going to be too many changes with that yet it's more serenity so in serenity there might be a few in Metropolis it's still a little bit up in the air because we're still finalizing our aetherium improvement protocols around what we're going to complete but some of what's going to happen there is the ability for smart contracts to be their own it's so right now we have user accounts and we have smart contracts and user accounts are people contracts like they can't actually have their own code on there but we're going to combine it so that everything is just a contract even like user accounts or contracts so in doing that you have better execution to send a transaction and the contract take it and say oh I already have ether in my contract account so I can just provide the transaction fee and send it along whereas before as a user I had to be like is this going to be enough you know ether gas I'm sending to execute the transaction I'm not sure right now if you send if you you know talk to a contract and you don't put enough gas in which is our basically our word for what runs the system it's an abstraction of transaction costs if you don't put enough gas in it could just fail and it'll just do an out of gas error and return that's going to help prevent those a lot more Oh microphone yeah that's serenity but it's going to be optional of course it's not we're not changing how we're doing our normal aetherium management I'm more talking about the ability to take etherium score codebase and implement this kind of things easier there's going to be more cryptographic things cryptographic precompiled behind the scenes that would enable types of transactions like that yep so I think that's all my time thank you all so much for listening to me and check out a lot of the etherium workshops we have going on we have deep dives a lot of cool people here interacting thank you [Applause]
