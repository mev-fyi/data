[Music] okay hello everyone i'm lillian the CEO of jews x technology from china and we our focus focus on the next generation distributed computation infrastructure and related orbital graphing algorithms we are not only the traditional blockchain company they're not only the traditional distributed ledger technology company we believe that in the new future the most important thing is the liquidity of data just for data no just coin just a digital currency but data we have the biggest team of developers and the express almost modern with more than 150 based in Shanghai and Shenzhen and we are best founding company in this field last year in China almost twenty three twenty three hundred US dollars in CSA for the last 20 months we have it was the heavily in the cryptographic regions so I would like to share with you about what we do and what we have a juice juice Nastase now own enterprise platform of course is direct from the estrin miss Regis ago three masses ago so history Masako we together with one sham blockchain in the we Bank to announce the open source project bcos bok choy and open source in China the Jews platform is totally derived from this project and we will serve we will provide service for the developers and users we adopt it and the price concerns a solution you know a feature it reached the platform consensus architecture we have awkward optimized pbft and raft and what so now a solution could provide add and remove now us dynamically and automatic acceleration recovery of 14oz this this is the basic features and in you know the the most the most difficult problem in blockchain technology is consensus we did we do not seek that pbft is the best solution but in the world we haven't founded the best one yet now solution still provide identity verification and access control you know the role based access control model have been embedded in smart contracts and in the new future we will continuously provided fine-grained access control using the attribute base the incubation the most important a state of privacy protection as you know we have integrated a lot of algorithms into the different levels group signature is using transaction protocol to facilitate civilians and tracking when request is requested by the legal offices and we have integrate our client six encryption algorithms and the sake a proof to israel Mercato in the transaction we have two used state channel mechanism to Aysen and you can specific the receivers will broadcast the encryption hard well we believe that if there's note any hardware there's no any security now askew secure hardware support Bluetooth and USB standards and suppose broadcast encryption group signature Kalia homomorphic and the Jesus and Isaac a now interactive zero knowledge for sure because we are company from China we have to support a national cryptographic standards sm9 we also support multiple platforms so you can use it from PC Android iOS mobile phone we have worked together with my partners in China almost 15 to 18 years to help them to write their own smart contracts to support our virtual industry applications you know there's very difficult for most of developers to use solidity it's a little bit difficult so we have some new instructions into into ubm to optimize and exchanges functionality IBM log output instruction which is impact an application instruction and cross contracted invocation instruction and for sure homomorphic encryption and the sake a proof instruction into the IBM folder for the developers the most important thing is as is user experience user-friendly GUI and configuration wizard this is what we have done and of course the strong monitoring is for business class platform ok the next step what we will provide is we will integrate Java much emotion in the next three to four months oracle mechanism cross chain protocol and a fully blackball cryptographic framework is now an ester the use case we are honored to be the partner with the Chinese biggest security infrastructure provider sorry I just cannot say his name for almost one year 30 more than 30 engineers in this project we have delivered 31 small contracts in this project and this is what we have delivered it is a very difficult project because you know no the not only the technology but the business process and the regulation is not so mature in China so what have done the the most of that work is to communicate communicate which the with no partner to reconstruct in how business the business process and we have to optimize and extended um as you know you really is not so mature so let's turn to the second part the algorithms the first ones in Isaac a non zero not interactive zero knowledge this was a difference my picturing between zero cash and and no company the security of now the solution has been or can be mathematically proven and we all publishing in our detailed white paper in the new future maybe in in the end of this year we are the first succeed to integrate the whole algorithm into the Israel account model and it is compatible with the smart contract you can implement it parents a trations to matching with so all systems it's very interesting that we have got lots of treatments to be milliseconds latency and and our solution can support lightweight devices such as you know just your mobile phone a lot of solutions in various industries can be supported the classical application is that is the supply chain financing stock assets or identity protection most important thing is you can providing fully protection for your data your dries you your balance and it almost all of the details such as the financial data your transaction records all of them the second algorithm we have invested heavily in the past one year is MPC multi-party computation we have worked together with the top scientists and the top the institution in China to deliver this solution we now solution is the first enterprise and PC platform in the world and the solution could support customers computation logic with millisecond latency for just to whom to park computation to purchase trooper computation is very very heavily computation complexity and very very heavily turn combination complexity in the new future we will deliver the new version it is available for multi-party joint computation for three party and even more you know two and three is a different world so what is the MPC MPC can protect your data you can store attack you tetter locally and never been copied by some others and then we can benefit from this data so MPC in the busiest circumstances we can use it as collaborative management just as distributed key star region the collaborative recovery and crowding rating computation and risk control [Music] maybe it is an interesting Saints big data analysis because everybody has data but we are on the blind man which refers one of us cannot get the whole dataset forever so we have to we have to make it thank you we have to make secure distribute eight data exchange and the joint computation just like MPC solution we can give an optimization of quantitative models through data sharing okay here you can see our solutions performance just like in a decade we believe there is the best performance in an invert now but in the nest phrase we will still invest heavily to improve this parameter this one proof verification okay we have a big project oh my god now we have support your knowledge multi-party computation and ECC the nest app is game theory and the lattice base cryptography the last one is now a open platform open traffic juice for eight we have integrated Jews with lots of middle well API and solutions to help now developers to get most used user-friendly experience in the new future this is now platform framework and Rome app I think the most feature a feature is da PP market Nasri we will integrated the JVM and provided the solidity IDE and solidity and the Java so for the users no company will continuously provided training document and development and compiling and testing services for the developers lots of Chinese leading company have been my partner in this open platform so welcome you to join us join this open platform thank you thank you [Applause] [Music]
