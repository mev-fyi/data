[Applause] I am often forum reacts and what I am doing is currently works for privacy solutions to the protein networked so of digital Jam product also the privacy preserving approaches so I'm happy to be here to talk about it let's start off by briefly defining what data privacy the blockchain context we can see the whole production system can decompose maybe 2/3 radio and progeria and the Justin is my talk I recommend you find the premise in future itself kalimera come first also that confidentiality features after landing has features competition for the networking layer means hiding translated and anonymity for networking really high degree of analysis whereas the condition for the rock generation means highly transferred amount so when you set up transport or point in the same for everyone see how much use Center is available the data and anonymity for the route generator went into hiding on transaction graph so again when you send the transaction of everyone see the transaction when come home or where to go so in this mental cramming on focusing on the privacy features for dist approach generation in the midpoint ym standard transaction pogchamp and when your sanctum same transaction citizen rupture will be attached to one of centers private private to keep a public key and to verify the signature question to verify the craftsmanship of the signature but it always reveals a transaction where confirm and so inaudible data type of the data linkage in the module is a special signatures called real signatures and the signatures basically a lot it'll be attested not just one of center pipe type int but management with some damn authority and the difficut effects from the maharaja network and the kids also safety in the infant sectionalism so signatures basically ensures that our it's time to buy one private key corresponding to one of the remembers a public key and as a kid works as a dummy private key so this in this picture the red one is on europe center actual territory and as a kid I washed them damnit Oprah private key and this is a white to advocate to give their anonymity features for the sender others in in the morning protocol and Paul gives confidentiality features to the morning centers tender very commitment hour instead of the low edge of the volume and if we attach the arranged roost there are sprinting systems and the each of the provides Authority officer within themself value is in the back the range and some fundraisers there are services of all sorts of animated features to give the recipe and jealousies if the teacher also likes a utak so right model in the world champ and I guess that the mandatory not commitment is admittedly to the Magna tree and it was like yo Jeff saw set in the world champ so that centered on stands that a child buried under it to be communities enough commitment and so it to be highly this is a actual amount and there's an important thing is that this Clinton this Magna tree is regarded so in center to a payment into the it not update is also not commitment instead of it will be an eternal fire data which is a unique and radical to the specific is a consuming commitment and that the fire data will be added to the very fire set drawn in fire set and which is to prevent from status pending so that they just max prove that all these computational processes are actually do or without revealing just hands together such as a Senna's privacy and actually transform art so these are major privacy focusing proteges objects units of Westeros but how can we achieve there is a future in the cattle based approach so it means it can be achieved at confidential features form so when you send a transaction how can we achieve America's features for when you settle transactions so Delta Y Delta Z Chang is a privacy preserving culture and supporting data based approach and we are currently not on top of Osibisa you know we talk of ins substrate and we especially provided some substrate on shamrocks called ourselves 12 modules and some Cherokee to follow protecting the same stipulated R which is a strain and let me jump into my privacy solutions in this JAL JA let me talk a little bit about the what is a substrate is some strenght is best very approach a framework which is developed by parity technologies and the substrate provides a basic block chain component or such as a database so in the chair force during transaction and peer-to-peer networking to precipitously transitions in general stream network and the consensus mechanism to provide the incentive mechanism entities abrupted network and attractive transaction here and so on and the teeth protein component might be most complex and difficult part when you edit your own proteges but if you be reached on the substrate oh you don't need to implement disease in compressed complex component so all you need to do is that you just build some substrate modules and substrate ranting and this is the white to configure the sensor modules into the substrate want em they're a bunch of substrate modules and this though each module provides a specific features such as the timestamp module provides just a text and we deserve approaching and the parentage module provides the amazing the fancy process the production system and especially you know and we provided some Travis it was focusing modules such as a bankrupted parties module provides the white is a confidential transpose into one time and animus policies module provides management was passed into the water and the this is a self chance variables again we are toppled on service right and xeljanz architecture is a permutation of the laser and also who is a teacher snacks as as a knowledge proving systems and we can on top of it we can build privacy oriented applications of intelligent protocol such as a confidential and animals payment applications and privacy features financial statement applications of the portage urgent protocol and what it is this is a paper published by when experience after in earlier this year and it is allowed rest area Church free decentralized and conformational payment memorizing all that isn't always a smart contract or form and the basic idea is that common fix deep encryption scheme hide or transfer amount and conferences and also it takes a tanto based approach for some reason observation CSM usability and thus all video quality music circulations in don't change and the result is I used is a sigma brent of called signal printer which is find out that they are not building systems but we use instead it is next now the statement itself that they just not sell based on teaser vertical permeability just max because one of the problem of the anonymity say it's so expensive so we want to work small troops and shelter verifications in Internet services in our competition and also the distance as a great community and a lot of project using as it effects libraries and their existing that what was a awesome libraries for they just next but as you know one of the downside is a necessity of the Transit Center and the practice tests and there are some solutions and some applications turn to the transitive one thing it's at much much computational which is to by the Zetas protocol and some Universal and updated service so which is a lot of researchers in Germany century and how it works are actually in the confidential transposition read six simple cases so re standard include the three coins table so here we are take is a catalyzer process or one share a we re starting point and the board has five points correctly and but obviously to be readapted everyone see how much they have now so if you don't have to have it we need to encrypt it those a month by the Livity to carry encryption and this missions team has a home for body so we can calculate to be the encrypted way so very stable and it is very constituent transaction and this so this is a materiality the public balances and some selected fountain heiresses balances and we can calculate function with ourself of tipped away so no one cannot see those actual madam chair and the auspice artist can see how on bass is by using her decryption key which is one of the private to do so this is a or Robert Scalia or the confidential transferring the church and about the problem is that how our auction knowledge imbalance this anklet element I mean this so encrypted three coins it looks actually just sixty forty virtually so easily to convince that this 60/40 by the reins actually encrypted three coins by corrected correcting encryption key so your touch is wheels of the conspiracy because the kiss next basically profile provides ample if that statement some statement is actually correct so in this confident the statements the transform a tree is within the Buried arranged so that is not a negative amount was not overbroad or Center has an imbalances and it's anchored by the great change Shanti so if it is statement is actually correct and the snacks not videos and not only research at Immanuel sensitive data such as a travesty and if the statement object corrected by fire function on Jamie test children and the camera dead its own collagen and the case of them and I'm a trans person just that over processes similarities are confidential to hospital or as I explained earlier but the difference is that to meet some dummy addresses and Simon and Peter a month will be added into the transactions so this is a similar point to the monitors approach because it will be propagated because of the damien data so that's point is that other people cannot tell the difference between the actual data such as a recipient and Dominator and as father launched operation after part finger which is verifying fraction operating the anklet appearances will be calculated in their own chain and these changes will be uniformly and this encrypted the accoutrement for Damien disease is actually equal to Jeremiah's so that we address disposal in authorities will not change the father Archer balances this is change just to save our taste and this is a bench mass I was a surgeon as this is a console right side of the teachers is a constant against an empty sides because of the accumulated up approach or which is I explained earlier whereas the console rentals ehm groves opinion against anonymity size because we need to today's show yep it's a limited size in this foreseeability size or in this title is our any size is a number of the entity sets so in this so in this features 40 in 47 in cell 14 yes it's quite smooth yes but I want to come I want to compare that yesterday just concentrate and object constraints so it's a small sum without cause rent of the general in area yesterday sites so that they'll just consoling context over land 26 and 27 so in the just constraint sanity side the as a reference I decided upon our is a German territory and we can achieve of searching our children the UH narrative feature levels of the mana with half of the Z just constraint southeast 15,000 constraint so by the way the constraint is a computational complexity in the geological thing and the next thing I would like to talk about is our ability for some privacy coins and the name is a selective disclosure because for the other the water usage among some Enterprise usage possibility to so important aspect and because they need to comply with some regulations and to be some protecting from the like that money laundering so it means a profit entity should be able to or it to certain users maestro in the financials 10 videos cases and the reenter tips as such or it ability features or we prepare some key component for getting accountability and the Apache which appears but importance key is this difficulty because all the transfer of handle and anklet devices will be encrypted and distinguish aunty and if user pass this deficient I believe she'll be through some monitors orders can decrypt it by using the stick love shopping but the order cannot spend their users coin because they don't have the spending t the decryption t cannot be announced a new key cannot be derived from this equation t I mean so as harmony what is a good point I was a cutter based approach the factorial thing with a syringe battery because or you can ferment the YouTube so based approach if it is a smart contract but it's too expensive and all you need to all you tics or set and or Spencer attachments such as a nerd via data need to be stirred into the smart contract and also or we can achieve is a confidential cap to talk means that not the best approach for example or if so if you want to prove that a scout has a security tokens over 4% of the total supply in a confidential manner but in the YouTube service approach or you need to activate the correct order of the YouTube so set on channel so it's too expensive and it's easy notice was it went easy to get the automated features in a cut best approach because in the YouTube saw best approach alter need to try try to distributive over several days to including their our history of the transaction and so it's it's too expensive and but the counter based approach all it'll just all fetches a specific group or intuitive oxygen forms abruption Network and difficulty it and we get the single register parent and so you know we are all open salsa argumentation Hotel champ and implement or implementation interpreting last and but it's at the development for our production already or you can check out Patriots come - okay so this is a demo oh so we have the several hundred one thousand points now and best hands has a logic is a search and not randomly lotteries and the rats have is a whatever desktop client on Lister granted I'm gonna send a 100 points to Aris and submit is an integrated to the generally and cementation skin and the by five-minute in with internal Chandana and transferred amount will be subtracted from my balances and the change that the forward to others into the best authorities I'll check the origin now let's get 100 coins thanks so much [Applause]
