I think it's a little early today and it looks like everyone I must had a good time I have konichiwa here but I think I should start off with ohayo-gozaimasu ooh is that the right way okay so morning my name is Wu Klim and I'd like to kick off today by doing a 20-minute talk about why Samsung is getting into the blockchain business and perhaps how we can go about working together to increase blockchain crypto currencies and basically overall the entire economy ecosystem rather so that we can try to push what we believe is a fantastic technology further into the future so what am I going to be covering today when it comes to my presentation well there's primary three things that you see here our vision so basically what do we see what any see in this industry what do we think we can do to accomplish great things in this industry with you as our partners and secondly what's all the brouhaha what's all the fuss so allow me to share in the coming slides why we're we feel very strong in our position in this particular space and how we can work together with you to make our positions even stronger and then finally I have a little bit of a sneak peak that I want to share with you when it comes to something that we're gonna be holding in Silicon Valley in a couple of weeks that I'd like to invite you to so let's go ahead and get started in regards to our vision so what's different about what we're you what why are we getting into this why do we feel that our Galaxy devices can be a great part of this ecosystem at the same time how can we define our leadership in this particular space really we feel that we have the right combination of getting our products or rather getting this technology out to the masses I think all of us here as we see these events get bigger and bigger with more audiences and more participation and whatnot we're looking to somehow crack that not where we can get our technologies out to the masses create that true token economy and get everyone involved when it comes to what we believe is the right way to go when it comes to everything related to the internet everything related to the blockchain everything related to crypto currencies so we feel that at Samsung that we have the right combination that can help you with this if you were to partner with us and now we're having to deal with difficulties Samson wants to leverage blotching technology as one of our key feature device feature device features how I suspect that those are that are in attendance probably already have some sort of cryptocurrency right now it suspect that any of you because I see nodding heads probably have some sort of hot wallet today how many of you in this room buy raise your hands maybe I can see everyone here already how many of you also have a cold wallet wow we have some serious folks here this isn't gonna make my presentation any easier I'm kidding we all know that when it comes to hot wallet it's necessary we all know that for this token economy work having some sort of wallet to allow the tokens and coins to be transferred sent receiving whatnot is required but we also know that when it comes to these hot wallets there are some challenges there's been some incidences in the past that we're all aware of where various wallets have been compromised various companies have been compromised so how do we avoid that you do that by getting yourself a cold wallet you now have an offline vault where you can securely keep everything you yourself become the bank you control your funds this is some of the challenges with the cold wallet not that they're great is that they may be a little inconvenient right you have to stick them into your phone into your PC or whatever it may be well how can Simpson fix this problem this is how so the root of what we're providing is really security convenient security so this is the stack that I want to share with you in regards to how we see how we can combine the convenience of a hot wallet with the security peace of mind security of a cold wallet so you'll see here that there's three layers the most important step is really the bottom but let's work from the top down so at the very top end of the framework you'll see the wallet and the various different DAPs that you would be able to access and have different types of interactions then you have the Samsung blockchain key store SDK this facilitates and allows partners like you to help create different types of integration so that we can now present different offers to the masses of customers that we have and then finally the key store and how is our key store a critical part well it's because Samsung has been very be very aware of the need of security mobile devices I don't know if many of you guys are aware of this but there is a product that Samsung has that's called Knox it's our mobile security platform long story short with Knox what we can do is we use specifically designed chipsets where we can take any digital certificates keys and whatnot and etch them into the metal it is not in the software layer it is not in the application layer it is down into the chipset itself so that it cannot be maybe I should care for this it can happy hacked it cannot be touched it could we have not had any incidences of any of these types of negative things that have that many of us have has seen in and in in the industry today so what we do is unlike perhaps some of the hot wallets we keep all of your keys we keep all of your certificates within the key store so that you now have a secure place where you can go ahead and of course authorize authenticate the various different transactions that you're trying to do with your wallet when you go about using your device make sense if you need more questions please come see me afterwards and so how do we make this easy so we saw earlier on the on the earlier slide that we had the technical specs of how we do things but on the outside when it comes to the users all they care about is that it works right it's secure it's easy peace of mind so we do this by having a crypto wallet on the surface of our device so that the users themselves can go ahead do all the normal things that you would normally do what they'll script a wallet so you could say that you can transfer you can receive do all the things that you want at the same time on the app side we're trying to build out at that marketplace so imagine let's say today you have different types of app marketplaces with A to B the Play Store or whatnot what if Samsung can with your help create a that marketplace where we now have a location where people can go and see all the various developed app that you guys have to offer again come see me so we can talk about this and so that they can now be able to quickly and easily look up your products and leverage your products so that we can continue to grow this ecosystem so what are we doing when it comes to trying to increase this well back in the spring of this year when the S 10 launch that's when we first had our some blockchain platform built into our s10 device and we only started off with four taps but you'll see that by the middle of the year we were able to increase that - it says 19 but I think it's actually 20 now just one more but we're really trying to make this a lot lot bigger we're trying to accelerate this quite rapidly and the way we're gonna do this again is by talking to folks like yourselves that are building these types of products for the users that are out there we want to talk to you we want to partner up with you we want to come up with different innovative exciting incentivize promotions so that our products that's our combined product sets can be very accessible and very appealing to the user mass that's out there and we're gonna do that and we're gonna really start exponentially increasing this marketplace because what we'd like to do is not only talk to the individual developer themselves but we're now starting to speak to the various maintenance and protocols so that we can use that scaleable one point of contact to reach out to the massive coding audience that's out there so that we can try to bring more and more of the various wonderful gaps that are out there into our marketplace so what why if they're even why are we here why am i speaking to you about this well it's because aetherium was the first minute protocol that we went ahead and implemented so already we already have a SDK that's ready to go you can go ahead to Samsung's website where we have our free SDK you can go ahead and download you can play around with it create let's partner up let's bring great things to life for folks that are out there and when it comes to support you're not gonna be alone within the SDK we have different when you download this kit we have different points of contact when it comes to various types of technical support that you require and also my team is there where we can start engaging with you so that we can try to help you troubleshoot and maybe even rise a little bit more quickly through some of the color that may exist when dealing with a large company like Samsung so this is really the value prop slide that that you may be interested what's in it for you why Samsung again starting with this presentation I started off by saying that we're trying to grow this together we're trying to make this mainstream we're trying to get more users to understand what blockchain is so many times I'm talking to folks even within the company when I say they I'm working on watching the comment I always get is I lost some money when I came to Bitcoin when he came to eat or whatnot well it's it's more than that and this is what we're trying to develop together so Samsung can bring our massive marketing engine Samsung can bring our number one position as the global leader in mobile device om market share we can also go ahead and leverage what we've already built out in terms of the SDK that's ready for you and what we're trying to do with me and my team is we're trying to reach out and talk to you folks so that we can come up with again different types of incentives programs marketing a promotion so that we can try to make create awareness and to get more and more folks involved in this and I think at the end of the day whether you guys are trying to do this out of the altruistic sense of your heart or trying to do this for profit you need its customers we both need customers we need awareness and that's we're trying to build so where can you get more information we are holding out as well our own developer conference the Samsung developer conference and this will be happening on the 29th and 30th of this month and I'll be in San Jose we move it around just like everybody else doesn't it I think when it comes to the central theme of what's being done you guys probably accustomed to it so white you can show up and please learn and at this particular event it's not just about Samsung mobile it is about Samsung and all the consumer electronic goods that we deal and so if you're doing different things you're looking you wanna get more information about different parts of Samsung all that is available there all of our experts will be there all of our technical folks will be there business folks and even our VPS who make most of decisions on what goes and what doesn't go so a great place to be just want to share a little bit more information in regards to what it's about you'll see that when it comes to attendees that sagir it's specifically for folks like yourself will have different types of exhibits we already have plans in regards to who we were gonna be having as exhibitors at our event we'll have various keynotes of people that are much smarter better-looking than I am so that you can certainly get to great information there and then we'll have different types of lab sessions we'll have your different networking session the one that I'm kind of curious about is I don't know what this activation capture-the-flag wellness session is so that's the whole reason I'm going so hopefully that would be some some exciting stuff that we can both learn together and then when it comes to certain sessions that may be of interest to you there's three sessions listed there's actually four the fourth one we didn't list cuz it's basically this session over again so if you think get enough out of this you can go ahead and listen to it as well but you'll see that there's three other sessions that may be very appealing to you we'll have different people on our product team people on our dev team that'll speak a lot more in depth in regards to what Samson does how we go about managing the keystore how we go about doing various things so that we can try to bring again the best of what you have to our to our mutual consumer base so that really draws me to close regards to what I want to share with you I really plea to you to come seek Samsung when it comes to your blockchain endeavors when it comes to your cryptocurrency endeavors and let's talk about what we can do please consider coming to SDC 19 in San Jose on October 29th and 30th and please come see me I'll be the one wearing blue shoes you can't miss me and we'll talk about how we can partner up together so thank you very much [Applause] you
