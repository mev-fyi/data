[Music] [Music] [Applause] the genius of metallic butter ins multi-client implementation approach was seen this morning so obviously there was that incident regarding you know the exploit of gas and so the parity note was running so this alludes to the importance of a robust and multi-client implementation of the theorem network so good afternoon everyone my name is TJ and I'm here on behalf of Earth core so Gavin wood is unable to attend today he's spending time with his newborn baby so I hope I will be able to present on behalf of Earth core and on behalf of the team if you don't mind because we are here in China I'll say a few words in Mandarin control data how what y'all Susan ting what was the escort totally does eat chicken her counting her once inside yeah i mention fabu a woman's racing ee d it i found kaho parity so I hope that Alec doesn't mind that today we are so excited we are so excited to be here to launch parities UI so we we know the importance we know the importance of contributing and growing the hyrum ecosystem and that is what at cause focus upon with an amazing deaf team and it is our passion to prove to provide and create amazing software so today will be about the launch of parities UI and we want to continue making it easier for developers and users to leverage and utilize the amazing ethereal network so we want to thank the foundation and everyone has been involved in the organization of this event especially Ming and Vitalik so what we have done for earth core a little bit of background alcohol is made out of many of the alumni of the serum foundation with a great relationship with the foundation and we present to you the parity a theorem client it is a high-performance client written in a very safe language rust it's a very new language created by the Mozilla Foundation and what we tried to do was to do a cleanroom implementation to take the lessons that we've learned you know building the the different clients with the foundation and to put that into a high performance client that we can bring to everyone so we believe that the ecosystem has a tremendous potential for growth however it requires basic infrastructure for example the roads and electrical electrical wiring and the plumbing to make sure that everyone is everything is set out there for people to build on for example it is important that the network runs at all times this is mission critical so what we try to do is to ensure that the infrastructure is there for people to build on and leverage today what I'm going to show you the parity UI has there in mind it is the focus of the UI and it's our gift to developers and application developers everywhere so in tomorrow's session my esteemed colleague Arkady will be presenting on parities performance and security I really encourage you to attend the event it will be very technical today I'll just be walking through the UI the shiny amazing UI never before seen by everyone and I hope that you guys enjoyed that so we really think the tea madness has have done a really amazing job and what we tried to do was to take some of the ideas and reimagine it in a new and different way for the first time the client and the UI will be natively baked in by downloading the parity client you will have the native UI built for your use you wouldn't have to download any the external application we are going to run discussions you know to support miss to ensure that you know that Miss is compatible with with the parity client but this is a reimagining of how are you I could look like and we spent a lot of work looking at it thinking about the various security design features and ensuring that the UI is baked into the client so for the first time running a full node you'll be able to see a user interface for for the for each and every one of you to use so there it is okay before you get too excited this will only be going into beta in the next release so it's not out yet the next beta release will be over the next three weeks or so why is it so amazing why is this blank screen so wonderful and so amazing this is a Chrome browser by simply typing in localhost internal URL line you are able to interact directly with the parity client directly with the foo note think about that you wouldn't have to download anything for the first time you wouldn't have the you know command line now every day users can build stuff we don't need to mess around the security can have a wonderful UI just for you to use so that is our gift to you so it is packed for features before I go into it I'll be talking through the video pad for features that we hope will dramatically change the user experience okay so I will show you now the UI the first glance okay this is this is I'm gonna I'm gonna show you a video in a bit but I'm just going to talk through a few of the screens short so that you understand where everything is going this is the this is the first screen right you can't that you come across when you enter the parity browser it allows you to set up an account very similar to what you're used to the UI is designed to be very clean very intuitive it's designed for my mom and dad my grandparents to be able to use to be able to use the power of the etherium Network to leverage that decentralized network you are able to do obviously client imports this is on a full life no think about it this UI will come shipped with the client are you all ready for the video ok ok so right now we have the client being run in the background and we are setting up an account you have this identical you know that map from a key image which allows you to remember your key and we have a UI which is you know natively design allowing people to use it very easily it integrates with GAF keystore if you want to do that and suddenly you have the UI baked on top of your client now we are doing a quick transfer just either transfer and this is a key feature here this is the parity signer which ensures the level of security which the end user actually needs so that developers won't have to mess around with that kind of stuff so you see the transaction there you have address book and you can just save the address as well so it's a very intuitive user interface we are focused on the core technology we are focused on building a high performance client but we don't think that just because you have high performance client you have a crappy UI know we believe in that the two things come together so the next part of this presentation will be what should really excite all of you it is targeted at developers it's targeted at that developers to create that infrastructure which should have been there so that you don't have the massive security so you don't have to like rack your mind thinking about UI how am I going to keep it safe do I rocked it through a server am I going to get shut down by the regulator things like that so we want to ensure that the apps have the necessary infrastructure to function in a decentralized network the way it was intended so this is the debut I hear we have GAF coin because even though Kevin is not here to join us he is here in spirit and he sends his love so this is imagination of how depths can look like and how people can use the parity client to integrate whatever depths they are creating depth tokens are given equal citizenship status in the UI to either okay and we'll see what that means in a bit this means that you can do whatever you are required to do with the apps with the dev tokens in the same way as you would you know with either it's treated in the same way and we know that it's just as important and we want people to build amazing stuff on this network so this was the trusted signer that I talked about this thing has a emoticon identical on the bottom to ensure that the user knows that it is trusted you can trust parity we sandbox all the depths from parity itself this means that you don't have to worry about depth accessing particular of the client pots you know compromising security any of that issue as long as this parity trusted signer is there you can make the transaction so the really beautiful thing about this is that this thing is not routed through our central server it is done natively on the client side you are the one doing all of this transactions the way that theorem was designed to do as long as the dev tokens out here with the ERC 20 standard and it's on the guaranteed debt token registry it will automatically be integrated into the WI I talked about the trusts I know in a bit tomorrow after you talked about a little bit about the technical aspects of the trusted signer and what goes behind in the machinery and a background but I just want to say a few things about it that you can actually go into the signer and ensure that the transaction is done in the way that you intended it so you have level of trust in the theorem network you know in interacting with the apps that currently may not exist if you just use the command line so now will be the dead part of the video are you guys ready for that as well okay so now we go into the debt pot gaff coin is a toy debt you know just to show you what is possible now we buy coins this is just a toy okay so we buy coins using the ethernet azita and we transfer it into the account the dep is functioning the background and we can see oh wow the transaction is locked now we go to parity and we see okay now the account has this new DEP token in it now we can transfer the token this is the first classes and treatment that we talked about and we cannot send the tokens between different accounts so this is we're not running any server this is completely on the client side and now this trusted signer allows you to key in your password and you can trust parity and now you can see that the account has a few of the dead tokens in it so we're so happy to be here today and to present to you the launch of the UI this will be the the UI will be coming out around about the same time that this video will be put up on YouTube in about three to four weeks so we are really excited to be bringing this to you and if if there's nothing else you know I would just like to thank the organizers of this event you know for doing such a wonderful job here in Shanghai and now hello to everyone [Applause] [Music] you
