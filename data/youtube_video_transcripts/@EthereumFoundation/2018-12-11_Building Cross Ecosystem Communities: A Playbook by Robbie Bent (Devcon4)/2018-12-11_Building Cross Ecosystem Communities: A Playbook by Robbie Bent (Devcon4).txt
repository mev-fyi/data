so these three efforts were called eath prize each security and the community of communities and while we have this big messy governance stuff around aetherium there's a lot of these cross eco system things that have just sort of sprung up not really any governance and all volunteer base to kind of solve problems and very much echoing what these guys are saying it's not about you know you should do it it's just people going and doing it and that's why I find these things inspiring so the first one East prize what is it so I was talking to a bunch of my developer friends from different projects and it seems everybody was duplicating efforts so in talking with augur and Zeppelin and a lot of other daps you know everybody's rolling their own testing tools rolling their own deployment tools having trouble and not really sharing their efforts so a group of volunteers about ten people got together and just started interviewing developers around what type of tools they're using and what problems they're having building on aetherium this is like really cool so just pen random people just start interviewing teams out of the good of their heart documenting this and making it available in an open-source manner this ended up this project ended up interviewing 100 developers putting the interviews and github repo building a website around this and marketing it so that new developers and the space could figure out what they should be using the build and it gets even crazier as a result of that the etherium foundation and a whole bunch of others like web 3-0 excel for coinbase funded the effort and so the effort became called eath price as this was a new way to fund bounties and we called maktab bounties and as a result two bounties were actually funded this year one for an open-source block Explorer and one for eath etherion package manager now what's cool about this is it's not like somebody said hey I want to build this it was like the best developers in the space or saying we need this and so we listened to these people these actually got funded and they've been delivered so POA bucks gathers an open-source block Explorer that's existing and can be used and each PM was actually launched this weekend so if you talk about like people just getting done 100 interviews tools required funding tools built I think this is like a really really strong model and Heath Price has funded a bunch of new work mostly around infrastructure stuff so if you look at like the universal logins project from Alex Van Dusen it got funding from Heath price so this is cool because these things have no business models and what people asked him for and actually need so this scene this happened going from an idea and talking to a bunch of people it's like that's really awesome so how did it happen right so if you're thinking like I'm sitting here how can I get involved in the community you know what can I do well early curation is everything so and listening to community so as you heard these one-to-one interviews were key so going and finding credible people and asking them what their problems are and having a strong mission of making everything transparent so here the mission was like can we build better tools on aetherium can we actually help the developers and like really mean that from the core and listen to what people said and then make the notes transparent so this stuff was just available in github for anyone to see and so what this just shows you in this case is with a little bit of coordination you know there was no weekly meetings or organization or anything it's just a group of people saying hey we're gonna do this there's an opportunity for literally a huge impact this can be done with almost no technical skill anybody in this room can accomplish something like this with a little bit of work so two other stories one is each security this started I was working for a project called true--but and I went to get our smart contracts audited and it was really frustrating so I don't know if anyone's tried this before but you know getting quotes for $70,000 starter smart contracts insane totally insane but like just annoying and then even on top of that you know you might have to wait for three months you don't even know what you're getting so like are these auditors standing behind this are they any good do you know it was like it's a really really really big problem there's not many companies that can afford or only like the pull of a few that can afford this so I started talking to a whole bunch of security owners during this process found a bunch of people who like believe in this mission put together a telegram group and invited all the best security companies to join it with the goal of creating like a single source of truth so what happened as a result of this right so this telegram group ended up getting like bounty hunters hackers InfoSec and OPSEC experts DAP builders all the big security players consensus zeppelin solidified and it became like a single source of truth so if you want to find an auditor or have a question you can go and ask and say hey what should I be paying for the who's somebody I can talk to who's reputable where can I find information to learn about security audits something really cool they created the eath security org website which launched this week and the idea is a place for resources around security so if you have a security question you can go there for free and try to figure out what you need to do they hosted in a vanity Berlin you know this was first posted on the magician's forum by John martlin these guys picked it up and over a hundred attendees showed up right and again this is like all volunteer people coming together in the community to provide you know some results around security the guys in this group advised the security track at DEFCON and have done a bunch of presentations they also went so far as to formulate working groups to determine like guidelines common resources and are now giving out grants as well so again you know a couple people talking about how shitty the auditing process was and it turns into this like massive thing with like a whole bunch of momentum so anybody in this room could have seen that problem started talking to people and made it happen so again like how do we do it right so like early creation is everything so somebody actually applied to the ECF for a grant to interview all the best security people and in these interviews we again made the transcripts available and then invited everybody to come and telegram thread to get people to start collaborating so if you're trying to like form an early community think of like who needs to be in this community where can we get them to start talking and like what is the mission to get these people interested so we use common goals to align all parties and in this case it was one the interviews and sharing of knowledge and then to funding of tools so getting these people interested with potential funding for the tools they're building and then three there was the event at East Berlin and once everybody was in this group and came to East Berlin made it really easy for people to want to collaborate because like Greg said they're all talking face to face and then provide value add for the group members right from the start so like in this group we have a bi-weekly call around security tools where people can present what they're doing and it's a good way for anyone who wants to learn about security to watch what's going on and then the final one is the community of communities this was like a pretty cool experiment where major problem is that people don't know what events to go to so every week you hear about some type of conference meet up is a real is it not is it valuable should we spend our team resources to go and so again telegram group was made 250 community experts have joined it's you know pretty much people from every single ecosystem a project it's a place where you can share any PR updates you want retweeted or clap for a medium you can ask questions about you know hiring best practices PR and there's a group of experts there that can answer for you and so again it's like a single source of truth you know so why does this matter it's just again like in decentralized space it's tough to get access to get information and no it's good information so it's kind of you know where do I go to find experts to figure out a problem all these communities super-lightweight and you know really they're just problem solvers so eath prizes for tools eat security for security this is for like marketing and building community this is where you can go to find credible people to ask questions and it's all volunteer based which to me is like super inspiring and powerful so again you know I'm just kind of repeating here that the PlayBook is the same so if you're thinking about doing this you know you can do this you want to find an early cure you want to find a problem you want to solve make sure you find the right people early find common goals to align them so in this case it was the events and the mission was like getting the best information around marketing and community building and then providing value right from the start so finally just you know I've said it a bunch of times but that's what I'm trying to get across here is like you as an individual can have a huge impact each prize was just a set of interviews things start small they move really fast so each security was just a couple people talking about audits and then a three-month period it had a hundred groups of all the best security people in the space hosting events running a Def Con security track like this is awesome this happens with completely altruistically with no funding and then the final one which is most important I think is just listening is important so all these things come from listening to problems people are having and then trying to take people who have the same problems and put them in a group and again this is kind of what's happening at the magician's and it's the first group of people who decided hey like let's listen to each other and you see these awesome things happen and a lot of momentum is built so you know um final thing to say is just you know if we do a breakout group here and some things that people will be looking to talk to is like how we have these all these groups right and like how can they improve so there's a lot of like telegram and slack and discord and all the everywhere it's kind of like you know I wake up when I have 50 messages what am I looking at so how do you make your group stand out from the noise how should these groups be structured so if you have 200 projects you know what are the cultural norms and like who is the leader are their leaders how do things get voted on this is stuff the magician's are working through right now I'm pretty interested in it and then how do you make sure the group continues to create value there's no financial resources so like we wanted to do a community of communities event at Def Con who's gonna pay for that because it's not a monetary thing so interested in answers to any of these questions you know how do we continue to get value from these groups yeah that's it Thanks you
