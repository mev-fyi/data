[Applause] we made it well my voice didn't but you guys did I just want to first thank the theorem foundation this is the first time a design track is in a Developers Conference can we give them a hand clap awesome and we also want to say thank you to the developers who have been so open and curious we had this UX audit it was so fun such high demand that we had to turn people down and make a queue and so we're hoping to continue that post DEFCON so watch out for those news and so I'm not really going to talk about the why of UX I think we're a little bit beyond that now but we're gonna talk about the how I think it's important to know how UX is entering this field so how does web 3 look and act different than web 2 right how is the technology fundamentally different for our generation how are we designing for the future these are all really great questions that we're asking ourselves which are really fun and so exciting things honestly we kind this is our first awards show and so obviously it's a work in progress if you have feedback we love feedback so please let me know come up to me but we are if you didn't get a chance to sign up this time feel free to sign up next time yet now you have a whole year to prepare so we're expecting some really great stuff for next year and so we want to kind of talk about the criteria a little bit right so we had a hard time coming up with something that was inclusive but but here it is so first enginee is the solution clearly inventive or resourceful we want to see some creativity and some of these ideas and it's all awaited criteria and so we also want to look for language and visual cues are the action commands clear and easy to understand usability obviously really important is it easy to interact with user research are these actions informed by research and insights I think we have some really amazing workshops and some talks that talked about that and then accessibility does it reduce the barriers to entry and so this is kind of what we came up with for this year and probably beyond we are going to continuously work on it and without further ado like to say thank you to our judges who are amazing and went through 85 submissions and like several hours um so summer knack for who is the senior designer and I do connie yang who is the design director at coinbase and Dylan field who is the CEO and co-founder of figma we really want to create a well-rounded panel that had that were not biased to any project but actually can give different insights so instead of just telling you guys we want to show and so without further ado Dylan is gonna announce the first winner [Music] [Applause] and so for first winter we have the Bounty's Network yeah so I'm like to introduce mark Palin from the Bounty's Network to the stage we were so impressed with the Bonnies network because they've managed to tie crypto incentives to real-life action and also we were incredibly impressed with the way that they were extremely thorough throughout their entire product and how everything was considered so without further ado here he is thank you so much cool so oh there we go cool so when we first launched you know the boundaries network a year ago and if you look at our github commits the way we started was always with standard bounties it was always about building a protocol for bounties on aetherium that would be interoperable however we realized fairly early on that we would need to build a generalized product and explorer that would actually allow users to interact with the bounties network and so this would also act as a testing ground you know and this is what we've been doing a lot for the last year is testing how bounties can be used you know on aetherium and so we've you know we weren't incredibly happy when we first launched that Explorer it was an MVP and you know we recognized that you probably shouldn't be happy hunting such an early product but we were lucky that we were able to get so much user feedback really early on and you know this is user feedback about the user experience you know the details of there we go maybe that'll start the video maybe not okay we wanted to get user feedback about the detail the user feet the user experience that users actually have to go through the different touch points that users have actually outsourcing work also the different details of actually using adapt you know the different primitives we have like an address or transactions or gas and trying to figure out how we can abstract these for users so that they don't even have to understand and hopefully they can learn about these concepts without even realizing that they're learning and so you know as our team grew we actually started rebuilding things from scratch not only rebuilding you know our protocol and our caching layer but you know our Explorer and so we actually built in such a way that we would hopefully it would be so modular and very usable and extensible for any DAP in the ecosystem to make it as easy as possible for anyone to build a marketplace and so you know for at the boundaries Network all of our decisions we try to make for our users everything we do is in service of them and to try to help them create more value and so we were lucky enough that our hive of bees actually has been consistently over the last year giving us a ton of feedback about how they liked our product what they didn't like and that is really what has fed into this new Explorer and so without them I want to sort of give them a thanks first is you know without them we wouldn't have anything here we wouldn't know what we were building the next thanks I want to give us to the rest of the team a lot of them are sitting in that row over there Corwin Harrell unfortunately who's our head of design is not here who deserves yes a round of applause for consistently advocating for users yes but also will villanueva our CTO who put the team on his back actually building this product Matt and matias who join us a little bit later to help us sprint through the finish and simona and blair as well who really fight this battle on you know the front lines talking to our users gathering feedback and like I said in having that inform this next step I want to take a special moment and thank my mom my mom has been our number one UX feedback tester since day zero and you know we're really we're really proud of our product and we think we've done a lot of good work but we also recognize that we are still failing the mom tests you know mom tech moms can't use our product without hand-holding and so we you know we're about to run for example a project in Manila where we want users to clean up trash and you know get to fulfill bounties for picking up trash the problem is that users have to onboard to an exchange adapt wallet and then our product as well and so we've kind of realized that this is untenable that we can't ever you know achieve mainstream adoption while this is still the case but at the same time we're also very lucky that the community is realizing this as well whether it's you know challenges with onboarding and you know we're lucky to be working with the meta transaction group on actually fixing that problem whether it's the sort of solving education and onboarding and working with eath magicians and a lot of the different depths we're there as well to help sort of have some consistency around the language that we're using when we're boarding users to make it you know easier for people to actually join our community but also just to share as much as we you know can with with all the other dabs we've done a lot of user research and have hopefully some lessons that we can share but also you know our component library all the different buttons and UI elements you see are completely open-source at components bounties Network so if you guys want to build add app and don't want to worry about design you can actually reuse all of the stuff that we've already built which is also very important finally we're really happy that these awards actually exist they didn't exist last Def Con the number of design events last Def Con was pretty minimal compared to this year and if you actually went to any of those Awards you would see that they were all overflowing with people who are all beginning to recognize that you know while scaling is important if we don't have any users actually creating those transactions scaling won't matter and so while we recognize that there's a ton of work that needs to be done not only with our product oh we have mobile responsiveness not only with our product but also with all the different apps in the ecosystem we're you know excited because we realize that everybody is collectively recognizing that this is an issue and coming together to actually solve it together so thank you guys very much and thank you guys for the award congratulations okay and then next up we have Sameer [Music] argent so what we really liked about argent was what we really liked about what they did is that they're trying to attack some of the bigger UX problems in this space namely wallet recovery without seeds and without compromising ourselves sovereignty so I'll let Itamar say more about what they've done so far thanks Samir so first thanks for the award thanks everyone I meet amar one of the founders of Argent's so the vision that Arjun was ready to remove all friction to enable access to to web tree and for that we really started from a blank sheet to rethink all problems one to tackle all problems one one by one as a result with sergeant you have no more seat phrase you don't have gas thanks to abstraction with meta transaction and our relay errs and you and you can you can also use that to access in the future all world of the central application we and also no more cryptic address that's a big point for us and no stress and all that in a fully fully decentralized way so if we continue the onboarding let's on board at Arjun basically you start with a first step which is to pick your ENS so we are very excited about that every every user of Arjun gets a free NS argent at XYZ once and thanks for the nest team if you are around so we are very excited about that once you have picked your ENS we think about you know the stress about handling crypto today and so we enable users to get security alerts straight so they're the preferred channel can be a phone can be your email and we will monitor for them transactions and in case of suspicious transaction we'll let them know about it we of course have the usual biometrics supported by most most devices and you are done with your own body you haven't even thought about sid phrases so let's talk about Sid phrases for for us it's literally an anachronism for 20 years we have been telling Internet users and not write down their password on a post-it and stick it on their on their screen and now for this new Internet we are building a new Intel Network telling people to write down on paper something even more critical than the password so with Arjun and our Guardian system you have no more seat phrases so the wait works so we have a smart contract based wallet and you're the owner of that wallet your Guardians do not have your private key you do not share that key but they have some rights on your account so a guardian is any kind of user account on the blockchain and they can launch a recovery procedure so concretely that means it can be friends family who don't know d'argent but you don't have to trust other people it can be yourself is any private key you can take Hardware wallets you can take 3rdeye wallet and there will be a consensus and at any time in case of issue you can recover your account we also have looked at the best solution for exchange decentralized exchange don't have to be complicated so we're very excited about native integration of Qyburn networks where it's probably one of the simplest way to buy to exchange any type of token on your phone one tap and you're done then let's talk about transaction transacting it's stressful it's complicated and it's sometime dangerous and what if someone takes control of the wallet what if someone gets access to your private key so at Arjun you define a daily limit at smartphone track level someone get access to your phone in the current paradigm in the current world it's over someone has accessed your private key they will drain your account with Arjun the smart contract will see that there is a large transfer being triggered to an untrusted address because obviously you have never used that address you have never sent money there and it will delay the transfer by 24 hours you contact your guardians or pick up your hardware wallet you have time for that and you will freeze the wallet launch a recovery procedure and so obviously you can whitelist addresses so that you can transfer as much money as you want to an exchange or prefer to your preferred address at any time we have also some little tweaks here and there so for example there are use cases where you have to ask users to double-check and address critical situation for example account recovery so in that case what we do we hash the address into a very easy to check emotive images you check the images and you are done it's again a much more relaxing experience when you think about public addresses so always wanted to have a slide like that finally done so I mentioned in Arjun you don't have to worry about gas you actually don't pay gas because we we we have meta transaction we have on relayer that allows much more interesting to do other interesting things and so we are very excited to support universal login so you will be able to have a frictionless access to any DAP so how it works you type your ENS you you then get a QR code and basically what you are doing there you tell think about a facebook login experience with fully decentralize you tell your wallet hey I want to authorize that dabke to do something on my wallet to give it some others and so in that case I've even set a security policy so that that key is not the owner of the wallet they cannot do whatever they want in this case I've said ok they can spend one is there a day I delete time I go in my wallet and I can revert a revoke access so that's really how we have thought from A to Z about the experience where you so what is maybe the most exciting part is that we are live on the app store so you go now to www argent at XYZ you will have links for iOS for Android today you will be in a waiting list we are being really careful getting user bit by bit as we want the all experience to be perfect but you can already reserve your free NS so go for it straight away since Amy hasn't cut me yet I have another minute maybe two thanks all the ecosystem I mean there is DNS team and neek there is the meta cartel there the khyber team I mean that wouldn't be possible without all the work that have been done by the entire ecosystem so thanks everyone [Music] and next up we have Connie who's gonna announce our new winner [Music] hi everyone I'm really excited to announce our last prize for our last winner for our design prize and it goes to blue shift and I'd like to introduce Kane and one of the reasons that this is really impressive for for us to see as judges is that they really get at the whole user journey it's not just the product which is obviously super important but the experience of somebody trying to navigate what is the world of crypto and watching for the first time and if we want to make this global we have to think about the people who don't have access to exchange is the same way we do that without any more thank you this is pretty exciting for me we got the clicker just solve all kind of step through it okay all right we're just gonna walk through it so this is a live demo since we couldn't do a live demo so basically we've got this platform here which is an iPad and it's running in twelve hundred and fifty stores in Australia and it's live now so if you ever come to visit us in Australia you can go and buy some crypto and basically the way it works is you've got your ether wallet so you've got a QR code you scan it on the iPad you can walk into one of these stores and the system will detect the code and it will allow you to purchase ether directly in store for cash right and this solves a lot of problems but one of the challenges we have as you can imagine being in 1,250 retailers is that the people who are operating this platform are not you know technically sophisticated right they're small business owners it needs to be super easy to use and so we've designed the system basically to be as accessible as possible and oh it's paused over there but okay so so essentially what happens is customer walks in they choose how much they want to purchase they the the agent will put in as it says they don't accept credit cards because it's a cash-only service right so that's an ugly screen but it's there for a very good reason and the agent will process the transaction and they scanned it into their point-of-sale system to sync it up with the rest of of their accounting and then the eighth is sent to the wallet of the of the user so this system has been in operation since about 2016 we started the company in 2014 and it took us a couple of years to like find the right exchange partners and what-have-you but the the I guess the interesting thing for me with blueshift is that we've probably now processed about a hundred thousand transactions so that's a hundred thousand real users in the real world who've walked into a store and been able to get crypto and I think the even more exciting thing about this is that while we have the ability to purchase Bitcoin and eath and a few other cryptocurrencies over the counter we actually want this to be a distribution method for more than just buying crypto as you can imagine a lot of the people who've been coming in to buy crypto have been coming in for speculative purposes not necessarily for for usage and so if you're out there and you're building something that you want to get into people's hands whether it's a game or adapt or something like that we really want to talk to you because you know certainly in Australia in other markets as we expand we're gonna be probably one of the easiest ways I mean you know someone mentioned the the mom test or mom test and you know for for a new user coming in yes they've got to have a wallet they've got to be able to get through all that stuff but actually purchasing a DH to be able to do the first transaction can oftentimes you know you can download it out from the App Store and set up a wallet but you know getting that eath to be able to kind of get into the ecosystem is quite hard and so you know this system allows you to get your users potentially into the ecosystem very easily and yeah we're we're super excited to work with any teams including we've got ether here who's one of our partners so you know anyone who's looking for distribution and wants to get you know real-world users who are not deep crypto people who kind of get all the ins and outs we're there so yeah thanks very much really appreciate the the support it's it's awesome to see cuz you know we kind of sit in the middle and we don't get as much exposure so you know the blueshift team is kind of in the background and so it's it's really validating to be given this award so thank you so we had the judges go through quite a bit of submissions and they had our time at the end but so we want to give some shoutouts for some runner-ups Aragon who adjusted also for their design system and their components that they just released crypto care for their kind of whimsical take on social impact and then status for their easy onboarding process and the and we want to thank no known origin who has actually provided the trophy of this UIC's Awards it's a limited edition and of T which all the winners will receive damnest by the artist martin lucas hasta el choque Sikhi so thank you guys all for coming and we can't wait for the submissions for next time [Applause] [Music] you
