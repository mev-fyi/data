[Music] [Music] so [Music] hi everyone i think we're live now um i'd like to welcome everyone to the ethereum ii modasha testnet launch um this has been a work in progress for for many years about five years since the launch of ethereum and um what we're gonna do today is spend about an hour looking at um what went into this the history of it for about 30 minutes will build up to the actual eth2 phase 0 test net launch which will occur in about 28 minutes um and after the launch of the test net will monitor metrics to see how well things are going um and hopefully just celebrate a successful ethereum two phase zero beacon chain test net launch um the big word of the today is is modasha that's m-e-d-a-l-l-a um and so let's get going before we get into this call i'd like to tell you how to find us and how to join our community um many of us live at reddit.com r eatstaker uh that is a great place to get support to talk about your staking build to find out um some high level information about what staking really is there are a lot of places to get deeper into the research but a good place to get started is reddit.com r eatstaker a lot of us also spend a lot of time on efinance we're kind of a cousin or sister reddit to eat finance um and if you want to find us on twitter you can find us at eth2scc that's the ethereum two stakers community call this is part of our community call series uh and something we're we're really excited to share with the community there are so many people who put blood sweat and tears into making ethereum too real um starting with ethereum two researchers the ethereum two implementers call um and all the client teams without hundreds of thousands of work of hours of work by so many people this would have never happened uh let me give you our brief agenda today something we're really excited patricio is going to talk to us about uh the po app the launch attendance poep there is a poep token available for this call to get that poep you need to join our discord or just come to our discord and find the poep channel there you can post your name i'm sorry just make a comment and patricio will respond to you with a link to claim your poep you don't have to post your ethereum address just post a comment receive that link and go claim it uh there are also five additional co-apps available for each of the client teams we're talking about prism lighthouse teku nimbus and lodestar that you'll be able to claim by running those clients and using a specially designed graffiti in your client to indicate that you have actually run that that client and you're ready to receive the po-app uh we're going to hear from offering who is the test net manager offer has set up i guess four major test nets i'm gonna not gonna get them right but they're witty uh slushy altona celesi sleesy altona and now madasha then we're gonna hear from danny ryan uh he's gonna talk about key metrics and what we're looking for for launch and that's going to lead us up to the launch after the launch we're going to just monitor key metrics talk about the network and chatter for a while so with that let me introduce patricia worthalter patricio is the brains behind poep which anyone who knows about it is obsessed with it like i i heard about it i was like i don't need some more crap poep is it's it's kind of the uh the badge of honor for participating in ethereum events if you don't have any yet uh today is the day for you to pop into that eaststaker discord chat in the poep room get your po app it'll come to your ethereum address and you'll have that badge of honor that says that you participated in this call so patricio tell us what you got hello everyone good morning so we have very excited plan exciting plans for people that hold this po up so make sure you get it and you don't have to worry about minting fees because we acknowledge that gas prices are quite high for meeting a pow-up today in u.s dollars it may cost between two to four dollars and some people can't afford it so when you get the redemption link just make sure that you input your address or dns ideally your dns and whenever we launch our second layer solution we will make sure that all the people that claim the token get it on the second layer which is going to be very cheap so so no rush or or anything to worry about that much anyways if you want to have it on mainnet you can still do it the same way you always did this is assuming all people know po-ap if you don't know pop by this time just you better go to our website xyz um as superficial explains there are two different pop-ups this time the first one which is just being part of this call which you get on the it's taker discord on the pop-up channel and then there's the other pop which is like like the hard one the one that matters which is the one you get when you run a note um if you're running a validator for for the medasha test net um you should likely put a is one address on the graffiti field like like we are seeing on the screen thank you very much whoever's doing the the live the screen sharing and when when you added your is one address on the graffiti field that's going to be on a merkle tree that in the future once we reach some stability will allow you to redeem your actual uh proof of validating on the on the test net so that's it for me i think we can go back to you super face all right thanks patricio um i cannot i cannot over estimate or overstate how cool it is to hold um to hold these po apps so uh i know that i'm going to do everything that i can to get all of these clients running uh i haven't been successful yet i've been a little a little busy but uh i'll spend every moment getting these to work we might even see if we can bug well i'll bring that up later it would it would be neat to invite more participation uh into those client po apps but we'll see if we can extend that deadline uh maybe to work out so next up is offery showdown aufry is the uh ethereum 2 test net manager he has uh i'll let him speak for himself but he's done a wonderful job of managing i believe it's four public sorry four div three developer test nets and finally the medasha public testnet in terms of context this is something that we've been working that the ethereum foundation ethereum developers in general have been working toward for about two years that's just implementation and for several years before that in just research uh so offeree is a critical part of of this development and uh i'm glad to have him on board uh thank you thank you for having thank you for the intro i was actually going to give a presentation soon on test nets but um given the chance today that we have still 20 minutes left for the medusa uh tested launch i can give a quick overview of what we have done in the past and and why this is such a critical milestone for assume to development um i think one of the most important milestones in issue 2 development was when i believe italic and justin came up with the design of the beacon chain in 2018 and since we have uh this theorem two researchers have worked towards some specifications that at some point uh can be implemented in different clients and then there was there were many attempts to implement it some died along the way and some new came and joined later and eventually over the course of the last two years there was some need to get towards a point where all these clients start working together for the reasons of having the best possible client diversity on on mainnet later and um in september last year there was this uh interop log-in where the teams for the first time physically met in one location and tried to figure out how to actually wire this client together they focused more on networking um later in 2019 there was these simulations where you have this multinet simulations where you can just run a script that tries to catch all the latest code of the clients and to run automated setups with a certain predefined amount of validators and so on but all that was still very far away from where we are today and um when i investigated um i had some free time and i investigated how i could contribute to eastwood too and i figured out like uh i want to help with tesla and i reach out to danny and you say yes it's a good timing and so um all these client teams had their own public testnets or simi public test nets i think uh prison and lighthouse where the first uh test nets um prison was more um more public about their launches they had the sapphire the topaz and the onyx chestnut was a lot of public validators from the community but all these test nets had more the scope of this single client like um testing and eventually when i joined the efforts of multi-client testing uh in around march this year uh i tried to bootstrap test nets that uh are launched not by one client but by the first thing i did was uh taking a lighthouse and the tickle node back then and i just managed to have them both validating on the same network it was it was like a small definite not many people knew about it apart from developers but it was a quite a nice success and with the progress of the specification and the updates of the specification to new versions with new improvements i i kept adding clients and i had a prism and lighthouse tesla the schlezzy testnet in april and then we had the witty test net which added uh tickle at guinnesses so we had three clients at genesis in june we had witty test net which has had nimbus valley data in genesis that was also really exciting and then we noticed at this point with the itoner testnet um that we might be stable enough to have a go at a public community-run uh test net and this is uh what's happening today we are launching the medusa test net that not only features five clients in genesis as far as i know was lighthouse prison tycoon nimbus and loester but also is entirely run by the community apart from some validators that are provided by the client teams or the asean foundation or and myself and some other people but the majority of uh validators will be provided by the issue community and this is the milestone we have been working towards for very long time and i'm really happy that this is happening in 15 minutes and six seconds i'm looking forward great thank you so much aufry um gosh it's it's so exciting we are uh just 14 minutes away um it's so impressive to see so many moving parts coming together into several developer test nets and finally into the final hopefully the final you know obviously there there may be issues that cause restart um but the uh public multi-client test net the next thing we're going to move into is um is the the individual client poeps now there's a and there's a little disambiguation there is a a poet for this call but the real badge of honor is running successfully running each of the five individual genesis test net clients again that's prism lighthouse nimbus teku and lodestar and even right now where we have some uh some getting up to speed for for i i think there are a few people who have lodestar but i haven't gotten loadster up yet um and so to talk about how to claim the individual client poeps um we have nolan who is my my wingman you know him on reddit as lamboshi nakagini did i say that right i just call him nolan um so tell us what we got man so we really encourage everybody to try out all the different clients i don't think any of them are more difficult to install than any other um and a healthy distribution of the different types of nodes is very healthy for the network so we really do encourage you guys to try them all out and we thought this would be a good way to incentivize everyone to do that so um all you got to do is set up your nodes set up your validators go to beacon chain slash po app enter in your eth1 address and it'll give you a little which i'll show you here so punch in your etherdress here your eth1 address and that'll give you this string here so pull out the one for the relevant client that you're using and then i launch my validator with a script but to do is just put dash dash graffiti and that string that'll record your eth1 address onto the beacon chain and we can pull that off onto the eth1 chain and you can uh claim your token so it's really fun guys i encourage you to try it out and it's it's a good challenge and you can show how much cooler you are than all your other friends that don't have those badges so yeah poep we love it the most fun dap on ethereum awesome thank you nolan uh i want to talk about how so many of us got into um into this place into dealing with the ethereum two clients and i would like to use that opportunity to encourage you if you're watching make a contribution to the ethereum ecosystem so i got started just creating some videos and while i created some how-to videos i i made some friendships along the way and it has really um it's really been a great opportunity to participate in the eth2 ecosystem rather than just being an observer so if you're an observer right now i would love for you to uh today just create a screencast of installing one of the clients um or setting up grafana or any of the the hundreds of little pieces people love video content and that video content is so instructional and it onboards uh more and more people so if you're looking for a way to become involved just stick your toe in the water create a little bit of content and share it it'll enrich the entire ecosystem and that's sort of um sort of the way to get going now danny ryan is i guess the the big organizer uh behind the ethereum two implementation and he's he's a great guy fantastic easy to talk to um and um i'm proud to have him on the call danny do you want to get us started with some launch prep and we'll get going from there yeah yeah thanks um yeah i mean i i don't i do some of the hard work but like client teams research like there's so many people doing a lot like incredible hard work on the stuff every day um i really don't need any credit um cool i don't have much to say uh east 2 is kind of like the next step in the evolution of ethereum to kind of reach the original promise of being a security centralized yet scalable platform for globalized global decentralized computation and and the sort um and ease 2 phase 0 is the uh laying down with the backbone of that with the launch and beacon chain um i'm going to give actually can i share my well i don't know nolan can you pull up those uh health metrics on your screen um whereabouts drop the link i dropped a link in there okay let's say um i just want to give some context on the things that we uh i guess what the beacon chain does um and the things that we're looking for today as kind of like the the health metrics uh examining the health of the beacon chain and knowing if this uh was immediately a success um or if there's like disabilities or if there's some issues um and so the beacon chain primarily is concerned with the organization of many many validators in this consensus validators instead of miners in proof of work are those that build and create a proof of stake chain beacon chain and what they do is they they build blocks and then they all come in and attest to blocks so someone builds a block they're assigned to build a block many people are in it assigned to vote on the block and say i think this is the head i see this is the head and they send these little messages around on the network these little messages called out to stations are included in blocks and help kind of finalize and come to a firm agreement on what the chain is and so what we're watching for and what a healthy chain does is blocks are built blocks are voted on blocks are then justified and then blocks are finalized the justification and finality that's uh that's that's what we call casper it's this consensus algorithm in which validators are constantly taking part in uh constantly signaling support for chains and uh coming to consensus on things proof of stake as opposed to proof of work actually has this notion of finality this notion of something uh that is permanently embedded in the chain like you know this block is always in the chain i can make that claim um i can make that a cryptoeconomic claim that this block will always be in the chain based on the activity of the validators um and so the sequentially we see we see blocks are built then blocks are justified and then blocks are finalized and so these these are the key things that we're watching for um as we move into launch so in pre-genesis i have a few notes here um on the things that i and other teams have been looking for pre-genesis once enough validators have once enough deposits have been made into the deposit contract clients figure out the genesis route the genesis state uh the genesis block and the time and so the first thing that we did was okay do all the clients agree on this and they did success um and then we and then once we see the genesis information happen then clients can appear and begin to form a mesh for the ptp network and what we did over the weekend um was to ensure that this mesh began to be built and looked stable now if you go and look at these two stats you can see that people have you know any clients nodes have anywhere between 40 and 80 peers beginning to look like a healthy p to p mesh so that's that's a good signal and so now we're in that waiting phase six minutes till launch in which the genesis time which was set a few days ago that is when the genesis block comes into fruition the genesis block is a known block for everyone and then after the genesis block proposers are selected to actually build upon this chain and so at the genesis epoch the first thing that we're looking for is okay did we get a new block did we get a block after the genesis block ideally we see this block within one maybe two spots a slot is 12 every 12 seconds that's kind of the time at which things happen and so we're looking for a genesis block we're looking for the genesis block we're looking for some boats on that and we're looking for a new block to come in really we want to see it in the first one or two slots um that's good concerning would be if we saw it in in the first three to eight slots that might signal that some uh validators are having connectivity issues or you know there's not a lot of balance like a bunch of the network maybe didn't come online or maybe there's like connectivity issues between different validator types um and then bad if we hadn't seen a block in the first eight slots um that means like 25 of an epoch is passed which signals like the network might be fragmented or um you know more than 25 percent of validators didn't come online uh so that that would be the concerning scenario and then at the end of the epoch which is 32 slots that's when we'll first get like a good signal on what was the the validator vote participation these attestation votes that i was talking about really like a good metric i think for this test that would be greater than 90 concerning but okay would be in the 66 to 90 percent range 66 you need 66.6 percent two thirds of validators for finality so like this is still okay in that range and then if we saw below 66 in the first epoch um we'd we'd be concerned we'd be scrambling we're going to be looking and trying to figure out what's going on that might signal that a client you know one of the key clients is not connected to the others um so then moving into epoch one we're going to be just monitoring we want to see some regular blocks uh regular attestations and at the end of epoch 1 we'll again be looking at this vote percentage we really want to see that greater than 90 that would be like smooth sailing the finality information the justification and finality like i discussed before can't happen um in the first in the zero in the genesis epoch and the first two parts so nothing's going to change with finality but at epoch 2 we're going to be again monitoring similar stuff each epoch 6.4 minutes by the way but epoch 2 we're going to be monitoring similar stuff but at the end if we have this good vote participation then we can see epoch 2 get justified ideally if epoch 1 is justified and not 2 then that might signal like some instabilities and then if we have no justification that's a red flag so epoch three similarly um this is the first time that something can become finalized so at the end of epoch three so that's four epochs and so six point four times four epochs that that many minutes um that's when ideally three can become justified to be can become finalized if we reach that point then like we've had a good launch nothing uh 15 slots to go yes age uh sorry nothing uh you know everything went according to plan it could be concerning if we have some combination of justifications of these epochs that didn't lead to finality the sequential justification really leads the finality that would mean that there's intermittent connectivity issues and we haven't seen any justification uh since genesis then like we're having some issues and client teams are scrambling and we're debugging and i'll probably get off this call and we'll fix it um but ideally things are going to be smooth sailing um and i just wanted to give you like a an idea of what we're looking for over the next uh about 30 minutes and we'll be looking at these two stats we'll be looking at block explorers we'll be running some local metrics and each of these clients have local http endpoints in which we'll be pulling down relevant metrics dynamically if you have access to this document i threw up some of the key endpoints for the clients that i'm looking at to pull down some of the information i talked about like how to get peer account how to look at the head global votes that kind of stuff if you're interested uh http http http port holy that's really hard to say http port for prism is 3500 i'm changing on the document right now i'm sorry if i confuse anybody um but we have a couple minutes to launch that's all i wanted to say i'm really excited uh congratulations to the incredible hard work of all these teams um and thank you east staker and all you guys for putting together and excited for these co-ops too it looks like we have about 67 seconds before launch thank you danny that was that was really exciting we're going to get to see all of those metrics in action um and so with a minute left i think it's time to stare intently at numbers um and we'll just remain client quiet and open this up for anyone who wants to uh chime in fair warning my graffana dashboard might break i might have some port overlap issues so but i got we can look at the clients themselves so hopefully we'll be okay everybody get ready to screenshot i got about 10 seconds 17 16 seconds 10 nine eight six five losing some peers gaining some peers three two one and we're live genesis time reached i made an attestation yes attestations can happen now and then the first block would be at plot one so 12 seconds then yeah we're making attestations too yeah we've got other stations and aggregates going out from the turkey notes i see a block we have a block hell [Music] and we yeah an empty slot i'm going to propose for 31 with one of my fellow writers i think at least for my experience i was doing a lot of testing and probably claimed a lot of slots that are unused not a lot but you know okay we have a block at flat three yes and at four we missed a lot too okay that's okay that's a pretty good percentage yeah it's pretty nice our nodes are agreeing with the blocks that are being produced okay so if you're looking at my public health metrics we have the first thing that we're looking at we have a good give a thumbs up we got a decent amount of blocks in the first handful of plots and now we're waiting until the end of epoch 0 to look at the vote percentage hopefully we'll see something over 90 percent i've already seen votes from about two and a half thousand validators first two pull-ups have been claimed already [Music] we currently have over 1 700 viewers on youtube hello youtube hope you all are enjoying this i am so we're looking you're looking at uh lamboshi's four different clients running you can see you know different asset stations are being submitted uh blocks are streaming in hey nolan will you will you uh go through each of those six and just hit real quick what what they're running okay so top left is lighthouse that's the node there and to the right of that is the validator below that is prism and again the prism validator this guy up here is nimbus and they do validator and node all-in-one and same for taku and unfortunately i ran out of time setting up lodestar but we'll get it going probably today proto what are you looking at on your end looks looks looks like sure am i not running well so i'm running all five different clients uh two notes each 64 photographers each and it's just about to monitor me and i'm running metrics as well and it's feeling good so far proto i gave you screen share um i'm sorry i didn't have it before oh sure i'll share my screen meanwhile i made a block slot 17 is mine [Laughter] i was number one on altona so standards are slipping well maybe we can uh game game the randomness on mainnet you can get number one again yes these are lighthouse metrics the summary of like what the stages look like everything is going up a bit so far a few misfortune for too many and then i'm going to propose a block in slope 31 with one of my prison photographers i'm looking forward that will be a miss swapping up let me see if i can find the locks so these are blocks and this right there is prismatic they is where supposedly the first one will originate from and so many metrics there's there are five clients and they're producing over like a thousand different uh data points i think now is a good time to zoom out and see our overall progress what we have right now is us an apparently successful launch of the network um we'll be waiting for two epochs uh to conclude before we can actually get the metrics to know how successful we are but so far everything looks i would not say perfect it looks nominal we have a few miss slots those are very expected but things are looking really good so far we broke beacon chain bitfly's website to monitor the beacon chain so sorry uh peter i want my t-shirt especially there we go yeah we are aware we're already on it the website also like the beacon champion website also uh broke we didn't expect just search to be honest and so obviously if you have a poep link you'll be able to claim this poep anytime uh in the future you're that's not i don't believe they're set to expire are they patricio they don't expire yeah so don't worry now if you have the link just hold on to it and every see anything interesting on those metrics proto too many metrics i'll go back to the summary this is like the most important diet already like do we miss uh how many likes aren't this thing that's it so we're getting close to the end proto proposed block 31 i like that that tag 17282 was the proposer there so we're at the end of epoch we finished epoch zero um so do any of the apis allow for uh checking the uh participation starting at epoch zero i know that we can look once epact one passes i'm seeing sixty percent participation rate in the previous epoch which is not great so hopefully that's wrong i haven't paid much attention to it in epoch 0 before yeah i only saw about 10 000 validators in the previous epoch okay red flag it looks like lodestar's choking on gossip that's lots of stations uh load stars processing right there oh we have a twitter poll from vitalik uh epoch is pronounced epic or epoch that's a that's a good one wait okay vitalik how do you pronounce it e-bug okay i pronounce it however vitalik pronounces it can anyone quickly see how many what percentage of the blocks in epoch zero were not skipped so if that looks to be the same as um the attestation percentage then i'm going to assume yeah according to our websites um epoch zero has 57 percent participation rates i i know but in terms of attestations what about in terms of blocks okay i see 24 blocks seems a little bit higher than the station participation right yeah but it's close yeah that could be just the randomness participation rating the epoch one that we're in at the moment is pretty much on track for what last epoch did as well uh it's a little more erratic there's a decent chunk not online we're approaching slot 64 too infamous slot 64. that's where all of the consensus bugs happen i'm seeing a black box on your view proto i don't know if if you wanna if you can refresh that screen if everyone else is seeing it that may be indicative of having zoom chat over there yeah it's i remember the next maybe just like official program i'm still sharing my screen i'll research can you see something now it's not fatal it's just a obstruction if someone likes the concerto screen back to mine i guess my lighthouse node has a bunch of invalid attestations coming in danny will you explain so i am yeah i mean i'm just looking at these logs and seeing an invalid involved attestation coming in from the network which implies that someone is signing a message that lighthealth is not seeing is valid um and if you know if a client is um if like a particular client is signing invalid messages and that could account for um low participation rate but i i i don't have much of you into what's going on at this point that message isn't super clear either that sometimes you can get that error when um it's just rejecting things it's already seen so i'm just gonna have i'm getting that on my answer and look into it a bit more so one of my nemesis notes is reporting abstractions of the future so there's some time discuss there that might be end right for epoch 1 i'm seeing about 54 participation i'm wondering if you guys are seeing the same i'm looking at 57 here 50 the 59.8 on aaron did anyone else see a duplicate block for slot one might be bouncing around in gossip so as a high level interpretation of this participation rate that isn't exactly what we expected it to be uh am i correct i understand that so we expected a hundred percent of people who submitted 32 eth to validate but it turns out gurley is cheap so many people would have submitted the deposit but they're not actually running a validator to support that but the network definitely yeah that's definitely one uh potential scenario here is that people just didn't come online um another one which i think we the investigations need to the investigations right now are going to be you know is there a client type that is online that isn't being included or isn't uh making valid messages or something like that um my my guess is that a bunch of people submit deposits and uh monday night happened and they didn't quite get their validator running and now their validator's not running so the network's response to this would be to to leak those validators down to 16 ethereum and then forcefully eject them as that happens um those validators are no longer in the network and participation increases because the live validators are participating and then we return to health is that the longer the longer that finality doesn't occur um the more that you lose for being offline um it accelerates uh and if for example 50 of the network was offline um it would take approximately three weeks for enough to be leaked to get there um which is not a very ideal scenario obviously in normal production especially if there's really securing these validators the offline validators have a high incentive to get online quickly so we don't really expect to have to get through that entire leak in a test that scenario there's a chance that somebody just bombards with a bunch of deposits and never came online um but because it doesn't really matter but hopefully people take this a little more seriously and figure out how to run their clients but again there could be underlying you know a deeper issue here so what we're doing is we'll be investigating that if it actually is the case that basically 40 of depositors are off um offline then i think you we would basically have to wait until they leak 25 percent of their balances right because if right now we have 60 online and 40 off then if the 40 week down to 30 becomes 60 out of 90 and i think starts finalizing again in which case the network would basically just not finalize for a few days and those people would learn a lesson or rather learn a test lesson um and it would just go from there so if someone has this available i mean i think one easy test would be to see if those missing validators are evenly distributed in the range because many people have positive large blocks and if some of those blocks are completely missing then that indicates it might be a client clients failure would imply even distribution because like people that deposit a lot would also presumably be running the same clients on all of them if they're lazy which i think most people are so far well right i would say a contiguous block would imply to me that somebody just didn't run their software because yeah yeah if we look on if the ethernet 70 is on prism and 30 is on vitals so i think that crawler well i'm not certain because if you look at the um the self-reporting on h2 stats the distribution is not that um let's see this seems to disconnect nodes quite fast before people have been able to identify it um i've had a few people say they can't find tekku but they keep getting our disconnected for too many peers custom disconnect code so they're finding us but not identifying us interesting yeah if you look at um i i quickly scraped the data off at youtube stats this morning and the self-reporting nodes which is only representative of the people that actually run this was 56 percent uh prism self-reporting 25 lighthouse 10 percent teku 6 members 3 25 load star um so i think that the i think the crawler is missing some of the data yeah that's probably right makes sense evo 3 should be up soon right yeah it's just gone by um and participation steady at about 57 on my dashboard 58 is everyone um that is running a particular validator type seeing uh blocks and at the stations included so i know that ben created a tekku block then are you seeing attestations included uh yeah i believe so so i'm checking on beacon chain so um to cross-reference in it and basically that's reporting my all my tech validators showing up for duty and that's getting info out of the blocks so that looks good right and um people running prism you're seeing blocks and attestations yeah mine is fine but i have inclusion delays for some reason okay lighthouse you're seeing people running lighthouse you're seeing blocks and attention included in the canonical chain uh yeah i'm not i'm not yeah we're building a chain with other people and we're not burning heaps of people and sending bad blocks so i was humor on the clinical chain look sir what do you think so i think our nodes went down um i'm trying to reboot them right now but so for our part i think that two two percent is not not helping what about slot 67 it was orphaned by nimbus yes we are seeing some problems with our notes as well and we are currently investigating it seems to be missing some other stations remember have you ever seen any we're also missing some asset stations members have you seen any blocks or adaptations included from your validators well it was mentioned earlier in the call that there were blocks proposed by nimbus but i'm currently investigating basically doing random sampling of our validators and now the result doesn't look very good okay so it could be um at least between some of the issues with nimbus and lodestar that might account for a small percentage of what we're seeing and if we fix those errors might get us over the over the hump um because loadstar and nimbus the teams have both made 1024 deposits correct that's correct yeah yeah so each on our site because everyone is encouraged to do some personal validation to many some personal validators yeah okay so each team accounts for at least five percent of the validator stake or in the range of you know four to five percent um of those original 20 21 000 validators so if we can get those online that might get us where we need to be so while this investigation is ongoing i can speak from an eth 1.0 perspective to a certain extent uh in saying that there is active um that there is active development for the one to eat to more or less i guess you could call it a transition and that's going very very well um the eth1 devs are tuned into the progress um and we are going to potentially this year we don't have an official date so i can't speculate launch the berlin hard fork at which point we're going to be including a pre-compile in as one of the changes that's going to help validate addresses deposit addresses on eth2 for the eth 2.0 launch so um or phase one i need to look back at my notes but basically uh eth1 is going really well right now we are still exploring some things in eth1x like beam sync and we'll continue to monitor the situation when it comes to eth 2.0 development and do our best to have everyone have a successful transition from eath one to eath too thank you hudson so let me zoom out again and and give us up the the overview uh we we had five clients who set up um beacon node invalidators to launch the genesis block of ethereum two phase zero um on the madasha test net um we launched the the genesis node i'm sorry the genesis block about 26 minutes ago the thing we're looking at now is participation isn't showing up the way that we expected it to and basically all that means are for whatever reason in between deposits being submitted validators being set up and validators proposing blocks there's there's some kind of um less than expected participation by all the validators this is something that's likely to be resolved in time and so danny vitalic do either of you want to uh yeah so we're seeing um we believe we've identified some errors and issues with members of mozart um the client teams of modestar and aggregate are running at least 20 48 validators so in the range of approximately 10 percent um if we can resolve these issues or um if we cannot resolve these issues soon we consider moving these keys over to a different validator type until the issues can be resolved at which point i believe with just the coordination of these two teams we might be able to resolve uh the finality issues in the next handful of hours as we as we investigate um something to point out and this is like a little bit of a cop out but the chain is working as intended um the chain is being built chain's being attested to and the chain is alive even though there's um failures and liveness due of finality um this can happen in production ideally uh it happens very rarely if at all um but being able to work through these issues uh being able to resolve errors and being able so the changes continue to be built and ultimately finalize itself is part of the protocol so although things did not go or not going currently quite as planned i do have faith that i think that we can resolve these issues in the next handful of hours and reach finality um so that's about all i have right now yeah i'd like to point out that uh you're correct we had genesis we have a chain running and resilience was built into the protocol and the protocol is going to demonstrate that resilience so rather than being less participation than we expected we have an opportunity for the protocol to demonstrate what it was built to do which is recover from low participation um so that's from that perspective it's definitely a success so um what i'm gonna do and what we're gonna continue to do is to um monitor figure out what's going on um and figure out if we can get this percentage uh participation rate up in the next few hours um and from there uh finalize this chain great all right i would like to thank everyone let's go ahead sorry there is a comment in the chat that they found a proposal slashing uh slot 138 so that should be interesting to see if it actually flows through and we get our first slashing on the network unfortunately one of the people who's who's uh actually uh validating and will lose them so it might do any help for the network super fizz um i for people who are wondering how can i jump in here to help out i want to participate either to get the percentage up or whatever else is the east staker discord the best place to go when it comes to getting your validator up maybe you went through the eth2 launch pad and then you had some trouble actually getting the command line stuff working where can they go yes thank you so yeah i would say um those those people the best place is going to be the east acre discord because we can answer individual questions and give individual guides if you have if you've gone through launch pad or you've um submitted a 32 gurley east deposit and you're not running your validator right now maybe it wasn't a big deal it is a big deal to us now so if you have those keys it would be great if you could get them online we'd love to help you do that you can come to the east staker discord general room you can come to reddit.com r eatstaker that right now is the best way for you to contribute to the big picture with that i think that we're going to conclude this call we're going to be looking forward to lots of growth and lots of updates in the next few hours again you can find that fun information about that on uh reddit.com we'll be we'll be keeping updates um and watching this throughout the next uh day and few weeks so thank you to everyone we will uh we'll leave this open for a minute or two for everyone to um say their goodbyes and i'd like to thank everyone in the community everyone at youtube um the implementers the researchers everyone for putting so much time and effort into developing a fantastic beacon chain product what i don't want us to do i don't want anyone to uh look at the current state of low participation and make any negative assumptions because the the client the protocol is still strong and valid we we have low participation at the moment but that is a very temporary um yeah we're gonna we'll we'll get through this we'll get through this okay so i have a quick announcement that we're testing an edge case uh so early yeah and like i was saying it's a demonstration of the protocol it's it's not um nothing well i don't want to say nothing like if one client if a client is not not working plus uh 30 if people are lazy like that's the sort of situation that the network's gonna have to deal with anyway like we're not kind of assuming everyone like these two kind of design rationale deliberately doesn't assume that everyone is hyper professional because we want to be accessible in all of those things [Music] thanks vete okay uh patricia did you have a statement uh yeah the pop-ups on the discord we will send them manually and there's like 500 people so please be patient bear with us it may take us a couple days for send them all but eventually you will get them [Music] cool i'm going to debug talk to y'all soon okay great lots of work to do thanks everybody um have a wonderful day and uh let's get this thing working bye thanks everyone bye-bye thanks guys [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] you
