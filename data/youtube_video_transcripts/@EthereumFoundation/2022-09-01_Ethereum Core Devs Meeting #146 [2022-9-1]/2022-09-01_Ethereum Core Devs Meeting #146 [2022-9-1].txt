okay hello everyone um welcome to the which number is it to the 146th or curtis call i'll i'm filling in for tim um just for this call um it's hopefully going to be a rather short one um yeah so we don't really have much on the agenda for today um the first and main item is just general match updates i heard that we had a very successful shadow fog um recently do we maybe have anyone on the call i think parry unfortunately was not able to make it um with anyone on the court that can give a brief update on this um um hey this is justin i was uh talking to perry about it he did use the phrase uh perfect merge so things went extremely well we actually had an increase in proposals um after it due to some uh some i believe it was the nimbus client that was actually behaving a little bit better post-merge than it was prior to merge um so super happy with that mainnet shadow 412 was pretty happy and the word perfection was in fact used and i know pari and he does not throw that out lightly great yeah i heard that as well um that i mean could not come at a better time uh basically that we have uh our second to last uh shadowful be the first one that's like absolutely perfect um great so um yeah with that uh do do we have um any any specific updates but any client teams is there anything uh for this call um android c i have your hand up uh yeah i'd like to say that um we recently there is a another issue that recently surfaced in aragon that we don't filter out uh transactions with invalid signature in our transaction for so we need to make another release to ensure that we don't produce invalid blocks that was separate like we fixed uh a separate issue where we produced embedded blocks but unfortunately yeah there is another one with with uh uh relay with uh not stringent enough checks on on transactions okay that uh that's good to know so for anyone listening um basically uh be prepared to to upgrade your arrogant notes um and just do just to be explicit like because we have the politics for coming up but this this basically the time here would be you can you could do that at any point before the actual emergency set right uh so it's yeah it um the the time is before the merch on the execution layer for for aragon update so if it's it's kind of because it only the bug and it affects block production and we don't have any uh pow mining on aragon so it will be only relevant for uh building proof of stake blocks okay yeah that's that's good context okay thanks for the update uh ben i see what's happening up all right thanks zen scott uh yeah for those who are using teku as a consensus client uh we put out a slightly broken release yesterday we have today about two hours ago made a new release 22.9.0 and we would strongly recommend anyone using teku to upgrade to 29 22.9.0 at your earliest convenience right thanks for that as well um i assume we'll see a few of these kind of small last minute upgrades so in general if you listen to this and even if your client wasn't mentioned here do pay attention um they can always be kind of last-minute releases um okay and and uh yes lucas uh so while nevermind doesn't have any uh anybody in roblox we will probably also have one sounds good and okay do you have any expectation already when that roughly will be uh yeah i was just wondering if you if you already um have a rough idea of of when people can expect that that release uh so we'll target early next week but i'm not sure if it will be like probably around tuesday sounds good but if you're running one um okay yeah good good context um gary yeah uh similarly basu is going to be doing a release next week on wednesday the 7th uh 22.7.2 uh there's we don't have a a critical bug that we're trying to fix but it's uh just you know logging improvements uh some additional uh features not necessarily features just uh fixes uh that will be uh not critical but recommended for the merge that's that i believe the seventh is post bellatrix but uh should be available on the seventh and we will be recommending that release for the merge sounds good sounds like a lot of um basically small um optional um actual releases um i mean i think this is that's a great place to be in just just this smallest minute improvements do we have any any other much related items for today oh okay i mean yeah i guess we have like this yeah one another small one uh shall we do you want to give an update on the optimistic scene tests uh yes so uh we have a consensus uh speak text vector updates here let me put a link here in the chat so mikhail and i are working on the optimistic sync test vectors and so we i attached the uh the simple test vector tables in this pr so um we're looking for more inputs from the sizes layer client developers on the new test vector format especially and so in this goal that uh it would be great if uh we have at this one or maybe better two client things to implement the basic test runner and provide some feedback for us and before we merge this pia and make a no more release for the whole test suit so yeah appears here and requests for feedback thank you okay um yeah great um maybe just because uh i i see some comments in the chat um i think uh bordeaux is still predicting more or less the same same time for the march uh thursday at around 4 4 a.m utc it's of course a little bit of variance depending on the count uh hash rate so actually that would be just for context a few hours before our next um okadaff's call so i think there's a very decent chance that this one is the last ever pretty much uh okada score but you who knows if the hashrate um ends up dropping a little bit before the match we might we might um just barely um slip to after after the call and also i think there are a few other kind of um merge prediction websites out there that have slightly different estimates instead do we by any chance no specifically like um why they their sister virgins i mean of course there's some uncertainty but um i think what else has been so far kind of the most precise um so is that kind of the main place for people to to look or do we do we um know anything there um mario yeah so uh basically bordeaux um calculates the prediction with a bigger time span of data uh currently like three weeks and other websites are using just the latest blog difficulty or the latest hash rate so that's what is up in past week or like five days so uh if you count just with this uh the merge would be like day earlier than what bordeaux says but like statistically it will probably get a bit lower so bordeaux is more conservative in the prediction um but on the border website you can also see the last chart where it's calculated purely on the daily hash rate uh you can see the uh how much extra it is needed to achieve on a given date so if the hash rate is stays as it is right now around 900 terra hash uh we will hit it on september 14 roughly earlier than planned um okay i think that's very helpful context specifically uh just for for people who are not super familiar with all the technical details and who are just um basically following along casually i think it's a little confusing to basically have these different estimates out there but i think um that's really helpful context i mean of course you know this is like a slightly like somewhat statistical uh process so we don't um we can't predict like the precise moment of the merge until we are closer um but uh you know i think all of these estimates give a good kind of bend um for for when when the match will uh roughly happen and also of course um that might drop back down a little bit before the match um so it could also slip like a day or so and um like a father as well so yeah anything in that range um for anyone listening you should be prepared um for the match to happen it but i think um thursday and two weeks is still kind of um the most likely date um uh with that i think that's for merge updates that uh what do we do with any any uh remaining merge updates otherwise there's the the other um point as well we will be having the final uh merged community call on the 9th so obviously you want to prepare for bellatrix before that but there will be one more session let's go to do we um um can someone just uh remind er listeners when exactly bellatrix um expected to happen i believe it's september 6th but i will double check on that yeah i think that that seems what i remember as well and of course with poetics perfects this um not the not the proof work and predictability of the timing so um yeah i think i think it is the sixth so again for anyone listening um you know um you should really uh have your setup ready by then because um that's when the content is there um box okay um ahmad i see you have your handwritten yeah so just need to encourage people to upgrade their clients because only right now 53 percent of clients are merge ready so we need more people to update their clients be ready for the merge is that 50 53 of stakers or 53 percent of users or not operators um getting my data from ethernodes.org not entirely sure i'm pretty sure it's just node operators okay yeah that's that's useful context of course um for non-staking node operators there's always less incentive and to make sure that they're that their setup is fully free um set up so we might expect that this will not quite reach a hundred percent uh before the merge but if you are not operate and you want to continue following the chain um then um you of course have to upgrade so please do that any other merge updates i mean it sounds like we're just not right on track quite exciting um well then uh let's just briefly go to the other general point just other um do we do we have anything anything non-much related we can we can discuss right now okay sounds like everyone is focused on the merge as it should be uh great so then with that this might be one of the shortest all kind of scores in history happy coincidence because you know it couldn't couldn't really break anything it's great are you we've been putting off planning shanghai forever like if we've got everybody here for an hour is there a reason we're not starting to plan shanghai um okay well let me just ask what's what do people have opinions and whether we should use the time today to um talk about shanghai or leave it for for later today in theory it's a nice idea but i don't think people are prepared to do that today yes okay yeah then i think i mean i can i can just very briefly say uh just because i've been somewhat involved with the kind of ep 484 effort um so yeah again i don't think now it's the best time to actually discuss the details of this um people are still working on this um so this is you know this um um first kind of version of this prototype charting um people are still trying to to get it ready so that it can be um considered and included um for shanghai so this is a very active effort and if any any of the of the client teams um happen to have you know some free time now that basically everything is in place and if they they're like bored waiting for the merch you know it's always they can just um we're just happy for anyone to reach out and give some early feedback and before we kind of open it right up after the merge when everyone is ready and but but yeah i don't think today is the day to to really dive into this and i think trent also just linked some some tweets for the epsilon team about um kind of the uf which is another one of these really exciting um updates that i've scheduled for for shanghai so um if anyone interested um do have a look no not scheduled for shanghai because we still haven't had a meeting to schedule yes yes yes this is why you know you need someone with experience no no but yeah exactly so this is just considered for shanghai that is said it's uh yeah considered conclusion right now um and that's that is a very important distinction so yes thank you micah but yeah with that um last chance um [Music] but it sounds like we're a bit we are um at the close so thanks everyone for coming um have a good day have a good um time before the merch hopefully relatively relaxed nothing super urgent coming up anymore that that would not be a great sign but um see you all soon and let's uh you know merge this chain bye everyone makes sense thank you
