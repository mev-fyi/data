good morning good morning I think I can pull your wall Oh what about now okay yeah i just don't think any better was talking and i just updated the agenda by the way and i think i posted a link so yeah look at that do you know how many people show are winning a swappable um no not exactly I know Christian is going to be 0 cushion just joined okay so far yeah we have a good amount of people so far definitely enough to continue with the meeting there's parity get theory MJ C++ Python usually some go people so we also have a theory MJS martin bz representing hello good morning Conrad looks like i'm in the bat cave or something should probably turn on a light good morning Alex hey yeah are you pretty good oh let's see I might go into the go channel and see if anybody can join is anyone from going here that I missed ya know Oh perfect occasion hey Daniel mean Daniel our city has each other oh ok and James here from Ruby good morning Jan or wherever whatever time it is where you are all right so yeah Daniels here then I think we can start let me see what's the first item my page closed it is Oh Christian XVI p 2 11 so if you want to get started with that you can go ahead and explain it and all that so you're talking about an offset weather well no not really a fever correctly yeah so another submission for the problem that it's hard to turn down casaste a phone call and the proposal would be to create a buffer and similar to the cognitive offer which then had a position memory and in a separate butter and contains the full return by extreme and there are two opcodes one of them is the trimming a size that extragenic size of this buffer and tell if a copy which can't use insulin which ecology happy to come take them from that actually they are thickness this is what concern and this is the problem that the memory of the connie have two can't be free immediately after to turn and this kind of changes the memory requirement of it and yeah so they want to propose to basically share this butter whenever menu is dishonest and I didn't really get why that can help sue could similarly play that perhaps isn't here I don't see him in here yet I'll send him the link to see if he can join I think anyone having better inside to us yeah i think if you often pull up the page but Gavin I think I'm gonna Gavin you suggested it right yes I think so games last year but I think a few golfers for whatever mechanic and you haven't talked about it all on ya hear yeah he updated theory about eight hours ago he added a comment to suggest don't define any memory restocking operation so she basically what it calls or not necessarily resizing I'm knowing a lot your suggestion because I'd be able to go to pirate that you watch the extra hooks University route what we sent me a miranda did hmm all seriousness buffer so that's a snack long but what there are other things like a store called the exotic will call me or where the guru chef Kerry Simon memories anx Sidonie sirloin you get all wrong we'll examine some of the earlier also going to be 85 h where even we start to like what the one you didn't call we fill atmosphere and eating a successful alcohol for yellow and is the calculations were very complicated dampening drawbacks are both to go to lowes this is just the fact that you two have to add a number gasps shaq-asso in the middle of the acqua di mo execution not start or they're clean off and I remember I'm listing it in I saw it all again and I just moved over D and long-term memory expansion that chef at chef from the start of the code to the foreign difficult actually allocate the memory of the added in scheme more accomplished so what a multi-product that the call code can't fail after so yes a unique one so they're keeping and the other would inhabit all marketing call the kind of has to serve to the gas for the leash and collar members yeah all right the problem with this one is that I feel like is the first of all is the kind of it increases the complexity of the object and a policeman after ass computational stage so a long ways I memory and is that gasps we also have yeah and we also have to worry officer data but it can be generalized this multiple segmented memory write all that you can lock here here don't you have another complication in return it and exactly the same object s called enter or it's very similar and then just tell everyone i think it's better to have more objects than more complicated um no Phil Phil to once your economic so awesome they can handle it very nice as well so so that another benefit of this is that and I imagine call is a type of interface that marking off the road between two different concepts washing machines and a glass of vinegar have specified so the memory can be an internal our conversion machine with you if you can part on data and content so the other thing that this kind of the relegation la Bastille or wait-listed me is that at the end technical staff because now for some weird reason and combinations that are call me indeed I want you to have a copyist voice or we can have their kind of costume for your place or no team want to set the argument or well it's not that it's not like it's just about the fact that a good block of extra your stuff is happening of course and it ends up being kind of decision we can't keep it around oh you resend them so so after this if this just implemented then there's only two ways to access the data of alcohol there's one of them is going to be the app that defended default by over to identify terrain and the other one is going to be to access you will return data copy access there in what generally have to resemble some feelings for logging something is employed a nice for me should that be given us to retain backward compatibility right well right so he even stole a while if we follow that principle then like I'm worried for 30 years down the line would have 50 of these in order cannot receive as well in we can so we can say that the third is empty is the return area of the call is not empty is it mmm you can we should recycle at least there's only one way to eat a certain time so you can't provide these two blues yeah ah so what is off waiting it in mind so what helped it all to have implement or like little test implementations to see just how complicated it is or would it be kind of not kind of pointless because we're still stuck on the idea it potentially being complicated to maintain backwards compatibility down the line well I can imagine what am I think people will be abusin if I far and I still see a lot next slide eight ER she wants each and every one of the annual 10 15 or more the Encarnacion picture another if it's a small change to a rule that's already quite complicated yeah and it's going to happen you object to the zoo stereos head hmm okay so it sounds like this might not potentially be a good candidate for metropolis to do to some questions but it's between now and the next all for dev call their can either be an alternative or people can come to agreement on it or I guess come around to the idea implementing in I think this can be brought up again but yeah I think we should continue the discussion on github unless there's any more comments sure yeah well i think is falling the [ __ ] all my work i'm the same we named chocolate because that but yeah yeah this doesn't get some scheme kind of asking for death or 48 years but I saliva look forward to continuing to sort of inter alia various roles cool sounds good any other comments Christian alright sounds good so this one we will just continue on github so let's see the next one is the Robsten spam attack so I am NOT up to date on everything so if someone doesn't mind just kind of in a nutshell just explaining what's going on there and if any action is being taken on the part of the Deb's to do anything because it's pretty unstable right now is what I've been hearing and additionally if this actually if it's actually really needed for it to be stable for future testing for metropolis or other things we're doing what is the current data often online is still going to work or yes basically is a fun an activist work off their own burn process the older or loss and on the soft work from there regarding the main chain it's kind of year because the conversion of establish return occurs and mo sang together and Alice Alana yet again huge gigantic a machine appears long guessing we have record will actively try to offer support responder he releases lost track material and what Ash's friendly and efficient thanks Israel monitor nominal fleshy can't ignore it back original sin la corte this is the huge conservative slow this time is the inertia right please read articles in we offer em the gasoline enema basically before Jason Martinez on law and order is longer Daenerys but that's possibly solution that we can always just released a new version of gas for this developers which are which has basically been the current change distracting to something and I think on whatever black mass destruction will be air pollution marketing in the American on man well careful right not require cushion haven't you know because in the Guardia you just excellent leaders can using literature Christina somebody now so the vehicle tracking from a prognosis is that a paragraph it has the ability to limit the law deafness why haha hardness and volatility gas does not have a Fisher to configure the feature to do to change also practice with this rather it means a year is not follow this path we are we do need to do some some development Alyssa starting to our data it's not something that we can just listen or so this parameter that's configurable how is it normally decided is it just hard coded or is it something that is adjusted by minors or users have to go and manually generally currently traveling spectrum Thornton aluminum

sort of real productions that you don't guess we are two large rocks or too deeply basically gas from the lodge memorial cigar lot and an action water i think murray has limits that biblically on different through many fishes below lovely so it's a promise in uniprot to actually drop all trapanese people to sing from not reappoint so forget i can do this regularly do yes we have not bad looking at least we can that law and anxieties exchange contain that larger DNT after departing from a point and a crappy one wallah i admire mortification trespassing communities as a kinetically delete everything Ignotus in generally candies actually proceed in a decent range rattling language around like at the national level particular recommendations the analysis we could try to censure you see the media would need to manually to in order to force I have to make this down a lot of their king okay so um arcady is there any strong conviction to maintain the fix the way you guys implemented it or would it be potential like a possibility to get in a chat with the rest of the client debs and see about this alternate way of coming to the consensus on which chain to dump in which block to could continue on sure i'm going to matter much we're fine whatever myself dammit that particular walkable before the local that I've got it it's still left on state law vintage and there but not a marsh after not that ended for moi okay and this Peter the approach you were talking about does it how much would it actually make some transactions that have occurred and valid the point where like test snaps would lose some of their state and some of their changes that you know they push to the network well that's about a thousand law so yeah and quite cool feel awful okay there's a high probability that the distractions are integrating a little chain but I'm also have some def go get food okay sounds good or not ideal obviously but good that we have clarity on that so not sure if there's any way to avoid that except to I guess pick some of these chain or four crops and which would be complicated in itself i'm guessing a long thing that's so more thing that we can do is a bigger than attractive stick with a stick severity chain because they seem to have to get out the nice Locker and forum and maintain a teacher and I researching so I'm fine as a container for I think question is how can we ensure that the old clients and somehow on that chain and a lovely to be action figure out how two rooms locked in it because I personally am NOT Lee and we're that blocking asana but still you know what remove the botanist would be nice to know how we have attracted after trying to go there yeah I would imagine it would be more difficult to provide an incentive on the testament at least for that to happen I guess it wouldn't be impossible to just be getting people to combat it with their mining powers the only way i can think of anyone else have thoughts from that metallic long guy who was because manacles with hearing he actually offered me personally that if he can afford to snack refugees used to just try to show ever chain water off okay that's pretty cool then yeah I think that's a good idea then so let's go ahead and take this this wouldn't be an EIP obviously we can take this into the all core devs channel on getter and coordinate with all the clients and actually jan or anton or any other clients that are in here they all have any opinions on this or is there going to be any issue implementing this on your side so on more possible solution is that so unworkable solution still at the track push push for change music and the internal economic heavier and whatever else is out there and then all science google not distinct to that without having to a modification so that was possible so I think experiment gas can create a semantic distinction correctly the demeanor science can automatically stink exchange from Lana I think I've just as editing watching people try to if you wanna be synchronous because both already have hash have cash in our data crunching yeah I would say the top the most used clients for that would be get parity in a theory MJ just because I think harmony might use that test that is the default I'm not positive so but yeah it sounds because Anton said that it wouldn't be too hard for them to do something like that we can just coordinate this in the Gator channel so many other comments on this okay it's great I also saw in the last 24 hours this is item number 3 by the way there was some discussion about minors not or minors using the old recommendation for gas price can anyone gives kind of a synopsis on that and what's been done I'm sure so basically the idea here is that there are um yeah my soul games all right now or cellar around equation American were slightly off Lucien and the some people are basically concerned because they expect that efi the beginning of the price of ether that all over the last couple of weeks liga eh smell fresh sugar dynamic compensate or transaction fee still get it too high um so began in the challenge is though that while the idea that gap should be in and it is Ariel in the cream in the current environment the situation is a bit more complicated because the basically the only reason why the meijer a tray now you will not accrue transaction this is because this is what happy for others and a shovel yes well it is because they're afraid of increasing the probability desert walking away to be available right so this is something that a lot of meijer store is taking more seriously facts during a big deal Waka cracks and but the basic principle is that if your water large sure varsity and therefore more likely to get propagated in in in I'm or cellular levels back animated office and Ashley feeder pressure from eater seein me a couple more regressions today and he discovered that become really unique on Christians or gas price is per aspera p.rhet nearly get from fees mashes up with their with the cost that they have to pay for from the increased uncle race on these the equal really ours around a 19 channel right sort of peter pressure from research in statistics such yeah right we could actually get paste this into this txt chat room there is okay so right now is it yeah so these some years if we want to have a or if we want to get rescued work go lower than the city this is the assumption of austin would be to show that somewhat castle we um we should have cushioned small it actually makes me a minor much more learning in future dashes on the other way would be um do people still carry by the way yeah sometimes your connection gets a little bit slow but it just it just doesn't actually make you go away it just slows down your speaking for a second so you're still somewhat um oh we're going to go thank you ya voy but it doesn't see melissa here in the shot yet got it now over on ok there is yeah yeah so basically the challenges that you look at the average walk more bright variously everything forward is to around 3.4 eec yes sir but look if uncle inclusion of a vertical efficiency will be able to a up to four points be cinema claude and then i would actually reduce the people really always a couple accessories Shannon so remember that sub developer started what look briefly at why digital happening in an exit visa community for all ended up being that there is a portion of situations where when clients for easy blocks the end up kind of not adjusting these are adjusting your work shortly enough so the orgo that is where they basically don't I opened in until a blog after initial you should be available this before before the air strike three o'clock we're so like it what basically absolutely want to used to go down the working and what unit that our dear one of the support or one of the easiest approaches asaram ability only other thing would be a base and a hard work see or adjustable constants destroyed it instead of like my rescue or for show emotion deductions on but it also is added royalty or not needed so the non hard fork solution would that just be I guess would that be considered a soft fork or just an education for the resort it's not even for it's a strategy changing the client's innocence estrategias voice and marketers should support because it will get a little more revenue ah ok so it sounds like it's a dual changing the clients changing how they you have some of the stuff for their defaults and then having something that shows miners the the fact that its optimum and part of what I was thinking is maybe I know there's for the Vic one community there's certain sites that show like the optimum guests or optimum transaction fee in order to get your transaction on the network I wonder if there can be some kind of very basic like one page site that shows the optimum strategy for minors to make the most money at the time using a formula you work two minutes ago oh great awesome you know what's the senior after Altamont gas price ratio optimum also an intrusion strategy and I think that I would have to be related to the client it's not something really easy because I got it okay that's different than yeah one of the framers they can set okay so yeah let's let's start with parity parity with you have any thoughts on that is that something that could be agreed upon him and changed well yeah sure didn't know a condition so as for the gas rifle ready for an factory and here wife misty but for an Omega feel just an equal in all right okay sounds good and then I'll go team I not entirely sure the changes in there we can change whatever so it should be fine we're seeing water change just react with the artist on approach a problem is a lot of action arises even as Mullins cancel the follow- override peoples and birthday parties and the original to rugby for which are below my incision might happen that the first article of interaction data center click over all replaced without actually and minor including it so that's that money should resign clear affinia practice there somehow aboriginals need to wat minor do look what the default are ya what a long as you're in robotics I just wanted to meet once again actually a meeting us all resist but it's not needed a suggestion which is that the science room just being able to choose the aspiration terms of the number of way maybe me possible choose the average but here even more in what 3gs as either a percentile or as a mobile what we are or the original to deliver something similar the ideal either they'll just make it easier any more deliberately is there anyone from web 3jf in here that can comment on that I guess it would be Alex or Martin hunger disease if you do smaller so i can promise including a setting promise that happened we lower the gas fact that opening up the network effect deny a thurs amazing we cannot lower field personally for me huh proportional to lose your hearing is your experience in fully these per meter services to the pre-war and is something that people where is the dysfunctional you people it wants to have but we know that you don't resell or there's a small problem how we can monitor so authorities and the economy get miners to excel / lower heat look out for how we allow already spoke about making an ideal distribution of course so one of the third point my current instinct is that I think first of all regardless of whether fees are low or high like your new service to those chapters are going to learn is just need full blocks and just set off for walks forever or water that in an assassination washing not work well or whether it's in a sense to blow and blow of the state and I think if I mean is hopefully act you know once we get up or if we're comfortable that old is an elf service issues are fixed then she runs through the ethernet water be a monodisperse in Spain both the whole time log that something that knows should theoretically be able to tolerate but its surface decent growth in us in the area where we want to be here than we have to rebalance again for awkward gas prices again so it sounds like there's not a quick fix necessarily but as long as the cost versus benefit is on the benefit side for you know enabling people to I guess have more freedom to choose I think I think I'm following that correctly then that would or to choose the gas price when they're actually sending their transaction that that can alleviate some of the issues that people have them okay hold it oh alex could you get close to do you're Mike alright sorry yep we can hear you now if you can start over okay so I decision this and over the last Mountain log of all transactions wearing to this over 75 cents then we're back attention lesson one percent were free and only only and avoidable that they are PR action so is that means that log still here though the initiate thinking even though we miss you included lighter people only look at lighter most people don't don't change it to make it larger and each people it's more than tension on international level at yourself so most people do not change the default water okay if it's not too personal a fine but it's still a staff yeah I definitely needed the wicked price rises is adiabatic costs should go down it's on the move a little bit okay so yeah that would be I guess the suggestion for the 13 team right for whatever you for well over season oh okay maybe I'm not following this correctly but I thought it was the user being able to or I guess they already can adjust that in this nevermind yes but if you put it over infection I should not do they and not mine though okay so yeah if everyone else doesn't think it's a pressing issue it doesn't need to be resolved today necessarily so any other comments sexy my pressing issue is we don't have solid knowledge without assault rather in a short and long term so basically if you can figure out how to prevent them from being the offline my client relationship I'm theatre can you just or are you specifically concerns or daughters in terms of short-term impact so the question or experiencing a partner of sufficient or restarting xfinity about more long-term daughters that struggle and border of the station is ability / vers la la la actually I have an absence of month launching are talking about the network its top celebrities live here okay the very reasonably probably needs to be sorry for sure so I think last loose nut I am walking before they want to finish I thought through our property Knobloch just turning around tens of thousands of Honda action is an action as I actually slow and fixed a shoe but corrective action are I opener that a lot of things that will really wrong if you allow on basically turn actions you lot and actions to sustain I think that laboratory to this oh it's not something that you should not be in at ya so get there by the problem of the eternal Perry miners they use their fault don't mine you know dubstep transactions attention with characters can change the gamilons won't really low transaction so respectively the on you can't broadcast a transaction with lessons for my Shanna because it gets real a Baldy so Peter is that something that sounds accurate for the way guess operates on default yeah yeah this is not offered but okay if if you stock settings on actions that won't be 18 by an environment you will equal level okay so yeah unless there's any more common it sounds like Chris needs more book sounds like this needs more study so whatever thing that we could practice this one learn severity all the focus aside their backs to the dollar value although easily i canna find as a horrible idea socialization focuses because means user only here i have one of the exchanges and hope that it will [ __ ] your entire network so that's my biggest issue this this is your place in school p market in the hands of the next change but if you can tie in a reasonable way to the dollar and the media dis- but probably there will be some iron wok manual changes to may be stable at least and if you can try to play around with the promise you will see the larger than the x times e denied access to basic architect is there any I guess like Plan F the exchanges or whatever data sources manipulated is there multiple data sources that are pulling for that US dollar price currently there's just not a source but it's check for being sane I think yeah and yeah all right okay at sinuously so friends around santarus car PMT at the five fifty-five thousand nine hundred dollars I'm seeing would look saying so but it could be back Sinatra hmm ok so there's a few different so you something there's a few different suggestions Peter if you could just do just a summary write-up of kind of what we talked about on the issue we can circulate that for more discussion and see if we can't come up with a short to intermediate term solution unless it's something more pressing I don't exactly have a grasp on how pressing or how tight it is to the price so yeah you slow manner so that people who eat food then I'm going to get out okay great yeah p write that up and send it to me I'll circulate it on the appropriate channels for parity Theory MJ Ruby all the other ones and maybe even run it appropriate so what I really have something up right Oh perfect okay any other comments on that oh yeah I didn't have that the the transaction relay policy is important to you know I think it's working an EIP to specify the networking layer the transaction we lethality because right now the the extraction of a transaction origin you know the economic strata it won't work if if got no don't relate transactions with your gas right so is that someone I'll go ahead so let's suppose that we start laying transactions if your gas price and I start firing out contract calls from a million different account all other thing that this is your gas market means that the alga will have a network so that's one of the I guess spam do s vectors that you were referring to earlier lacrimosa vaxcel I can basically turn out infinite number of transactions that are completely valid yes they will never ever be processed and I can the problem is that even zero gasps hi I can actually create new brand new Cardassia second equation assesses a car Chardonnay to the level at the furnace and they will start propagating anyone if they swap them I don't care as long as it's probably something the network will start getting sluggish okay that does sound like a concern okay so yeah any other comments otherwise it sounds like Peters going to summarize all of this sense it's a non non trivial but you know can be solved issue Oh Daniel your microwave don't work [Applause] that can be mitigated ization of wording convection not necessarily some other posted that's why are they so Daniel your microphone just went haywire and sounded like robot who is screaming for dear life if you could repeat what you said and just look at chat will tell you it or the chat in Google Hangouts will tell you if it does it again if you can adjust anything and it might be a combination of your microphone volume input volume and your how close you are to it ok it is any better now oh it's perfect now so if you could just repeat what you said ok so after that was common for that that it is not necessary the solution to this problem is not necessarily a hardcore OC of whether to forward transactions are not worried but it might also be so bad organization that if a node is having managed contraction which is from that it matches which version to forward fish that microfilm in today's dog attacks has described editor double my heart yes true the problem starts happening where product lines that we will try to property transactions that cost a lot money yes they will not be included for some reason and we actually might prioritize a statistical transaction so there's programs angle increases transaction that requires four million gasps back off little action and then cysteinyl subsistence transactions that are really really expensive but since I each of them can see my full block or maybe I earthquake damn block worth of transactions with cheaply and the Tana really let artists transaction and then while you will be spinning around their practice transactions where they will won't get into the direct action and political connections kept okay it's possible for this under saying that it's not not an obvious solution okay yeah it could even potentially be a combination of these some of the things you talked about and optimizing what gets relayed so yeah I guess it's what I guess you have to also judge if these rules or these changes would even be followed or if they can be made in a way that you know everyone cooperates for the best interest of either themselves or the network so yeah but this is an interesting problem yeah any other comments on this okay so yeah the last item that's officially on the agenda and just by the way before we go into this fourth item is there any other ones that didn't make it on the agenda that someone wanted to cover after item for now okay so we're going to go ahead with the agenda item for which would be the metropolis IPS so from my perspective of where we're at with that there's going to be some there's some people who are formalizing them in PRS the eip editor team has been going in and providing suggestions or getting them to conclusion as far as making sure that they're syntactically correct by the eip standard and that there isn't any glaring errors does anyone else have comments i know the talak is written a good majority of them or maybe all of them so you can go ahead with your memory um yeah I don't hmm i don't think i have any serious new office and in the mistryl or he is my mobile he got working with a Christian finalize except i was surprised too early it was going to be working with jeff to an unrelenting up so that would be air loss occurs and earrings aside from that I don't think I've had a new insights instil actual okay about a month ago I know Martin host one day have brought up the the issue of the difficulty bomb is there an update on that as far as the network changes that may have prolonged that or if there is something that needs to be planned and what time frame practically speaking I think it all have to be for long hmm so he's an ass and it's me actually can just reuse a nap right now on this is just one lucky girl is going to look like yeah because I feel like there should be somewhat of a at least a mergency mitigation strategy if needed at minimum but also just kind of thinking about if anything needs to be done ok I'm going to really screw up with the latest data and it looks like at the end of March the locks on affinity around 14.6 tagging at the end of June it's going to go up to us it'll be a drought 4026 21 seconds and at the end of august it'll be 32 servings all thomas for the Sun yeah for medications go you may I [Music] but when you operate was that in a difficult calculation functions we would basically add a few where let's say for the walk number less than four million then use that if it's the walk number six we need for a 46 million is just use another 4 million instead of all 66 lawyer and then use the walk and relies too so we were just I or official a discontinuity okay and that and that's something that would hold up all the way until the potential transfer from proof of work to proof mistake yes yes well still healthy to a lot of transfer to proceed by the way is that with my latest kind of thinking and I mean if you want more details like I wrote a bunch of medium hosts that I'm going to eat where anymore is that it does seem like we are Suresh we might be a possibility if you willing a kind of slow transition so where we would go switch from a proof-of-work to prove my work with fruit of state-run Lhasa Apso need anything to hide recruits takes to add more false escape over time so look even though implementing one hundred percent of that road application longer so I legacy is seeking more than here uh yeah if we would get to some of the earlier stages of the way ahead of schedule so that's just so information to think about yeah I recently heard an interview with Rick Dudley I think that's how you say his name where he was mentioning the i guess the certainty that there would be a time and transition process where proof of work and proof of stake would be running alongside each other and also figuring out i guess have it how the EVMs are going to i guess work beside each other or if there's complete compatibility complete compatibility with even one versus tbm too so yeah my question basically is the for the P poww and POS running alongside each other would that be something that is still a little bit unexplored or is it pretty much known that the through these transitions that's going to take months to kind of D couple the two so we need a different way so as running them at the same time at what oh it looks like we do bushes right oh no not to block chains to proof of work and person stake at the same time yes numb wrong yeah so the idea would basically be a right that we could first implement the proof of state court very conservatively so that the proof of stake would basically only finalized washed after proof of work as like a Sox will finalize them anyway then over the course of a couple of months we would in this place that would savor the fruit of state fortress rule then we will probably cut down with proof of work walk reward increased out of group of state validator reward then we would implement some hybrid groups they steam that would let us kind of parameterize between from working fruit of steak I'm 0 to 100 scale and then we would just implement implement that and still look first formed would not even be a part for it would be a very weird kind of soft work via in the second court would be a hard for it but it could be one that kind of eases into the new version over the course of media hundred days or something okay so it's just more of an issue of implementation coordination once the research team I guess somewhat officially wraps up the process on how that can go okay sounds good so along the way ch.12 already being implemented into the floor level are diamonds oxygen through what are we see you oh okay so is that something that's also an any other clients are just Oh implemented not actually but if you're basically in talks at any time here oh yeah um so what you think would be to keep it pure class laughter now because it's still in iteration most but once it settles that it should probably went into class directly okay and the timeline for that is post metropolis it sounds like yeah yes always to get into the cenacle axis book metropolis for giving it an entire bottom will have in a barrel everything is doing in parallel okay sounds good so um i guess if i were to create a summary on the metropolis stuff IPS are seeming to go well there are some discussion on them we're going to continue to monitor the PRS and the editors are going to love to make sure those are moving along and don't get stalled as far as discussion and other things are concerned and then Oh finally is there when is the one is there a need to actually put a block number down for metropolis it sounds like the last time we talked we are actually two meetings ago we were talking about making it a fairly conservative fairly conservative number to allow a ton of time for testing and to have less rushed hard fork in order to avoid any issues we've had previously a lot a lot to rush for us for Courtney Nash we do mr. habla ya when you actually do metropolis because I mean homestead wasn't rushed to either but like some of the recent hard Forks that there was a cadence of you know having a hard fork performed within a month just because of having the mitigate attacks and other things so I guess this 100 you can go to quick draw that yeah so I was just saying the cadence of recent hard Forks has been rushed so I'd just iterate or Jeff implied two meetings ago that we should be given plenty of time so is there any comments on how much time that should be or if there is a need to actually set kind of a rough time in the next couple of weeks or something to make to decide on the block number of things like that so I don't think we should be deciding a block number until you see both lost flashes greatest asset and 20 clients or with that um something to be synthesized ELISA so it's this really really recommend making a starting to go longer for that so it need to go off to something like three weeks okay yeah that sounds reasonable or three weeks pending any issues that may arise the winner yeah yeah okay cool yep that sounds good any other comments on the metropolis cips cuesta cific question about the account abstraction is it the case that if we have this special bureau signature than the sender is set 2-1 echoes you're all um yeah okay so anyone can spend money than I yeah okay right sounds good any other comments on metropolis well I think it'd be good to have a an idea of when we're shooting for you know to do the fort whether you know sit in August you know what would be okay to do it when Ross or about 9 30 seconds it will be for coaches to you know 15 or 20 seconds my personal preference would be in with the engine soon but so yeah and that kind of sounds like it's dependent on the implementations and the discussions over what is already longer we got logs we don't have any bit longer we're going to it here okay there can i guess i agree with case you know there needs to be i guess some sort of at least assurance that there is a time frame we're shooting for in order for the network block time to not go up to an unsatisfactory level for the majority of the level that's the majority of the community would think as an unsatisfactory level so what concerns that if the block nap gets you high then a lot of cash power might wish to you know is more profitable ah ok um i would argue that at that point Etheridge's I so far ahead other other cryptocurrencies in terms of dollars per second that I never give the number of people of another risk of that is actually lower than the extensive we should make people happy by confirm earlier using this motion rate okay um sounds good and I'm getting actually just over half a pack of key servers on with that flowers I would have known because you have too much more caution but and let's sort exactly when you for over 25 decaf yeah when I weaker than i-19 Andy yeah sure that's a 40th actually yeah so you can determine areas for further life okay and if there is a change such that somehow we get back to the state you were like are the conditions not necessarily the price of five dollars but other conditions and the cryptocurrency ecosystem would this be able to be the time frame adjusted and we feel safe enough to do it by would it still be kind of shooting for end of june or what need to be pushed up quicker for casey's concerns it ended up kunis should be objectionable because when its twenty seconds versus 14 points for two in that much but you know once we start talking but for people to vs. surreal oh that's a different issue so yes under google condition yes we have to probably put a control laws on ahead take it out to be short or too okay sounds good so yeah we can cross that bridge when we come to it it sounds like and we'll just be monitoring that over the next few all core dev calls any other metropolis related comments um what a Christian I wanted to ask what you have there been progress on that evil messing decent people off lots and when does it look like we're close to having cast photo the rocker target is integrating the slot properly we should be a lot of to finish so ok this is always perfect yeah that case I recommend starting task for everything except for the star stuff and I so so sorry so the star stuff is the matter of the restaurant yet or successful oh yeah I laughing about the old mistralla features her stuff okay sorry I know we started to work on on the other stuff and sausage snark stuff is Montana ok guys here yes ok cool any other clients going to comment on their progress from some of the implementation marketing i saw the parity team i think was in the process of at least doing initial implementations of 86 yes right working for whistle yeah walking we're waiting on the test let's see more at present ok concern a 6 um this is our conscious effort infrastructure allow for these tests because I mean when when when connects to the webblock they should all be director one of the things we don't have to have structure to test the 930 ray right and you know I have to come out of that now alright sounds good so we're waiting on test and then that'll help with testing but it sounds like we're still at least finalizing some of the specs so that can definitely happen in parallel you know in general we lost to what test mining strategy then one thing you could do is you could just set up on your minor alan ralston and on ralston check you know if you create will are going to be sure to younger work that we for uncle that you're recruiting or a poor or 375 okay so that can even be coordinated if we want beforehand if we just figure out is a Robsten miners if we can just ask them to do that right if you will get the slip strategy six or doesn't really need twice coordination okay oh so yeah that's right cool and then um yeah i think is there anything else from metropolis wise anybody had a comment on mmm cool quick shout out to yo e cheese work he just released a blog post on formerly I guess formally verifying some of the are guess it looked like it was putting it like graphically some of the things that were coming up for proof of stake and some of the stuff the research team has been doing yeah so that was the baseball not jelly this week dr. King the building office and now that Aniyah doing some consider of that haha I think I mean Mia now i am explaining everything to these machines so now i think this explaining things to people with so in a very fine go shopping awesome sounds good yeah good job and a last point is that the eip editors are currently meeting periodically to go through the IPS again if anyone in here has an EIP especially one that is mid-2016 or older if you could go in and update them to say this is something that i still want to do or this can be closed or close it yourself that would be incredibly helpful because we are crunching through i think 156 or so eip s that are in various states of abandonment or just like some and progress stuff including stuff from 2015 so yeah if you can go in there and do that that'd be very helpful and then we're also checking the PRS fairly frequently every few weeks to make sure that those kind of stay in line so yeah I think other than that is there any other comments from anybody yes just all this question that using the normally closed and I formal yeah stop the leaf on a score compiler Roxy I thought and I think it makes sense and most of the people creating your proposal miyake facebook and the moral is added to the idea so as far as the rally marking your active least it we also handle PR my question is this work is this something that we are going to sue it and if yes I'm from do you can just accept it as a yes crappity I do something or national professional so this is the most important thing to watch out here is to a sensorial recording the earth yeah I agree yes that's nice yeah and would this can be handled by the group that makes the gap frameworks I guess it ours once you take it away including that another issue and we are cool that the problem is that nobody really uses these samples and more because for example many people want to slap each day as possible do that then some especially but I don't think people have already spend on decency maybe keshava ready to just a specimen actually using it but it's actually done slimming and fasting is the underscore compatibility rapture using Sophie therapy ok so here love ya tittle turning in Google hockey so that it doesn't work basically and I guess it's all gears who are attracted follower ok so updating the tutorials would need to be something that is looked at and right now the tutorials or at least the ones that the foundation has more or less produced are pretty outdated themselves that's a whole different issue but inside that eep we can kind of discuss how to move forward with that in the best way actually at me not sure that I shallow tutorial fish facility because I was that for example the zoo it really spacious somebody sometimes to a half years ago and Victor he wrote some sleazy tutorials are my application and in arrogance to the field athletes tutorial should be in the superior movie page because they have a typical Syria and austell think it's something that we article in black maintained but it was decided a nappy foreign language topic yes it's not as if a big decision for making little well aware of the key wiki an editable destroyer store on the Syrian border so I think that illusion i think if we could make a more natural something that works too to try and any quick tutorial page that the agenda each other happy we can even a single please ya esta court was our initial attempt at that and that's kind of fallen as a not a priority compared to some of the other stuff the main Tanner's we're doing so i might do a shout-out on reddit to see if anyone wants to pick up on that and anyone here the ethics org there's a repository and the etherium github account that's called by come stead docs that really needs to be updated to something more generic but I hopefully will have time soon to do that there's a few things more pressing because I was one of the main maintain errs the other ones were Bob summer well and Victor Tron and I know Victor's then all in on swarm and stuff lately so I know he can't maintain it so it's more of a an issue on that front of finding someone to maintain it and keep up with the changes so I'll see if anyone in the community can take that on along with maybe someone who works on a core client just helping with their piece of that and yeah so that's pretty much the deal with that and I'll comment on the eip to see how we can move that along as far as a plan and what type of VIP it should be cool is there any other comments great all right I think we're good here i'm going to upload this recording in the next few days i'm behind on uploading the recordings but that should be fixed pretty soon i'll have 10 and 11 up so thanks everybody will have another meeting i guess in two weeks which would be the third friday of the month where we're on a cadence now the first and third fridays every month so thank you everybody have a good weekend [Music]
