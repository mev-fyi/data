foreign [Music] okay so I know it's 5 30 and it's been a long day and I know everybody's thinking about dinner but let's talk about social composability so I want to talk specifically about how Dows can leverage it for the future of work okay so I want to start with actually who am I right so actually I think that nobody here knows me so have we met you and I would you hire me for 300K a year probably not right that would be insane right not yet exactly have we met no do you trust me probably not okay so exactly so who am I which begs the question if you don't know who I am why should you care about what I have to say right you came here you don't know me right so what's happening is actually that invisible identifiers are at play here that we subconsciously respect right the fact that I'm up here at Defcon giving a talk means that you to some extent respect the approval process of Defcon somebody has vetted me and said this person has expertise worth sharing right but actually I would probably think that nobody here knows what the Defcon approval process looks like so you're trusting something that you actually have no idea how it works and this is even more difficult online right the internet is absolutely crazy platforms don't talk and reputation that you build on one platform is completely irrelevant on another if you've got three million followers on Twitter that only matters on Twitter technically right did you know you specifically that I used to be the head of design at Spotify yeah no of course not because it's a lie I'm not right but on LinkedIn anybody can say anything right I can just go on LinkedIn and say yeah I designed the internet as we know it right there is very little checks and balances of that system right when you hire somebody via LinkedIn you need to go through their referrals you need to check their CV you need to invite them to an interview there's an arduous process for verifying that somebody has the skills that they say they have which brings me to social composability right this is something unlocked hopefully by web3 that I think is going to change a lot of things going forward so composability is for anybody who doesn't know it's basically Lego right web3 loves it it's how can I make a basic building block that anybody else can start reusing and social composability specifically it's about social identifiers as Lego so information that says something about you that represents you as an individual and about the skills that you have but what do we actually want to know about each other what information makes us who we are in the age of Taos we actually need to change the kind of information that we need to know about each other because the type of work has changed so we kind of need to as Gamers would say min max it right we need to maximize the useful information about each other while minimizing information that we don't necessarily want to know about other people we need to respect each other's privacy as well so right now money talks in web 3 I if I've got loads of money I can buy a board ape become part of the board ABF club and suddenly I've bought my way to influence so that's not kind of the web three that I want to live in so what if more could talk than just money so at Common Grounds I'll get to that in a moment we're building based on boardier's theory of capital and he was a French sociologist that basically came up with a theory of capital there are lots of theories of capital but his is the one that we are using to build because it was concrete enough for us to build good software with it so what year says that you have multiple types of capital at your disposal one is economic capital which is basically cash right your assets the the nfts that you have the properties you have and all of this money your Colombian pesos you also have social capital though and social capital is your connections it's the people you know it's your parents it's who what clubs you're part of the influence that you can exert via your social capital and then there's also cultural capital and cultural capital is your knowledge it's your education it's your mannerisms it's maybe even having a British accent right it unlocks certain doors because of having access to this kind of cultural capital and finally there's symbolic capital and symbolic Capital it's Prestige if you have two rich people but one person spends it all on culture and being a patron of the Arts and another rich person spends it all on gambling and cocaine they have different symbolic Capital they are perceived differently by Society if I write books to extend my my respect in the world I'm growing my Prestige and therefore my symbolic capital and all of these things are deeply in interconnected so you can trade these things for each other so for example I could spend economic capital to become part of the board API Club to grow my social connections I can throw those connections earn knowledge or Insider alpha or whatever the hell using that Alpha I can maybe write blog posts about it and get really trending on Twitter and grow my symbolic capital and using all of these things I can start making money again so all of these things are interconnected and they say a lot about your standing in the world and the influence that you can exert over it so let's look a little bit about identifies in web 3 that say something about you so for example in economic capital somebody has a hundred Doge that's okay that this person has a wallet understands a little bit about cryptocurrencies cool they bought some Doge good for them this person whoa it's still a hundred but who is this person right like this this is probably an important person or at least a very rich person right so but you need to know the difference between these two things the average person has no idea what this means and for example Social Capital if you have 72 followers on Twitter maybe you're writing good content maybe not who knows but you know you don't have a broad audience so to speak but you add a k to that 72 suddenly you're a big person you have influence over the space I want to get to know this person with 72k followers I want to know what they have to say I don't want to it's biased but I want it I don't know why and for example cultural capital so the knowledge that we have for example if you participate in governance good for you you've understood what governance is you've read a proposal and you put a vote on it cool you already know more than 99 of the entire world however if you pass the governance vote so if you wrote it if you defended it to your audience and got it approved in your Dell clearly you know a lot about the subject matter that you just proposed you have a different cultural capital at your disposal and another example is for example the Devcon at ND so this is you the audience right you have certain knowledge you've understood what ethereum is you understood how to come here and that you want to learn more but it's not the same as Defcon speaker me in this sense who's been invited here to be an expert on the subject matter I have in theory more knowledge about something that's why I'm standing up here and finally symbolic Capital as an example to be a member of a Dao is a fantastic interesting thing it means that you've understood what a Dao is you're contributing in some certain way it doesn't necessarily give you a lot of prestige however if you are a founder of Adele maybe you have more connections through that people start talking about ah this person founded a Dao oh my God who who is this person so they have access to different kind of symbolic capital and this again influences all of the other types of capital so you get the idea web3 says a lot about you but only if you understand it and actually understanding it itself is cultural capital it gives you an advantage to know these things and most people don't understand it so let's talk about designing a system of identifiers and this is I think where it gets a bit more interesting so we think a common ground that a major source of identifiers should be when humans interact most of society is built through humans interacting and I think it says a lot so for example if we build a chat app where one person asks for help and another person provides that help this is very qualitative as an act and it's difficult to quantify it's difficult to say this person has provided a helpful service but what if in web 3 we could say actually if this other person says yeah thanks for for helping me this person could grow helpfulness in a kind of gamified way you build this identifier that in a way you are helpful in the space and this is just the first example another example is you become a member of a Dao so if I join a Dao as a designer and I contribute for a month slowly my little Dow contributor level can go up and eventually of course once I'm level two level three people will be like whoa this person knows a lot about contributing to Dallas and another example is governance votes if I vote Yes on governance proposals I can grow my governance expertise and in a few years people will be like wow this person has participated a lot in governance and what this does is basically you start mapping out a skill tree of The Human Condition you basically collect and map out your accomplishments and in a certain way web 2 companies already do this except it's a quarterly review you sit down with your supervisor and they say what you're good at where you're performing where you're underperforming but it's a very subjective thing it depends on your boss it depends on your supervisor and ultimately if I quit a job and go to another company I have to start again from scratch I have to convince them that what I did at the last company was really good totally believe me guys uh you know regardless of of what I'm actually being reviewed as so it's a very subjective thing and I think once we start mapping out the Human Condition in this way you can start becoming more objective but we'll get to the cons in a moment so this becomes a massive skill tree summarizing your entire existence into badges right this is amazing loads of projects are building this right now it's going to be really cool so these social identifiers become verified credentials to be used anywhere this is the composable aspect something I earn on one platform I can use anywhere across web 3. that's where it gets interesting and pay attention to VCS because you're about to see them everywhere in web3 actually the w3c in March this year recommended starting to use verified credentials so it's officially endorsed and I think loads of projects are going to start using it so I think my work here is done right easy I've mapped The Human Condition that was super easy and nothing bad can come of it probably but it's not that simple right because designers have a massive responsibility when actually trying to map social behaviors and uh social inequality to basically a glorified skill tree so all human beings are fundamentally Born Free and equal and dignity and rights so this is from the universal Declaration of Human Rights and basically that means that these kinds of systems have to be designed really really thoughtfully because they can have ramifications socially that maybe you don't entirely are able to put to anticipate right so what's to stop my entire reputation that's on chain ruining my life in three years through some reason it conducts me and suddenly people find me at my home and that's it because of some reputation thing I did three years ago so we need to start actually talking about preventing reputation trails so we need to start with something called self sovereignty which is basically I get to be the master of what I share and what I don't share so when I start building these skill trees I need to be able to say who can see what so you need to have control over these systems what you also need to be able to do is to revoke certain things so binance actually you know they do a kyc and this year they started issuing a token for this kyc that you can claim and then prove on other platforms that you've done the binance kyc but this is revocable so you can actually go back to binance and this token that you have in your wallet you can revoke and say actually I don't want to have it there anymore right so in case binance is I don't know suddenly turns out to be super evil or whatever and you don't want to be associated with it you can revoke it and then there's also consent so I don't want to be airdropped soul-bound stuff that's on my wallet forever please ask me first right I need to be able to claim these things there needs to be a mechanism of consent especially you know when you start talking about things that might be on chain forever and finally Rehabilitation just like in real Society if I break the rules I go to prison and in theory that's to be rehabilitated so that I can become a normal member of society again I don't want reputation that I collect in these skill trees and this in the social composable system to basically track me and I can never do anything about it again another thing that we have to talk about is civil resistance so civil resistance is basically the act of being resistant to civil attacks which is when people use pseudonyms to subvert a system and if you've ever asked your cousin to leave you a five-star review on your Google Business you've in some way committed an act of civil attack or if I post something on Twitter and then I quickly change account and upvote my own thing and I support myself then you are committing a civil attack so what do we do about that right we can do things like reverse Turing tests which is humans having to prove that they are humans but we are some kind of test you know the picking little uh Street lamps or whatever but then there's also things like dids so there's loads of projects starting up now talking about decentralized identities uh this is basically conducting a kyc and it's often like holding up a passport on a camera but there's also privacy preserving dids which is basically it can scan your face and say you are a unique human being but we don't want to know your name or Identity or anything else so this is also really interesting and finally passports so you've probably heard of the git coin passport and I think disco XYZ is also considered that what they do is they basically put verified credentials and dids into one cool little identity so when you connect to a platform you can say I just want to share this part of my passport to get access to the platform and it basically confirms that I'm a human being and I have the credentials that I need to access I think these are going to become very very common but verify credentials are only as good as a system that issues them so it doesn't matter if I make a decentralized application and issue myself a badge that says best designer in the world like it's irrelevant because it has no value it has no reputation the system that issued it so you actually need to think about who is issuing these things you need to actually have a reputable issuer issuing reputable credentials so that the user can themselves become reputable so it's really reputation all the way down so you're going to see a lot of projects in the next few years issuing all of these Badges and all of these verified credentials but you always have to think in the back of your mind who are they to be issuing these things do they have robust mechanisms in place and do they have a nuanced view of the world so that these issues are these credentials actually are fair and good for society and not just you know the next thing so how does all of this change anything at Common Ground we are building basically something which is decentralized collaboration coupled with verifiable credentials so we want to be the intersection of this we're building like this communication platform and as I mentioned at the beginning interactions are where things happen so what happens when you start using these verifiable credentials and start planning online spaces with them this is where I think it gets very interesting because probably most of you use Discord so Discord is a cognitive overload catastrophe you join three communities and suddenly you're spammed with 7 000 notifications and then you're like I'm going to mute all of them and that's it right it's it's kind of pointless so what happens if you actually start building areas which are more Dynamic using verifiable credentials so let's say that you have an online space where you have access to the areas that are destined for you based on the credentials that you have so imagine you're a Dao and you can basically make a space for each of your working groups that people can only get into if they have the right verifiable credentials and this can be an automatic process so if I build up my reputation because I provide my services as a designer and then one day I'm designer level three I automatically unlock access to the right space and everything else that I don't have access to is fuzzy and in the background it doesn't cognitively overload me I think this is the way that the internet is going to be shaped in the future which I think will make everything a little bit more focusing what it also allows is more trustworthy interactions so with this did credential for example we can say only verified humans can talk in this chat for example Twitter could tomorrow Implement dids and the bot problem would to 99 be solved it's just they're not web 3 they don't care right they're not going to do it but they could the technology exists and there are applications right now saying only verified humans can use the app so it basically means you're locked out of participation until you verify your humanity and you can do this in a privacy preserving way what it also allows is for more concrete information maybe you shouldn't have access and a view of everything and here is an example of for example a governance vote that is restricted so for example if somebody asks should Defcon give more swag maybe only people who have attended Defcon and have the verifiable credential that they did attend can vote in this thing because they are the only ones who know how much swag was given so you don't suddenly allow everybody in the world with their token to participate only the ones who are relevant for the vote and what is what this is going to do is also streamline entire Industries and this is a big statement but I I fully believe it um in fact you could imagine that if common ground which is my Dao would choose to hire a senior designer for example I could set the verifiable credentials that we required the applicant to have I could say it needs to be a designer level three it needs to have a tested Badge of being a good communicator and this person needs to have verified their Humanity for example on the flip side if I Dominic um a designer looking for work it would be as easy as enabling a toggle that says I'm available for jobs and then another toggle Auto submit my verifiable credentials to matching dials anonymously you can imagine how suddenly the recruitment industry might get a little bit worried if this would be the simple this is how simple the process could be you wouldn't need in like in LinkedIn yeah the interviews and the CV and the whatever these credentials if the system issuing them is is trustworthy and reputable then you can just set the verify verifiable credential that you need and suddenly people are matched right this thing can happen instantly and imagine multiplied by all dowels and the entire Workforce suddenly everybody gets matched in a system that is really robust oh there we go summary okay so just getting to the end now your online Persona is about to get much richer and stickier with verifiable credentials this is going to happen you're already using them your your driver's license is a credential your passport is a credential your University degree is a credential this is now going to be translated into web 3 and internalized on the blockchain so it's coming whether you agree with it or not it is going to come and I think as we as designers should be very mindful of Designing these systems in a way that makes Society better and not worse right you also need the quality and social responsibility behind credentials um that they really really matter right so it really is all about reputable systems issuing reputable credentials that are well researched so it actually causes public good and not more trouble and finally we're looking at fundamental changes in Collective agency so if we pull this off in a meaningful way and this is going to be the challenge then web 2 organizations will not be able to compete with the Synergy and the doubt collaboration that will be afforded by this change right because they will have to transition quickly because of the fundamental changes that is going to be enabled by this in terms of collective agency so I think that we are really talking about changes to the fabric of our society and you know this may be it sounds like hyperbole but you know if you look at the world how it is right now I I think we have to do better and I think this could be one thing that takes us there so thank you very very much for listening follow me on Twitter to grow my social capital questions in terms of skills I would say no there is no um issue of skills that is yet at the degree of nuance and sophistication that there needs to be if you start talking about issue of like decentralized identities as credentials yeah there's already loads I mean there's like bright ID there's fractal there's lots of these projects that are trying to issue these credentials in the most privacy preserving way whether or not those systems are perfect I don't know I don't think so I think there's somebody from World coin or whatever said he had two identities so probably in some way it's gameable but I think the systems of reputation that grow on top of those basic decentralized identities then will eventually build a better web of trust so I would say to answer your question no there is no reputable systems yet this is super early hello um I love the concept but I was wondering what happens with sensitive information with sensitive information yes because let's say we have a Dao and we say that only people with verify credentials can access some information but it doesn't prevent that I take a snapshot a sorry a screenshot and share it with people who don't have the credentials so how do we prevent that attack yeah I mean there's lots of uh security mechanisms to be able to prevent this I mean what we're talking about here it's this kind of skill system that gets you the entry right but this is built together with an overall reputation system so you could also say that it's a combination of trustworthiness via a matrix of skills and the participation in the platform that you can say only a person with a minimum trust can come in if I break that trust then maybe I'm slashed socially or in terms of tokens or in some way maybe there's even like a staking mechanism that if you enter you need to stake your reputation and if you misbehave and share screenshots you are slashed in some way so there are mechanisms that are very very interesting to be able to address these problems so native Dao Workforce is a tiny tiny fraction of the entire Workforce yeah industry tiny so how would you see like the initial data dump right like the the the bridge between the the old ways of doing reputation I don't know uh degrees or work experience into these kind of things so I think there's lots of ways to build a skill system like the one that um that I was talking about here for example you could even start with self-assessment so when you join the platform you give an estimation of your skills and abilities you rate yourself in this kind of nuanced contextual system and then maybe others who know you have worked with you can verify you over time so it you don't necessarily have to start a skill system at zero you can self-assess and then stake certain things and if you then live up to that self-assessment then you can participate effectively in the system if you don't live up to that self-assessment then you are slashed in some way so I think we need to of course be realistic and you know we can't expect everybody to start at zero especially what happens if you got an established skill system and then you know everybody has been there for five years and you get a new user who's has nothing that what is it gonna they can't compete right so there needs to be a system of self-assessment and say or or somebody vouchers for you somebody Stakes their reputation and says this person has the skills they say they have and if they don't then they're both slashed so there are mechanisms to get a head start in the skill system so that you don't get left behind you know if that answers your question ideal thank you great talk so I'm just curious about your thoughts on China's reputational system because they gamified the way they want their population to behave yeah and that might necess not necessarily be for better yeah but so you're talking about this as a social credit score yeah right so I think the social credit score in China is a little bit different because um it's tied to you as a person and there is nothing you can do about it because you will only ever be you in web 3 in theory you know I could create a new wallet and generate a new identity and start from scratch so there is ways for you to reinvent yourself in web 3 without having to you know create a whole new identity so it's not I would say the same as the social credit score because that one you can never get rid of the government has labeled you with it and there's nothing you can do with these kinds of systems you can create a new wallet and you're a new person okay and follow up and how do you how can we give opportunities to those that haven't proved the reputation because those are going to favor those who have been proven more yeah so I think this goes a little bit back to the the previous answer as well so be able to say that they are skilled in a certain thing and maybe they can then be a probational period for example if I say I'm a master designer and I join a Dao and you know they don't know it's just self-assessed that I'm so good at design then for example if I start working with them maybe the money that I earn is in an escrow account so like a third party during this probational period for example and if I confirm to the Dao if they say actually this person has been doing a good job then the money is paid out or if I don't live up to those expectations then maybe that is slashed is that in the right direction how do we discover this the skill or I am not sure I understand maybe we can talk later sorry uh because I think this is a discussion a large discussion and anyone has any okay and just the the last one so as you said you're basically reinvating Reinventing the wheel uh the qualification and credential system already exists yes non-digital world I think the biggest problem with scaling it to the larger size is how you rate the issuers so how you actually make sure that the people that give credentials are the reputable entities yeah I think this is going to happen organically I think there's going to be a lot of projects issuing a lot of credentials in the next few years and I think it's going to happen organically based on how people interact with these credentials so is there a threshold is the system robustly designed is the system transparent so people can understand how things are weighted and how you collect these Badges and these skill systems I think there's going to be an avalanche really of these skills systems and badge issuers and whatever and it's going to take time for that kind of to stabilize and people actually starting to realize which ones do we take seriously and which not so I don't think it's as easy as you know somebody uh vetting you know a issuance system and saying this one's really good I think it's going to happen more organically but this is just my opinion okay that's it so okay yeah we are we don't have thank you very much everyone yeah [Applause]
