hello everyone and thanks for joining the ethereum.org November Community call so it's already November and Q4 the last quarter of the year today we want to share some of the things that we've worked on last quarter and what our Focus will be until the end of the year as always a quick note that this is the ethereum.org community call discussing the website and the ethereum.org roadmap not the ethereum foundation or the ethereum protocol with that out of the way let's take a quick look through the agenda for today first off um jakub is going to demo the learning quizzes that we've recently launched next up Joseph will share how we prepared the website in anticipation for the merge after that I'm going to give an overview of the recently revamped EF blog Pablo will talk about our migration to a new UI Library Nuno is going to share some updates on the design system Paul will talk about the kcg ceremony and what we're helping out with there and finally Joshua will discuss one of our Q4 epics creating real world case studies after that some miscellaneous announcements and updates as always and some questions that we've been asking you to ask in slido uh if you haven't yet sharing this in the chat right now feel free to add your questions there is still some time and unless there's anything else from anyone I guess let's just get into it and start with the Jacob talking about learning quizzes take us away Jacob thank you Luca perfect I hope you can hear me all right so in the chat I am sharing links to pages where we have a published our learning quizzes and let me show you as well so we have shipped recently this new feature quizzes on Selected Few pages but our goal really is to have this globally on our website once the content is ready and for that you can help us with that Let's uh to present what we have right now so at the end of few pages that I sent in the chat you can see that at the end of the article we have now these uh this is which basically will verify your knowledge of the page or article that you just read so this will be always context show to um what is on the page and it's a fun way to practice your knowledge uh one good thing is that whatever choice you make we will have most of the time also a custom explanation so this way we will try to help you understand why perhaps the thing you chose was incorrect and this way you can just test your knowledge on a few pages and see if you can get all the questions correctly at the end you can also share the results on Twitter to promote these quizzes if you want so we have uh published I believe seven different pages for uh with a quiz and in Discord Channel you will find that there is a quiz Channel where you can give us any feedback on whether you think this these quiz questions were too easy too difficult or whether you think there could be some improvements um you have started with these seven pages later to nfts what is it what is it and so there but uh if you wish to contribute you could help us with creating content for these quizzes on other Pages uh again bring us in the quizzes channel on Discord or you can race a PR with just the questions and explanations and we'll take it from there and that's basically the quizzes awesome thanks Jacob yeah we're all excited about shipping the quizzes received some really nice feedback so far both on what people like and how they could potentially be improved um next up Joseph and how we've prepared ethereum.org for a successful merge hey thanks Luca yeah um incredible that the merger is less than two months ago a lot happened since then um so in advance of the merge we had a set of objectives to go through the site and just make sure all the content was accurate and that we had sufficient material available that people were well prepared and ready for the actual event to happen um but we also had to be ready because the second the merge happened a lot of information on ethereum.org would immediately go out of date uh any information on preparing for the merge would be kind of nonsensical and information on how the network comes to consensus would be wrong any Pages referring to the merge in the future tense or explicitly mentioning the upcoming merge all of that kind of stuff would all just suddenly be inappropriate the second the merge happens so we had to have some kind of system where as soon as the merge happened we could just press a button and update the site to some pre-prepared post merge state and the way that we did that was to have a branch of our GitHub repository where we developed a post-merge version of the website in the weeks leading up to the merge and pretending on that Branch like the mergers already happened successfully and auditing and updating the site for for that hypothetical and uh we started with a initial site audit and that generated a tick list of 59 pages that needed to be updated at the moment at the merge some of those are relatively small changes by swapping temperatures and things but some were complete rewrites and restructures especially in the developer Docs so I've just put in the chat the link to the issue if anyone wants to actually see what those 59 Pages were um it was actually amazing How Deeply the merge touched every part of ethereum the switch from proof of work mining to proof of state-based consensus changed everything um changed the basic architecture of the nodes and the networking layer um in the sense that the existing peer-to-peer Network would exchange different information post merge compared to pre-merge and a whole new P2P Network would be introduced to exchange information that the consensus layer and all documentation around the nodes and the clients and the networks had to be updated even the blocks changed their structure and their content at the merge and the documents documentation around all that too um but then some of the okay uh some of the kind of less obvious updates included about block explorers um they showed different information after the merge compared to before some of the tutorials were broken by the merge if they included proof of work test nets for example or some proof of work specific features um I think overall the most satisfying page to update by far with the energy consumption page it was really cool to be able to just click button and watch the website leave behind the old kind of one day we won't burn so much energy rhetoric and actually implement we are a low carbon blockchain and you know since then a third party has estimated the carbon consumption of the entire network to be 0.02 terawatts a year which is lower than even we predicted in advance which was just a massive win uh it was also kind of cool to incorporate A celebratory front page design on merge day we had this merge Panda rising up out of the fountain in the decentralized Commons image on the home page uh just as a kind of small way to let the community know that it was a time to celebrate and that it was a big achievement and we should all be proud of what we did I posted a picture in the chat of what that looked like um so we had that update and then since then we've been looking through for gaps uh before the merge and at the merge it was all about correcting the existing material um since the merge it's about what new material do we now need to make sure that we properly explain the new proof of State Network for beginners and also for people that really want to know the details of how the protocol works um that's all I got to say thanks back to you Luca yeah thanks um this was definitely an initiative that a lot of the team were involved in but especially um Joseph and Paul with all of their audits and updates that the brunt of the work so nice work on that um next up I wanna talk about the EF blog that we have recently rebuilt um so yeah our team has recently worked on rebuilding the EF blog using a more modern stack to add some functionality the main change on the blog so far is added internationalization support So visitors can now change the language of the UI and read some of the posts in other languages um this effort mostly included design work by our designers Nuno and Jacob to look similar to the previous version of the blog and Dev work by Nico and Paul to rebuild the blog while maintaining feature parity we've also translated some of the key blog posts that have been published this year especially the ones related to the merge given that that is when the blog went live if you want to learn more about the specific improvements and future plans for the blog we also published a blog post about this a couple of months ago which goes into some more detail let me share this in the chat real quick as well here you go uh yeah so currently the blog is available in 15 languages and selecting any of them will change the blog's primary language and only show the posts that are available in that language as you can see there's also convenient ways to switch back to English or check out the other blog posts um all the or as well as change the language for individual blog posts uh we hope that by continuing to localize this content it becomes more accessible and reaches more people across the world regardless of the languages they speak uh and I know a lot of you are already aware of this but contributors to the translation program can also get involved with this and translate some of the latest blog posts more information about joining the project and contributing to the blog translations can be found on the website just share the link in the chat as well um that should be it on the blog just wanted to give a brief summary but feel free to check out the blog post that goes into more detail on this or feel free to reach out if there's any questions or thoughts and moving on to something that ties in very well with this is we wanted to share something else that we've recently added specifically this chart of non-english page views this is a chart showing total page views on ethereum.org over time non-english page views and the ratio between them the main reason why we added this to the website was to show the translators how much of an impact their contributions have and how they're helping this content reach more people and it is definitely true we can see two clear spikes on this chart of non-english page views on the website the first one is when we first started translating um when we first added translated content to ethereum.org that is this first spike in 2019 and the second one is when the amount of content we were translating and the amount of translated content we were adding to the website signifi significantly increased last summer and since then the ratio of non-english page views has gone up for the last 12 months straight and currently over one quarter of all visits to the website are now in languages other than English this is in large part due to our amazing community of contributors translating all of this content so a big thank you to all of them obviously and the reason this ties in well with the blog rebuild is that it clearly shows how much interest there is for multilingual ethereum content and that the more resources uh that are available in other languages the more people can actually read and learn about ethereum and follow along that would be all from me but as always if anyone wants to get involved feel free to reach out to us either here on the um yeah that would be it and next up we've got Pablo who is going to be talking about our migration to a new UI Library okay can you hear me hello thank you Luca and let me share the screen so yeah basically I want to give you a quick update on one of our technical epics which is the migration of and use a UI library in all of our UI components so um a brief summary of goals of this epic is basically we want to create this base layer where we can build a unscale better in the future and so uh this will serve us one thing uh to improve uh to to improve on our upcoming goals that we have for next year next year we will want to to implement the our design system which is something that our designers are working on on Shake Up are leading that that effort and so this chakra migration uh is going to basically set the grounds to build on that on top of this um so jumping into this epic specifically you can see here all the contributors that we have so far and I want to thank you all you guys for the contributions uh you have been doing an amazing job and thank you also for the patience and on the core review from our side and so um the current status of this epic is that we are dividing the the work on in two waves we are migrating all of our U UI components to chakra So currently we are doing the first wave with cons that consists of around 60 components you can see the whole list here and you can see that most of them are already my have already been migrating and we are almost finished with this first migration and so I wanted to make a smaller announcement for next week we are planning to to open the second wave which will consist on the remaining around 60 more components to migrate and we hope to finish that in this quarter so that is going to be uh a lot of work but I I think we can we can do it um that is basically all I want to say and just stay tuned on our Discord channels we have a dedicated channel for the UI migration and I also next week when I open I I will create a new issue I think because this is kind of a mess this issue has already a hundred comments I will open a new a new issue and and put the new list there and I will announce that on on the Discord channels and in this GitHub issue so stay tuned and if you want to get involved in this of course you can jump into this this issue I will share it in chat and you can read the how to contribute section or you can just ping me on Discord or here leave a comment in this issue and and I and I will help you so that's all thank you guys [Music] great thank you Pablo for sharing that and leading this epic and also thank you to anyone who has gotten involved and helped with the migration um it's definitely been a bunch of work but making some really nice progress so that's exciting um yeah let's move on to Nuno who is going to give us an update on the design system hello how are you can you hear me okay so yeah so on this is a perfect segue after Pablo because he's doing the groundwork to implement the design system so I will try to do a small overview of what would have been done and what's next to come but the overall goal is to build on top of chakra UI new components and new design approach to some of the components improving the experience The Styling of the websites make everything more concise more close to what we want to be an experience so a small gldr of the design system it creates a framework for open design to open to all of you to contribute better to get more contributions from the from the community to the design to the contents to the development so everything we believe that this is uh one big Improvement to do uh in the project and um having this in mind uh we have been working on Design Systems since uh Quarter Two this year we have been following a lot of different steps to have everything ready to start coding beginning next year so once the UI Library Epic we'll have all the components already on chakra we can start to implement new styling the new changes uh that we are currently working on on the design system and have everything ready to be uh faced and implemented throughout the next year so this is roughly what we have been accomplished on this quarter we are trying we are working on on more content-wise like the markdown Pages what can we improve on the market Pages we have already have the basic layouts and the and the basic components like we've changed the fonts we've improved the color system we've moved the spacing in a lot of different design components will be worked on and based on this design system so I will just go over really really quickly in some of the data to so for you you guys have an idea of what we are what does a design system looks like and what what is the the outcome of design system by itself so here here it's the drill down of the navigation from the figma file which is based on Foundation space components compose components in the layouts we have been working top down on all of those and this is just screenshots from from the design system itself just for you guys to have an idea like this is the new um typography typefaces and font sizes that we will implement this is the colors uh we have updates the colors a little bit from what we have right now and have everything ready with rules how to use them where to use them um the old illustrations will be kept on the website that's another epic we will try to improve those and have new illustrations on our website next year so something to stay tuned to and this is the example of how the buttons look on the design system so we have all the states we have all the buttons close to one big one base component we're now at ethereum.org there's a lot of different sizes of buttons uh we want to make that a small size or aggro size so we need to make that more consist throughout the the website that's one of the goals this is an example of how the heroes look like the different Heroes on the monitorium on the design system that will be implemented next year the layouts and mostly this is a working progress for the beginning next year for sure we will need your help uh and track one board as my designers as we can uh to the process and help bring all the components that exist on the website and it is on on chakra right now to the design system improve them and then have them code it uh after that uh the last thing that I wanted to bring uh just we have the design system published on the figma community if you want to just say uh like or just download and share it but I want to talk more about the design system so I will schedule another call just on the design system itself for the 24th of November in a couple weeks because there's a lot of things that I wanted to talk about and collect your feedback and I think your call should help a lot um and that being said it's everything I have for you guys now I will post the link for the the for the file itself uh on the comment if you want to just follow and just make some comments whatever you think suggestions Nicole thank you so much for your attention Luca yeah thanks Nuno um as Nuno mentioned if you're a designer or interested in contributing feel free to hit us up in The Design Channel or reach out to Nuno or jakub and definitely do check out that design system Community call moving on we have Paul who will be talking about a new commitment for our team um how what we'll be working on um how will we be helping out the kcg ceremony Paul yes thanks Luca how's everyone doing um so this is a little bit of a different role for some of the folks on our team um one of the other things we do Beyond just the ethereum.org website we do help out with a lot of the other sub domains to ethereum.org as well as just other products amongst the ethereum foundation and in this space this is one of those examples where some folks have been working on the kcg commitment ceremony and what that is we'll get into but we've been trying to help out a little bit with with some of their needs to try to get this rolled out within the next month or so basically and what this is is the next phase of the ethereum roadmap and the upgrade plans uh some people have probably heard of eip4844 or Proto dank sharding which is the next planned upgrade as far as scalability is concerned which is designed to help Roll-Ups have more affordable ways to store the data that they use in a way that can be scaled part of this involves basically the generation of a secret a shared secret amongst the entire Community something that can be used to generate fraud proofs to make these things function appropriately and Josh just dropped a excellent link to learn more about this eip4844.com um I would encourage people who are curious to learn more about it to check that out we've been working on a page which was actually originally demoed at uh Devcon in Bogota last month and I'm not sure if you can see my screen but this is the website here ceremony.etherium.org this is the task website at the time uh you're free to check this out if you want but we've been working with them to try to help improve this for things like like accessibility making sure that it's accessible even on mobile to be determined if we'll be able to actually run the ceremony on mobile and actually participate through mobile but we do want to at least have the information available for folks if they come to the site we've tried to make it more responsively working with them to help with the translations as well you'll notice here there is a changer to switch the language to Spanish we plan on getting all this text translated into more languages and this is going to be rolled out like I said within the next month or so it's going to be open up and the goal with this is to be completely public uh something that anyone can participate in so we're doing our best to try to make this simplified easy to walk through you know we're trying to clear any bugs that we encounter uh so more and more people can participate in this and what this is is basically this big shared secret that's going to help uh enable things like fraud proofs to be generated and it's set up in a way where anyone can participate and it will automatically destroy like your portion of the randomness that's contributed to this big shared secret and really if any one person actually just does not hold on to their secret portion then the whole thing will be a success basically the way the way this works is in a way where as long as one person is honest and destroys their portion of What's called the entropy the randomness that's contributed to this thing then it cannot be reproduced by somebody on the side and what that would lead to is somebody basically able to defraud these proofs and to prove anything that they wanted and the whole goal of this is to make that so it's absolutely impossible and I think we're on a very good track here and I'm looking forward to the rest of this getting rolled out this is less something that's been super open to the community but it is something our team's been contributing to and we just wanted to let you know about it thank you Paul more exciting upgrades coming up in the pipeline always nice to hear and finally for what will be the last presentation from our team Joshua will discuss our Q4 Epic on creating real world case studies Joshua please everyone and just before I do that we have created a poet for this column so surprise I guess uh if you're interested in poor I am sharing my screen just now [Music] um we are like we've got a good bit of time left so I'll leave this for maybe a minute or two and then I can get to Chang to everyone about real world case studies which I'm very excited to do so [Music] thank you uh just a note that that's QR code um it does refresh every couple of pull-ups are issued so some people reported that they'll scan it and it won't work and if that happens just do it again and it should work the second thing I'll also just add please scan the code right now if you can but as Josh gets into his part um after he's done we're gonna be showing the QR code again in case some of you can't claim it right now or just aren't fast enough back to you Josh yeah I'm too busy getting my pull up so yeah I don't actually have anything visual to show for this so I'll leave the QR code open as I ramble on a little bit about our case studies and hopefully I'll I'll do my best to try and explain why we think it's important so real world case studies what does that even mean I think the maybe the best way to explain case studies is first to take a little step back and Q2 yakubu earlier on in this called game order learning quizzes write an epic focused on how we could get better user feedback after executing on that epic we got a ton of feedback and from that feedback we seen two main overaction themes uh one of which was that many of the users on ethereum that are wanted more instructional based content like non-technical tutorials and step-by-step guides on how to navigate different tools concept software all within the feeding ecosystem and from that we prioritize the tutorials revamp that we are working on in Q4 and we're not going to be covering that on this call but I'll shell our Q4 roadmap both post if you'd like to learn more and if someone could post on the channel I'll be great um the second major theme that emerged from the user feedback was that users particularly ones near to this base they're definitely not limited to just them they were struggling to understand what the real world benefits of the use cases of ethereum wear so they understood that they could join or create a doubt but without any experience in those they didn't really see how this sort of structure could lend itself to something novel or innovative or they understood that they could use stable coins and non-custodial wallets instead of traditional Banks and but being from a relatively wealthy developed country they didn't really see the point in that the the truth of it is is that like the blocked in Industry as a whole hasn't done a fantastic job at communicating these ideas or these benefits there it is a lot of prerequisite knowledge that we assume that people need to really get by blockchain as important uh and then we're baffled when the people we talk to don't really understand why we think it is so important is because in the first place we're not really communicating the ideas of having the values so obviously if you're on this call you're probably already one of the converted uh but I don't think we should assume that the people we speak with have the same understanding the same knowledge or even the same worldview as people in this industry do so instead and the ideas that can I form this epic is that we want to be able to communicate these ideas better and a clear non-biased way with non-biased language and language that actually resonates with people so it was this line of thinking that led the athenian.org team to prioritize an epic around creating real world case studies and the final solution that we've came up with at least for Q4 to begin with is is quite simple so unless I think we will pack a particular aphidium use case we'll research where that particular use case has been used to solve real world problems and from that we'll identify the most impactful instances of problems being solved and then we'll rate case studies providing all the context of the problem itself and how aphidium was used to help solve that so that's quite abstract but they have a very concrete example an ethereum use case might be use of stable coins and our research mainly does to how stable coins are used to fight hyperinflation in developing countries from that um an impactful case might be like argentinians using stable coins to save money instead of it disappearing to the Argentinian Pesos 50 odd percent inflation rate and writing that case study would probably involve setting the context on how Argentina's government implemented a ban on buying U.S dollars leading people to using two currencies as a way to sidestep that band um yeah so that's pretty much at so far I'm really excited about this epic uh selfishly I think it'll help me communicate to like non-cryptopyle people friends family as to why this stuff actually matters and I guess we're hoping that it will do the same for crypto Skeptics crypto novices and even people who have maybe been in this space a while but have lost sight of the forest for the trees so that's pretty much all I've got um if you've got thoughts we've created a case studies Channel and discards that you can check out and ask questions or if you feel more comfortable doing so you can ping me directly I'm always happy to chat on this sort of stuff with that I'll hand it back over to look at to close this out and thanks very much for listening thank you Joshua yeah so moving on to the final final part really which is some miscellaneous announcements and call outs um one that was already mentioned specifically Nuno organizing a design design system Community call on exactly in exactly two weeks from today uh stay tuned for that there's going to be an event that you're going to be able to share your interest in and get pinked before it starts on our Discord so if you're interested in that please do check it out another one is office hours so a while ago we did a couple of office hours sessions on miscellaneous topics that were either very much relevant at the time or things we were getting a lot of questions about and just wanted to clarify further and help out that way so Paul is planning on holding another office hours most likely next Friday um similar to the design there's going to be an event created in our Discord there's going to be a topic and an exact time so stay tuned for that as well and finally feel free to check out the learning quizzes uh Jacob and Josh have both shared links to the pages that entering quizzes at this moment so please do check them out and let us know what you think let us know what you like let us know how we can improve them I guess feedback is always appreciated so don't hesitate to reach out and share it with us and moving on to the last part which is questions from the community um we've been sharing this slido around for a while asking for questions that people would like answered yeah Paul just shared a link to the slido in the chat I'm also sharing my screen just in case but yeah let's we have some time let's work through some of these [Music] and the first one is sorry go ahead you know up here too yeah exactly I'll be like calling out um whenever someone is better equipped to answer a question than I am which the first one is the quiz was real fun adding more soon so Josh yeah I can take this one but Jacob feel free to win if I miss anything so that is the plan um I guess we wanted to start off originally with eight pages because we wanted to firstly see how much impact I had um where people using the quizzes was the design we originally came up with the best solution for this um and we haven't done like a deep dive or a deep retrospective into it yet but our suspicion at this point is yes that people are finding these useful and impactful um So the plan is probably to revisit this early next year um with the goal of potentially having an entire Hub that's dedicated to all of the quizzes on our site currently you have to go to an individual page take the quiz and then that's just the end of that experience so the idea is to consolidate all of that around one page where all of the quizzes throughout the site can also live in this one Hub page so if you just want to go on and just test your knowledge on one place you can do that and along with that we also hope to open this more up to the community um it's very straightforward to write a lot of these questions so we hope that we can get Community Support around us and get people to actually write answers and explanations for us to help us grow this a lot more quickly and make more of an impact with it yeah Jacob anything you'd like to add to that as well I think just covered it cool so yeah the tldr likely yes second question is is there anyone at eath working closely with the leg Regulators to work out the vital policies and controls again this is the ethereum.org community call so focused on ethereum.org the website um my two cents on this would be ethereum is a permissionless technology that anyone can contribute to build on or use there are hundreds of organizations initiatives companies in the ethereum ecosystem some of them are definitely working on advocacy efforts like coin Center and the blockchain association and similar ones so the answer is probably yes I don't know if anyone else wants to add anything there foreign I think you covered it pretty well I do think you know an important note there to reiterate is working or anyone at eth working closely with The Regulators so at eath I mean ethereum is a network it's permissionless it's public it's open there's also then the ethereum foundation um I'm sure there are some folks there but honestly don't quote me on that because I'm not sure and there's where a subset of the ethereum foundation funded by them to work on this site specifically just to try to help clarify some of that so on our team no unfortunately we don't have anyone uh Lobby in Congress [Music] yeah exactly um any other input I think we can we're good to move on um has the bear Market had any effect on your community that's a good question yeah uh again I'm gonna like I think probably yes though the community is very much still active and vibrant um people contributing to ethereum.org are likely more focused on getting involved than making an impact versus short-term price speculation if you're just speculating on a price you don't need to contribute your time and effort um so those who got involved for those reasons are definitely still here sure if anyone has any uh anything else to add yeah I think the community has been pretty strong lately to be honest despite the bear Market I agree that you know there's a lot of people who are who are going to be around during price pumps and bullishness and they're going to get excited but this is not the first time this has happened prices drop people who were there for that specific reason start to lose interest but the folks that are here to build and contribute I haven't seen much of a drop off I think we've been doing great yeah I think sorry go ahead now we should just point that out that we we do see on visits some impact yeah um I took this question from the perspective of like our community as in the people who helped contribute to aphidium.org in any way um and and yeah like when the Market's down I don't have exact numbers I apologize but um I would also say like our contributions have steadily still gone up over the course of the last year which you could I guess is the bear market so um there's some ways that we've grown as a community in some ways that we've shrunk but I think it's in a positive way we have farthest people just coming into the Discord with price speculation and more about contributing to this project or wanting to learn about ethereum so I think like in ways it's been a positive effect on the community yeah like translation program differences but um as far as like GitHub contributions that's something I can speak to yeah there's different ways to measure the community to talk about the effect on our community one is visits to the website you know engagement and Discord Etc uh contributions to the repo we may you know I think personally it seems to have reduced a lot of the noise which is why I've kind of been enjoying it lately to be honest yeah I'll just add one more thing um like just looking at the people who are involved in our Discord who are involved in translations and on our GitHub we're finding that it's consolidating a lot more than like a core group of people who've been around for a while so even looking at the people that are in this call today uh like I recognize quite a lot of people here I've spoke to a lot of people here I've met a lot of people who are on this call um so it shows that like the people who really care about ethereum and want to be involved are still here and that's the important thing so I appreciate everyone taking the time out of their day to join this call and see what we're up to yeah some good answers there next question is anything I can help with mainly do front end um yes for sure there's a lot of ways to get involved and contribute I just share the link to the um how can I contribute Channel on our Discord which covers a lot of different ways to get involved and to contribute covers the relevant channels where we discuss contributions um so yeah always looking for new contributors and people to to add something like um we found that that there's very little limits to how people can add value and help us improve the website or whatever their ultimate goal is so I would say yes always Keen for new contributors and more people getting involved with the community yeah x-ray thank you for asking that um I mean for what it's worth I started in the same boat I was looking around doing front end trying to figure out how to get involved and I landed on this repo a little over two years ago now and started contributing posted the link just to our issues board a lot of ways to get involved um what I did back then was I checked out the issues board I found something that I felt like I could work on and just started tackling it anyone's free to post on those issues and requests to be assigned to help keep things organized so yeah definitely reach out if you have any more questions about it yeah for sure we're always happy when people reach out and are excited about getting involved and contributing and anyway I think we have time for maybe one last question which um Can the community do something about this useless scam project called Zen crypto if has been unusable for most folks since that scam was launched so I I would say these last couple of days a lot has been going on in crypto and has led to a lot of Unchained activity a lot of people are probably withdrawing from exchanges or sending assets to exchanges closing or rebalancing their positions swapping tokens whatever and with an increase in activity gas prices go up which is exactly how it's supposed to work um ethereum is scaling using Roll-Ups where gas fees are low and will continue to get lower as the technology progresses and more people use them and while layer twos are still in the early stages and still developing and have some trust assumptions associated with them at the moment most of them already have vibrant ecosystems of dapps and things to do so if gas prices on the ethereum layer 1 are pricing you out of using it um I would say be part of the solution and start using in layer twos does anyone have any other input on this one yeah the only thing I'll add is can is there anything we can do about it in short no I mean this is a public open permissionless platform anyone can release tokens and do what they want with it there's a fee mechanism in place to make it more expensive when there's insane demand and it drops back when there's less demand a lot of those fees get burned so the sales you can take in this is that when gas prices go high well we're also burning eth at least so it kind of gives back a little bit to everyone who holds eth at least and participates in the network so yeah we can't get rid of it but just takes us and then we've burned a ton of gas lately for what it's worth and moving to l2s I agree Luca is definitely a way to to start to avoid this stuff and real quick it does get into a question I saw lower of when sharding soon TM that is the thing I mentioned earlier Proto dank sharding is the first roll out of that we're hopefully expecting that q1 Q2 next year the website I mentioned will be up sooner than that to start participating in that ceremony but sharding is coming the initial phases of that I would you know Loosely expect in the first half of next year um to say with that one I was listening to the all core devs call for Shanghai and depends if they want to do withdrawals and eip4844 in the same release which would maybe be like midpoint next year or if they want to do withdrawals first and then eip4844 which would put it in the back half um just depends on what for sure yeah it's not finalized yet so don't don't like quote me on it necessarily but it is being worked on the ceremony is going to be one of the first steps so that is definitely in the works and will continue to make l2s even cheaper um and another one I see on here FTX situation I would strongly suggest checking out the bankless podcast and if anyone else sends us any references they could Point people to could drop them in the chat and yes there will be more poapps in 2023. yeah that's one good question um that we've probably answered but maybe through this one minnow's way of our Jacob um I'm a student designer how can I help with the design system I I would say just stay tuned to The Design Channel uh and be on board on the next call on the 24th we will cover that a little bit more we still we still haven't figured out the best way to to collaborate on the design system to design the components itself one figma figma it's open but it's not that open as it GitHub we still need to figure out so I think it's a good a good way to discuss that on a call so everyone that wants to help on the design side please check uh the community call on the 24th awesome I guess we are at time um I think we covered a bunch um maybe there's any closing thoughts from the team I I would just like to say thank you for joining the call thank you for being part of the ethereum.org community and contributing to the website and see you soon at the next one thanks everyone have a good day thanks everyone
