[Applause] it's performers and today we have to talk about how we can use our work would be the option of is practically like anything so first cuz both at that would give gives to the review of the evolution of competition our opportunity today evoke we we had which be computer takes after we are starting to put the body we managed to have small devices start to appear in offices in our hands so we stopped using 4matic application revolving game things everything we started using another kind of vacations devices become even smaller to finally achieve that a situation in which we need artists attribution clouds the thing is it's a work on advanced it takes a lot of benefits to us like for some we can avoid these kind of kind accidents because we're now all the data distribute it around a problem or one of us know all the benefits of the cloud for example we can make easy escalade our application or they defecation history portals the condition of having leading to the world not from our device making possible to reach to unionize understand but the truth the god is that think about their service computer it can be even worse there is no colleges are available so in cooperation this is very important for for people like us the robbers since we are the okay even tries the noise if we usually didn't write apologies in a set rice matter we are using positively that we are in forgetting that so we we lost privacy and anonymity we rely on three packets these defeat the purpose of of these technologies so we should attack worry about that so we believe that we need reason of some of the camera here we to recover the control maybe not all the controllers and this one part of it and recover this freedom that we have when we we we have this computer at home the question about that is possible and we we believe that is possible we know people are buying device they are putting this kind of error which speaker box or other kind of the value so people are we including so you can see for example right now there are 45 million of smiling speaker in the United States so imagine that we have the same number of theatres not see Robbie Readiness Center in Oakland but here the question is this is microphone sorry these boys resistance are start to war growing a lot but the people know that this these devices are not right they are they use your data they they know all of you they can listen you have sex and the people knowledge misinformation they they are aware at least but they feel buying this surveillance devices and they are good in a home that which is why what that one is commitments this is the one I mean they are willing to loss priority if you beat somebody if they don't want to be worrying about spending time everything they own one comedians so let's take a look if do not please convenient so if we take a look there the numbers how many times takes to synchronize all right now this is more or less we are moving right now by the next day both hours yes 18 hours even the amazing work of the pizza from the term condition is making possible in the last question to synchronize and all today maybe not this time this is me this is not very luminous it's just one thing thing yes one time but is not perfect we got this with that but we should improve this now let's take a look to the heart act differently nuts you need to realize that we need an SSD the aspiration of you to speed they attain between annasophia a drive but even it's more convenient because we got however with less requirement that means that it's more it's harder to start again it was part of the convenience and if we take a look to the numbers we can see that we're now who not succeeding which around 200 gigabytes of space for that anaerobic is around 7 or 8 gigabytes three months the question we hear is in June the science of the changes wanna be around 270 guides and that is important thing because we are going to a new tier of hard drives the thing here is ran out with a Buddha in there 250 weekly device but in January and June this year is gonna be that's what having each one so if we take a look to numbers we really check how much cost you romantic I think you know in June this year these are the number are fanatical about hard work or not enough provide spoke that is possible so that mean that's in film you got to pay the rom wattage CC correct for not a right at the home it's not too fast but if you check will happen if you are going to the last now yes that means that you have to pay six hundred sixty dollars for methane and it seemed not so the conclusion of August is own piece number is that no Ryan and I said no this is not for me I don't want to make a feel of it is just put the number to the table to find a solution to this situation I mean if you have the worry about the privacy you maybe have enough motivation to run a cell phone or if you are philosophically aligned with the possible spots everywhere people are not willing to the lab because Branagh it will not cost money and pigsty so we need to find something to this to this problem and one of the deployments that this vision it's design is that right now we are losing around 10 or 9 percent area of the number of cells every month and we even was when this is even growing happens because according to several scars there are 60 65 percent of the dogs are running media so genes is more expensive dying at home we expect a phenomenon sparkle to the face so how do we get people to write their own harbor and increase the number of thoughts we think that these three takeaways the first difference among these communities we need to prove that it's us we know that people want each oceans and is the way to but if they the mass adoption which testimonies so this is vision right now these people are not just you know senior all the hype they have good instruction but duty to be a boss to understand needs other thing is even if you are a boss you don't have to waste your time understand an important piece of stuff that is taste of your time unit you want to expect exact other things another thing that we have in our analysis our project are trying to put their grading arbitrary byte that's very cool because you are trying to lower this bit but the thing that is happening right now is defined we'll try it your way pretty much after after we find another good right during most a favorite one so at the end after a week maybe you switch three times or prayut this is like the root of things and you try a project on to move to another one you are not making the network more efficient you are just trying right we got a spare people by say not everybody at home moving of practice because this is 20 people only this not help that coming the next the next one is practicing what we we saw that privacy is not one of the most important things for young people they are believed to lose that but they they not that this can be important the because I started to realize that privacy is something that we should care if you offer a solution that take care of your privacy it's going to be more convenient dust and other matters in supplies so we should really privacy solution platform because people understand that their privacy is poor and finally the people is degeneration is elastics meaning we do ha not very dominant ocean you have Protestants little more convenient but if you are in television you can appreciate this lack of a comedian so since we are ready to start other to transferring money we can praise we can move into a smaller all of these so for example it is a city to come home so half of the of the situation water and if you take a look if we have one medium it's validating that means that we need to have around 30 Nationals right pronoun we are around 6000 so we need to put another division you have each number that is why you can see that number that the greater great 4x8 ocean around 80% but more people come to the decision the Commission goes longer so that's not happiness that at some point it's not competing or he's not enough convenient to run which we take off for maybe yes but why not do good all the hesitation water on top if you added the division of model of put a stake to a situation with the device smaller light starts that you can get to a bar chord shape but you can make for me at the end we can create a kind of a static situation in the same in the same rate so we can have given ceiling to contain its you know what as a division one of the whole suite or why not I expect for example I left another situation wallet that help you to create a make place again we are building kind of a computer using this leads to greater enough to be a family economy this is gonna help us to to be able to to produce devices is naughty so mainly the yes if we made it easy for anyone kind of user to use Eastern on it maybe even if they are not radicalize they are up to would this have accommodated or helped us to create together this this new system so Indonesia is we need to put this three pieces together we need to make a minute take care of privacy and half-bloods division politic and good all in the same place so we can calculate this this in one sentence we need privacy dances money boxes that are used to a community prosecution if we put all together we make a really convenient solution it's a way to to achieve maybe not much but at least that people start using a start to understand business technologies and help to to make more art so that is why in that we started one year or so to provide these kind of subjects we we make easy to start but we we have more things we we start to good the knowledge is like SDX into them to be able to be used for the products so again is we we are great innovation in which private fan can use estar to distribute its content and hello order to cost to build over for ecosystem so sample we can start to add identity or even you spread it like that help you to obtain that are sitting or we can expect a good other musically to that first of all you got it remains and a DNS would hold it together to to build bigger system if you want to know ma know more about us do our community we we grant is greater commercial project we get the firm raising 407 predation it's fun at the end we believe this bread is not safe for the community since we come with we think that we can tell all that wasted a bigger thing what question is on the storage size I am I correct in sort of believing that watching as linear growth model or being expected to be extension in the storage needs well it is so if we and I should just say the reason about is it is because and feel free to repeat the question people on board so the the reason is that you know disk space and disk off suits expected to have exponential properties so we're you know what would the curves look like over the six years and we're willing to reject them over the next two to three yeah well think about the progress specification I think there are some projects from like here that are working on that it is a drawing of the the chambers of all two entities what we gonna come out they are going to buy this is growing more so I think the idea I mean when it's used to burn out comments another solution they are going to see the change so they work on this baby no they did it's these are going to be not exponential it's gonna be posted because you are going only to start so far yeah yeah no but I'm it's deceiving the way you did it was you're talking about the growth of the node even money I might see as well like I thought the growth of the etherium storage not what's active but what's been historically done it's linear yeah so that thought process whenever I talk people like seems always like well this space is improving exponentially with respect to cost so that aspect is not the critical one like this will continue to the larger that you know dr. Serge is the active data set that Alexie's working on because you have to be able to do that storage nice close to it yes I think I mean this is uh sure your dinner sure thing is perfection I mean to me for the future I cannot guess what - aha it's very hard this is it's just six months principle we are quite sure that this is that this registration of day of the same plans for the future I mean the thing is we we can only think about their their the price of the carbon is one of the piece with it with the deal so again it's we got guess that we yeah my thing is that it is not gonna be a big deal in the future but it's growing as well yeah and just to confirm the only incentive in the monetary side of the 90 boxes is the mining reward if you have another one there sorry what they sent it right in the money box it was just based on mining words you know what is between that they need to put several roofers take credits or an estate - yes yeah a system oh my all the brightening support a file going integrate that so that is good won't wither so do you feel I mean what do you think is like the cabinet's effects and the expected return on any of these types of platforms yeah I mean we are renting the bathroom to a lot that projects to be able to be styled so but the recent innovation body model depends on the price at the end they need to reset about what's the correct monetary or what our expectations we are only the very button in which they can be solid but we cannot we are not putting any kind of relation or any kind of the limitations to the actual date they need to be applause [Applause]
