i'm the community lead for ephedrium.org and feel free to thank you if any ideas you have for the community or any support needs or if you want to collaborate in some way with the team luca would you like to go next hey everyone my name is luca i'm managing the ethereum.org translation program that's what i'm focusing most of my time on so if you ever wanna chat translations if you ever need some support got any questions feel free to reach out in the translations channel or dm me um i guess paul you wanna go ahead sure good morning everyone my name is paul um i am ethereum.org front-end developer i'm out on the west coast and also a bit of a professional rabbit hole inspector um i am a big fan of things like poe apps as well as the staking community and protocol support i'll pass it along to corwin hey everyone um corwin i live in alberta canada i'm a web developer on the ethereum.org team working on ethereum.org and yeah if you guys ever have any technical questions when you get stuck working on um features or anything that you're committing or contributing for ethereum.org feel free to reach out in the discord um you have a few contributing channels and stuff that happy to help out in um i guess paul blow you can go next yep hello guys hello my name is pablo i'm from argentina basically i'm a front-end developer working for the ethereum network team yeah you can chat with me all things related to web development technologies and crypto of course i pass it to some i guess everybody um awesome to see so many people here thanks for coming cool to see a bunch of familiar names um my name's sam i live in lake tahoe california um i've been yeah working on ethereum.org for two years and change now i'm a software developer and team lead here at the ethereum.org squad um you can see just a small group of us and really driven by the community you folks who you know hundreds of code and con content contributors and thousands of translators that make make this project possible so thank you all um yeah love to chat all things ethereum my my username sammyjammin you'll see me on discord and github um and feel free to reach out if you ever want to get in touch okay thanks everyone um i've just started sharing my screen so if you want to have a look at that if you're not following along with the agenda feel free um the last thing we really wanted to cover is this is obviously a community call for ephedium.org the website and not so much a community call that represents the ephedium network or protocol directly our team is supported by the athenian foundation but we don't even necessarily represent the views of the ephedian foundation itself so just wanted to clear that up to start with that in mind where possible will try to prioritize discussion around things like how the website ethereum.org can better create content to help developers build on ethereum or things like create better educational content to make ethereum more accessible and maybe not so much around things like um what is happening with sharding on a feeding for instance with that being said many of us do live and breathe ethereum so we're happy to answer a wide range of questions if time allows so on this call as the agenda says um we'll quickly just run through some standout features that have been implemented by the community we'll go through quickly run over the translated acknowledgements page and with the time we've got at the end we'll do a quick q a so the first thing that i actually wanted to highlight was just some awesome things that we've added to the site recently as a result of some community contributions so i'm going to stop sharing my screen just now and first up we've got corwin who's going to talk a little bit about zen mode and type search real quick if i missed this program i want to hop in um thank you for so many people being here if we could if everyone could just check their mics do us a favor and try to make sure he muted through this since we're all in a joint room like this much thanks awesome so yeah as josh said we would like to highlight a few features that were merged um quite recently for ethereum.org that were standout features from um contributors in the community so one of the new ones that we merged that maybe some of you have used um was a zen mode toggle for the documentation section of ethereum.org and so for those that aren't familiar with what zen mode is um we have a toggle up in the top right here of that page when you toggle it it'll get rid of all the menus and navigation items for that page it'll just focus you on the content um for the documentation that's there you can just have to hit that toggle to open it or turn it on i guess and same thing to turn it back off you can also hit the escape key to turn it off um but yeah this is a contribution made by and i'm probably going to butcher the name but akimadan and very much appreciate this contribution to ethereum.org it's really very helpful for people who are going through the documentation um just being able to focus on the content and one other feature i would like to highlight here is shortcut focus for searching so you might have seen our search bar changed for desktop recently where we added this slash into it basically what that was highlighting is when you hit the slash on your keyboard it'll auto focus onto that search making it so you can search the website um quicker without having to take your hands off the keyboard or the mouse or something like that and would like to thank uh again i'll probably put your name but s nikhil for that um yeah definitely appreciate these features guys and looking forward to highlighting more community features i believe paul has one that he is going to highlight so i'll stop sharing my screen here oh sure i won't be necessarily sharing a screen if you want to check out i think i was going to look at it's on ethereum.org homepage you can scroll down to the bottom uh so the home page this is something that uh we set up close to closer to a year where it was just a very simple setup we wanted to display some common metrics that people would look at related to the ethereum ecosystem give people a glance of what's going on on every given day um this started off as just the simple value and we had a contributor who helped us out getting getting going with charts on the page this was andrew rofos thank you so much andrew for helping out with that uh i had hopped in that too long this was a couple months ago now we're over the edge after we got away from these charts um so yes apologies for the value locked and defy endpoint that you see here this is something that's on our docket as well we want to get that taken care of we've been in touch with the folks over at d5 pulse and may consider some some updates to this again future but yeah thank you andrew for helping make this make this possible awesome yeah sam here thank you paul and corwin just wanted to yeah again give give a shout out to those contributors and really call out like you've seen us introduce ourselves guys like we're a team of of six people total right now so we're a small team and we do product planning we publish our roadmaps every quarter on github for like features and um new content that we plan to create but like a lot of what happens on ethereum.org is community driven and i think these are three great examples of like people taking initiative to suggest new features that we hadn't even thought of and got this stuff added to the website um so if you are looking to yeah get involved build your resume kind of build your reputation in the in the ethereum space this is a great way to do it we try to be as open as possible to any any suggestions that people come up with yeah so thanks corwin paul sam yeah as sam was saying these are really great examples of contributors advocating for features that we weren't actively focused on and now they're live then used by potentially millions of users so really great to see um especially some improvements like the charts that we've wanted to do for a long time but just maybe didn't have the capacity to actually prioritize so yeah once again um just a big thanks to hakeem seth nikhil and andrew for their contributions there yes thank you and of course anybody else who we didn't necessarily highlight right here who's contributed thank you so much yeah so i'm now sharing my screen again um next up we have the community hub that we quickly want to discuss again although this was completed by our team much of the design work was completed by a contributor who was collaborating with us and through discord so big thanks to scott for all of his work on this um so the motivation behind this page itself was that her old community page was just really a poorly organized bunch of lists we wanted to create something that was both more visually interesting and more helpful to people to find their place within the community so we felt that one of the most important things to highlight with this was probably like the why of getting involved obviously it varies so greatly from person to person but we've found that like the key points here are just finding a place where you actually belong within ethereum being able to earn money and being able to make an impact and was some just key important points we thought were worthy of highlighting next we want to just highlight we wanted and just to highlight different ways to get involved so we've got our four main call outs here firstly there's the online communities page well for a while we've wanted to grow out these resources that we listed but the trouble with the original design was that it became very hard to just find what you were looking for so we used some clever design tricks here the use of icons just to make the more information more scannable added some nice spacing to it and now you can see it's now very easy just to navigate and find what you actually want we also broke out this events section which includes our events and meetups um so to allow people to participate in events conferences etc we wanted everything just to be easier to find before what we listed was just a simple list of events and again this was really hard to navigate and users weren't given all the the correct information so in this new design um with each event you can see it's very easy to find the dates of the events um and we also explicitly state where the event's actually happening so again you can find an event near you and one will actually work for you for the meetups the main change we added was just to um add search functionality to this so for example if you live in let's say vienna you can just simply search and find the meet up and people in the area who want to you know chat ethereum and talk about the recent developments uh next iteration of this page will be our or this um community hub rather we'll be including a meetup guide so that we'll get you all the information you need about how to actually start a meetup so keep your eye out for that that should be coming out beginning at next year at some point hopefully we've got this section for contributing to projects so on this page we list out ways that you can contribute based on your skill set so let's say you land here and you are a non-technical person you can go to the non-technical heading and just have a quick look for this and let's say you land on you want to write content for ethereum and so we just provide you places that you can look so you can actively contribute and whether it's writing or you want to organize meetups or perhaps you're a researcher and you want to just find out how to get involved with research this is all contained in this one page rather than just being split as we said before in this community page which was a bit of a mess of just different links and on this page we've obviously got a couple of more things call outs to finding jobs in the ecosystem getting a grant if you um are working on a project and you need funding you should definitely check this page out contributing to ethereum.org itself that's obviously something that we would love to see and if you need help with that feel free to message me or anyone else in the team yeah and the last thing um i'd like to cover on this is just our new support page um so it starts out just very basically explaining the decentralized nature of ethereum and that there is no official support for ethereum but directs users for places where they can get support so whether that's support with their wallet support building out decentralized applications on ethereum or even running their own nodes and lastly we have this section on like frequently asked support questions so this is things like sending a fee if to the wrong wallet um we hope to grow this over time so if you do look through this and you find things that you think we should ask feel free to ping us or feel free to open an issue or a pr and we'll try and get different things added and again um obviously any feedback you have on this page we'd love to hear about so please post them and our discord preferably on our website general channel or just reach out individually to a team member so next up the important part for many people here the apps um so if you aren't you should check out my screen just now because it was where i'll be firstly sharing the passcode to get the po so i'll quickly run through how to actually claim it before we do that um if you go to any channel on our discord server you can see in the users list on the right-hand pane that the pull-up bot is right at the top if you click on this bot and send the message um you'll just send the keyword to the poet bot and the poet bot will send you a link back with a claim link back for where you can get your app click on that fill in your address and your wall address and that will be your point claimed so the passcode itself is it's all community so that's it's all community all lowercase no apostrophe if you message that to the poet bot once again if you just go on our discord server find the pull up bot at the top send it a message with the passcode it's all community the bot will send you a message back and you can enter your wall address to claim so everybody go get it everyone will get it i'll i'll leave that a minute to get sorry to interrupt i'm just wondering uh what is the pull-up i don't get it great question i cannot stands for proof of attendance protocol which ultimately is just uh a set of where you can get nfts essentially c721 minted for just participating in different things various things especially in the ethereum ecosystem um it was put together at east denver in 19 i believe patricio warthalter is the guy who leads the project these are minted originally on xdi and they're minted for free on which side chain to etherium if you want to pay the gas you can easily click a button and migrate it over to mainnet but ultimately it's just a fun way to show that you participated in different things and to kind of build up a repertoire if you will like a little collection of poeps as you attend different things uh in the ethereum space they can be for virtual events like this one they can also be they're all very prevalent in real life events like conferences for example so if you haven't grabbed one yet make this your first one go mess and get started collecting them cool thank you yeah thanks for clarifying um paul and thanks for asking the question it's very easy to get wrapped up in the ecosystem and not remember that so many of these are quite abstract concepts um so yeah thanks for asking i'll just leave it another 30 seconds or so just to let everyone claim and then we'll move on yeah and while people are claiming to i'll step back on that community page i just wanted to point out to people that some of those things are i mean again everything's open source anybody if you see something that's wrong please you know feel free to raise it with us or go to github and raise an issue also the events page in particular is one that's kind of an ongoing thing it needs to be updated over time so if you're aware of any ethereum events if you hear any particular big meetups or if there's conferences in your industry please feel free to like again let us know or submit a pr to update that it's all the events are basically held in one repo and if you need help learning how to do that you can message one of us or post in one of the channels great i'm now going to stop sharing my screen but you can still claim the what bot once again the passcode is it's all community if you just message that to the bot it'll send you back a link where is it so as always has been so um next up our translation league looker is just going to speak a little bit about some of the work that we've been doing to acknowledge just all this amazing work that our translators have been doing yeah sure um let me just share my screen the anticipation yeah very excited to show everyone the new acknowledgements and the leaderboards we've been working on just a sec here we go so this is something that we published recently it's a translator acknowledgement page or a contributor acknowledgement page more like it um this is dedicated to our translators the purpose here is to acknowledge and highlight all of our translators and especially the ones who have made the biggest impact on the translation program this is the first iteration of this page so it will probably develop over time we are planning on adding other content to it but for now in short this contains our translator leaderboards where you can check out our top translators most active translators for each for the last month the last quarter um and our most active all-time translators this is again the first iteration of this leaderboard so if if you're a part of it if you're listed on it and notice that something is off feel free to reach out let us know it's still a working progress but it is um yeah we're happy to be able to share this with you it's something that we've been working on for a while especially thinking about ways how we can acknowledge our translators given that there's thousands of them and the best ways to highlight them so yeah the first part of this is the leaderboard the second part is this page our translators page where you can see all of the translators who have ever contributed to the translation program at all so if you've ever translated anything you can find yourself on this page and the last part is a section on poeps what they are how you can claim them some um general tips on you know claiming pro-apps with self-custody wallets as opposed to exchange wallets stuff like that um the po-apps are something that we're also keen to build on and be able to create new pow apps um basically build on this and we're planning on yeah we're gonna have new pro apps next year probably gonna have different criteria than there have been so far so right now our translators can claim three different poeps the 2021 the 21 gen uh contributor pro-app which everyone can get the 1k and the 10kpo apps for people who have translated 1000 and 2000 words effectively yeah so that's it for the poeps right now we are working on a translator certificate as well that we will be adding to this page uh if you've visited the translations channel in this past few days you've probably seen the vote where we kind of ask the community which certificates they would like oh communities so that is all in the work right now we will be adding this to the acknowledgment page and yeah like i said thinking of other ways how we could highlight and acknowledge our translators moving forward so if you've got any ideas if there's anything that you would like to see if there is a specific way how you uh as a translator would like to be acknowledged or highlighted feel free to reach out also if you've got any feedback about this page at all feel free to reach out you can drop us a message in the translations channel for example or send me a dm and we will take your feedback and thoughts on board for the next iteration of this page and for the next for all the for all the content that we're planning to add moving forward um yeah at this point i'd like to thank all of our contributors and in particular the translators in this case as sam already mentioned a large part of ethereum.org is community a lot of the content on the website was contributed by the community and the translations themselves they're all community right so it's incredible to see that we've got 37 languages available on the website with at least five that we will be adding very soon um yeah so thank you for helping us make the website accessible to everyone regardless of their language that's what the purpose of the translation program is if you want to get involved with the translations send us a message in the translations channel send me a dm we can help you get on board it and start translating if you're bilingual and want to get involved want to contribute um so that would be it for me thanks again beautiful thank you luca for working on this and yeah once again thank you to all the translators who are involved so take a second just to remind everyone that we've had to jump over to a voice channel so if you do join in and you're not speaking please make sure that you're on mute thank you um and yeah i heard it sounds like a couple of people are still trying to grab their poet at the last moment so once again the pull up claim code is it's all community feel free to message the bot and the bot will sort you out i'm going to share my screen again so we'd like to [Music] spend basically the rest of the time here just going through questions from the community we do have a list here of questions ready to go um if you've already asked the question here you don't have to ask it again but firstly we'd like to just open up the floor to everyone here and if you've got a question just feel free to unmute and speak up or if for any reason you don't feel comfortable with that you can also use the community channel to chat as well i heard someone on do you youtube a question um hi i'm uh my name is ethmaxitard um super big fan of the website um amazing that there's only six of you um my question was um now that ethereum is switching to um prioritize layer twos and that's the future of ethereum i was wondering if we should have ethereum.org focus more on onboarding users directly to layer 2. for example the wallets page having a much bigger emphasis on l2 compatible wallets and i saw there was some issue related to that but i feel like it's really important because there's so many complaints about gas fees now um even though lt's like arbitrary are already available i feel like we should have a much bigger emphasis on on l2s on the website and and just not on board them to mainnet at all if possible yeah really great question um i wonder if anyone else in the team wants to chime in on this but i just want to firstly start by completely agreeing with you that the next stage is trying to get people directly on elders i think that truthfully that the infrastructure to do that has only really just matured in the last month or so you know you've got announcements from finance and coinbase getting people directly onto arbitram and other lyrics um but yeah i definitely think we could be doing some more work on that um does anyone else in the team want to speak on this at all i can turn into yeah thank you for raising the question i i also agree with that sentiment uh and and the fact that yeah these are still relatively new technology so it's it has been tough to go full throttle into pushing these just yet because like josh said there's not a lot of centralized support from the you know the different uh exchanges that are out there that number new users are utilizing to get onboarded um but i do agree that as that's rolled out we have already kind of told we want to update our wow section it's definitely a date at this point as far as features things people are are looking for from uh so this is definitely something that i would like to see pursued as we go forward l2 support is going to be key going forward and that's just too expensive yeah and like ted a bit we're looking to revamp the wallet section um and that is a filter that multi-chain support which would include l2's in this case um is definitely a filter that looking to add in our wallet section for for that case that you're describing exactly like being able to just onboard onto an l2 and a wallet is going to be very important cool thank you yeah thanks for asking does anyone else want to ask anything or if not we can jump into the questions we got during the week hey hey joshua i i had a quick one just on the the website um i i know we i know we it looks like we typically use git coin for kind of feature bounties and things that are related or maybe peripheral to ether but just wondering if you guys have thought about employing kind of community bounties sorry are you asking if for features on ethereum.org if we work with like get coiner yeah or or use a i don't know if there's an ethereum.org treasury that you guys manage but just potentially tapping into that to kind of accelerate some features and have many hackathons or or things like that yeah um i'll let i'll let sam speak to this um because i know it's something that we've looked into in the past before my time um so sam you wanted to take this one sure yeah thank you for the question and i mean overall like this is why we have these community calls because we want input like this so great to hear there is potential interest is like bitcoin bitcoin bounties is a great platform and something we've used you know years into the past to kind of just like generate interest and obviously incentivize people and actually like reward them for potential contributions to ethereum.org so something we've done in the past it it was like a non-zero maintenance thing and this was back when the team was basically just me and one other person so we ended up kind of just like putting that off for now i think largely just because of the maintenance but i think that is something we could definitely reignite um i feel like we tend to have some tension between you know having this open source website this open source community where the large majority of people right are just completely volunteering their time and like it very much is an altruistic decision to like give back to the ethereum community and pay it forward in a way with content and contributions to like you know help onboard the next you know million people into the ethereum landscape so we do hit a little bit of tension where we say like pay for certain features but not for others you get a little bit of a slippery slope of like hey why not me i've been contributing for months and i've never been paid so in short it's something we do think about of like what is the best way to get people involved and we do want to reward people who put in who put in the work so yeah if if bounties is something you'd like to see um i'd say yeah like get involved in our discord create issues um this is something we could definitely build out and like potentially help um create like a community-run bounty program i think would be something great to see in the future yeah yeah i mean the specific mechanism i had in mind was just have people who either build on ethereum so daps or layer twos or or potentially venture capital funds i suspect that have benefited from ethereum just provide um kind of a matching mechanism um via git coin and just have them say hey i'll match anyone in east org who wants to put up money to help fund the next big feature like maybe a mobile feature right which would be pretty pretty uh that'd be a pretty big undertaking um and just have kind of a the like adapt treasury uh maybe from uniswap or others that would match things or maybe you know do a two to one match um i i've just seen that work well in other non-profits just to get potentially get around that problem you you'd highlight it but yeah fully fully recognized money introduces the whole can of worms yeah all good ideas thank you yeah thank you for the question um i want to keep this rolling so if anyone doesn't have any other questions we can jump into the community questions that we got beforehand um so yeah feel free to after a question interrupt if you've thought of something or want to ask a follow-up or you've got something tangentially related um first question that we've got in here as what fresh content as a team are you prioritizing from for ephedium.org and that's from anonymous um yeah so thanks for your question good question um so many important things that we'd love to produce content for i think so as sam and corwin already mentioned one thing that we're working towards right now is a better more refined wallet section of the site at the moment it's a bit overwhelming to users and users without any context for the ecosystem can get a bit lost and obviously we want to try and onboard people into layer twos as we already discussed so that's one thing that's definitely high priority for the the near term paul's also currently just adding finishing touches to a new page on running an ephedium node which goes into the similar to the community page the why of why you'd want to run a node and how you can actually do it you know the technical specs and things like that um i'll i'll get and post our roadmap and the chat but our qford our q4 roadmap highlights a lot of these things um so you can have a look at that to see what we're currently thinking about and at the beginning of next year we'll post the q1 roadmap as well which we encourage people to have and put on um worth noting on the roadmap itself these are the thoughts of the team but we do try to enable anyone in the community who wishes to advocate for new content that we haven't thought about um i suppose to open up a little bit i met a question for anyone here is this if there's any ideas for content or things that you'd like to see on the site that we should prioritize that we don't already have on the roadmap or we don't have in the site please speak up just now if you've got anything like that or if you don't want to feel free to put it in the community call chat or even ping us afterwards about that and i've um i've posted a link to our roadmap and the chat if you're interested in checking that out okay um i'll keep this rolling then so the next question is is aetherium secured or safe yesterday had been cheated with my point to ethereum they said it was a giveaway for ethereum started by the co-founder that's from satish um wow really sorry to hear about that um does anyone on the team want to maybe speak to this a little bit yeah get up and yes again i'm also sorry to hear that that happened satish um first off as far as ethereum security i mean this is this is a network that's extremely secure um you know run by a decentralized network of thousands of nodes so as far as the protocol of ethereum it's extremely secure and with that comes what's called immutability meaning you can't just go back and change things that have happened in the past and when transactions occur when they've been included in a block they are essentially permanent so in this case it doesn't mean that everything is perfectly safe you need to be very careful out there when it comes to interacting online or when it comes to these kind of these freebie type things where you say oh send some meat this way and we'll send you twice as much back that's known as an asymmetric giveaway amongst other terms it's it's always a scam okay so please stay safe out there if you send your money to an address there is no way you can get it back unless you know the person who is that address or private keys to it yourself alright so anytime you see these things a very common damn unfortunately is youtube channels can get taken over by hackers who break in people maybe their account security wasn't great a hacker gets in they take control over it and then they delete the entire channel but keep all the followers and then they reva they rebranded essentially as something that looks legitimate like it's run by the ethereum foundation for example oh vital stage talking so he's talked at a lot of conferences i mean there's a lot of footage like that it doesn't mean that like this is legit so anytime you're posed with things like this where you think oh i can get some free eth if i just send my heath just don't uh report those channels um and stay away from them again so sorry that that you lost some meat in that situation yeah we um recently released the page on staying safe and ethereum and just avoiding scams in general corwin has posted a link to that in the community called chat i'd honestly recommend everyone to read it when the team were researching content for this page we learned a lot of valuable information um even with the experience a lot of us have so it's probably pretty valuable regardless of of your experience in crypto but yeah sorry to hear about that again but just recommend everyone does their due diligence and tries their best to not fault for any scams like this um moving along we've got a couple of hiring questions are there any upcoming opportunities for feeding the org developers and when designer hire um i'll pass this one to sam she's largely been dealing with that yeah happy to speak to this glad there's interest in these opportunities so yeah um in short yes upcoming opportunities for developers at ethereum.org um no official job post at this point in time and i guess to take a step back again you know ethereum.org yeah currently a small team six of us working on this full-time um alongside you know the hundreds of you helping out um we are supported by the ethereum foundation which is great the ethereum foundation you know has resources at its disposal and i think more and more is recognizing just the importance of ethereum.org or just like educational ethereum content in general um having a place where you know anyone can contribute where we're hopefully providing a credibly neutral source of information to just help onboard people help people keep up to date with this whole ecosystem that just evolves incredibly rapidly um so we we do have an open um job posting for a product designer we've been fortunate to get like nearly 100 applications so far for that and in terms of timeline like if you have applied hopefully you've already heard back from us i know we've we've started our first uh round of interviews just this past week um timing's kind of hard to estimate depending on people's schedules with the new year coming up but i would say yeah by january or february where we're looking to to land a higher on that front and for developers out there yeah no official job posting open but i will say and like speakers today i think are a good testament of this of like the the first place we look to hire people is within our existing community and within existing contributors on ethereum.org paul here could speak to you know he started as someone who just started opening prs on github and helping us knock out features and and bugs over half or i guess half the team here um originally started as just open source contributors on github or crowdin or or discord so great way to to build a resume um to get seen whether that's eventually hired by you know the ethereum.org team or if you're just looking for you know a role within the ecosystem in general i would say open source contributions are like such a big value add in terms of showing showing what you're capable of so definitely encourage you to get involved i know sometimes it's hard to work for free right we're all busy we need to make a living and support ourselves and our family and our friends but a great way to get into the space is to yeah just like solve problems provide value and i can assure you you will get noticed yeah we're kind of in a space here where it's somewhat of a you want a job go out and take it a lot of this stuff is open source our project is entirely open source so please feel free to get involved and contribute and like sam said we definitely are looking to those folks first and yeah like he said as well that was how i joined the team last year where i just basically was doing what sam said this guy in the github repo and started participating in it every day and eventually got brought on um this is something that's i can really only mainly speak for ethereum.org seen in a lot of the ecosystem as well if you're looking to get involved get started get in discord start talking to people start contributing and then recognized so i encourage everyone to do that if you're interested in getting more involved yeah and i can add to that too that i got hired in the exact same way i've just found the discord thought this is cool started contributing being active and then a couple of months later there was a role came up applied and here we are today so yeah definitely if you're looking to get a role not just a freedom.org but anywhere within the ecosystem um just as paul put just get involved in any way that you can and if you're not sure how to just ask because all these communities are open source and are desperate for contributors to to step up and take things off their plate so if you want to be that person just ask how you can help definitely and i'd say like i'd say one thing at least i've noticed about the ethereum space and a lot of projects and communities here is like oftentimes there is no official job posting but if you find a way to like demonstrate um value and and show projects that like hey this thing is useful this thing you didn't even know you needed um i think luke on the call is a great example is right like we didn't actually have some person owning the translation program full time um and luca just you know hopped into our discord started sharing recommendations suggestions on how to improve the the program from an operational standpoint and like that eventually perked our ears up and like wait maybe we should hire someone to focus on this full-time given it's you know thousands of contributors around the world really pushing this this project forward so i think a great example of if you identify a place where you can add value there doesn't necessarily need to be an official job posting to apply for and just to add to that a little bit um you don't have to be a developer to join this space and to make an impact and to add some value um the space is growing at a rapid pace and people of all backgrounds are needed so if you've got unique skills if you've got some experience in um yeah anything pretty much like just get involved join discord channels uh start getting involved with the projects and add value in your own way and yeah as paul and joshua and myself are a testament to you will get noticed people notice when you are helping out when you're adding value when you are contributing um so i just wanted to clarify that you don't have to strictly be a developer and a highly technical person to be able to make an impact in this space and to be able to get involved and get a job basically yeah for sure coming close to the hour here so we want to try to speed things up um if the others on the team don't mind i want to try to wrap it a couple of these questions um in particular we see some stuff about i'll just kind of broadly touch on those questions about you know how to roll ups what's going to happen after the merge what's being done as far as research and everything i'm posting uh right now to the eth r d discord and the community call channel this is something if anybody's curious about kind of more protocol level research and where things are going i would definitely suggest checking that out there's some other sources that we could post like cat herders and the ethereum blog for example these are good ways to stay up to date on what's going on at a broader level uh again just emphasize our team of six we do not you know dictate what's going on with the protocol and we are not necessarily focused day-to-day on researching this stuff but there are teams that are dedicated to this stuff um proof of stake one similarly um hopefully very soon uh and i would i would definitely follow along in the darn discord there yeah um to answer that current estimate so the end of by the end of q2 2022 but we have a page on our website where you can keep up to date um and i've also to add to paul's point about following along with r d posted a link to tim biko's twitter every two weeks after the old core devs call he posts an update on a quite succinct update on exactly what is happening with core development of the affiliating protocol so definitely um follow along with that if you're interested yeah and there's another one here i see after each two is ethereum complete do you still need to update the website i'm so long story short uh there it'll never i mean i don't see it being completely complete for a long long time honestly this is a ever-changing industry and things are constantly being researched and learning new new approaches are being taken as far as do we still need to update the website i would argue yes for quite some time there is kind of this distant goal of potentially making this somewhat of a mdn or a wikipedia type setup where people can self run the page say in short this is something where we're going to continue to update the website for a long time yeah and just to point out our good friend micah wouldn't be very happy with me if i didn't quickly explain that the if2 branding has been dropped and just that's mainly because it's no longer accurately an accurate representation of what's actually happening um so instead you can think of those upgrades that were formerly known as e42 as three separate consensus layer upgrades so we had the beacon chain which shipped december of last year um the merge which is when we moved to proof of stake and that should happen early to the middle of next year and then sharding which is estimated just now for 2023 yeah and just to touch on this too there's been a shift in the road map over time for any of you who may have been familiar with the phasing now phase zero phase one phase two um that's kind of been phased out if you will in favor of more of a rob centric road map uh which vitalik's talked about in the past but mainly focuses on the fact that we have l2 technology here now such as optimistic roll-ups and zk roll-ups are in the pipeline these things are going to drastically scale ethereum and are not necessarily dependent on proof of stakes so those are emphasized right now try to get the scaling going we're going to try to transition to proof of stake you know as soon as possible and then time that layer charting that helps to even further expand the scalability of the network so stay in touch yeah and just to answer one question related to that by eric um asks are there objective downsides to adopting a rollup centric product role map for what use cases does decentralization matter most um just to her one again about paul's point earlier is that these aren't really the things that we are the experts of uh probably a question that's better suited for the researchers or the many many unqualified philosophers in the space on twitter um so i'd point you to the r d discord for that i know you're already heavily active there but for anyone else who is keen to check that out there's a lot of interesting conversations or things like this happening there um and yeah with that i think we're pretty much at time so i just like to once again like thank everyone for spending this hour with us and taking the time to get an update on what we've been working on and any questions that you've asked thanks again for anyone who's contributed to the website this year or is thinking of doing so and all of our amazing translators as well you um you're all a big part of what makes ethereum dark so special so i just want to call you once more yes thank you to everyone and for those questions that we didn't get to um apologies if you have these are burning questions feel free to ask chat and try to get back to you but thanks everyone for coming huge turnout i love it yeah thanks everyone for getting involved and for joining the call okay we're going to call it that thanks again thanks everyone we all have a nice rest of your day bye everyone thank you bye-bye thank you
