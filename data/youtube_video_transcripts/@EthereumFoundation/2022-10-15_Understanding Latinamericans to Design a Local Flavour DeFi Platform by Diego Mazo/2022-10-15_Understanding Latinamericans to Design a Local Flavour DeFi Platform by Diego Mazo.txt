foreign [Music] we're here to talk about understanding Latin Americans and to design a local flavor D5 platform so the question straight to the point is how do we understand Latin Americans and this is not a global question it's more local question but we use a unique method in our team a model we created yes to understand all that we can with uh in-depth research and also combining with a community model so what we do is basically we try to engage we try to educate and we evolve with our users but not they are not only users they are contributors so we created a two-level community one part of the community are the global community and then we have the Community Builders why well we want to create long-term relationships and we don't we want to engage with our users we want to to create value together to co-create value and grow in together in a long-term process to to have a better product and to have uh contributors all along this this way so applying this model we we learned a lot of things we brought here five main learnings and we will buy one by one so the first insight the first Insight is that convenience it's decentralization for breakfast what does it mean well basically users normal users average users don't understand decentralization at the beginning so it's a gradual process and we need to help them to educate them and especially to have decentralization as an invisible concept so we we cannot ask our users just to have a ux or an experience that is so complicated for them that they will give up in the beginning then as Latin Americans we kill four dollars dollars are our store of value for the future and local currency is the enemy and most of you probably know it so we need to also adapt to current mental models so in the crypto ecosystem if you have a platform probably you have several stable coins but this is a non-existing mental model Uh current users they will think there is only one dollar so we need to adapt to these existing models just to provide them a better experience if we're talking about savings we think well it's it's good a day our users our contributors will learn about web3 but first we need to teach them how to save this sounds obvious but it is not most of them in Latin America in general is difficult to save it's not a common Habit to save and if you don't choose the right path if you don't know how to apply certain methods to save if you don't have the tools to do it you will have that you you will open the door of abusive loans which is a vicious circle that it's very very difficult to accept so some of our users we understood that it's very important not only to help them save but also to educate them to get out of this visual Circle if we talk about loans that's how I was doing it um first loans are hard to get in Latin America and harder to to pay and we have high interest rates we have a big barrier that is the credit history but especially I would like to to focus on conscious decisions so if we have the urgency to get a loan that's a bad situation there is no negotiation and probably we will get into this vicious circle that I mentioned before so we need to educate our users in our platforms to make conscious decisions we need to provide them the right information to understand the consequences of their decisions because we are talking about financial products we are talking about money and probably the well-being of families finally our last insight is that trust is careful Source in Latin America so scams are frequent not only in crypto but also in any Financial Service and it's very very complicated to differentiate between uh proper service and scam then in general governments don't protect us and people don't trust governments so it's also a big barrier and Banks take the advantage of its privileged position so this it's a combination of factors which makes everything very particular and especially difficult so with all these that I've explained we believe we are working we are building Tropicals that is the platform to to create better personal finances using web web3 and in Latin America and just as a friendly reminder we are not here for the technology we are here for the impact gracias what in your opinion are the top three low-hanging fruits what we can do as Kanaya people involved in the crypto ecosystem to Foster crypto adoption and education here in Latin America that's a good question um so I think that the first part is as we said it's education right so we need to educate in in the tools and especially try to differentiate from scams which is a big problem because this there's many people is not trusting crypto they don't have their technical knowledge they don't have the the whole context so education I think it's the the main the main tool and [Music] yeah for example in in tropicus we would definitely believe that we need to use certain standards that are used in web 2 to bring to web3 so if we use a web to login without all the seed phrase or this kind of technicalities it will help a lot to the average people to understand these kind of platforms
