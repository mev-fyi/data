[Music] hello everyone so today I'll be talking about something called ID box ID box is it's a project for nonprofit building a foundation for identity in developing country so I will try to stay high level because it's I don't know much off time to view a very technical aspect to the product I would rather prefer telling you what I've been doing what we've been doing in developing countries around identities and I first bought myself from a developer entrepreneur and I've got a master Nietzsche con engineering and Master in computer science and I've been doing different projects around FinTech transportation energy all kind of project and then I will tell you what I'm telling you all of this so the main problem worldwide already people a lot of people already mentioned this problem but you've got 1.5 billion people in the world that like official identification and we're talking about countries where you don't have internet you know electricity and you don't want smart phone so if you think about all this different started that try to solve the identity problem by building a very fantastic smartphone application for those people it's it's not relevant because they don't have a smart phone so they can really use the application so we we building we're using we starting to use blockchain and we're building all this kind of crazy application but still those people they cannot really profit from the the new technology so I've been for the past nine months I've been trying to build something that developing country could use in order to first create a unique identity and then access to different services and the main goal is having a device don't really need internet don't need a great electricity and doesn't require smartphone so and the people can use it by having either analog phone or by having a smart card and also has to be has to be cheap so anyone can actually buy it and the private information from the user is not saved into social database like the Estonian government is doing or like the other project from India so we'll quickly show you a video what I've been doing the video is a bit less nine months old so the project involved well you don't have time to edit the video so that enables people within developing countries to create a unique identity the ID box device is composed of a Raspberry Pi SMS chip fingerprint recognition and the solar panel by combining these components it allows us to create a secure identity based service that will revolutionize the way that developing countries participate in a range of activities from Papua New Guinea to Ghana to Samoa we are able to ship the device to any local area even if they don't have power or the internet the devices which cost less than fifty dollars are hosted in a range of centralized areas like schools churches banks and coffee shops people use their SMS phones to text the ID box device to create a unique mapping of their phone and fingerprint creating a personal ID once someone has created an ID they don't need to use the Box again unless they want to assign their ID to a new phone across the country millions of people do not have an ID this is John he has recently heard about ID box using his phone and the local ID box which is located at is nearby church he is able to create a unique ID he sends an SMS to the ID box to activate the registration process he puts his finger on the fingerprint scanner the box then encrypts the fingerprint using an advanced encryption process and then sends the hash of the fingerprint by a ms2 the blockchain attached with John's phone number if the identity doesn't exist it then creates a new identity on the blockchain and sends a confirmation message to John on his phone to confirm his new unique ID with his new identity John is now able to view his balance history of transactions he has made and to securely transfer money to other people who have created a unique ID each time John wishes to make a transfer with other active users his unique ID is verified against the blockchain he is quickly notified of his transactions on his phone he can also participate in voting systems health care registration and ownership of land thanks to ID box John's engagement with these activities has been revolutionized so this was the video from 9 months ago so you can think about all the different problem is not possible today the private key or unique here from a fingerprint well it's not actually entirely true if you state your very local village and you use like kind of like fuzzy logic extractors and ROI stuff that's what I've actually been doing in two different place in the world that was the first implementation of the ID box looks like a bomb but it's not so basically use Ivy's sensor you got the phone number on the bottom of the box don't text it that was my mistake I put the phone number but no I had to delete it because people were sending me SMS and you've got a SIM card on right hand side so basically the SIM card can be bought from anywhere in the world so you ship the box to this do the idea this is the main idea basically you ship the box we need local area and then they just have to buy a local SIM card to have either internet communication or SMS / communication and then the solar panel charge the box because you don't have electricity and you can also add a passport and information on us on the screen then I build this new version that was a new version of the ID box version one I called it I want to Papua New Guinea to run a proof of concept that was using private private data based through for three different institution the Central Bank of Papua New Guinea the micro economy loan and mobile mobile mobile providers but the problem is this kind of box can be very easily Hucky and people can perform like if you try to copy your fingerprint from someone and then try to create a new identity so then I saw I forgot to be moved and stuff then I raised quite a lot of money from private grants not ICO and so with the money I was was caught with a lot of money but this was my new desk so I moved from my dust desktop to my living room and I build open-source 2d printer so basically the idea was to build kind of open source opens to the entire project and build AI that everyone can actually build the ID box to create a unique identity so I design and I put the file online so everyone can actually don't know them and can they can play with the ID box that was version so version one on the top and actually am I'm the first one I mean ID box is the first one to create a first 3d printed a Java card that Evan can print and modify and can save like a personal token inside from a dairy fingerprint template I will show you why it's it can be used for so that's the that's a new ID box so you've got a Linux distribution system and a screen inside rather than having just raspberry pi because what we spiteful for people they're not really a technology they don't really you know I interact often with screens and technology you know in a very remote area so you do you have good screen and you can do different kind of you can access different services so you can you can involve yourself so you can create a unique identity and you can um you can use the box as a voting system or send money or receive money so if you if you remember the previous presentation they were talking about how costly it is to receive money for those people in a village most of the time they have to travel six hours into the capital to receive money from the son who for example walks in Australia so the sense and money to to Papua New Guinea to Western Union Western Union most of the time thirty forty percent and then the person's the village asked to travel to the capital six ours cost them about one hundred one hundred the local money over there which is almost the money they would receive for them son from this one so it's a complete disaster but this it can use that to get away from receiving money using an ATM card so you've got the sim card on the side you got the solar charging port you got charging ports so people can actually sell electricity to other people in the village why is it important for people of the day they've got analog phone but they don't have system to charge the analog phones so they need to travel six hours to the top of the mountain and find someone for carrying very huge battery system and then they buy the electricity with this system a local shop they can actually buy the box and then sell the extra city back to the people in the village and it's modular modular box so basically what it is is you can increase the security if you're talking about a big village and you you you worry about collision into creating your private or public key and then you can add re sensor and blood sensor you can add different biometric system so using the multimodal biometric identification system at the end of the day the private key obviously is never saved because you are the private key that's the main idea of the project and you can encrypt either you can sign whatever you want so I content efficient system using you your own body so Nick Johnson is everyday so I create the I talked to Nick Johnson and a few people from from the same foundation like God and also other people from Swami no acceptor so I build this first ID box card they help Nick and so basically we've got like about the entire village now has got the card so I can send you a unique public key of those people and you guys can actually send them money without passing by a Western Union so it's dark money from them which is very quick and I've been working on something new haiji box ad wallet using a new Java applet and using NFC and fingerprints the USB token I put it there because it was cool but it's not actually functionable and the idea is to you basically use this card to sign transaction because those people didn't have a smartphone so the ID box will transfer the template or the the private key to discard and then the user can actually put his fingerprint on the card and then sign a token transaction and then very fine to the box that is a real person the pool concept so I'm gonna talk about this one this one is really cool so we we decided to go to Papua New Guinea sure you guys know it's Papua New Guinea it's on the other side of Australia between and so you got New Zealand Australia and then a little bit further you've got Papua New Guinea Papua New Guinea why Papua New Guinea if you look at the statistics Papua New Guinea is probably one of the biggest country in the world where they people don't have their identity it's about ninety percent of the entire population not registered so they don't exist so that was a big a big challenge if we can build the ID box over there if we can create identity in this village in this country then ID box can walk they can walk everywhere so we won't there it's about five hours we got a little bit stuck on the way like what like five hours and so imagine those those people first they don't have a car if they have the bike it's probably impossible for them to go to the capital and then get founded get the money from their son from Western Union because you got to travel six hours sometime to take the bus I'll let you imagine what the bus were doing this on this road so the village it was very fantastic we called Aloha you can look online and we register people from the village and they were really so for the main was very interesting because they can sell a tricity back to the people into the village so they got incentive of buying the box because then they want to if you can sell electricity by charging the box then people are more they want to carry they want to take care of the box and then so basically what it does you create you create your biometrics send it to the card and also the public key of first the eastern card is linked with your phone number and linked with your public key of your biometrics and it's a village of 150 250 people so the collision into the village is not very high and you use also GPS based location system I know like proof of prison so of position is not very it can be hacked but if you add all this kind of biometric into the system then you can make hundred percent sure in a hundred percent sure but that the person that was created was unique and this is the local soft the man so you see we've actually done first transaction so this woman we see him from the son who's in Australia and they want to local shop to get the money coming some looking at the time coming features so I've been looking to will be looking into zero knowledge proof so making sure because the main idea about identity which is very difficult to build is you want to build a unique identity system by the same time you don't want to share your information so it's a bit competitive you you want to make sure I mean any service for businesses like Bank insurance and all this kind of big companies what they want to do when they want to know they want to know that they want to be under percent sure that the person is dealing with is unique that's the main idea and they don't really care about your information the only reason why they actually get your information they ask for your information is for them to make sure they are unique but if you can provide a system first if we can make sure is they are unique then there's no need for them to get to take your identity so I've been looking into and also talking with fabian as well like it's building the editing tip protocol into the eastern which is fantastic so he also like system where you can add multimodal biometric system my fingerprint iris and blood sensor i'm saying that remember that this information is not safe anywhere that's the main idea so only the David key even the public key is saved and then you always need to go to the Box to sign transaction well if you use the only the fingerprint with your card then you can use the card but you cannot use Ivysaur finger blood sensor I've been looking into something called actually I think we are the first one trying to do that but it's called them I called it then the identity a I am it's basically like an ATM but more like for identity system and the roadmap so we've done version 1 version 2 done yeah we playing a second phase of the prototype in PNG so we got big institution over there that following the project I mean actually part and partner with the project got some short Bank all the mobile provider Insurance micro micro loan micro credit so you can all those different application can obviously be used by the ID box so it's for nonprofit so if you guys are very interested in trying or helping a partnering if you also building something with identity we call I think I've got time for a few questions and if you know so this one was a nonprofit project and if only come this afternoon for I'm building a flying carpet so be a different discussion but that's it I was I you
