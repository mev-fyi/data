and we're live cool welcome so this is a video for any developers to the EMG SVM projects the purpose of this video is to show you how to set up your dev environment rotor finding where to find requirements for what to work on next and how to run the test my name is Dan I'm a contributor TV theme jazz projects and this is Casey Casey would you like to introduce yourself yeah I'm Casey I'm a volunteer helping out with the theory MJS lately and trying to get more contributors involved sweet so uh you're cloning down stuff right now and we can do an NPM install but while you're at it would you like to tell us a bit about AI PS and how any developer can find a IPS to work on sure um the EIP repository is over here and that's dream /e IPS and the finalized specifications that etherium dis vm needs updating are all listed down here so the one we're going to work on right now is 150 cool but it's a little confusing because sometimes a IPS are in issues this was the original one and we're trying to get them consolidated so that the correct final specification is just in a file so you have to wade through the comments and the evolution of each specification perfect so the issues board is for seeing any context and evolution like discussion between core devs and to find the final spec for what you want to implement in our projects you're going to use this these markdown files in the Gehrke's folder yeah that's right great let's talk a bit about the homestead tests okay so currently the homestead tests are in a pull request right here and went with these poor requests merge this one and delegate call which drive you merge that one you see are you saying we passed all of the homestead tests so now that we have the branch we just drove npm install to install all the dependencies yep and when we run or what what commands you use to run the tests should be in the package space line yeah we're on NPM run test block chain great and the test suite that we're using is in etherium slash tests and specifically we're running the blockchain tests and the general Watkins has general state says yep and and the detection is here in that test our cross client in that they are run in all of the etherium clients so where you're right Lee this also we is a as the cross client consensus tests wait okay cool so once those node modules are in we're going to run the tests and we'll expect to have the changes that you merged in which means we'll get some test failures well we're going run the tests for eat 150 so got it as soon as this is done I'll show you how to change the for configuration okay so now we can now we can change the fork configuration from homestead which what this does is it looks at the test name each test name and matches with the end so it will only run the tests that end in homestead and we're going to update that to a point 50 so that we're going to be running eat 150 tests yep okay so now we've done that now we can run my tests and we should expect to see some sub failures because we're running a homestead compatible implementation on the 150 test cases yep so had we had we run the original homestead tests than we would have gotten 100% of the tests passing that's right like yep this is right here with all the homestead tests running you can see each test basis homestead right and so they all pass and in our case we're getting a failure because we're running on 8.50 and the reason why we need to show you these outputs as they're saved and like not really wait for them all to run is because the test suite the consensus test suite does take a couple of hours to run so we're just showing you how to get the test running and what expected outputs are before we move on to more dev environment setup so we have one failure now let's do this the easiest bit of a point 50 and just change the constants change the gas costs for a few out codes so balance is no 400px Tito copy s load to 5,000 and we three run the tests and we should hope to see some of the test case which were failing now passing and we do yep yep it would be the full up through the changes 300 failures yep go without the change in absolute guess we have about 1500 failures once we do the simple change of changing cause the opcodes we're down to 300 failures and when we finish with these last two changes should be down to well to zero failures perfect cool so yeah that about wraps it up for this video we've gone over how to run tests in the FD mgsv in project and how to find requirements for the APS you need to implement in a future video or if you hit us up on Gator we can explain how to setup the rest of your dev environment and how to do debugging and running traces on both the if your interests and the PI each area in the fire element Asian yep anything else you'd like to share yeah just we need help and so yeah hope to say some contributors joining us join us great thanks Casey thanks Daniel see
