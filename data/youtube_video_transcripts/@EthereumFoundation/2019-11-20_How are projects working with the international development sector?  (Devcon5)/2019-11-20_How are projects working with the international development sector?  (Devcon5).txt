[Applause] so if I never cross the Red Cross together we'd have this process of thinking about how to allow that cross to be more proactive as opposed to reactive and so when we think about the type of projects that we work on they're very much looking at where the worlds in the community years and what kind of funding gaps there are so if we look at today for humanitarian assistance about thirty eight billion dollar years how much money goes towards humanitarian assistance but it's still a thirty billion dollar gap so I we narrow that when we do it was thinking about allocation and you also think about new ways to kind of activate different pools of power and so in that regard we currently have a couple projects some of the birthday but a little deeper project that was announced and so we're looking at with blockchain perspective we also look at detachments potassium bonds are essentially an insurance product or we go out and raise thirty million dollars from the private sector and I'm just looking at the clock right now at this time and what 35 here it'll blow up okay the whole session oh so I will stop talking in ten seconds so we have insurance products we just basically insurance the atashi bond where we're sharing volcanoes we're also working on community currencies there's some of you may have heard earlier that you will be hearing about later community currencies essentially allows vulnerable communities around the world to create their own cryptocurrency and we fund that through our billion dollar and caps transfers and that essentially allows individuals to trade amongst themselves and then with other communities to sort of spur growth resiliency viability currently the project is worth grassroots genomics in and Nick who's here will talk a little bit loose info about 6000 people on this on the POE of sidechain I think about sending thousands actions and I think about 20 different currencies so marinate hi everyone my name is saundra and the pacific cash in light women's league for Oxfam Oxfam is a global NGO a nonprofit at present in over 90 countries we have several use-cases active across the organization and I am in charge of the work that focuses to leverage the capacities and blockchain technology to assist people in disaster preparedness and response so I guess I'm going to focus more on message than what we're actually doing and you can hear about that right after this it'll just stick around for us the message is really that one of Oxfam's key missions is to act as a broker and a convener connecting local to global we work across dozens of civil society organizations just in vallata where they globally that turns into tens of thousands of community-based organizations and civil society actors so in that way working more community facing but what that also means is that we have the capacity to collaborate and connect to field environments where love chain is still something that is unknown and working we're still very much disconnected which is the organization that was working on this particular box here they resisted broke the order to stay so Simo really focuses on financial inclusion for other nations around the world and this is a really fascinating aspect of the watching space because it's sort of one of those narratives raining inside this big white rectangle it was talking to us to equalize that system of masses yet somehow when we are in his afterwards and the reality is is that we have really seen a lot this materialized the reality is is that Bitcoin deeply you just read is to be wealth but it didn't really used to be love the way you wanted it to we're gonna want a very rich people and they're not equal necessarily on the first ones one of those here is that like a lot of organizations focusing on objects best don't really focus all the means and it results it's very easy to get trapped in a bubble of the Western world as long as we have here so that's what separate focuses on we actually developed a lot of our current or my work more later but one of the interesting experiences we've had over there if we made it over to let what we work with refugees we worked out that actually what we were building was virtually never really through your typing out which totally sucks is better for it Ilana one of these things are people who get a sort of big wind-up what is that bitcoin really to stop work from unions at all the second something is a good store of value a kind of ceases to be good that would be some transaction and what we've seen is entirely flat space the wall across the point without them less people wanted to train there because it was something to look forward and so I think this is kind of basis the conclusion that who actually really want to create like wouldn't back for communities we need something that isn't a great affordable currency and this is great quote by I actually read yourself which I love which is that a good medium of transfer needs to rush rotten luck paper rustling by and the Vepr I like Eva and even the size of birds that start like the eighteen hundreds so it's pretty recent and so what we work on this is context between currencies and stuff we're doing in country is really working out how to transform workforce of reserve like bit point into different forms of currency that are actually useful means to do rather than just grab credit pulling away I think so as part of the Democrats dollars program I think there's a recognition that there's a massive disconnect between people living in the rest of the world and people who have access to conferences like this so we're really in the business together of bridging and struggling that disconnect but also making a concerted effort to break those hierarchies so if you're interested in learning about how that's actually done then you should stick around Thanks customer Etsy is too much more but just to read up the size the interdisciplinary nature of what we do and the importance of understanding and clearly communicating why why ball chains are an interesting tool for formation by what they mean for our groups of people at the society and both controlling and governing and and data and value we will watch it enough to have some really incredible people in Trivium got beers their thoughts but just shout out to Sonoma said Bob she's out the back MIT University of Copenhagen KDM you just work at the main stage design and extend again that invitations with broader community around bringing what you have in your knowledge and expertise and coming humbly to to learn from people that I may be a little bit closer to liberal communities already doing things of scale or most people that would only sell sensitive little communities themselves to really reach you out of all of this watching for social benefit idea and they were better solutions that are more meaningful and helpful and enable that choice which is why the other side so thank you so much that next presentation to propel themselves and thank you for your attention feel free to approach anyone that you've seen or ask any questions I chicken to you I also encourage you to turn your attention to orderly growth which was just announced effort to respond to Libra and collaborate around baseless Libra mentions of in terms of booting and network which creates governance well people have actually once I would just play the decisions that I made so that's something else really interesting that backspace so thanks again and please [Applause]
