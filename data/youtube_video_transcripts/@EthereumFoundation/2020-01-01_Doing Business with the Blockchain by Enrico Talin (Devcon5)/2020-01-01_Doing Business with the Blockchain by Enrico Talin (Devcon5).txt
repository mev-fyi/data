[Applause] so my name is Enrico Kalina and for the last 25 years I've been basically doing one thing is try to convince companies to adopt different technologies to differ years is a long time and so the technology is actually changed over the time but there was always like my focus in my business life is always try to improve companies and try to make them adopt something that change from the vector in the way of doing business so basically today I'm going to talk about two things try to explain a CEO CFO CEO is like the top management or company okay what's blockchain and the second thing I'm trying to do is also explain this same kind of people what they can do with the little chain within the company now why this actually matters why this is important okay let's think about it our ecosystem the blockchain ecosystem on the hive of our the Tyrian world was like for example crypto kitties crypto kitties in the top ten it was like a hen like in the high days they are like 14,000 daily users okay so this is like we're talking about the the the project that made so much impact on Haiti really actually blocked it even for a little while for a week and also and there was like four thousand daily users okay companies usually have like millions of daily users so it's essential for us to think about that companies can be like not only one customer but they represent millions of millions of users so when we focus about blockchain adoption we of course we can all talk with each other and try to to do a project that goes directly to user but if you think about like going to the intermediate so you go to companies then you can like really be reach the adoption of the chain adoption in a very very fast way and more easier way okay but this is a now sounds good because you know I talk with a company this company has two million a user so let's move we have like two more media users to the etherium I can system or any other blockchain and echo system yeah now that's the that's not easy okay this is not easy because I've been doing this for the twenty five years and honestly this is like talking with the top management it's very very difficult okay so now I wrote a loop because I couldn't I try to really repeat repeat many times the same thing so at the end I said okay I'll route the booboo song it's gonna be easier and okay so let's see like this presentation I wants to like the way I usually present to CEO and the main thing to think about like the main consideration you have to take in account when you talk to CEO it's just they're like five years whoa baby exactly because they're super short attention span they absolutely do not understand anything you tell them and even if they pretend to listen they do not listen so you really need to use the same tricks with a five year old and being a father okay I exactly use the same techniques and then starting things going on so first of all you have to make them excited because if you like start like telling the story and you just like it's a story about business say ah okay yeah yeah sure like thinking about other things okay so you have to put this into context the suit you have to make it really excited for them and what is the best thing it's called like exclusion okay so I know it's suspect but it's actually the best way to make them interested so say that okay now why we're talking about the blockchain why because they've changed something that happens once every 10 years now just maybe dead you get the man attention you say what do you mean yeah you know in the 70s we have the mainframes that completely changed the way the accounting was done and then we had to perceive the completely disrupted the way the mainframe was used and then we have the internet they completely disrupted the way that you see and then there is social and then we have the mobile and you know what what's going to be next for the next ten years it's going to be the block chaining so you know what you absolutely need to take account of the pill change why not because you know when this a new technology comes along you can be either the streamer owner or your leg gonna be part of the road because other companies will gonna roll you down and make you have really flat so now we got the CEO of tensions because they say wow I don't want to be like part of the road I want to be the steamroller I want to be the one in charge we're talking about people there are like leaders okay I want to do this now once we set the correct like just position of what the blockchain is that we need to what is of the chain so that's probably a lot of people who's what sort of chain but here that's not like it for a CEO it's not easier so we talked about the centralized trust and we use a lot of images because the only way to explain to them it's not like the words that don't make any sense to see you so the thing is you have to show them absolutely a lot of pictures so we talked about a situation in multiple and distribute them we talk about we give them like a little bit of background so just like this guy named Satoshi and they Bitcoin they designed another guy Kofi tally it is like this - group 2.0 kind of a thing okay and then I chain 3.0 it's gonna be all about the inter probabilities when I because most Orkut often of course they do an extra credit and we don't use the two you see here it's blockchain 3.0 we don't put it in 2.0 because perhaps confused and so next generation things like that and we talked about like the environment friendly things like that so things that you don't really go never go technical never use a technical terms if you ever use a technical term always put a picture sensors which are like it's public they will use permissionless and permission it this really scare people because the information up so you say public you say private which is basically not about chaining or is that like to reinforce the fact okay and they like a hybrid you know you can have like some sort of doing things like that and then make we go to what can a company put your chain now like they really get excited this is a cool technology let's see what's going on and then we say okay let's start with the needs because everywhere I see in this room and others from a lot of people are trying to make solution in search of a problem that's not the way you should build things first find the problem first and then build the solution that's the other way around other why is it gonna be so difficult the best thing in marketing is not like try to create something try to sell it the best rule in marketing 25 years of experience do something that people want and they will just buy it you don't have even to market because the essence of marketing is not doing marketing it's just like doing people want and give it to them that's it deliver why they wanted it's so easy please do it please so let's start with the needs I'm gonna be super faster okay and and that's it [Applause] you
