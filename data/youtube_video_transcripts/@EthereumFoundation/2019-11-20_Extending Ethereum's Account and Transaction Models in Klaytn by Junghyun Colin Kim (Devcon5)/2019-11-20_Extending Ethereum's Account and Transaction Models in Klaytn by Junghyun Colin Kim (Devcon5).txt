[Applause] my name is jangan kau kini and they'll be the same plentiful interest in this presentation I'll talk about how we extended the history of soccer and tension bonus infinity okay October 1st is about Twiggy's police' content platform built by graphics a crab legs with clutches of material which is Korea's largest mobile platform I thought Augustana vertical service and this is wrong messenger service in South Korea it has more than 96% of user penetration so this is therapy services the program and an finish from from coffee theory on so this is if they embraced the project we launched lately until this year as you can see on the left hand side v is an open source project so we can check out a source code with BL Sokka Katara and we can get some competitions about Clinton we are wasting our time we are to support enterprise rail services as a coach and platform the dispersion feature talk about biology so to summarize of limitations first and foremost one is a little cranky now in fatal keep air in Athenian the three male stays to turn so if you click on the key pair it means you create a dream account so what if you're a perky excellent on what you can do these to create another account but we interest more additional problems so you should tell the address to your friend to make sure they're toast your friend to the same but with their to the old madness in any shop you should transfer your necessity all the nurses to to a new notice if you use any disinterest applications if you goes to expose your credit here accidentally Mustang game you should follow this process to me this is very inconvenient and unexpected pleasure experiences let's compare to the pickle car if you click on if your email address there's a bank account number also technically different private key as the password of your paper found but if you expose your password what do you need to do these are just change your password use only two three thank you pal so this limiter practically is a little imitation the second thing is legal artistic movements if you confuse your account security you should you can use our participants but one interview you cannot use vertice economically understand you should create what you see it's not country and you should know how to use so this way this is very inconvenient so we should be very if we have brother see my husband and third one is in terms of something find information for our consent traditions so it is very hard to extend deformities and first one is you should there's no attention time so you should that there's some necessary field should be included in the tradition presenter think of a parrot iceberg if you just rebellion listen to some ether to your friends you don't need to set party appeal but it should be always because there's a silver finish the floor and there's no affiliate fee generation mechanism affiliation means there are we can gain recently instead of a standard there's no such thing is implemented on a do so I say think about these are senior engineers first ones what if you as a user should pay whenever you trees this is very uncommon but one older decentralized application requires you to paste on 22nd is it one of you as a software first if a developer want to give users free trial period this is very common service our synthesis but it is not possible so you feel provided English mechanism of the plant another those seniors will be solved very easily let's talk about what we are designing the features of theta first we are providing a friend key to do this we can change your friend key if you expose bureaucratically once then you can use your account number continuously and also we stop we're about to finally kill the planet understood you don't need to know how to create how to use a smart country order for the Sigma cancer and also be pounded out there are several doors in a knock loud when a desire is account model so we can assign separately you can assign keys to each other and you can comfort to your fans more specifically and we talked about change the model you can really provide thirty potential types so there we can easily extend any features of the change type or so you can ignore some unnecessary periods and also we provide ventilation a custom of trenchant woman but want in our society that we preserve community will be thin which means it's in traditions and they still on Satan without and so for those extinctions we use some techniques first on his interest time so we designed three the structures account of a key transition there are structures we have tried information and we used public appearances so in code athina at first then the movie data with simply us again we find information so when we think of this minute about this matter of the structure the first equal time information and then mythical was some game face on the file information so let's talk about a more an interpreters a single account type here so there's no flight information and VM we can see we have four finish here but history has it distinguishes two types smart culture becomes an Estonian doctrines or a domain but as of September of this year we found more than 8% of the thermal transfer awaits in eh there's no information occurred for a routine voltage so for anyways these are search warrant so to evoke this kind of surge over here we design a model in the top five so we have to contrast here and you can see the new way there's no routine called nest build so you can just search tossed in additionally we have a key field which is here and this account key field also have five information so he field can be configured one of those four times let's get last is what's Malaya III thought we said no key this is provided for our comparative it with you and also consent our pollen kita kita in this case traditions of discipline can decide by dr. McKee that first must is apology to can change any his artists too perfect so we provide participant another plan a misstep so we can say multiple public his into discreetly to respond to comedies workers keys we have found three doors first one is transition the second one for cantata and the last one he pay his for a tradition historic traditional role are used to whisper on very desperate ethically and smart cuts of execution and his pearly account of interest is to update our assumption and the last one peeping a role is used to change a fee-only so if we have only kissed or at least even keep in your role and you just realize that you can pay transfer only if you have chest for a value and you need to know that you have a kiss for 21 let's talk about a third to the accountant water interview doesn't have tight information changement changement but intense three functions their transfer is mathematically plain there's not much execution interpreting transaction be interest or war feelers from sonia sender address this is a recovered to attitude change repaired key so we should explicitly specify the standard errors that we provide but see mechanism the sender's features can add body procedures and also be payer addressed and we pay interest are related to finish McMaster but they are not occurred for water change types which is that shows the theorem which interpretation mechanism as you can see we can get our signatures from the transition and then take the apology from the sketcher and we can get the progress from the policy but in Clayton we are change it accountant organization motor we should some work attested to verify the tradition so for the determines winter shots we can use the same mechanism but for other newly introduced engine clanks we can follow the but against time so it is a feature from the transition and we can get a public key of a switch so we can get funky that's time and we can get account key from the sender members of the transition so we get to public keys and if you compare both the keys if they match then you can say here this is very citation if they are not mentioned and can say that the tradition is in them dispatcher was two examples of our generation ties left on them for grabs on shows are very inspiring right pontius easily will transfer the transports petition was interrogation mechanism so it was not have to have he player Atlas NP players Rangers so when we still public transport transition to therapy really charged by asserted to sender Everest and the amount of tokens will be transferred from sender address to the subpoena and many skilled affinity benefits per the attention fee will be charged to the people and the amount of tokens will be transferred from the sender endless to disappear and distractions some of our Clinton changing tribes settled from shows page refreshes types which has no affiliation both conscious the delegation changing types which provides middle-aged attachment and issue loss use different functionalities first on is the explanation this is provide for comparative so whole internal transitions will be bent to his worst finish and those functions are also provided in internal thought we separate attention spice and we also have two functions such as of Qaddafi and so on so if you're not work if you're interested in the origin price we can find more informations in our documentation site let's talk about provenance in this chart on the next date these issues Bogey's built-in super smart content deploying and smart object excision and the y-axis shows a little team exhibition fight over legacy as you can see our new patient ID performs well slightly slower than the legacy image after conviction less than 10% this is due to the doubling coding and rehabilitation but we have more benefits from something is visibility Esmond which means we provide change of Bernanke and bhakti see my pencil and reversed key so today Washburn visuality ESMA and due to the time information we can Hospital on disparities so if we had more planks for functions required in the future we can easily implement those family crest without curry in the airsoft world and we also got our search position as a family data data we as of September this year we found that there are 75 billion users billion neurons in this area so if we have five information internet then we get one type of red purple advance this case are sent five megabytes but we can reduce 64 bytes for us as you can see Weald routine routine cottage for those are fixed up Pittsburgh parts if we assume that US states of a percent of total income then we can reduce 3.8 device rosters post it is obvious we can get massive masters position so let's summarize my presentation we found several solid limitations such as a little panicky and the robot ASIMO has menthol and we find solutions by extending across modern and traditional more also to to change of this and mothers we should change the treatment Fishman with chief our sleds be overhead compared to Eternity but we get trailer there's essentially the illusion of mass delusion but we can get more penalties intro is adenosine extensibility and we also reduce search cost so I hope that this distinction at least do motors can be applicable to other different approaches for sale staff okay we always welcome to contribute our open source project waiting as you can see over the kitchen table our sauce going to it aside and cannot find some more information about Clinton in the documentation site and you can see the right hand side there's a cure for what is what the user should wear to a fish dip in the last slide you can find my email address to film any more questions and please ask me yes mister even madness this is another thing I'll talk about is that there's some 20 stickers and pegs just in front of the entry you can be interesting in that you can take some medication [Applause]
