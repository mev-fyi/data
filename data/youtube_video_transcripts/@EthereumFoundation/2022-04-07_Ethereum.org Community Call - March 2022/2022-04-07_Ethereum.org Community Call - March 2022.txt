hello everyone thanks for joining and welcome to the march ethereum.org community call i've shared the agenda for today's call on the chat feel free to check out and follow along in summary jakub and nuno will go through what they've been working on in their first months in terms of design luca will give an update on the translations program carl and we'll talk a little bit about our awesome new layer 2 page and we've got a pull-up going on as well we've got a guest speaker colfax who will talk a little bit about his latest project sam is going to talk about our plans for q2 and a couple of more miscellaneous items um before all that we have nico from the ethereum.org team joining the call for the first time today so nika i'll just give you a minute to introduce yourself nico are you efforts here we can maybe look back to that um so yeah in terms of the agenda um first up we've got yaakov who will be sharing an update on their first 30 days um for product design i'll stop sharing my screen just now and i'll let you take the floor hello everyone i'm nono nice to see you all again um i will share my screen we have like four slides just go through a little bit what has been the last month for us our first month working uh in the team [Music] so uh hello everyone so uh we will start with uh the idea to give a quick one month update from the newly designed team meeting jacob jacob are you there yes i'm here listening hello everybody so uh first and foremost uh super super awesome to join the team it's been a wonderful uh and really productive first month uh just thank you a big big shout out to the team and to the community we have some conversations over discord around design and we're starting to build a more design designish approach uh for the politium.org so it's been really fun first month and then um a quick update of what we've put out there with the help that we've already been hands on uh the l2 page uh it was an ongoing process that we've helped karwyn will uh talk more about that later today but it was our first as a design team within the team uh to put some page out there and this taking uh it's the one that it's been taking a lot of our time uh and we've asked for your help so uh jacob do you wanna go through a little bit what has been going on yes sure so now as you can see nuno is sharing our figma file and for this particular redesign of stacking page we already had ideas what the new content should be but in the spirit of open opening up our process and design and our plans we also decided to engage more with the community before we actually release the page out and after we had some initial drafts and some um plan how the website the page should probably look we decided to share these mock-ups with the community here on discord and in the kidhop issue and so anyone who wants to see you could you can go to the epics discord channel this one is specifically staking and here we were sharing links to this for people to actually give us feedback on what the content is on the general structure of the page if it makes sense how the [Music] layout is prepared and as you can see each of these little bubbles represented feedback from some of you and we had quite nice discussions with any of you through this sharing of the prototype which helped which really helped us greatly to push the designs and content further and helped us validate our ideas a little bit before we actually release the page so um right now i'm showing like the first was like um like jacob said a wide framing kind of approach just to get some feedback on the contents more content-based approach and see what what's missing what's going on and then i i will show you the figma file it's a messy file as you can see but it's been a super collaborative uh within the team work and just showing uh the final uh images for that uh are being developed uh and you can see the on the pr there's a url to uh to see on the browser it's almost done but all those details that we've put in like the icons like um understanding the flow of the page with these call to actions or we've discussed which on the design wise should it be full color uh go through the the different sticking options that we are putting out there there's a lot of different uh decisions that we've made here and now we will ask like a second of opinions uh next week with with the page um up and running on codes but overall it was a really fun process and uh it's been really good uh to collaborate with everyone either the team or the community so thank you so much for for your help the ones that helped um [Music] so next uh jacob do you wanna take it yeah so first of all the way the process you just saw we are hoping to do this more often on basically any new page or redesign so this was like a pilot version but it had i think quite good feedback and so we want to start doing this more and maybe over time we will start asking questions and for feedback even earlier in the process so that's that's all about preparing to release a new redesign and this is about actually uh so what happens after the page is released uh you may know that on some of the sub pages on ethereum.org currently we have already this widget asking you whether the page is satisfactory in terms of its content and this is not everywhere right now but we are hope we are uh hoping to get some sort of feedback loop on every page we have out there to gather some insights whether the contents that we put out are actually and in the future we will be asking for more feedback this way so that anyone who is interested can give us some valuable input on how the pages should be changed for example and this is going to be one of the main focus for the next quarter at least try to get as much data as we can but the second focus uh will be uh starting a new process that we call it open source design uh this process uh we are starting to put out there some some issues on github start to ask for some help uh in the community but we'll we will open it to a lot of different things uh we just need to create the framework to do so we'll be using figma has the basis for design system discord to talk with you to put out call to actions and to have some discussions uh and to focus discussions on the issues or on the things to improve on ideas we will use github the combination of the three of them will be the the way that we think could work at least in principle it worked we haven't tried it out so we will focus on this as well for the next quarter and we are super excited to open the process to um to everyone to help us build a better design wise uh user journey ux ui whatever you call it it will be a lot better experience using the ethereum.org and that being said um it's all that we have for now uh thank you so much for listening thank you very much joshua what's your call again awesome yeah really exciting stuff um as jacob noted so if you're interested on collaborating with us on any of this then our design channel is open to you and a lot more to come on that very soon hopefully uh next up we've got luca who's just going to give us an update on the translation program and some things are happening with that everyone i'm gonna give you some quick updates on the recent developments in the ethereum.org translation program to start i'd like to call out the fact that non-english page views in comparison to english page views on the website seem to hit a record high every month last month we had 456 000 views on translated pages which represents 18 of all page views um a new record statistics like this are good confirmation of the effort that our contributors put into translating the website into many different languages we believe that making educational content on ethereum.org available to everyone is important and the fact that people seem to want to read this content in their native language is encouraging thank you to all the contributors to the translation program for helping us achieve this i'm sharing chart of unique page views by language other than english where you can see the progress that non-english page views are making basically this chart is growing all the time moving on we have recently started translating key posts from the ethereum foundation blog to other languages as well sorry about that specifically we have translated the eth2renaming blog post which goes into detail on why we have moved away from eth2 terminology on the website this was translated into 10 languages which we've chosen based on the number of speakers and number of visits to translated pages into these languages on the website the second blog post we have translated is the kilnmerge testnet announcement post which was published when the kiln test net launched in preparation for the merge this was translated into 15 languages with the hope of getting as many eyes on it as possible to help with testing the merge you can check out these and other blog posts on the blog links are available in the community call doc um also posting them in the community called chat if anyone wants to check these out and read through them yourselves in your native language perhaps next up we have finished updating and cleaning up the ethereum.org the glossary in our crowding project thanks to everyone who added input to the turn base it was incredibly valuable when updating the glossary if you're helping us translate the website you can use the glossary to find descriptions and establish translations for key terms in the project while this update is done we are still looking to further improve the glossary so if you would like to help out with this the spreadsheet is still available feel free to add some terms that you think should be included in the glossary or any established translations here um this was basically the first update of the glossary but we are definitely looking to clean it up even further posting a link to this spreadsheet as well if you want to add some input and finally also wanted to quickly mention the tags links and code snippets that appear throughout the project in crowden which you can see in this segment for example these tags are often the source of confusion for translators who sometimes change or omit them this leads to broken tags and links that need to be fixed for more information on how to differentiate between tags and how to handle them we've added a section about this to the ethereum.org translators guide which is available on the website also posting a link to this in the chat if you want to read up on how to deal with tags in translations in short tags should always be copied directly from the source which can be done in several ways you can copy and paste them which is probably not the best option even though it's fast and easy you can copy the source and translate everything around the tags or you can click on them and they will automatically be copied to the target text so fairly simple to keep this these tags the same as the source and um yeah basically these should always be unchanged and copied straight from the source as always if anything is unclear feel free to reach out to us in the translate channel on crowdin or send me a dm that should be it for the translation program updates thanks again for all the contributors and if you are bilingual and want to get involved with the translation program reach out to us either on discord um we have this translate channel or you can simply join the project in crowding linking to the project in the community called chat and then that is it for me thanks everyone great thank you the the number of non-english pages is really great to see and also good to see the ethereum foundation blog post being made more accessible for non-english speakers as well next up we've got corwin who's going to talk a little bit about our newest page on layer twos hey guys uh can you see the page okay just want to double check i shared right and i guess hear me for that matter um yeah looks looks good to me all right cool thanks um yes so last community call we highlighted that we were working on a um layer two page and this community call we get to announce that we've delivered it so this is a layer two page that we've been working on for quarter one um basically what we were looking to accomplish with it was a beginner to intermediate level kind of overview of what layer twos are um and how they work and so if we look through the page um we'll like navigate through it we'll see up front some stats on there too so we can see like what an average transfers fee is how much is locked into uh layer two so we can get some like really quick high level stats on what's going on in the layer two ecosystem and we'll briefly like describe what's going on uh or what a layer two is sorry um but then to do that we need to like understand what a layer 1 is so we define what the layer 1 looks like then we talk about like why do we need layer 2 what it means for scalability some of the benefits that layer 2 brings to the ecosystem and users then we talk a bit about how layer two roll-ups will work or how layer two works and specifically with roll-ups um the two different kinds being optimistic and zero knowledge and we have a little bit of disclaimer on doing your own research uh with this we link out to l2 beats risk page so it has a really good matrix to go to where it talks about different risks for the different projects so definitely recommend looking at this first before onboarding into any layer twos next we look at a couple of uh the layer two projects that are in the ecosystem we have both generalized layer twos meaning that like smart contracts are deployed onto these they operate um similar to the layer one in the sense of applications that can be deployed onto them and with that we link up to some bridges and if they have available ecosystem portals which like shows what projects have been deployed in that ecosystem for example then we also highlight some application specific layer twos these are mainly zk roll up ones but what they are is just like very tailored uh rollups to do a specific um thing so like dydx for example is just for exchanges um hermes which isn't on this page is like just for payments so uh the really application specific layer twos but nonetheless there are layer two for this page uh as well we look at like noting what the difference between a layer two and a side chain validium alternative blockchain uh is so that mainly being layer two has to inherit the data availability and security from ethereum so in this case like uh polygon pos people will talk about quite often we wouldn't consider that a layer two because it has its own consensus it has its own uh data availability you can just bridge assets over to it so it wouldn't really be classified as a layer two however polygon is working on layer two solutions and we've heard feedback from the community around this so um i guess with this in mind i'll quickly switch over to highlight we have a um suggest a layer to listing policy for uh layer two projects so if there's any layer two projects that you feel we've missed um please take a look at uh suggested in layer two through this uh github issue template we'll ask for information around the project so if you just provide us information and it meets the criteria we'll take a look at it and try and get it onto this page here um one of the main things that we note is it has to like be on l2b um so if you like there's a layer two you guys are looking at adding or suggesting and it's not highlighted on that page would definitely recommend going to l2b before uh filling out that form um next on the page we go into like how to get on to a layer two so there's two different ways that a user would get on to a layer two so they would either have funds in their wallet and they're looking to bridge over so for that we like any of these layer twos that are above here um we list in this like bridging component so if you select one we'll show you which wallets that bridge supports and then you can click over and go directly to that bridge to bridge your assets over from maintenance the other option is you have funds on an exchange and some exchanges are supporting direct deposits and withdrawals to layer two instead of having to go on to mainnet and so with that we did a little bit of research and looks to highlight what what exchanges do support this so you'll only notice exchanges in this drop down at the moment that um do support deposit and withdrawals and with that will also um when you select an exchange we'll list like what l2s um that have been announced so far that are supported for deposits and withdrawals for those exchanges and kind of the last thing um we just have some information that would be helpful for for users looking to navigate this landscape so more information side is like l2b great resource for getting information on the various l2s l2 fees is really good at just getting a quick glimpse of what the current fee would be when you're using a specific layer too and we actually use a similar api at the top to like get that average um average cost to transfer each so um we're pulling from the same resources l2 fees but theirs is more broken down um and then chain list is a really easy way for you to use if your wallet supports importing rpcs uh it's a really easy way to just go and connect to a network um without having to do a bunch of like manual inputting of the the chain id and the block explorer and all that stuff so it's just a really easy resource to go to and just connect to a layer in this case like a layer two network we're also highlighting some wallet managers that help give you a holistic view of your assets across all networks so uh wallet managers like zapper xerion and bank let you see assets on mainnet and arbitram and optimism and dksync it'll just like cover all of your uh networks that your assets might be on um and it just makes it easier to track where where you are in this environment and we have a few frequently asked questions and uh for the reading section as well um but yeah really proud of this page really happy that we got like a whole our whole team working on it we talked to layer two projects in the space um really happy with how this page turned out but definitely would appreciate any feedback that you guys have to give i feel like this page can still be improved upon but as a version one very proud of this page that we shipped and with that i'll pass it back to josh awesome thanks again carmen uh yeah the page looks awesome to echo corwin if anyone has any thoughts or any feedback please feel free to share them in our layer to the channel under the epics category or you can send zdm that's more your thing and so i'll start showing my screen again make sure everyone can see that yeah so next up collapse um you'll need a phone or qr scanner for this here where are the instructions for claiming the but unfortunately the poet bot that we use has freaked out a little bit and isn't working properly um but we found an alternative so here is a qr code that you can scan um i'll leave this up for a minute or two just to let everyone scan and i guess when i stop sharing my screen i can also share the direct link to this in the community called chat you can see the numbers of people claiming on jumping up okay you should all be pretty good at claiming pull-ups by now so i think that's been long enough um as i said i'll post the link to the qr itself in the community call chat um but that will be gone and deleted after the call as well so i'll stop showing my screen now um next up we're going to have colfax and as a guest speaker for us who's going to be talking a little bit more about perhaps um not for this call specifically but related to his latest project and so colfaxel stop streaming and i'll let you take it away no problem thanks to intro hey hey everybody um i so i come from uh a project that i'm working on called gitpo app so speaking of poe apps what we're doing with gitpo app is we're actually rewarding poe apps to open source software contributors so i'm going to share my screen real quick and show you guys a few different things one second sweet everyone can see the gitpo app joshua can you see the github uh homepage yeah you'll see your twitter tweet so yeah as i mentioned what we're building with gitpo up is essentially an integration of poep minting into github so you can admit co-apps to your open source contributors based on um either pull requests or eventually maybe like issues and other contributions like that in the future um for those of you not familiar i imagine most you familiar with poe app but briefly it stands for proof of attendance protocol and it's basically an nft that represents an action that you've taken and what we're doing is we're using po-apps to represent contributions to open source software um a cute little diagram here that one of our designers made which i uh which i really love um something that i that is very exciting to share with you guys is actually the ethereum dot org community and the fact that you guys actually do give out co-apps for contributions your web page was actually one of the ideas for turning that into a platform and with a number of other tools around it um so we're very excited to be launching we're actually launching this platform tomorrow we have been in progress uh for quite some time now on it and it's just super exciting um so speaking of launch uh so we posted uh our launch plan about a week and a half ago uh you can find that um either on medium or on twitter we're actually at gitpo app at g-i-t-p-o-a-p and i'll just go through our launch plan a little bit with you guys um so for this it's fun to issue co-apps to contributors and share sort of this like immutable recognition um on top of that like on its own that's exciting but on top of that what we see is that this this bringing the record of contribution on chain can actually enable a lot of other future applications downstream so one you'll actually be able to like have sort of like a resume on chain so you can build up sort of your poep collection to essentially tell a story about what contributions you've made and another cool idea that we have in the future is if we wanted to say fund a project in the future and we wanted to um yeah fund a project essentially if we have this on-chain record or contribution through po-app we know exactly who we need to fund so we're working on different tools like that in the future that are going to be built on top of get po-app for now we're focused on getting these pops into the hands of people and uh we actually have a cool little feature that we haven't launched yet it's coming out tomorrow but i'll show you guys a couple leaked designs um let me post this link actually in the community called channel if any you guys want to take a look um and then keep an eye out uh on our twitter for an official launch announcement tomorrow we don't know exactly what time it's going to happen um the reason why i'm excited to be here with you guys is for our launch we're going to be giving poeps out to the contributors of about 15 different projects open source projects central to the ethereum ecosystem and of course ethereum.org is in this list so we are going to be minting poe apps to anybody who contributed at least one pull request that got merged into the repo uh for any year the project has been alive so going back all the way into history so ethereum.org started this project started in 2019 so we're going to actually issue these historical annual contributor pro-apps i understand many of you probably already got a poep but we're going to be issuing another one that comes from gitpo app that'll be memorializing your contribution um so oh i don't want to show you that yet i'll show you in a second so i'm gonna i don't have the uh actual app prepared to demo to you guys although you'll be able to use it tomorrow but i'll show you guys uh this is our figma designs for how it's gonna work and i want to there's a few tweaks that we made and then all of this text in here is also just dummy text so like uh don't read anything into anything you see here but this is the basics of the app and since uh you guys invited me here i wanted to sort of leak these designs to you a little bit so this is going to be our home page by the way uh i'm talking quite a lot if anybody has any questions feel free to just pop into the chat or just interrupt me um so this is going to be our home page some general statistics on like who's uh who's been claiming most claim poe apps last week most honor contributors kind of like a leaderboard recently added projects we're actually not launching with this component but it'll be there soon and then you can suggest projects here as i mentioned at the beginning we are only launching with these 15 but we want to onboard uh many many more projects my goal is i think to onboard like about 500 or so projects in the next six months um so if you have any other projects that you guys are contributing to that you want to issue co-apps for sorry mid co apps the contributors for uh please reach out to me we also have a form uh that you can do get popped io or pound suggest i'll drop this into the chat thank you kev sir thank you uh paul joshua everyone thanks for complaining designs i wish i could take credit for him uh but it's an awesome design firm called deep work that helped us with these um as you can see in the top right so andre is amazing love that guy uh in the top right you can connect your wallet so you might be asking yourself well like how do you find out the address of the people that are on github in the top right you connect your wallet and then you also can log into your github account via oauth um and this way you can create kind of like a fleeting connection between your accounts and when you click this it'll actually turn into a button that will allow you to mint your po-apps because the po-apps are based on your github history and then this way you're connecting it to your wallet um we'll have a guide about that that we're going to be posting tomorrow as well uh gitpo app will be a devconnect we're actually we're minting pro-apps for anybody who contributes in the east faker hackathon on the 21st and yes there will be swag uh oh man my camera's not on we have some pretty cool patches too uh so i'll i'll share those with you at dev connect come and find me this is the the po page so like basically this would be ethereum.org contributor um and then the list of holders uh i don't wanna take too much more time so i'm gonna zoom ahead this is your digital profile or digital resume um again this is sort of the mock-up design we aren't launching with this top component yet but this is super alpha leak we're going to have this sort of configurable art piece that you can do behind your profile uh but not yet um right now we have the ability to show your git pop collection as well as all of the rest of your pro-apps and then this the the contrast is not great right here but there's a little heart here that you can use to boost up uh some poe apps to be featured and it gives you some sort of information about the contributions you've been making um and then for claiming poeps we have a simple claiming modal that when you see here if you click up here view and claim three co-apps you can claim them right here on the site so that is like a high-level overview of what we're building what we're launching with tomorrow again we haven't really shared these designs with everybody so i'm super excited to share them with you and that uh that everybody is giving some positive feedback very excited to support the athena.org community um and you guys are amazing and i bet you guys are wondering wow like this is so cool i wonder what the ethereum.org poep design is well here you go this is actually one of my favorite designs uh it's by this designer martina and um this is the founding year so 2019 and then we have a year uh the same design but different uh year of course for each year and so depending on what years you contributed you'll get a version of this poep and we'll be doing ongoing issuance throughout the rest of 2022 and then of course going forward uh we're not sure if it's gonna happen live so like immediately when you get your merge pr or if it's gonna like take a little while we're working on the technical side of that but we'll share that with you guys um yeah this is the theme.org and then the last thing i want to mention to you guys is launch is happening tomorrow but this saturday so i guess three days from now um we are having a large party call and we i don't know if you guys have ever done a poep art painting party but basically what it is it's kind of like reddit uh our place uh where you can do this like pixelated pixel by pixel drawing and your ability to place pixels is actually dependent upon your po app holdings so you can place a pixel only if you have the right poep and the more poe apps you have that are in the the selected group of po apps the faster you can paint pixels and so i see i think joshua posted yeah a link to this i highly encourage you guys to join um it's going to be live streamed on youtube the links and everything are in this post and we'll give you instructions for how to paint and everything um on saturday and another the last thing is if you guys are super interested um let me just zoom over there right now on the get poep discord server we've actually create so you can the way that these these parties normally unfold is uh people create these painting guilds and they work together because it's very hard to draw like a whole painting on your own and so you can see here we actually created an ethereum.org guild um oh nice paul joshua what you want to recruit which we draw so yeah if you guys want pop on over to the github discord server um which is gitpo app.io slash here let me just add this into the chat um um joshua is it cool if i post the gitpo discord like oh amazing you already did already thank you so you can swing on over there and then find the dot org guild and then i encourage you guys to collaborate on a drawing you can do anything you want uh really maybe something cool related to ethereum.org would be uh would be fun um but yeah so that's all i've got for you guys super excited to drop co-ops to all these contributors not only to ethereum.org but just generally to open source and yeah thanks for welcoming me on to the call today awesome thanks go fax really exciting stuff uh if you're a historical contributor to ephediam.org or any get up project please check out get pull up and get your app um she's definitely trying to cater some community members on this and organize a painting party maybe we can talk a bit more about that after the call and last but not least we've got sam who's going to talk a little bit about our q2 plans some nike josh thanks for the chat cool facts i'm pretty fired up to get my get pull up um let me hear my screen okay so not too much to share on my screen mostly just gonna walk through my notes in this community call doc that josh shared earlier what i want to chat about today is ethereum.org team roadmap quick reminder this is just the roadmap for ethereum.org our team um not the actual roadmap for ethereum the protocol um or anything on that large of a scale just for the website itself um so quick overview on just like our team's roadmap process and quick reminder on our team we now have nine full-time contributors um who i guess you could say is like the core team who helps you know facilitate these calls who help maintain the discord and the actual ethereum.org github but obviously the ethereum.org team is much larger than that right like thousands of translators hundreds of code and content contributors make all this stuff possible so thank you all for helping to contribute that so in terms of like how we do road mapping um at least for now this is definitely an iterative process and encourage feedback on it but at least for now what our core team tries to do is essentially on a quarterly basis so every three months do some planning and publish an outline on the stuff we're looking to tackle so i linked to some examples just to uh kind of highlight the fact uh here's a quick look at oh probably can't see my other screen um feel free to follow that link um if you're interested or i should probably just figure out how to do that oh boy um i've shared the q1 product map in the chat cool i'll just stick with this doc for now but i've included links if you guys are curious basically we outline one high-level overview github issue that maps out a brief summary of all the initiatives we're trying to do um you might ask like how we try to identify this issue these issues how do we pick one initiative over the other um i'd say like in short it's primarily based off feedback from the community um so i'd say like we use a mix of just like internal subjective opinions internal insights from say quantitative metrics um i guess a like a quick obvious example going down to below what we've identified as like focusing on some redesigns and revamp to our wallet resources one example of that is like we can see from our ethereum.org traffic data that those wallet pages we've created about like two years ago now they drive over 10 of all site page views so from the hundreds of pages on the website we know those two pages talking about wallets helping people find and compare ethereum wallets are like a very high engagement high area of interest on the website um and we also know intuitively right like for anyone onboarding into ethereum like you need an ethereum wallet that is a huge pathway and like a huge onboarding step for anyone involved um so kind of makes sense that that's an area we want to prioritize um outside of that again we rely on a lot of feedback from the community so people creating issues on github people interacting with us on twitter people asking questions in our discord a lot of what we do is reacting to hey there's a lot of people who are surfacing this issue or this lack of educational content that's out there maybe we're in a unique position to try to hop in and solve that um so yeah quick summary on just like how we try to ultimately pick which initiatives to work on um so we try to publish this overview roadmap issue for every three months um in part that's to you know hold ourselves accountable um but primarily that's to also like foster engagement right like we want feedback from you on if we're focusing on the right things and we also want input from you like if you want to get involved right like if you are an expert on ethereum staking and you want to give input on how those resources should be designed what content we should include what products should be included like that's why we do this out in the open so that we can enable folks like you to get involved so taking that specific staking example we try to create and we'll be going forward specific github issues for each epic initiative itself so i link to that staking page example where we go into a little more detail and just use that as a primary place to to track progress we also create a discord channel for each of these major epics just for more you know fluid discussion um make it a little more casual so folks aren't intimidated to you know post a really well thought out comment in github um maybe they can just hop in ask questions get involved in that front so if you guys are interested in getting involved with a particular initiative i think you know the combination of github and discord i would definitely recommend as as places to start on that front um so high level overview of our process for creating road maps um as you folks are probably aware it is now april um so it is so it is q2 in in the biz lingo um so we are currently in the process of mapping out our our roadmap for the next next three months um short story is that it's still in progress we still haven't finalized that so stay tuned probably next week i'll be posting a github issue and sharing that around so looking forward to your input on that but to give you a few teasers on the stuff we'll be working on um some of this stuff is you know carried over from initiatives we wanted to get to in q1 um but in part because we didn't really have the design resources on hand that we do now um we basically pushed push these things about a back a bit but just to touch on some of these things recently um staking page revamp you know since we initially launched our staking page when um you know the beacon chain first launch and staking actually became possible really the only option was as a solo staker um so a lot of the content was focused on that and pushing people to the staking launch pad um since then a whole bunch of different options include pooled staking staking as a service um even within the solo staking space you know more tools to make that more accessible and easier for people to do there's just been an explosion of like resources and products and tools and projects in that space so we're very close should be launching some updated pages around that next week to help users navigate that landscape um but really exciting to see and i think just goes to show it really is a full-time job to keep up with all the evolutions and like progress across the ethereum ecosystem in a similar fashion um the wallet resources we have on the site you know i mentioned those two pages we have on just like learning what a wallet is what does it do why does it matter and a page to help people find and compare wallets um you know of the million to two million visits we get on ethereum.org any given month you know over 10 percent of page views are revolve around wallets um since we created those pages well over two years ago the wallet landscape has also very much changed you know we've gone from listing about like five wallets to over 40 now i think um and the features that people care about about ethereum wallets have certainly changed right like you know different devices um different features they support you know layer two support wasn't wasn't a thing back when we first launched this page so thinking through what are better ways to kind of display and compare all these different products now that there are so many great options out there as well as the features that uh we display and allow folks to compare on will certainly be a focus um learn page redesign um was gonna show my screen but yeah if you do go to ethereum.org um you may notice that the learn kind of section of the site is a bit overwhelming um mostly good news because over time with a bunch of content contributors like many yourselves helping create pages and resources for us like we we now just have a ton of content on ethereum.org hundreds of pages that help explain different aspects uh of of ethereum um so we're working on ways to just like better format that what this will probably take shape is just you know a landing page as a learn hub to help kind of categorize different pathways different learning topics um whether it's like the fundamentals ethereum whether it's about the protocol and different upgrades and the governance of the protocol itself whether it's learning about different use cases of ethereum like d5 and nfts and dows creating better ways to kind of just like discover all the content on on the site moving through a couple more of these i'll try to make this quick um merge prep as the as the merge upgrade approaches um we obviously want to keep people informed and let them know what they need to do um if anything whether they're just a holder or a node operator or adapt developer making sure people are aware of what needs to happen um blog translations luca mentioned this earlier that we've been undergoing a few initiatives to to translate the blog um the ethereum foundation blog you know it's another great resource on a lot of ethereum related content some of it extremely timely such as you know merge test net updates um right now we have started rolling out some translations on these pages but we've been doing it somewhat in a hacky way given that the the code base of the blog doesn't actually support internationalization natively so pushing that forward is something we'll be focused on this quarter ethereum wiki consolidation so if you folks have ever googled stuff for ethereum um i think it's gotten better over the years but what you'll probably find is inevitably stumbling across what are you know out outdated stack overflow posts um outdated blog posts and there is a handful of wiki and documentation resources that the community has maintained over the years but have basically fallen out of date and unfortunately are no longer maintained um so one of our contributors who i believe is on the call joseph cook is helping lead the charge on this front to basically how do we consolidate some of these resources how do we keep the content on the internet up to date about ethereum so people particularly new to the space don't get confused frustrated unsure of where to contribute if they want to make updates um so we'll be doing some work around consolidating those resources and making sure we're maintaining those and keeping those up to date just to keep that experience a little smoother um and finally the open design system which you know nuno and yaakov touched on earlier on the call so i won't dig in too much but basically identifying ways experimenting with new approaches of how do we as a team and ethereum.org as a product really open up our design process um and allow people who want to get involved the ability to do that and to contribute to the product from a design standpoint so stay tuned for a post i'll outline these and more initiatives in more detail but again the whole goal is really just to get you guys involved both in terms of giving feedback in terms of what you'd like to see on the website um and what you'd like to collaborate on what you'd like to get involved with and encourage you to uh to do that when the time comes thanks guys thank you sam lots of exciting stuff to work on for q2 um and lastly just some miscellaneous items um the ethereum.org team will be in amsterdam for disconnect so if you're going to be there and want to chat or be up we're all pretty friendly uh or if you've got an idea for ethereum.org and you want to pitch us even better last thing was no no i believe you had one more thing that you wanted to share related to devconnect yes we'll be having special treats during the death connect so we'll be having some special swag just to share that with everybody yeah so we've ordered quite a few t-shirts um if you want one and you're in amsterdam come find us and we'll be more than happy to oblige awesome um yeah i think that's just about all that we have time for um apologies if you ask the question and the slider and we never got to it um i'll try to endeavor to answer any questions in the community culture or anything that haven't been answered thank you for everyone joining the call all the community members and contributors um our guides and eco model b willow joseph and thanks to colfax for jumping on the call and taking the time to talk about right everyone until next one thanks very much
