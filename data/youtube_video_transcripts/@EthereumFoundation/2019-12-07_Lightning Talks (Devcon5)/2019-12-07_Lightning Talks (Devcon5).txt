everyone thank you for coming my name is Alex I work in smart egg hi and today I will tell about one of our creations ear seed magnet SEO and how it helps in achieving the decentralized security to start with a couple of words about smart egg so we've been working in the area of application security for maybe 10 years now and the five years of those we are creating application security tools both for small businesses and big enterprise businesses and in the area of blockchain security we perform more than 200 blockchain audits and of course we create a number of smart contract security tools and during our work in blockchain we encountered the following problem many blockchain projects like some gaps or exchanges deal with tokens and most of those tokens are meant to be easy to any compliant but the sad truth is that most of them are not currently if you run some some of such projects for you there are only two approaches to ensure the intercept we need compatibility it's either or during third party code audit or writing a bunch of tests so both of these approaches take long time they are expensive they need certain degree of trust and of course they are not scalable so according to our region if you work in a project that deals with any counterparty interfaces that need to comply to some requirements you need to have a way to check these compliance in a decentralized way so as a first step in achieving this vision we created the tool that we named either C 20 test shield basically it's adapt it runs tests on it saves the results on chain and it is completely trustless since it's a smart contract it has simple web interface but it can be used by a smart contract so I will show you how it looks like so the process is really easy it has only three steps you enter the address of token you approve 1000 token units in order to perform some checks and please note that all of those tokens will be found it to you and then step 3 on step 3 you click yes ok please check this token and after a couple of minutes after the transaction transaction is mined you see the result it's basically it's a list of properties group by type and they are color coded to show whether the concrete property is violated or not so the same results are written on chain and can be accessed by any smart contract at any time so what we get we get low price you pay only for guests the process is fully automated because no people involved at any moment and those tests are really easy to run you saw it and the results are easy to understand and easy to show to anyone and not to say that we achieve Trust lessness so please go and try it it's online it's tested net and also we open sourced it and it can be it can be found on github so you can play with it and maybe change it according to your needs thank you hey everyone my name is Tim Baker I'm here to talk about how we can fund each one point X by auctioning off the names to a theorem network upgrades so bit of background there's some initiatives on a theorem one thought oh and that donates the fund they don't get the funds they need to get off the ground and oftentimes the amount needed for these initiatives are quite small too basically to build a proof of concept to get to an initial EEP and something like that so I think we could fund some of these efforts by auctioning off the names the network upgrades so what I mean specifically is I think we could run an untrained option from the first block of an upgrade all the way to the last block of it before the next one and throughout the auction people bid for what the name of the upgrade will be and this kind of a dynamic auction so throughout the oxygen whatever the highest bid says the name is is what we refer to the upgrade as for that time for that point in time um and obviously whenever someone out bids that bid then you refund the previous bird person update the name and that's it there's a couple things that are important here the first is that you'd want to have like a high minimum bid because premium namespace you're selling you want to make sure that people value it accordingly so I proposed a thousand each minimum and you also want to have large increments between the bids because you don't want people to spam the network while they're making bids for for these names so I had a proposal for a hundred eath and this would obviously be a bit complicated on the client side because if they need to change the name all the time that's not ideal so we could just use version numbers in the clients and use marketing name that we use sort of in blog posts and whatnot kind of like Android does where all the major releases have both a marketing name and a version number and so on the upgrade block whatever their highest bid says the name is gets finalized on chain and that's how we referred to the upgrade going forward in time and what are you actually fund here so I think we should raise these funds and try to spend them on initiatives that have a high likelihood of improving the etherium network today this means things like new syncing and discovery protocols some better testing some eath one point X initiatives like state rent some coordination across the clients or even some research ideas like off chain storage and again it's important to note that we should try to optimize to have a large set of initiatives so have fairly small amounts that are kind of proof of concept size that are spent fairly quickly so in an ideal world you've spent almost all of the funds from one auction before starting the next one but who gets to decide how we spend those funds um proposal for this is a three out of five multi-sig with the following parties so you'd have someone who's there to represent the theorem foundation who's not a client developer who's really there to represent sort of the etherium brand and vision I didn't want to have to kind developers ideally one or more not from the EF who are there to represent the core devs and then you'd want also an independent protocol developer to someone who's not affiliated with one of the bigger companies in the space and finally someone to represent the broader community so someone who's not part of the EF who's not a core developer but just represents the etherium community at large whether they're a top developer and a theorem cat harder or just some reddit or Twitter user who's very favorable towards a theorem um and the people on these multi-sig would basically be able to rotate in and out on a per upgrade basis so you're not signing up to this for life this obviously implies you need a process to decide how you add or remove people from that multi-sig and there's a couple constraints on the people in that multisig specifically that you don't want them to be able to get grants from the auction if they're part of their multi-sig and even farther than that you probably don't want anyone from the organization's to apply for a grant if they control the keys to the funds so for example if basu which is the team that I'm on was part of the multi-sig for Berlin which is the next upgrade after Istanbul that no one from Pegasus which is the company I work for should be able to apply for a grant for funds from funds raised during that auction um and so one interesting question here is like whether you actually named the hard fork so I have a couple proposals for what would be okay or not okay for names obviously this is something you'd want to prove by the community and you'd want to discuss and more specifically you probably want to have a process where at least one person on a bottie sig has to approve of a name for a bid to be valid so some couple ideas of what's okay just like some generic words you don't want bad stuff no offensive stuff and probably just like not anything confusing so no previous upgrade names no other blockchain name so it would be kind of awkward if you had like the et see if they're up grade and generally like something that you would be okay sponsoring Def Con would probably be a good a good name there and finally if you don't raise any money during this auction that we could just revert back to using Def Con city names which is what we started doing informally past Istanbul so that's what I had I have like a minute left if anyone has a question okay thanks everybody hello everyone this is whom and Franklin time with Gartner so in this session I want to share with you some end-user perspective you know that hopefully helped with the adoption so we have this basically service you know thousands of inquiries per year you know that relates to blockchain and pretty much half of them deals with you know selecting a blockchain platform in many cases we'll see there is a still a lot of confusion that what a auction platform is or is not so and that really play into the adoption and and the ease of you know evaluating a platform so there are many there are many different definitions you know that we find out you know unfortunately some of them really doesn't make sense and it you have to spend a lot of time you know for companies to first of all define a blogging platform what it constitutes and take the next step to start comparing the platform which is out there and select something that works for them so from what we have seen obviously ethereum in hyper ledger fabric are the most popular one but I have to say that there is no loyalty to any of these platforms because they still most of the organizations are testing you know and and going through proof of concept or some sort of limited pilot so the any decision that they make is not really a strategic one so in a couple of years or one year you know they may switch to another platform so what we thought you know it may help is to start establishing a functional framework for blocking platforms you know that helps with organizations to do an Apple to Apple comparison of different frameworks or platforms out there which there are hundreds of them they initially come to us and say okay why don't you as Gartner go create a Magic Quadrant you know for for all of this platform the challenge is that there's so many of them out there so and then they are changing to fans in terms of you know all the improvements that happening so it's kind of working progress so that's not possible so what we did instead we created this framework that pretty much covers all the key functional modules from smart contracts node management the core blockchain transactions infrastructure and more and more the ecosystem management aspect of blockchain solution so so basically the idea is that this is not obviously perfect you know we are going to improve it over time but the idea is that first of all they get an understanding what a platform is and then they start asking the right question so for every of these functional modules we define you know what it is you know and then we introduce some questions that they should ask so if you add them up it's about hundred forty two questions you know that pretty much covers you know all the key imports and you know features that you may expect from a platform some of them may be applicable or not applicable depending to the use case that they have and that will give them hopefully an understanding that for example what's the difference if they go with let's say if they're young versus hadera versus fabric or dumb and some of the differences you know will come up in us as part of that process you know but this story doesn't change doesn't end there what we have to deal with you know there's a lot of debates around versus you know enterprise we see those are the two key patterns in terms of the design of these platforms we see sometimes people try to differentiate these platforms in a much more granular way but the lot of those differences we consider them as configurable features that over time they morph into the same platform that that we have and even between public and enterprise we'll see the lines will start lowering over time so for example what's happening with the tharam 2.0 we envision you know an environment that you can define a shard you fix the validators for that those shards and eventually use the some sort of gateway you know to interact with beacon chain so while you are isolating your shard and chain you have the opportunity to connect to a public type of you know platform so so that's so that's that's something that we try to convey to this organization not to too much you know stock with having a shared ledger looking at the bigger picture of the platform like the crypto economics you know embedded native you know token you know that that's established in the platform that the coordination and consensus you know protocol the importance of them to make their choice future-proof over time but in addition to that we think the organization's need to also look at areas beyond just having the pure blockchain platform and that's you know things like decentralized web at Gartner we believe that interview ssin of decentralized web I think it's a key element of supporting digital ecosystems moving forward so without having that fabric you know to do transfer if occation between all sort of entities that having that vision of digitalization in the ecosystem was almost impossible so so decentralized web is coming and then from a platform perspective if the platform has a limited vision it can not support the centralized web so that's another lid layer that needs to be factored as part of the decision so and even we push it further in terms of long term planning like 10 years 15 years down the road this concept of worldwide ledger you know that we are going to have any kind of a muted version of world wide web that basically connect all these Ledger's together you know with new type of identification metals new type of an object new type of protocols that we try to convey and the whole idea is to help the organization's to understand you know where are we going with all of these technologies sometimes you know as developers we may focus too much on the bits and bytes you know and miss on the bigger picture which is important for them you know to build the case to adopt this type of technology so so that's the idea you know as some kind of you know hopefully pointers you know as you want building in all these great systems you know to convey it in a way that they can relate to and adopt it over time that's it thank you hi everyone and welcome to Japan my name is you know scanner Rama I'm master student at a Tokyo Institute of Technology today I would like to talk about network simulator called shim brach network is one of the important theme for us so Brooke Taney is based on p2p networks so it's necessary to consider communication within the network for example we want to improve the rope chain throughput you will increase the box size and the number of rocks generated per second but however this increases brach propagation delay and shortens approximation time so then it's it becomes difficult to synchronize prochain in network and toggle the chain folks so like this network communication is a cause of security degradation on broad chain so we research the improving as a method for improving the rock chain networks but it's difficult to experiment with your networks so we we derived broken Network Schmidt so and we we call it shim broke symbol Schmidt Rock Gym protocols and Rock propagation by default Brockton using proof-of-work and longest through on random networks but if you want to test you a new idea you can design an order behavior network topology and network configuration to fit your ideas and you can get the various data from zimberg this data can be used for network measurement and attack analysis and so on and this distributor was used for some experiment about net new neighbor selection algorithm and measuring the effect of delay networks so and now simple supports Bitcoin litecoin and those going and we are developing for Islam support but there are many ISM projects so such as casbah plasma so this time I should meet it cost on Shem broke as a sample experiment ghost is a broad selection protocol the current a certain protocol sect the longest chain as may chain but instead ghost X the heaviest chain the which t means subtree with the most blocks so I try to measuring the effect of ghost protocol against surface mining this is an interim result the left shorts the ratio of the attackers in main chain corresponding to the attackers mining power this shows how much mining power is needed for surface mining and light shows the average length of the attack chain released by the article this is related to the safe number of Confirmation this emboss wizard is a short the cost is better than the longer sir but it's not as much as I expected this is probably because assume has has not met so much folks so I think if it goes is better a more efficient with more forked rock chain so as this experiment simple will help you to evaluate some certain protocols please try simple and and give us feedback you if you if you are interested in the shrimp rock you can get more information and called our website or github thank you for listening please enjoy the pond or sack up you
