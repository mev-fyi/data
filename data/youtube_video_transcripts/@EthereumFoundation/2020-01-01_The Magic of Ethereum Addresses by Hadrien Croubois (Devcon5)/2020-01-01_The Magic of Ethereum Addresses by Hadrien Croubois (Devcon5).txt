[Applause] okay not that many people so you might learn something today the magic of fishermen traces so my name is Athena I work for exact as a particular designer in from fact expert but I'm also trying to simpler yet useful tool for these communities these many monsters so who hasn't places well it's and some are controls you might know both of those little very similar there are actresses sentencing comedian interview but they're differently so I do a super well it is basically it's a hash of it comes from the private so if you like the private key you go to address and this happiness is right on your network this means that you can use versus on next I and maintenance seamlessly but tomorrow stress is different when you deploy a smirk in fact do that basically the hash of the creator's address and to create forums so it's a creator is a well it's then just enormous Authority the Chiefs nose is not missing between different opening address is also direct red coat is not cars which address so if you have like have eyelids and announce you could deploy any contract we are nestled to Code Red Room as you can predict and this knowing this can set up your day so this guy was a hero Burgess because humans are you know paper tokens were sent to an address that was our respect contracts on the test nets but using painted assets and knowing that she was able to put a contract reversal from at the right levels you can send tokens or running to an address it doesn't exist this is how different so how to have the same address on the network you could use EMS and stuff like that but if you want to attend mix at least my level to the State address you need to be pro using to stay quiet and make sure everything is in sync between the network and so you have to do everything very carefully and if the Creator is like a factory smart in fact this is very dangerous because if user try to create accounts and they're doing a one network but not on the other then the network goes out of sync and there is no way they are going to have the same pathways for a while it that way yeah my technology on another network so hopefully there is a new thing there's more there is creates - and create - it's an up codes that are know smartly trying to deploy orders marketer i won√≠t able to speak to the test market I can you speak and how create to works is that the address is not constituting snows we can get out of thing between chain but using the creator's address so they brought code and a source and the source is useful if you want to deploy the same code twice but have different addresses and this is very interesting because it can be predicted like previously but so address basically in it contains of code so if you deploy another sabbatical you are never going to get the same address also it doesn't consider the notes so if you were to deploy is saying the Droid code on which the same sort on multiple blockchain you will have the same addressing and provided that the contract that does the deployment has the same address in the first myth and we know that we can do that using the previous technique which is kind of difficult but we don't have to do it once so basically that's what I did I built a very generic way to factory it's a small square contract only thing it does is course creates - so you can use it to deploy any small contract and you should keep it the same night put in the same source on our drug chain you will end up with smart contracts on Gordon rotate we just have to deploy it this factory to as many blockchain as possible we just say madness and that's what I did so this is the address right here it's like on magnetic Rob's an Iranian calamity or neon blue so and I'm going to give away to everybody sign transaction for all the chain IDs from 1 to 16 K or 64 K so that you just have to follow well that the clothes that you run man transaction and this with a project factory to end in sight anyone the night weight is factoring and act as the route from airport we of smirking trying to fill all that of say miles that way we never have to worry about sending tokens to a contract that has the wrong gap I suppose we can make sure that or contract at the same address on the alternator so thank you for anything and I mean sex to financing that and if you want to know orders compatible [Applause] you
