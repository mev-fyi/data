hey everyone and Rukavina with POA Network I'm going to be talking about an app we've been building called block Scout blocks out is an open-source EVM blockchain Explorer it's currently live at bluff Scout calm if you'd like to contribute to the project you can do so at github comm /bo a network blocks go all right so we support eight networks currently most importantly theory of maintenance Nets of etherium kovin Robson and brink be ranked B will go live early next week and we had to make some customizations there we also support etherion classic POA core VOA so cool and hard spoon one of our hard spoons of a theory and maintenance tied chain we support parity guests in ganache we are working on the internal transactions for guests so that should be enabled late next week so why we built a block scow as a side chain we don't have access to you know ether scan everybody knows and loves ether scan so we needed to change this were friendly to four side chains private networks and we wanted to allow users of the etherium ecosystem to spin up their own full-featured block explorer connect it to their node so they can check the balances of their addresses that we thought it was very important for decentralization here's some features a block see out you have the typical blocks transactions everything you'd expect from a typical blockchain explore the exciting things happen when you get into block reorge we have ERC 20 in the AR c 721 token support we have contract verification you're also being able to query those verified smart contracts directly from block scout real-time UI API so we have an ether scan compatible restful api so you could port your application from using ether scans api to using black scout if you chose to and really exciting we just added yesterday to master graph QL some graphic ul API endpoints which also includes some web hooks we'll be building more on top of that in the next couple weeks as well for our development stack we're using elixir on the Erlang VM with a Postgres database Erlang is great for running fault-tolerant systems so some other apps that use Erlang were whatsapp and Heroku so we thought it was a great choice for black scale I want to talk a little bit about where we're heading and what we're doing right now we just launched a couple weeks ago block Scout so we're still indexing etherion maintenance or experience such as like faster page load speeds faster indexing times when a block is mined we want you know what immediately to be available and imported into block Scout so we're working on that a lot of it right now is where ddossing our own node so we're building up more nodes on the backend so we can hit it a little harder we're kind of were reduced by 90% because we keep ddossing or node with all the data on maintenance so we're working on that right now as far as our indexer we've had many user requests to define a set of blocks on any je vm chain and just index those it's good for analyzing certain sets of data we're also we have our best engineer working on guest internal transactions so that should be available late and as I mentioned before faster indexing times block Scout comes with many customizable features but if you're not familiar with the app it's difficult to you know find in the files where these customization settings are so we're building a back-end admin panel actually the mint panel is actually done but over the next couple of weeks we'll be including all these configuration settings such as if you deploy black Scout you can change the CSS colors you're able to adjust how much memory you want the application to use it'll just shrink any of the processes that are too large it's just a small portion of the available configuration settings you'll be able to change we'll also be offering data export so you'll be able to download your transactions tokens your coin and token balance history so you'll be able to do that very soon to CSV some other things we're excited about is we have our graph QL we think it'll be great for the theory mu Co system to be able to utilize web hooks and other type of endpoints and use our data to build some great applications will also have continued development around ERC 7:21 data attributes so users have better can analyze ERC 7:21 non fungible tokens better write on the blockchain and finally right now we're working on internal I'm sorry input data and logs decoding them by the contract API so that should be finished late next week but I also want to thank each bride for their both monetary contribution and their community support if you guys have any questions I'll be around after and be happy to answer them for you thank you you
