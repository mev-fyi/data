so I'd be presenting something called I named a flying carpet it's a peer-to-peer decentralized autonomous transportation system that is powered by something called a AI protocol so you guys probably already seen this screen because of sensation about the ID box this morning but I've been developing different projects over the past 10 years fin tag transportation system energy trading system in ID box and they all funded so I raised money in private funding or grants and today I'm going to present you something I call the fine cup of Capet so it all started in 2009 when I was doing my thesis about autonomous robots this is my American countries when I was studying in a state and this is what I built was almost like nine years ago and this one was using a machine learning system to go around the campus and basically record live-streaming or analyze the campus and get some cool images about the building's no staff since then I've been always looking into trying to build a system a physical system like blockchain before the physical for the physical world how we can build a iot of systems swamp system that can communicate between each other so I will show you a quick video I just build the video like five minutes ago so please and the voice was made by a Delfy I'm not sure she's in the room she works for cosmos you can find a Twitter follower because she helped me let's see if it works [Music] [Music] [Music] oops okay so that was um oops so you got the idea about the flying carpet it's not really a flying carpet the fly but hello any drone in any location were to be charged and is connected to the blockchain and you can get money so then I decided to actually build a proof of concept and an MVP in my place in London we use exactly the same a Tesla battery that I put all together so I bought them it's quite powerful and I for me this is probably the first one fast charger using NFC so it can detect you just attach the NFC tag on the drone and then it will using only unidirectional state channel stuff to identify the junda it's flying on the top of it and it will charge it it's pretty I I will publish everything on the website but life three weeks of work completely live so you will access me for three weeks pretty much not sleeping to build the flying carpet it's it's about like hate what are so it's very dangerous you shouldn't open the box and normally I was planning to do a live demo here but I got the drone confiscated I will post everything in got confiscated at the airport so you see you can charge anything you can charge with a phone you see it's charging so obviously it cannot fly with the flying carpet even put in on the plane but you can charge and draw in less than 15 minutes super-strong Drona can charge all of them so you see like all the power I'm gonna try to get a little bit faster because the time is passing and must be pry with Ellis LCD and a 4G communication protocol the drone can be installed anywhere in the world as long as you put it as a 4G communication inside and this is me this is my garden in London the stuff that you see in the back is my DIY space it's summer house summer camp but you can and also if you see it but you've got the the drone on top and the top of the John is using a dgy it's got a NFC noir so plug for recharging the battery because you need to get a plug inside so he can charge it I'm gonna show you a live demo because I couldn't do it in here in Def Con I was planning to do our talk to death - Victor from Swami said I'm not sure that's great idea to do the live demonstrate with such technology so baby scare off people but that's me I recalled because we'll take too long to show you exactly what's happening but I accelerate the time and you what you do is just mount the flying carpet you basically you go in the back and then you default it on anyway you will so then you got a drone and what I wanna mention this John was not me controlling the drone it was automatically using a very simple a I'm like mathematical algorithm to detect the flying the where was the flying carpet yeah so that's why it's not really efficient because the drone is learning what you want to go this is basically this kind of app will be built by developers to the - the best way to reach a flying carpet you've got a GPS location based where the GPS is probably like 2 or 3 meters away so it's not really precise so if you need to join to learn how to go through the flying carpet and then charge himself and also as I think you will see a video from the other side looking at the drone so yeah so to show you that I'm not lying and it's actually charging normally you will see actually yeah yeah I came but is it's charging the drone and also making I would publish everything in a website it's making an estate channel you can see all the transaction there is actually identifying these himself using the NFC and then charging the join you can calculate how much power is charging the drones so then the owner of the flying carpet can get money and the owner of the John can also get money for the task is doing for this task we're just taking a picture of London so it's not very very high skills but it was cool let me show you a quick architecture that I'd be building for the past three weeks so basically you've got the drone owner that is paying very expensive money to buy the drone but I never use it apparently I was calling the statistics it's only about 2 or 1 times announced at the beginning and then you never use the drone because but they spent 1,500 to fight the drone it's just for showing off for the kids or for the wife or something and and then you got a flying carpet that is using NFC signature and I use the microwave and network but it can be used on the network as well and then what you have is the the flying carpet - talking to the ATM contract and the business making a request and the business was making a request to you is making a request to the developer that build the service so developer are incentive of building more application because if this the the business think it is a good application then they will buy the service it can be for anything you can add rooftop analysis you can have thermal or in a digital in this drone what I've done it will be published in a website as well is a live thermal camera so I hacked the dgy but John to add a thermal camera and then you can analyze the house and then you can sell this information to businesses for I mean quite a lot money by the way actually raised quite a lot of money in two weeks time grants and what it does is I use open-air Jean to teach the drone what kind of information you can learn in a physical world how does it done it's basically this is a video you can find online is using the same so any any any services that is pushed into the area network which first be analyzed by the by the platform to detect if there is no collision or it's not harming any people in network because you don't want the joint to carry guns all this kind of stuff so we need to make sure is that John is learning that the algorithm is pushed to the platform is curve is actually doing the right job so it's fun and then the drone can do anything you can analyze electricity grade you canalize houses in I will tell you I've got two full of concept that I've done worldwide one in Asia and I will show you three minutes I've done the live demo and you will find all the stat live information on the website there was analyzing a coconut plantation and calculating how many coconut were about to be produced and also the quality of the trees that was done by the drone without me controlling the drone that's very important so you can think this is very basic but it's not amazing the video and calculating different information that any developer can build and push to the platform it's like it's like basically the I know if you've heard about the project new Mirai for trading algorithm it's basically kind of the same business model you push it and then the best algorithm win and this one was for thumb to analyze and calculate the land and also analyze the plans how many it's very precise you can calculate how much cereals you'll be producing in two months or something just about John flying but no one needs to control the room the main problem why I come up this is idea and actually building it is because in their open country people I mean you can use it instead of country but the regulator regulation probably will stop you sometimes but in developing country people are not very technological people but they won't for them having controlling or asking service like few medicine medicine shipment land registration lands registration is massive for them it would be huge they just need to use just need to ask using the mobile or something ask and the drone will be it will be doing the job and because the entire ecosystem is one building the app one buying the flying carpet one pushing the drone and the other ones the business using the the infrastructure you see Victor I didn't do the live demonstration it was pretty scared yeah basically that's that's it that's the flying carpet if you got any questions just ask me [Music] [Applause] you
