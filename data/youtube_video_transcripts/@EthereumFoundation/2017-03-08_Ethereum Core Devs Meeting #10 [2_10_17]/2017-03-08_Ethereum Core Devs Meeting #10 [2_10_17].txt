well yeah I'll just get started on the first bullet point so yeah we just went through the eip overhaul process what that entails is putting together a new VIP one so that so that is already in place of what right now we have it so that you have to go to the issues if you want to discuss your VIP and then once it's kind of formalized and you got everything flushed out and get some you know community feedback go okay I'm here all right so yeah Greg I'm talking about the new VIP process I'm sorry there we go you go from issue to a PR and with that PR we have a new set of erection I guess or refined set of template to use on that we're going to be clearing out all cheese so so yeah that's kind of in process all the other informations on there if you have an EIP please go to your VIP and convert it to a PR or close out the issues which ever one applies to you so you are already awesome it's been a PR for a month or so yeah so what we're going to do is slowly work through those either in all four dev meetings or using the signaling systems we're building okay we should probably i think a big idea this is someone similar for the meeting so interested in the syndics right so it is basically similar to now just at at some point we will move it to an action like proper pukka exactly and there's a new or template on there that makes it a little bit easier to digest and with the more worthless if you want to updatable i see it makes it easier to go through that process of keeping history of the VIP and it's also a template for the issues so for the issues you can just you can use the pr template if you want a lot of people just go in and say I have an idea so it's just very unstructured all the issue section is now is a place for people to go and talk about the IPS and they can use the pr template or not so it's not nice until it's an encrypted pull request the important thing and who has been merging down there's a first of eight editors myself Nick kc d trio gap Roman italic and I believe there might be Greg as well I'm right yeah and then there's like one or two others but um I think maybe Christian so yeah the editors go through and what consensus is met we will merge it right now there's kind of a backlog that's going to be a little bit slow at first but we're working on the etherion package manager just because that was already mostly written up by piper so that's going to go in very soon as and officially and then I'll Robert you just joined us just hello awesome hey nice to meet you and your I guess it rip with the parity and escort yeah just I guess so cool yeah how these meetings go down we just go through the agenda which i will paste you in github or sorry get ur and we kind of try to come to consensus amongst our different development groups about what changes are going to happen the teacher just kind of have a sync up so any comments you can provide would be great and there'll be plenty of opportunity for that and if you have an agenda item at the end feel free to let us know and we can tack it on okay sure thing alright so that was the first item the second one is going to be Christian talking about the case not precompile so I believe that there might have been some finality on that so Christian if you want to go ahead thanks so I did not convert these two to pull request yet but I updated the issue description to the pull request template the main changes or yeah yeah the main change between the last version were that addresses are 62 or sorry I click a link and it brought me to the writer case but it's too it's too yeah peace and the first one is 196 which is additional scalar multiplication and then 197 I guess which is the parent function right okay Stu agenda items they are just incorrectly link okay then let's talk across the case mark Faris first so that's 1 917 I think the specification did not actually change after a suggestion from vitalik I simplifies the actual mathematical specifications but semantics is not change I assign the address of of 8 to the precompile we settled on two dimensional coordinates for the for the curve point I think that's it so what still to be determined is the gas cost and that I guess a topic after some of the implementation of finished are there any comments yeah following a bit about I don't know before mathematical bigger but with our in the gas cost is this a bit method is to have one type of tooth estimated gas and processing based on input so this is very wisely in depending on the actual input I guess I mean it's still a big curve point so I think we can just try random read according to something like this I don't think that it will differ a lot so they're all ready for the number of points is a factor that influences the runtime and fine with actually limiting the number of inputs to something like ten crabs if we can't find a good asymptotic for that but I think it should be linear in the number of points so that's that's not a big thing and what did you say about you wondering about the mathematical specification what we mean by that now there's been an adjustment for that didn't but I didn't know much about it also says that was the basis of my question of it smells very complexity could be activated by joint authority or sooner hidden work birthday system there you wouldn't them know it ecstatically so I think you're telling those more details about that but I think once you fix the curve then the complexity is more or less fixed give the at least to the main the main computational unit you have is this Miller loop and the number of iterations there is is founded depending on the actual cookies so it sounds like is there any if there's not any other comments on that it sounds like this is going to go into the process of normalization now there shouldn't be much of an issue is consensus but we might check outside of an all core dev meeting just for the final you know kind of getting the thumbs up for most people about that is that sounded Christian yep concerning the formalization so you mean converting it into lattes oh that I was actually talking about the PR but on the topic of the yellow paper that will need to be something we work out because there's a lot of open Polar question there and right now I know yo Ichi has been working to kind of clean that up but there's also things that are not updated from spurious dragons so it's kind of a question of do we update the yellow paper hooting stuff dated and that and that kind of thing but in the hill then I guess we would be easing the eip uses are more or less are back until the yellow papers updated when we do we have pre-compiled closer in the yellow paper on this fixed window yes they're specified at least the first times I've returned I don't know about my or one minute okay yeah that part is complete alright so um yeah that's for first item to umbria snart's precompiled this next one is metropolis vegan so what I'm going to do is so the talus depending on in the next couple minute I thought we thought baby elliptic curve operations for a different item you're right I was gripping them together I need more sleep yeah go ahead and go go on with that Christian I'm not sure so yeah sure much has to be said here yeah i mean the encoding is basically the same including of chris porn yeah i think i got resolved last meeting we were just going to get like a final kind of thing from parity team and I think Arkady joined a Kenny Harris arcady jump you awesome welcome ok so so here a multiplication is a bit more complicated with regards to get caught but I guess it can be dealt in a very similar way to to acceleration so that should not be a big problem yeah what is this progress in with implementations there I've seen that the Coliseum started yeah i started at implementation i didn't i didn't get much further than 20 elements but ok thankfully so priority is the plastic excuse me like fun library and for what exactly you see if I'm ya little cup operations and and yeah also preparing yeah we'll just use libraries there is a number to choose from ok ok I think we can complete these two items ok great and then Martin and chat talked about how one of these items is now they went from like 142 196 I think the VIP members are generally going to say the same as the issue number unless the author wants to do it otherwise so it kind of goes in the flux so if there's a weird PR number just look for a reference to the issue number yeah next on the agenda is city metropolis so this is a big one so the talipes going to join soon and facilitate a lot of this Christian filled up how it gets here if you could just kind of lead this and Mick to know damn alright class helpful here with the Hudson I'm here yeah yeah it's Tim win so I'm sorry I just a good question and question about 196 I am on fully aware that we probably want to do 1 917 when did we discuss more 96 I don't remember this from any of the previous call that we've had oh yeah probably discuss politics also in the previous co perhaps you you jane morris combined it with 11 and 7 the thing is led that for this KSDK snarks you also need elliptic curves multiplication upon otherwise it's not efficient enough and it's he has stated to the same operations on the same curve I mean when you want to implement the when you implement a pairing function you also need that anyway I guess it sound very cool phandra all right all right cool all right so these methods right you will need them anyway for their parent good okay yeah all right and tells on the same curve right cool okay thank you come begginer yes shall we press on to the next item which was so we just covered see what's good addition metropolis associated eat I guess the question here good fatality me so we don't have even that Phillip Baker yeah oh sorry um in that case do you want to take away sure yeah okay sorry so it's 58 between the last meeting and this meeting we notice that so yeah and one is aware of a proposal alien propose will be where proposal says charge memory enlargement for return value to the caller where proposal be is charged memory enlargement to the ecology to the remaining gas of the colony and we notice that this might break existing contracts when they call in to be the identity precompile because the gas costs for the identity precompile are quite easy to calculate and the solidity generates code or generated code where the the amount of gas was was exactly specified and if we now change it to make the macaulay pay for enlarging the memory then there won't be enough gas to do that so basically the easy compromise proposal was to keep the old semantics unless the size of the return area specified has a special value which could be 2 to the 2 56 minus one or two to the 64 minus one something like that and only in that case apply these special rules where memory is enlarged twice and the enlargement for the return value is charged to the Kali what are the opinions on that proposal what's the advantage of all of the cyber just chatting Lea and Cory the whole time that's why the caller the whole time the advantages that the caller does not know in advance how large the return value body let's say place this fightin upper bounded legs ah sorry so yeah what did you send more spatially proposal a quick effectively yeah I wanna it is like big is getting more complications so we see as well as adjustable to be over proposal a is that you know for a fact whether the call of code will fail or not before you execute the electrical and I mean in a way it is also kind of protects the caller come because if the corner does not specify an effective upper bound so just a gigantic value then the colleague can make the ultra call sale and make you out of gas and so then it is variously solved the color just specifies an excellent guess that is below sorry maximum memory that won't consume all of the gas that is hard to come up with traces of squad ration yes and maybe getting into all six of each cases with sometimes church to cover and sometimes you guys to cali and so on to be seems a real proper sorry what because it significantly complicates the key in and the proposal and introduces more potential first here is it makes it have as a reason that our basic sure I mean yeah the proper way to do this would be to provide a return like like the call data but for return data but i think we had passed that so the only way to fix is is in one of these problems the metal finger look could we not do that actually I mean if we just said that my friend Arthur always gets you you know the trend data Richard a saline let you access all the return data and the amount of memory you provide in the coop code this will fill up to that much their new code could simply sit back to zero all the time and use return data yeah I mean so you mean just like called a Talon and call it a copy and obvious for returned a tool and then return data copy yes and they the call our code would remain would continue to function same way as previously accepts that you could also fitch return data through those of co op codes and the return area in too small to three a basically get rights whatever it can up to the low mass of the return area and man that's us yeah and it would avoid the you know personally accounting issues st. agree what's the model for he wasn't in that area someone for me working here and great I'm already was in person he'll play list I mean I keep it I do keep an eye on it if you stayed the question more precisely i might be able to bring through I like the interface for function calls in he wasn't how the apasa input data and how to you be eventually returned a time I'm not really sure now I'm not really sure well much and was Martin he's not here okay once once it gets you know into the EDM it looks aimed for how they make that happen i'm not sure hello vitalic hi everyone sorry bum way pillars we were just discussing eat ok yet another proposal this is kind of here so i think i think we need to have yet another both over this one and we move on to you to the next week while we better discuss five-eighth right back perhaps get opinion from vitalik hold on so why do we need a new proposal so there's a possibility to as a basically return sighs and return copy the fluently as we have called it and form at a copy the reasoning being that can count thanks for return values to add see more complicated and expected with the current proposal well on so what would be a return what would the return size the return copy of codes do as corporate insides will tell you the total amount affable the most recently called contract hydrogen and turned out a copy would copy aside segments of that into the pistol I've seen as a memory and the co op codes and continue to operate is as it does already so if you arrive in new codes that expresses a variable which implies you just say bridge in size zero or what it a soup and then get started through the north okay this just sounds like a wheel programmable dealers to me check out for a recent discussion on five about yeah Oh council because that also have to be more complicated today I'm issues issue 5 yes sorry issue an issue sanitizer donated in the notes of five is a shade okay well what next proposing seems quite didn't seem to be too complicated yes I I think questions right we should take with offline and prescribes a microscope zeiss entry for them NS travel train resolvers here look okay um so I guess that brings us to 86 and propose to initial attraction changes from metropolis and it not take them okay look um yes so the basic idea i think as was i think we've probably mentioned in calls a few times is that we allow a new type of transaction where the signature is equal to 0 0 0 then veterans actually gets treated as valid and the center as your ex is assumed to be to the 160 minus 1 which is what is your wife's FF FF FF FF FF so and then there's also two now the basic reasoning behind this is so that you can use this as a kind of a type of transaction where the what's meant to be the account instead actually is the destination of the transaction so the idea that the transaction would go to an accounts in that account would actually be a book in realistic use cases a forwarding contracts which would basically check that the transaction data for a signature and if everything passes then it was either a cast the message alone or in some cases do something to do other things in the mean this has a few goals one of those goals is to kind of do abstract the way account security one of them is to abstract away yet I always partially abstract the way nonsense a third one is to allow contracts to pay for gas so in order for this to work well there are kind of three things or as we just covered in league bread for things that would needs to be a eventual done in parallel so two of them are items q13 and VIP in which and what they do is they basically switch to the way that contract addresses are determined from being based on Sandra nonce a to being based on the code and and the sender and the purpose is basically so that you can send two accounts before those accounts exist and because that's what you can do with any regular athyrium address so in the idea would be that you would calculate yourself what the address would be you would say with that particular piece of code and people could send either to it or do whatever or send whatever other tokens to us and whenever you want to start using that account you can buy basically creating sending a contract creation transaction which creates that particular account and the only kind of the only account you can create at that particular address en aquel that has the exact same piece of code now for backwards compatibility purposes look this was debated in the previous discussion in like previous calls and people seem to most in favor of basically creating a new op code which could be i mean i use create p2s age for you can rename it so i create what creates a with code address or whatever and that would basically apply the same principle to our contract creation transactions now there's in order for this Celeste in protocol then there's also extra protocol stuff the nice thing about the extra protocol stuff is that it's like it's not critical it's not consensus and it's not critical path and so we can see erratically implemented like a month or two after the hard fork and narrow we find and that basically is logic in the minor and logic in any know the does transaction propagation that would basically skin for specific psychic but come up with a set of rules that say if the transaction passes at least one of these rules and it can be iterated be propagated or I can be included and like the rules one simple rule as those who subscribed in the comments would be to check for a redneck that would basically say this account this transaction goes to a particular type of accounts which is guarantees to pay it only some feet to the liner yes that giggle Addison definitely return all right I've already partially implemented this change thing go and apart from the mining strategies and [Music] contraction remain challenging so so i have a question sorry and how you could likely you protect you know acha from my pillow the budget of this contract attack with attackers from doing what with the contract sorry just trying to spend all the money that I reserve or you know Oh paying for reproduction justice and transactions and okay so one important point is that the conscience the contract only pays gas after it determines that is the signature is valid so if you just send it yum theta then it's just not going to do anything and I specifically so consumers yeah exactly so yeah so I don't know it's the it's the signature provided through the call later so it's not the signature of the transaction itself so you would pass in so the transaction data which would contain the actual signature and you solid eight the signature within the contract itself it's basically the idea but basically could still them as spam the network invalid transactions and in Venice businesses right so yes I the matter will be up but you would have to stop process already be slightly so the idea is that no minor would be good enough to include transactions that will save them and like that and by default like until we start implementing strategies wonders are not going to mine any of these transactions anyway I think yeah to be clear at present attackers can make notes to work by validation with the transaction so I think the idea is that the cost of validation one thingies would be roughly on our current picture delegation that's just for now compete with this side but in this case I would have to spin a BBM first to those executed contract to contact will stop at this point roll and yes it yeah so we might have to increase the transaction proportional all right i look like hell currently if the if the regular expression is strict enough we don't actually have to run be the end we can also just do a yeah they see what we do with quick compose a song it does not take away and say oh I know what that contractors I'll completed myself yep yeah so so sorry I assume it like what is the basic principle that we use to identify a addresses that we should pay for them and Alice's that we are all going to pay for them what do you mean like you get the transaction right you identify it was sent by some hundreds and the now you know that you have to pay all for this or or you don't have to pay for this okay on those who is it committee where you a minor you a sender or receiver yeah you are a minor your reminder and you two under surveillance van approaching your liner to receive an EAP 86 transaction and that exe 86 transaction helps them to address right so okay when you would do is you would basically run a red X on the code of the to address and you would determine whether or not it matches what one particular preset pattern that would determine that a ton of safety pin medicine and that that transaction is actually going to pay you or click your fee we also have to check the balance of that contract work yes let's check the balance of that contract against the max guests will also specified as part of the identity they can clearly actually that if you're sure that it will execute quickly and give you an answer because it might be quicker just to ask the contract oh so sorry so if I am now in the head of the facilitator of this type of contract why should mystify a reg ex or all-conference what sorry for all others is I'm going to pay for no no so the rag XP is a rule is a minor strategy rule right so the ideas that would be like at some point after the fork you would release a version of the mug for anyone on a client that gets used for mine by miners would a demon like at least one or two red X that would in these were basically identify you know pieces of code that are kind of okay for the like way to be profitable for the minor to include and I could most you know I can help take this project if I am doing at the attacker you find that oculars I want to take advantage of some budget that this saves there or some others is to be saved I can most a you know a perfect or imitate the right projects to be paid done no no so the red X would be strict enough such that you can prove that any code that matches it would decode that basically if and if that if the account has enough money to pay for it and if fisting and if the signature is valid then the trendex the transaction would actually take money out of that accounts and give that money to the minor oh sorry one more question so we're talking about critics hope the code inside the smart contract of the code inside the of the code of the to address but the regular expression itself is stored in the code of the client yes you can only will change with a software upgrade physically or blue H so I have you know some sort of proposition to maybe add to the CIP and then tell me if it's reasonable and if for example offices that are not identified by this project but they are there I they have a value so it's very hard to accuse them play you know if the valleys large enough and so maybe because ursus can be also passed into the contract and it and you know it can be valuable in some a very famous case so I think the important thing to keep in mind is that once EIT 86 is implemented but we can we can definitely keep on coming up with more and more reg ex to capture more and more classes of contracts that are our case for minors to include and minor is what are going to piss are free to kind of add new reg ex unilaterally and oh no they sorry so it's not just of the obvious code is on any field of the transaction okay so it's basically Z so the breakfast or the racket so the rule without a minor would use the determine whether or not it includes a transaction is a function that takes the following input one input is the code of the contract of the to address another input is the balance of the two address to make sure it has enough money and the 30 and 40 is the data of the transaction and the reason it needs the data or the transaction is to let it can tell whether or not the fee of high enough and whether or not the signatures valid now theoretically of course you could you could have sent these rules could potentially be like arbitrary we quickly computable functions on other three pieces of data well sounds interesting damn ok I guess the way we should be you know make this is common thread BJP more active I guess these questions are read it seem still a little bit there you will shake it for me about the air and it jumped in details I don't want to take all the time of everybody so I will pass on and you know if you have questions from the arm of the bed I just take a look good okay okay then hmm the one thing you can discuss here is a good strategy to test this how would my assertion yeah that's the government the weekend necessarily as we do usually we just implemented every somebody to go to a package well no the important thing is right that but when the eia field when the hard fork is simple method initially none of these right texts are going to be implemented right so initially the only one would basically okay theoretically a malicious miner could include one of these transactions but it would just go the include process according to the consensus rules and the Wii U is the same like the same space s methodology that we've used for two years and it shouldn't really be a big issue right like his face pic with just a fairly small extension to with the signature scheme zia anyone nobody would rail relay these transactions anyone in like sort are expecting somebody including a minor include keychain got something so real yeah now if I mean in terms of actually testing to these expressions one thing that we could do a later on is that what wants to be VIP is that we step woman once the fourth is done on the test that and on the main nest then on the test net we can probably start letting some clients and have certain some of these rag up excellent and you know that will be a separate process so it's important to know that these red X are also being used for reeling and not just for a noted as a mining strategy yes so what I'm trying to say is it will be hard to a guy especially when we just roll out this is hardcore yeah yeah so let's see in general radius the kinds of attack classes we have to worry about are basically what is like one of them is consent of failure and this is fairly simple from a consensus standpoint the other one is like network propagation and the various kinds of transaction bosses and at least initially there aren't going to be in d and e reca and so there's not going to be transaction propagation issues and we'll be able to kind of loosen that over time on whatever schedule is necessary so you know apart from relaying and mining Sergey can we say that this proposal has been accepted expected as in first of all that we would like to have it in a hard work and second do we want to have it in Metropolis I think it's reasonable co scripted I just as well is whether we can place trouble yeah I think I mean I personally say this is one of the probably one of the higher my preference would be to try to put it into into metropolis and we need one of the reasons why i say this is just because of complementarity with the guys be a stark applications but and alongside it's also one that just has a purely kind of high trade off of you value to implementation costs but thats soon personally i would much rather like if we have to start putting things on the chopping block and much rather purge things as things like the revert all code but that's my personal occasion are there any objection measurement from gave team leads or remembers to and when it comes with some plans from the tropical what is in time for metropolis how we're going to where we had a concrete this well it is let me say there any attention to anything it in the next four crumpets from the people who are in charge of figuring out what the things can do and in the absence of that i think would be fair to say that this is tentatively on thanks for grant agrees yeah ok so i guess this needs to be put in a pull request now even though we can actually except with and merch i will do that ok next one wall where are we sorry um I still have a question about 86 world with CIT 155 replay protection it is hence protection so it's the question what will the 8086 transactions be really protective like the two are not mutually exclusive with each other um I'm inclined to say that by default I don't see ya I don't see any risk well actually bike defaulters not going to be risks because that's the other block chains are explaining it or look up the other here and instantiations are going to immediately implement this I mean it's the one thing that we could bring in is the achene ID parameterization so now if we want I actually assumed that we did we actually put the chain ID into the V and V being 0 would be after after having derived the train ID okay in that case that yeah that's there so we could basically instead of making it be 000 what would be a just be like a either chain chain ID 00 or chain i do find a 300 that seems like trivial and up and I could just put that into the pr so at NP class yeah intrachain re piatek for the responsibility of religious education function correct so yes something perhaps that should be talk a bit more about in the issue so I mean with with that abstraction we can't have an ordering of was actually more because if I mean the contract can check the loans but then the transaction will be executed just won't have any effect but it will consume yet so can't basically you can't put out a keyword projection movie then executed in order which is probably also a good thing because it confused resources in the in the minors and clients that aren't tasteful okay right well we unless that sound that sounds highly dependent on minor strategy is like it you could potentially have like miners tabare guess that check for a specific type of account but has a non scheme in which case you can keep an order or you could ask for a gag for some different non scheme that might not require in order or you might have a red X 4 sub UT XO scheme so it's like it's in the longer term it seems situation dependent sure but but any minor can include transactions with a future notes and gaudy alex has three all clients correct so look from the from the point of view of kind of reeling information about the effect of transactions the two new things would be that number one theoretically a transaction can be included as can be included twice and and so you have to look at you just basically have a look at a lawyer yes you have to make sure they're trying to actually made at the log if you wanted to check that it actually did something all right but that's something I actually even been considered so by just taking in the old transaction you can rub anyone that's correct no no you can't rob anyone why not because if like they're really going to put any sane actor is still going to have some kind of non scheme or so for some alternative inside of their contract sure even if you have a loan scheme you have to pay for the gas that textin on probably but the transaction is not going to do the transaction or the account code is not going to pay for the gas until the nonce is correct so if a minor includes this then the minor is not going to be paid anything the gas price will be 0 all right so these rights though isn't it out there and your code will break early and don't pay yo right yes yeah so guys and sighs and rubs I need to leave now Peter and Nikolai bought from the call so they'll go to represent ago things I should be sailing can we move on to our tea set up in two locations when they would okay yeah I only bet against it yeah so basically the reason why I I keep mother's two reasons why I came up with this one reason is as far as part of kind of abstracting and simplifying these know the protocol I wanted to move to but basically moved to a way from having any kind of implicit stage except for state that's like actually reflected in part of the state route so that this d transition function actually as you know take a state at a transaction get a News days without also having like some other state that we could actually call the space and right now the last 256 block ashes in some sense are kind of part of this phantom state and this ends up like actually increasing implementation complexity and it also it is also kind of limited because of its that there are use cases for checking bought caches way further back than 256 blocks but if we were if we were to try and stretch it that much further back then it would require even more infrastructure in order to be able to actually fetch these hashes quickly enough so the intention here basically is that we would store some number of wat caches in the states and the block a shop code would be a kind of redirected to read this basically look at what the contract says it's at the same time because the contract that stores these days these state routes or so these black hashes would also have a function so the goal would be that we will try and like to nudge people towards to use the function to access the block ashes instead of using the block the wash off code part of this is that we make state routes accessible be just as black ashes or the thinking here basically is that this would allow um it's more it's more intent Adele so as a kind of a longer-term feature in order to allow us in order for things like Casper Casper a future changes to the consensus algorithm via more capable of kind of evaluating things from inside of the EVM but it's also something like some applications might I just decide that they could benefit from and it's fairly a relatively easy to implement so the idea is that this basic with or the apparel mechanism that does the exact same thing the state routes as is already done with black ashes is nothing else it allows contracts are very easily purchase proofs of previous guys right I'm sorry and the other main important benefit here is for white clients so right now basic weave in order for like lines to like actually properly be to have the full like lion security it technically still has to validate the entire chain but because with this mechanism you would have an automatic kind of mechanism by which blocks would points table with the rectory points two blocks that are clear like 50,000 blocks before them this would allow white clients to kind of verify a partial chain that skip that I'm going to skip 10,000 blocks at a time and you basically be able to have like potentially even higher sinking efficiency is in the existing jeff white client and at the same time kind of the full the full chains for the proof of work security without checkpoints yes so one question is there a plan to eventually extend in this contract to store all state routes for all vocations ok so this gets a bit more more intricate um so there's a bit of a trade-off here because what you could potentially store every state ruin every ball cash and that would actually technically be the easiest thing to code but that would also lead to like a lot of state growth so in a block for Earth's are in a year right now for example there are going to be a ugly stud about 2.2 million blocks 2.2 million blocks x 32 bytes I guess due to about 70 megabytes and then that time is always times an overhead factor of 2 and then that's times another 24 black ashes and state were created to return ad megabytes or sticker with a year so that's like it's a bit overkill now if we want to go back further then I actually did I am this hasn't been updated yet but I do have a mechanism which kind of doesn't much better and the idea basically you said you would store the last tube you would have one mechanism that stores the last two fifty six blocks then you would have enough to another mechanism that stores the last 6 15 the every 256 block for the last two fifty six blocks and then you have a mechanism to stores every 256 square blocks for the last up to two to six cubes and so forth so the idea would be like you would kind of have several copies of the same mechanism except they would have kind of different levels of frequency and dip at the same time go further back so a block individual block ashes would only be accessible within within a fairly short frame but if you're willing to restrict yourself to block numbers that are specific multiple then you could go back go back much further so the it's theoretically it's actually not that much more difficult to code up the but you know it was this would actually allow you to kind of basically hop from any blocks to any other bottom of watching and logarithmic time right for you okay but that's not the plan for now right i mean like if if needed I could always just right up and in a any IP for that just to let people can see kind of how easy or how complex it is well actually from any IPC endpoints the two are equal in complexity because the goals what the goal would be a bad set from the point of view of consensus code what you would actually be doing if you would be doing a call to a contract and it would be contract code that's running the logic and the contract code when you need that you would only need to be written one okay and then I have one more question which was you spoke about like a very fast sort of initial sync mechanism where we would be able to just go backwards very quickly by just giving the whole bash that's included yeah porridge not but if we're starting from some header wishes entirely disconnected from the Genesis then that attacker could just put in fakeblock ashes fake state routes we still have to walk backwards to verify the proof of works for all of those individual blocks to the Genesis 3 no sorry I'm still prefer actually so for this to work well basically you would actually need to have a somewhat different role you will need to have a block point to its ant points directly to ancestors the status that just accidentally end up satisfying a much higher proof of work threshold the idea would be that the probabilistic chain would end up being none of being almost as hard to falsify as or almost as hard to want to make a state copy of as creating an entire fake chain right so because like if you imagine if you see a blog where that block satisfies the difficulty what a thousand times higher than normal just by random chance then from a proof of formal proof of reward standpoint it's 4,000 times as much as the regular block so the goal would be like you would kind of try and find a chain containing all of the high all of the kind of high high difficulty blocks if you would use that as kind of probabilistic proof to show no this is the cheat this is a chain that I actually had a lot of people doing stuff on it interesting so it's sort of we find the key stone blocks that occur by coincidence exactly yeah okay yes I'm pretty reasonable yeah let's see ya the Belize that I'd even see it is that I think you might we need to meet to prove the correctness of what may be 10 or 20 key stone blocks so it is basically the algorithm on the server side would be is step one scan through the entire chain steps to find the 10 or 20 blocks to satisfy a difficulty threshold 100 sign 100,000 times higher than normal then step 3 use this kind of block hash blinking mechanism to prove a hash link pass from each one each one of these super blocks to the previous and then you would just in the mid ship it off as a proof you'll like client and the whole thing would be maybe like five or 10 kilobytes along and the one well let me find maybe like 10 10 to 50 kilobytes and the like line would be able to just kind of voice through it probably in a few seconds is there any proposal it's I can and I I haven't written enough so far because it's not consensus or we forget it's not baseball no consensus but I can also assign myself the task of doing that showing they don't the next one on the agenda which is e 100 change difficult adjustment to target being blocked I'll including Michael yes so this was originally posted by us or a response to a bug that was uncovered by Syria learner which is basically deep on coal mining an incentive issue and the idea here is that because right now the blocks time targets one unit of height growth / 14.3 seconds is like an evil theoretically a militia Skrtel of miners that one is a maximize its own revenue would actually have the incentive to make three blocks at every high level and in that way instead of earning and then just include each other as own calls and that way instead of earning five user / for 2.3 seconds that's normal it would end up earning something like 14th or every three seconds and now that that's the case if you have a perfect cartel but if you have even a single line or a single mining pool that has more than about twenty percent of hash power then you actually have incentive to do a kind of weaker version of the strategy to increase revenue so I mean the solution here basically is that to make us weak to the block cut to the difficulty adjustment rule so that in instead of targeting one block height increase per 14.3 seconds it basically instead of ends up targeting one block header / some about 13 seconds you know including or growth now there's a difference between version 1 a and version 1 beef in version one be basic which responds with one on come watch for too long cause of paying the same thing and even though this technically does so slightly weekend incentive compatibility but like even still you get like about maybe seventy percent of seventy-five percent of the benefit but the nice thing about this is that the loop the challenge was to uncle was treating one uncle in cubicles as being separate saying is video said you can't with you can't extract that information from the blog header confessing the blockade oh you just get the hash of the uncles but from the blog header you definitely can't tell the difference between one in0 headers because your headers just would be represented as the as the hash of the auto pmts and so that's something you can trivially check in the blog header so the idea with 1b would basically be that you attend you would be the block difficulty targeting rule would target a variable which is basically league one kind of unit for 13 seconds where the unit he has 11 / block and superb water contains either one or two uncles I personally those things reasonably done controversial it's an obvious except the first thing does anyone have any objections to paying at metropolis flicks strong preference towards the version which they realize in the block headers I think difficult calculations you like and black bodies is pretty strong change okay so all opposed to one be passed by yeah when I need to gather thing yep all right oh and we didn't actually make it an actual decision on mog 96 I mean it sounds as it sounds as though the decision is that people want me to kind of write up the basically rear up right off the version that have that kind of gold goes back further in history with with decreasing frequencies and right up the e ikea for the yell like line algorithm and then discuss it again next time around okay you have pics do this yeah I cope and like this next one is 196 197 pairing there's also a missing will actually no never mind yeah I thought 101 with my finger than I real or I remembered that one one was superseded by 198 so all good yeah Perry I can sound Christian you around we already talked about that in the very beginning hmm yes so something else so yeah being on something it but i guess but contain suppose yes basil see no tables not nothing okay ma I am I am happy to provide a number and number theory tech support to anyone trying to implement this and having problems that you're skating how it works think that what we appreciate it Vitaly did the Royal was a question about the expected resource consumption I get preparing linear the number of yeah fairy yeah like I think the get the resource consumption should be a a plus B times and where is a is a constant or Andy Air Corps constants and anahi as the number of arguments that get multiplied off does it make any sense to limit the number of parents or not rly um I'd say no I mean I know it's any reason why it's not just I'm right it's not that some of Jerry's need a lot of memory yeah now no good ND the the elliptic curve scalar multiplication that is similar to the experiment um what do you mean similar to exp the guests would probably know molecule the gas costs curl up the curve stuff should just be constant because we're sticking to one curve the scalar multiplication oh sorry scalar multiplication um now that should also be a constant archery oh I see because what what um so my opinion is that i don't really see many use cases in practice for scalars where the expected ask the value of it absolute value of a scalars was much less than pure latuda series so i just say make it a constant that depends on the maximum okay like what what's the last time that anyone has ever multiple i don't know what the curve points by 479 right like it's always a ransom 256-bit number ah i see yeah I mean yeah hmm okay inversion squaring that might be useful and capecchi prom but yeah probably dominated by the cost for the call anyway so yeah okay by the way speaking of costs for protocols can I just make a quick poll on the level of support for any idea that would reduce the cost of calls in this specific case of the destination is a precompile from 700 back down to 40 I think that'll be it at that costume cases because it has been problems I think so that sort of stuff yeah I think it was a put that too okay so 198 began potty corner yes um so the goal here is for example it's just modular exponentiation of big numbers and so basically if the data would be an encoding of three numbers well the encoding would be a very similar to what I go through the ABI bridge except we like followed by the three actual values and photo with the air kind of less strict it would just expect the legs fold followed by the concatenated byte arrays and it would return the base to the power of exponent module of the modulus but the only kind of this there's a couple of educators so one of those edge cases that what do you do a fee modulus is zero and my opinion is to throw the second edge case is a county auction to grow up the gas costs and we spent a bit of time arguing and since the last time the formula was slightly updated so that basically it's the floor of the max of maxim of the length of the modulus in the life of the base or well basically the takes a maximum of the likes of the modulus in the length of the base square that and multiply that by the length of the exponents with a minimum of one it's a like it is slightly more complex than one before but this removes kind of 22 risks where one is situations where the base is much larger than the modulus and the second year is a situation where the exponent is 0 so situations where the exponent is 0 basically are going to return one in all cases except those cases where the modulus is 0 in which case of throws yeah I mean that's basically all there is to it the rationale is to support both RSA and in general any kind of dig number cryptography as what about alex is coming from me to the effect that you know they took until to be enough for anyone what's the effect of that what and with the link field starting to be creative on page hold on all rights 32 bits I'm income I'm inclined to say making the lengthy old 32 bytes instead of 32 bits basically because like that's the way that the existing ABI worse and there's no reason not the stick device and I would even argue me here this will be more annoying because it's actually more difficult to construct 32 bits in EDM that it is to construct courage or is more complex to pack 32 bits and as the factory device Kurt so you know I'm inclined to kind of stick to a bi style I intend to change that it probably won't be in time this is okay well any objections all right um I guess moved her to make better passing the top of role in running it it seems like an obvious synergy with custom signature algorithm okay in which case that brings us to Joy six the reversal code until I Steven encoding a reversal code yes this is basically the kind of updated version of Yeti 140 whereas I understand the main changes that instead of the revert instead of like it providing an error code as a stack argument it was it would provide error information encoded in Vice that would be returned in the same way that the correct that called data for that right or return out what would be returned that's more or less the idea although it with some disagreement in the other whether or not Cole should return the returned outer area call fails or whether it should be hunted for a few job code I'm personally family the pinion those should return it with one you can use Ruby bad weather some discussion and the whether or not the call opcode should return the the value from rigored if the call fail or whether that should be whether to prime so Union you mean the Giza value they just pushed onto the stack of the river itself yes well there's a memory area specified by the values of the stack well what do you mean the memory specified by the values on the stack so as I understand one night at twice X as the idea is that the reverse opcode would have the same always an index of the return of code yes right um is there was so what's the odds run up to that well so the discussion is whether the call log code should populate memory with the data returned by rivers or whether it should be punted to some future Bob code for accessing question um and my instinct system my instinct is the word call me this is to when making calls you is directly my arguments are that number one it provides a nice symmetry is here as you are between return in reverse and the of the other arguments would be a bit avoids introducing you off codes and particularly it avoids introducing kind of useful new forms of temporary says and but that's a commanding you have personally I'm inclined to agree I mean there's a problem raised is that called and provide a good way to access the link for the return java certainly from my mind April shoulder not sure whether it returns from reversion well that's the problem we already had and we all get fixed okay so yeah if we add Sunday to size and that's that's a good pair to address it so you within data size end the trim type of coffee in that case would also with a couple of the result right yeah so icky i guess those would also be a off course that ends up kind of introducing a weird new kind of state of x of a runtime state hmm so i think that the thing that you have to we could keep the return date alive until the next call that's the thing basically yeah so can anyone think of a problem with gas here under the memory was paid for by the head Kali I don't I could problem but are there any other complications okay so basically what happens if the call eerie returns like fifty thousand bytes worth of worth of data that's basically and basically a kind of second memory array in some sense it memorized it was OD it doesn't increase a bit its memory that already has facebook already gets paid for in size are always yeah I mean it doesn't seem what there is from that standpoint that's what you have to do is you have to do a little copy probably because you you won't keep the full memory area of the cornea life gesture of its own part you have to where it could I mean he could pull my areas go to call you live you could young but whatever and agree that but how we handle that it will Hogan or warehouse would with a chlorine conservator yeah I mean I my own instincts of the procedures and like professionally settled enough yet to say definitely included as in Metropolis look I don't know what other people think we're already need you moving up cousin to release or adjustable to you with the idea that as long as it's an invalid opcode 60s unassign it was awkward so which is fine and it's recommended it doesn't waste any guess that's fair enough okay so how about I will commit to like summarizing our discussion here or maybe and we can see severe there an EpiPen okay and then the other one was 207 which is how contract should have come rivet data yeah it will use the facilitative italic I don't know whether you had something on sale let's see i mean i've already mentioned already give my comments which is that I think just for symmetry purposes we should like just use a bi and know if it's things that seems a lot more relevant if we're differently returning at from call as well because people going on to the same neighboring area I believe the original plan these are all this week the expectation was that the main thing xs and hopefully of chain debugging tools not necessarily anything on chain then I would argue that in will obtain people I'll change the blogging tools can don't necessary even need anything against return to revert off code because like the thing you could be radically do is you could just push it off a bunch of dummy variables and I was up yes anyone else want to comment and then the last item on the agenda is dead call equal mom sex follow-up questions so debating a story a question yes i [Music] think i'd like to say from that um you know there is a builder that you're called pull request is that yes same thing what not I know so the difference is that static calls can read state but they can't write your goals cannot reschedule it can operate it yeah yes what number is if your call alright 195 I think yep okay yeah so for pure calls the main use cases are we will prefer static call the use cases basically are that any constant function we're just you want to fear easily provide an assurance and it's not going to do a reentry attack on you and 41 for pure call the use cases are you one of them is just generally pure functional programming but the second one is Casper validation code I'd also very very useful for account abstraction yes so regarding static Cole I think it's important to note that it's want to usually go to game daletech type things we and what your reaction is simply to reverse the PM yeah but it's not a magic fix to all consumer all kinds of a reentry address the attacks it's just a particular wave that in some cases you can gain assurance that really attacks won't happen lower surface area so it can start across somebody know or some know aesthetical can't send value actually the hold on me just reread it i'll just make any modifications to the States but it can read from the state I think it looking I think it would be problematic aesthetic values because then you take a way to bypass and what was the reasoning about it not sitting with six million for instance again ya know basically that's like there is going to be real tricky attacks that involved but because if calls that are not that that are meant to change state but that are not meant to be reentrant so current saving money to someone so there was a question with a pier call can make your calls right a Greg recommended add me a nice person we don't care either way it's basically just flipping a bit if you implement if you're mr. pure calls to not be able to make any so one or initally approach also go to address if they get killed yet so that step site near casters yes yeah I 11 rationale we suppose for making to your calls be able to make your calls is that cure cost should be able to call freakin piles in because spring Apollo's are purists so you might as well want to make other kinds of your goals to me if that's so empirical is subject to the same sex death f 63 64 sing and the other solid yes yes i have to admit up a bit behind on creating for requests from the issues I hope I'll be able to catch up next week on that okay and there anything else oh well what we want to conclude on the pathetic and feel call um I mean I'm mm-hmm what is there any real specification on the pure it's one I key 195 yeah I think both pure and study hall are very useful and also quite easy to implement right that called things off hand ed edd empirical because he'll call requires taking code from the EDM that's just my gift but then I mean photos create easier mash okay it seems easy enough to me I don't know that well any other it when i read an opinion do we want us to go into the trop allah we both of them re okay all against we got that schedule vitalik we're in excellent okay anything else that's the end of the net saree edge in touch yeah yeah p 90 it was again last time someone mentioned problems with the white clan potential problem hope you all right yeah so i think the issue that was brought up is that like client seems that might be that might have a need to exit to re-execute a transaction in the context in which it was originally executed and for that reason they actually need to have the intermediate state route so basically it like provides so what that means they'll said removing intermediate state routes actually does have that we some cost um so personally I'm a bottle like anyone's don't give her one so here for you yeah okay so personally I am I let's kind of you know what's wrong a night on Yeti 98 then I was back when I first came up with it my main reasoning being that I've realized that the bottle next to scalability if it's so much average case performance as it is worst-case performance and like even with yet you know even with the IP 98 what you can still come up with a worst-case like sigilyph single transaction das attacks that would be able to would be is just totally not paralyzed able so yeah I mean like so I personally say it's a I even say it's much much lower priority than most other areas at this point so if we add the chopped and I put it first on the chopping block right now okay it was like that i know its toll work there's there still a benefit of increasing paralyzed ability I mean I personally be happy to like keep it continuing the discussion offline okay should we do that then I do have one I would say agenda item just something the way in the go team so we saw that the first began working on the life time for coffee and actually there is a parity life protocols back on their webpage which is kind of based on the left but a bit modified and I just wanted to draw them bring it up that perhaps it would be best not to diverge the life-science protocols because then we'll have a separate party island and a separate guest island the network so maybe it would be nice to start analyzing the lifetime for the boat to to eat make sure that we don't get to non-conforming protocols and then one that clients need to suck it up and give it up yes that wiki page is really strongly work in progress I'm in pretty regular communication with joel's already so I don't know yeah probably we can merge some of those changes back into a yes so I'm not opposed to it for sure can you guys special all finally yeah of course not all success there are hundreds like ideas that you guys are doing so it definitely would benefit both projects and the whole thing in general I just wanted to make want to be on the same page that we don't accidentally dream up to separate photo goes and then fight it out between them rather we should be in for a more constructive approach yes who I'm not sure about that you guys want to do it touei peas or or more personally or more directly between the things that's all right so I think the thing I'd really like to see in VIP is the v5 discovery protocol and understand that guests like client users is already and Arkady and I went over to the office and spoke with two looks about it a couple months ago and it seems like a good proposal I'd love to see this VIP start getting that standardized and implemented in parity as well and that's definitely a big step towards likewise what definitely I think Felix S&S wanted to document the whole thing but I think the problem was that it was always labeled experimental so they didn't want to spend too much time on it but is it appears to work more or less nicely I think yeah we should really put in the effort to get satellites properly IP for it so I'll try to focus Felix and try to convince him or short or maybe we can also have any food together DIC because it's a it's really awesome that you can just start the discovery protocol and immediately appears simply it would be really helpful for the test latitude and yeah I'd like to suggest we consider saving I mean separating these seats and these changes in two separate who were more hard fork and not just one big metropolis heart for I guess estimated personally I think that's probably worse I seeing what our progress is added on one from now and basically I seeing how realistic is so imagine I you concerned about deadlines are you concerned about technical risk from the fork are missing from both the technical risk the fact that this has to be implemented some pork has to be implemented within the next five months to like push the ice age back yeah that's one thing and I'm most concerned above doing two large changes in one go and of having a sufficient says test materials for consoles success how everything here interacts with everything else want to do all these changes so I'm prefer doing subgroup several more smaller Forks but I guess we don't it does not something we have to decide ER right now I guess it is probably at least at this stage it's feasible to start implementing basically everything and then see how it goes and we'll get a feeling on what need for testing and what can be done quicker yeah yeah thank you nothing that we don't have to discuss now but it would be nice maybe to schedule it for the next I'm making is for Miss before HD wala there's a VIP with derivation pass so I for the last few weeks I was working with integrating the lecture into gas and it kind of works awesomely it will probably release found a and but electric classical HD wallet so we can actually derive arbitrary accounts and that is also supported in gas for now I if you leave that eip proposal stage I think there are two competing derivation path being discussed the missing the whole debate is around adding an extra nesting zero nesting at the end or not the letter uses one path and certain wallets use an extra zero at the end and basically alternative the state it would be nice to kind of thrive on an official fat because more and more wallets for us and more and more clients market internetting HD functionality it will really really screw with users if we get the divergence app you can ice to fix that sooner rather than later I guess absolutely i think plug and play HD walls would be really amazing it has to reimplement their own you know custom protocols just hit the record says it's probably going to be significant overhead yeah the only question would be here like how how would this be displayed to the death and how that's will interact with it is just like randomly new accounts edit because Tony kind of your accusing account we use you we use same one all the time so we can change the abstraction a bit for example in the way you did it in gas or set introduced an extra layer of abstraction called wallet and then you can have a wallet can contain arbitrary money accounts and you I wise what's miss to do is that instead of just displaying flames let the town people also say that hey here's the legend wallet and there are five accompanist so basic just another grouping hmm ok the business yeah so the important actually most important current RPG and pointed East underscore account for most almost all that is different when they used in order to like no you were anyway they're working so that not does not tell me to care about about wallets I would think probably the IAM wallet if you just use your funds then you probably want to know which account are groups under which hardware dongle I don't think that should really care about but that does not only to create each account a new account after each transaction then also that you can just create as many as you want now you can create as many as much barely remember it is s so the question was about the if it is part of a serial method if we should make some kind of official decision about the duration tough right yeah and it'll so currently there are two competing specs and as more and more loss to the fear I'm guessing there will be more constructive yeah and the problem is that it's all I'm not sure what the trash new users or hip key for example maybe Nick you know I know that I only work with the letter and the lecture is already supported by I similar to RL damn you're asking what it gives us for what exactly so the derivation pass the base crash if i remember correctly uses one without the a very specific while [ __ ] up managing constantly done that will be nice anyway so it's just maybe we should have signed just leave the base is mostly pick one out of this year but i did have something i wanted to bring up previously which just it feels and what do people think of any possibility of a pre-compiled allows you to celebrate a new theory in prison with the idea being with a good allow easier cross-trained interaction answer to taste for them as a crucial again dude what parameter is exactly are your vision simple blog header gosh gosh mom yeah exactly just put a schism world and it would validate but it was too expensive to go there is a paper that states if a more contrasting can evaluate its own proof of work there's a chance of a 37.5 attack or something like that actually it I think to be to be fair that's still true if the smart object if there's another smart contrary watching and I canonicity the first for contract Bochy's proof of work and I'd also add that if people really want to well boy who actually implemented etsu verification if your aim already and if you're away it only takes about 4.1 million guess but that's still in untie block most through some rich and I mean I wait Abraham is just barely powerful enough to run into my client excellent I mean I my thought is just that as we see why the deposit to the theory we may well free consortium chains wanted to interact with the main chain of a little easier we make that some awesome become you so I actually I think of this was something that was overlooked in the beginning for a corporate competitive but she added yeah hmm there's an obvious thing we want to do the energy how much memory does it was it's correct this year and it should it should be a bit higher now which should be around 30 megabytes or so and absolute so I mean yeah regardless it's going to be pretty quickly there's a guest comments you know hopefully less than the four women members come soon agent Lee and I mean maybe the waist tightly into again but with my legs evolution anyway anyway I mean I can put together a really simple we proposal reason just post Monsieur on the tractor just to get some discussion yeah looking okay I I'm curious about what your favorability on deprecating the nice underscore compile our diseases i think is sort of unnecessarily solidifying the kind of language or tresa news right now and put it over burden and responsibility for the note preferably read that to development oh no no I'm inquiry real it could be like that should be fine for it to exist on a note of the basis there shouldn't be the echinacea makeover but it kind of also with the ability of adapt to use a specific version of a specific compiler so and also inclined to to duplicate it yes my little lip sing some sensible and yet also anyway it doesn't have a male team compiler it just called so see what everything falls on your machine so if you don't have it installed any foam for camera lenses okay then I'll probably dress up a quick little VIP for them all right anything further right click over to close come on are we going right yeah thank you coming up the one thing the next meeting is in exactly two weeks but I believe sorry 60 are cut okay I said oh the eib agenda said that every first and third friday of month and the base was actually on basically next week is s con and that's why it was I'm not sure whether it will be in two weeks or to be available for let's play hockey game okay okay right right have a nice evening it was hot you know
