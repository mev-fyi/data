foreign [Music] my name is sukino I am the maker of skitter I'm working with the PSE team and today I'm going to give a little demo of skater and before I go into demo I want to talk a little bit about why I make that um make scooter so we have a bunch of like social media application these days um what's the problem with that why do we need another one um so I think most people know that these platforms use the data against us they use our data to optimize fees optimize advertisements and kind of like course or you know whatever we want to use but they make us pay more attention to the stuff they want us to pay attention to based on you know how we use the data the problem with that is like if you have a small bias toward a worldview they will actually create an echo chamber to kind of make that small bias and turn that into like something more much more stubborn and much more difficult to change like I think both opinion by itself is already kind of divided without a slippery slope like this but with all these um optimizations it kind of turned our attention or it kind of make our opinion even wider between the two side of the Spectrum which is something that I think is problematic the feeling that I get when I make a posting on like Twitter or Facebook or you know centralized social media these days is like jumping into a ocean full of shocks basically I don't know when I'm gonna get bitten I don't know if they like me I don't know if they like something that I said in the past but it feels like at any point they can like attack me cancel me and if I got canceled I'm basically die socially like I lose my Social reputation I lose my friends it's a problem um here's one of my favorite group man is at least himself and he talks in his own person give him a mask and he will tell you all the truth um which is why I am making skitter as a Anonymous Twitter basically I want to build features that gets for any toward Anonymous users allow them to say whatever they want while still having some kind of reputations that way we can identify like what kind of pose is more highly reputable more credible what kind of posts are like trolls and should post so instead of doing a live demo I take screenshot instead because internet is pretty bad but the website is live and I highly encourage everyone to try it out for this use case I'm demoing how to create Anonymous users using your wallet so in security you basically can create one of two different identity you can either create a wallet address identity which is pretty self-explanatory for anonymous users here's what you do so first of all you connect to your Twitter account and once you connect to your Twitter account you will be assigned one of the few groups based on your reputations um this is in this integration with internet basically allow us to have four tiers and read it I think bronze over and go and after that we'll create a semaphore identity um and in order to do that instead of doing a random identity we are deriving it from a sign Matrix through your wallet that way if you lose it you can always connect your wallet and we'll be able to recover your identity so after that you are you know you're done you are you are now able to make different posts um using the enormous identity that you created right here we we can see a couple of different identity already being used there's a tier for Twitter users with over 2000 followers I think that's a isk and sorry for attacking you um we also have a Tac member so if you visit our temporary Anonymous Zone later on today you will be able to join us a THC member and you can make posts without you know showing who you are um and then there's another Twitter tier right there um and next I'm going to next I'm going to demo and other features um so what I just demo is the ability to create groups based on your Twitter reputations um this one is more for users who want to create private groups so here I have a account it's called PBX fan club any Rick and Morty friends with no Mr Poopy butthole has a lot of fans a lot of families um you can basically add your profile make that a group profile and after you make the group profile you can send invitations to different members um and now that I switched to my account I can see that I receive an invitations from Mr Poopy butthole and after accept the invitations when I'm trying to make a post I will actually have the options to insert a post sukino I can choose to post as a member of pbh fan club and people can you know create their own group experiment with you know any kind of things that they want to do and the next features I want to show is CK thread which I think is really cool so basically I kind of built like a regular chat message is enter and encrypted um that you can use to talk to anyone in the network the difference is when you initiate a chat with someone say right now I'm trying to talk to sequino yes Yagami light I can choose to talk to him as Yagami which you know he will see my message and my profile and my name or I can actually talk to him secretly um he wouldn't know who I am but um I can choose to reveal to him in this chat or not but this kind of give us an idea of like how these reputation different kind of identity can work with each other um and as more and more groups get created you can think of use case such as you have a group for every style member who has make a vote on certain doubt and then you can speak as a member of the Dao and you can use that identity reach out to someone and that would allow you to again give a person a master would be more likely to tell you the truth and they will be it will give more honest opinion about your protocol your ideas your worldview or whatever um that's kind of it for the demo we have a lot of like new ideas new features coming up feel free to come to me uh come visit me at um the temporary and Amazon I will be there the rest of the day and tomorrow and here's my profile and scooter feel free to check it out again the internet is pretty bad but please check it out at home um yeah thank you thank you um we do have a bit of time for questions I see a couple hands up hello um stupid question why don't you just be anonymous on Twitter um so if you're anonymous on Twitter how do I know um like so when so I do have Anonymous account on Twitter when I create the account the ability that I lost is all the followers that I used to have I either have to ask for some of my friends to follow me again which I will talk to myself um or I have to like use my real life account to kind of retweet it which again products myself um but with this we can bring in Twitter reputations we can bring in GitHub applications we can bring in the rotation from other places add it to your account without turning back to who you are and now when you create another account you will have higher visibility you have higher credibility without having to start from zero of course and sorry my team so I'm going to add also you can choose when you post how much you reveal about your identity within skitter so you can be totally Anonymous when you post or you can sort of Reveal Your Skin right underneath so you have a lot more flexibility which I think is really cool um over here so is there any optimization of your feed at all I'm just trying to think about if I got a feed that was highly rated stuff but absolutely random it might be hard to use um so you mean if there's any post ranking currently in in the fees like if somebody posted content that would be divisive like to a small subset of people would be appropriate and they'd want to see it but to everybody else they're like why is this being sent to me I'm just trying to understand like how users are serves things that they want so right now I'm basically serving things if with a very simple algorithm I'm ranking it um chronologically and I'm assigning them reputation score and that's how I rank each post um like moderation is a big problem that I have not solved yet right now I'm basically trying to make sure the like as much content and data is shown to your users without hiding stuff but the way that I imagine that would happen is you would follow key opinion leaders in the space and in your home fees you'll only see um the content from the people that you that you follow okay thank you uh hi hi I'm not sure if you if you touched on that but what's how do you verify that the Twitter account is actually yours and what's up the risk of somebody just renting the Twitter account with 5000 users for people who just want to claim something well that is definitely a problem um Elon Musk their person who just bought Twitter couldn't really solve their problem so for me like it's not really a problem that I'm trying to solve um as in if people bought an account of their friends there's no way for me to verify it um Twitter can verify it and they might shut down their account and then that's how I would like change the reputation I would probably backwards slash that person that way that reputation doesn't exist anymore but that's kind of the problem when you use real life or when you do centralized reputations you are forced to trust the reputation um where that is provided by the Twitter API versus on skidder um their all the data is actually on an open Data Network that you can carry and you can verify um so in a sense like I'm trusting Twitter to provide me with real accounts and real data and maybe some of the account may be fake but that's something that like they have to fix and once they fix it I will remove that repetition from the users
