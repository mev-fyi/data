[Music] hello everybody my name is Andy Millennia's and I'm here from Maker Dao one of the oldest and most ambitious projects in aetherium and today I'm gonna be talking about the prospect of financial reform in the 21st century and to do that I have to bring it back to basics in a few months the Bitcoin Genesis block will turn ten years old and I think that it will be remembered as one of the few monumental events of the first decade of the 21st century and that is because it is so cool it is such an interesting and fascinating example of internet-enabled global coordination right a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and we've all heard this tagline so many times it seems very familiar at this point peer-to-peer it's our bread-and-butter electronic we spend our entire lives and electronic spaces but I actually think cash system goes a bit unexamined in this space and that is the part that I want to talk about today what is it that makes Bitcoin a cash system right Bitcoin at least in my opinion takes advantage of a very ancient concept called commodity money right this is a concept that is at least nine thousand years old corresponding with the rise of Agriculture and it allowed groups of people that otherwise didn't know each other to interact and coordinate and share resources right using a medium of exchange that had value because of its underlying usefulness just like Bitcoin was originally attractive because of its underlying usefulness in the form of digital Portability and uncensor bull nature and like a commodity bitcoins fixed supply and predictable inflation allows it to behave in a way that takes advantage of these ancient concepts but this is actually only part of the story of cash systems when we look at the historical record because commodity money has not been used as a dominant cash system for the majority of human history and with the appearance of aetherium we have an opportunity to explore new types of cash systems and that's where we get to die see areum's peer-to-peer electronic cash system what is it what makes it different it is based on the concept of credit it's a much much older tradition that spreads back even farther than commodity money and it is very powerful and foundational to what makes us human and it starts with the principle of mutual credit this is even older than the rise of Agriculture and in fact spreads back at least to the appearance of modern human behavior and the principle is simple I know you will find it similar because it is the simple idea of thanks I owe you one right this is probably how you interact with your close friends and loved ones thanks I owe you one right if I do you a favor and you do Bob a favor and Bob does me a favor then a whole bunch of work got done and we didn't even need any money at all and this is how humans primarily interact at the human scale when everybody knows each other and it works really well but we want to coordinate at larger scales something has to change right and that's where money comes into the equation and thanks I owe you one evolves into IOU five of something right becomes quantifiable and that is when the project of civilization begins five thousand years ago and we see the first credit backed ledger money as the city's arise in the Fertile Crescent and the first temples are built we see that they serve a function as the first debt clearing houses in the first writing that we see on the Kuna farm tablets are actually debt agreements so these forms of commodity money are laid up in temple warehouses and debt is issued against these assets there's a 5,000 year old concept that we're dealing with here we see so many complex and sophisticated instruments that appear as the historical record comes online whether it's long term debt agreements annual crop finance or most importantly IO use promissory notes for these valuable assets that can then be taken down to the market and exchanged as money a very very old concept right and credit systems are essential to what makes civilization possible and the together credit systems and civilization go on many different adventures evolving twisting and turning and eventually four hundred years ago it becomes the modern commercial credit system and this does not coincidentally correspond to the rise of capitalism right there are two main characteristics that we can point to when we talk about the modern commercial credit system one the rise of fractional reserve banking and to the issuance of paper banknotes and this was so useful so adaptable and so decentralized that it was able to keep pace with the all of the different discoveries and innovations that attended the rise of the scientific method and because it was so useful adaptable and decentralized it basically remained in place and didn't really change for most of the history of capitalism until 40 years ago when the internet first appears and this is when we see monumental transformations in the way that humans relate to credit systems whether it's the rise of ATMs credit card networks or e-commerce all of this stuff is enabled by the Internet but most of these networks the three that I just detailed there talked about how we can use the Internet to connect to legacy networks whether it's the visa Network or the New York Stock Exchange a lot of times they're enabled by cyberspace but they are rooted in the logic of previous systems and it isn't until we see cryptocurrency that we see a financial system that is completely endogenous to the Internet and can only exist within the logic of cyberspace and so how these cryptocurrency relate to credit systems well that is where die comes in the die credit system has been live for almost one year if you look at this diagram it should look very familiar right it's because we're dealing with five thousand-year-old concepts here we're using the blockchain to make them even better here on the Left we see crypto assets oddly all diamond-shaped in the center we've got again a credit Clearing House this time a smart contract something that we can all trust on a global scale and then on the right coming out as debt against these assets is die very very familiar very easy to understand right and we can go deeper how does this actually work on the micro scale on the micro economic scale well it deals with the concept of secured debt most of the debt in the world is secured against assets like I keep saying and if you see here what the diagram they have on the screen is what's called a collateralized debt position a CDP in maker lingo and like all secured debt when a user takes their assets and escrows them into the maker's mark contract system they can issue die against them as debt but they can never issue more or die than the value of the asset itself this is just a rule about all secured debt nobody anywhere in the world of secured debt ever lets you issue more value than the value of the collateral that you've locked up in this case eath right and if you want an example very simple example consider the humble mortgage if you want to buy a $200,000 house the bank will lend you one hundred and sixty thousand dollars to do it with the downpayment making up the difference here on the right we see our CDP with eath and died and the only difference is that the ratio of die to eath is a little bit different than the ratio of dollars to house now why is that it is entirely a function of risk and volatility in the marketplace now unfortunately I think that we can all admit that cryptocurrency is a little bit more risky than real estate and so you cannot issue as much died against it as you can issue dollars against real estate but how do we know this though how do we actually make this decision you know more importantly who makes this decision and that is where we get into the mkr holders MKR is a second token it is the administrative token of the system and its holders comprise a decentralized regulatory community that come together and make those decisions about the nature of reality the nature of risk in the marketplace they are tasked with coming to consensus about which types of assets can be used as collateral in the system and the ratio of dye that can be issued against those assets and the fee whenever somebody locks their collateral up into the system if they want to retrieve it later they have to return the dye that they issued plus a fee based on how long it was outstanding and this fee is transferred to the value the aggregate value of mkr as a reward for their services right because they're very much providing a service to the network and in exchange no sorry on the other side if they make a mistake and they misjudge risk in the marketplace then the aggregate value of MKR is actually used to protect the integrity of dye and this is very very important right because if we look at the responsibilities in the roles of MKR at the macro level then what they're responsible for doing is actually protecting the integrity of dye and protecting its stability and usefulness in the marketplace we wanted to be a useful cash system right it's very very important and so when we look at the macro level the job of the MKR holders because dye is a unique currency the job of the EM care holders actually looks a lot like central bankers and so we can learn lessons from central bankers when the MKR holders do their job and the most important one I think that really has a significant impact is this idea of central bank independence a few decades ago it was discovered that by making central banks independent from the electoral cycles then they could make more long-term decisions that would be beneficial for the health of the economy and I think that the principle sort of makes sense if you think about it right if a politician wants to be reelected they might make short-term decisions to kind of gas up the economy to the detriment of long of the long term right and so this idea of central bank independence was introduced as a tool in their toolbox to allow them to do their job and maker takes it a step further because not only are we separate from any one country's electoral cycle but we are independent from all countries electoral cycles right in my opinion maker Dow died and MKR is one of the most international ideas of the decade was literally started in a chat forum in cyberspace in this non-jurisdictional space that we call the blockchain right and died and mkr exists on every inhabited continent and they are entirely in the space in between these countries right it's such an international coalition that we've built here and that is a tremendous that provides tremendous value to the integrity of the project and it's not just like a nice aesthetic it actually goes a step further because there are economic forces that we can use to our benefit the most important one my opinion is the trifid dilemma the trifid dilemma there is a natural tension that emerges when one currency is doing double-duty both as a national currency for some specific country and as a world reserve currency the currency that countries use when they interact with each other whether it's the US dollar or the British Pound Sterling or the Dutch Guilder many many national currencies have been world reserve currencies and they have all suffered from the tripping dilemma and this tension exists in the space between the desire to curb domestic inflation it's basically a desire to control the money supply and put a dampening on it make sure that it doesn't overheat and over expand and this global demand four dollars bre four world reserve currency because if everybody in other countries is using it to interact then they need it they need to actually get it and they want to expand the money supply to get it so there's global demand for this currency and there's national desire to keep it under control and this tension has pulled apart every single currency that has done this double duty it's widely understood that it's responsible for killing the Bretton Woods system this rigid system of exchange between gold and dollars and when dollars were used as an international reserve currency there was simply too much demand for the amount of gold that there was but this is not just a historical fun fact it actually has real effect in the modern day and if I may quote directly from dr. Zhao Xiao chuan of the governor the governor of the People's Bank of China he says the desirable goal of reforming the international monetary system is to create an international reserve currency that is disconnected from individual nations and is able to remain stable in the long run thus removing the inherent deficiencies caused by using credit based national currencies I have simply never heard a stronger call for exactly what maker is trying to do if you look at the date there you said it's in March of 2009 that is incredibly important right because that was one of the most hopeless moments of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 this is when this idea first appears right and I think that this sentiment sort of kicks off a new age in global human coordination and I call it the financial Reformation and I call it that because I believe it bears a lot of resemblance to the Protestant Reformation if you think back to history the Protestant Reformation was kicked off on Martin Luther indignantly nailed a public message onto the front door of his church and we see the same thing with Bitcoin right the Bitcoin Genesis blog has this Dignan inscription on the first message what is the first idea of Bitcoin the times o 1 o 309 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks right like the Protestant Reformation people who are involved in the financial Reformation are not asking permission nor forgiveness from the large institutions that they take issue with they are simply reorganizing their society at the grassroots level in a way that they can have direct interaction with these forces that organize their lives right it was incredibly important this era that has begun you know I think that we don't actually give it enough explicit respect when we talk about we're at and why we're doing what we're doing because the alternative is very very dire the stakes are very high we all can admit it the stakes are very high when we look at global problems and challenges today and the fact is if we miss this chance at financial Reformation then the alternative is unspeakable we simply cannot miss this chance and we need to seize this opportunity and reorganize our lives right I don't even want to comment on the alternative and if you look at history you will see for yourself what happens when humans miss an opportunity at Reformation now this financial Reformation is where maker I think comes in the most and becomes the most relevant and I think that there are three main areas that actually highlight the strong use case for blockchains in the maker Duff system the first is transparency this is the key innovation in my opinion and it is actually I think a bit underappreciated in black chains but it is entirely essential to what makes maker a compelling project this idea of real-time auditability this idea that anybody in the world any potential customer of the system can look for themselves and see every single feature every single modern or sorry current condition of the and verify for themselves that it is in fact trustworthy if I went to a commercial bank today and I said show me your entire loan book I'm gonna see all the assets under management I want to see your whole risk profile and I want to see it real time they tell me to get lost right but in maker this is entirely the logic of what's happening there's no other way that the system can even possibly exist it's incredibly important when we talk about financial Reformation right but it doesn't just stay with the technology it actually bubbles up into the culture and that's where we get to decentralize scientific risk assessment awhile back I said that the MKR holders are responsible for coming to consensus on the nature of reality right that means that they have to share knowledge and agree on what is the truth if we look in history at decentralized knowledge sharing systems in the past we quickly arrived at the academic system the scientific method the system of peer review right this is what the mkr holders are currently realizing that they need to interact with each other because this is a far-flung international coalition who talked to each other online remotely over the Internet possibly never having met in person how are these people going to talk to each other and come to consensus on the nature of reality it has to be evidence-based rational repeatable articulate and candid right this is how the MKR holders have already committed to coordinate amongst each other this is so important right because the alternative to this the alternative to this commitment to articulate to communication is incoherence and obscurity and I think that this culture is actually what a lot of what made the financial crisis of 2008 possible right it was this culture of obscurity that we saw in Wall Street this collusion with the credit rating agencies this corporate doublespeak euphemisms this in same concept of moving risk off the books how they would shake quantum models in your face if you ask too many difficult questions and it was in this culture that we could have an insane phrase like super senior tranches of high-grade multi-sector CDOs literally mean the exact opposite right and what we got was an imperfect picture of reality where financial engineers were hailed as masters of the universe when it turns out they didn't know what they were doing at all it was monkey business the entire time this monkey business had dire consequences right we quickly Swit slipped into moral hazard territory and this the taxpayers had to step in and bail out all these banks the bailouts of I remember the bailouts of 2009 and I remember them as some of the most profoundly unfair experiences of my life right it was amazing this indoctrination of free-market ideology for decades and decades and decades suddenly conveniently suspended when everything went wrong and profits after being privatized for decades and decades and decades were suddenly turned into socialized losses overnight right this was very unfair and I don't even blame the government regulators and the agencies that did what they had to do I understand that the way that the system is set up left them with no other choice but make no mistake the problem did not go away and if we don't take advantage of this opportunity to reform the system then it will come back because that is what a moral hazard is exactly right like it doesn't go away unless you take a new look at how you're organizing that I think is the second point that maker can really bring an opportunity for in financial reform and it's this idea that we are bound by our rules this idea of code is law it's so familiar but when you apply it to maker it makes so much sense because we're talking about aligning incentives and we're talking about a rational system where we can understand the rules up front and MKR restricts itself intentionally and it can't do a lot of things that normal banks can actually do MKR holders cannot repos repossess the collateral they cannot move debt off the books they cannot create die unilaterally against without without following the rules of the system right these rules clear as day and written inscribed on the blockchain are what make the system trustworthy on a global scale because anybody knows no matter where you're from no matter what walk of life you are from you are going to be treated fairly according to the rules and you have enough VM Care holders undertake to change the rules that too is bound by rules it is rules all the way down and these rules based systems are such a huge opportunity to create global coordination mechanisms that are trustworthy and this is really important because it brings my third point of financial Reformation and it's this idea that die is globally accessible die needs to be trustworthy but more importantly die needs to be globally accessible this is another cool sort of fact about blockchain is a cool sort of feature this idea that anybody I love this about Bachchan's this idea that anybody in the world matter where you're from if you found out about a blockchain if you found out the blockchain and thought it was cool and understood what was going on then you could participate nobody could stop you you were invited to participate and share in the wealth that we're all creating this is really really important because a large amount of economic activity is not being welcomed and included to participate sixty-one percent of all workers in the world are not formally employed that's two billion people that were not on boarded into the global financial system they just were never invited right and it is clear after all this time that the top-down pyramid-shaped system of nation state capitalism that we have today is simply not adequate to get these people on line we didn't we need a new type of thinking if these people are ever going to be included in the global financial system and all of their productivity and all of their hard work will never be recognized and they will never have the financial tools to take control of their own lives until we start thinking in a different way and that is not an insignificant amount of productivity we leave 10 trillion dollars on the table by not treating these people with the respect that they deserve the people of the informal economy right informal economy in aggregate is the world's third biggest economy and these if we can endeavor to come up with a system that respects the sovereignty of the workers of the informal economy then global productivity will only benefit right so how does the informal economy actually relate to us sitting in this conference hall right now well it's typically through the global supply chain this is how it interacts a lot of goods are created informally at the bottom of the global supply chain and then they bubble up to the market places like where we're sitting here in Europe and this brings us back to history if we look at the history of credit systems then it is almost always the case that credit systems experience initial traction around the concept of trade finance trade finance is very much related to the global supply chain because it's all about moving goods from where they're produced to where they're sold moving goods to market this is exactly what the global supply chain is all about and the fact that these historical credit systems see traction around here around this type of financial activity gives me a lot of hope and makes me very excited about some of the partnerships that we've made in 2018 whether it's with trade shift a platform that is trying to digitize supply chain interactions and has already 1.5 million businesses signed up or if it's wire which makes it easy to translate dye into over 30 national currencies these are huge opportunities and more importantly they're opportunities that have a historical track record of giving traction to these new types of credit systems and this brings me I think to my final point possibly the most important it's this idea that maker symbiotic with all other DAPs in the ecosystem this is huge we need each other because maker needs other daps to create wealth and utility and useful crypto assets to serve as the base of Di's monetary supply and all of these DAPs need maker to issue to come together and coordinate a useful cash system for the etherion blockchain so we are so in this together and I feel like this year was the year that the flywheel started to get going you know there's so many gaps that came out this year that I encountered that simply could not exist without having died as a useful medium of exchange to make everything work and it's so exciting we've interacted with these daffs and we're so committed to incubating this ecosystem because it is exactly where we are placing our faith and our trust so if you have an idea and you know how you can take advantage of all the work that we've been doing on die then please reach out and come and contact us because we are so so incentivized to make it work for you right so please come to our booth up on the third floor and say hello if you have any ideas at all because we really want to be at the center of where all of the activity is happening on aetherium I think this is a good place to conclude right because what I'm seeing this year with the rise of maker and all of the growth that we've been doing in the etherium ecosystem is this idea that we're finally beginning to unlock our potential there's so much potential in what we're doing here and I think that with maker and all of the interesting projects that we are enabling and working with I think that that potential is finally being unlocked so if you're ready to be a part of this and unlock your potential then please reach out and get in touch and thank you so much I'm very excited about the future you you
