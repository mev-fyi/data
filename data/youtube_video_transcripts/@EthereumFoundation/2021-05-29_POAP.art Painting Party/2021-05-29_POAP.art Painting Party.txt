[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Music] one hi everyone that joined us said that kind of weird i am super fizz from the east staker community and i'm really glad that we've had such a great turnout for this road to devcon painting party i'm joined with a bunch of people but i know that the painters want to get started and so what i can shoot out to you really quick is that if you want to claim the poep to begin participating with the canvas you're going to message the poep bot that is uh on discord capital p capital o capital a capital p dash b o t pound zero zero nine four and you're going to send that poe bot the word columbia c-o-l-o-m-b-i-a um the bot will respond with a link and you'll be able to use that link to claim your poe app which will give you access to the canvas and we wanted to get that out of the way very first so that you can get started if you have any trouble with that in just a few minutes we're going to turn things over to logic beach and he's going to demo things actually did we just decide that he wants to lay the center pixel first yeah okay let me turn it over right now to logic beach because everyone's here to paint and then we can get into business as soon as that's rocking and rolling all right hey guys i'm logic beach i've been helping uh coordinate some of these guilds i'm gonna show you just the basics of the canvas man i should have this pulled up already there we go uh-oh some lines all right so um once you get your po app once you claim it you will connect your wallet it will find your poep it it is now seen that i have the po app and so i'll sign a transaction to join or to sign in all right so now what i'm going to do is as you can see here i'm going to place this red dot right in the center of deva's face here between our eyes but what i'm going to do is i'm going to look for the center pixel real quick uh 2 i want 256 by 128 nice okay so hopefully we'll get the color red right i should have probably had the color lined up oh no right there okay it is placed oh no so there's a green one there uh so what i just did is i placed that one i'm now going to place this one two over and this one too over to the left uh someone's trolling a little bit okay no someone's got the picture we got it going okay as you can see people are starting to see the picture of deva and getting it going cool um another thing to note is that you can easily change colors on the fly by right clicking them and matching color like that okay it looks like someone plays so well you can't do that with white apparently i've tried that earlier so you actually have to select white to place white pixels alright so deva is started but it looks like it's maybe misaligned one second one second we're gonna get this that one there that one there all right so what you're looking at right wait a minute what's going on here one there is a cooldown of one second just so you know you can't just keep placing so what you're seeing right here is just this area of deva i wanted to mention that anyone that helps uh create the devacenter piece will get the friends of devapo app um there will be a raffle down the road for that uh it's gonna be a lot of fun so thank you anybody that can work on deva uh aside from that once all of the um guilds have like their pictures made if you guys are freed up and you want to help anybody jump over to landscape guild they can use as many people as they can handle they're going to create like a cool wash and background of um just any free space it's going to be a good time yep that's about it for me i think thank you so much logic beach um i would like to point out for the record that superfiz did place a blue pixel and i need that um sorry yeah uh so welcome and we wanted to get that out of the way first we're gonna go back and talk a lot more about the canvas today um but this is kind of an overarching event in the road to def con it is our painting party um and we have a lot of guests here both from um devcon and from poep and from eatstaker so really quick i want to shout out the east staker team uh and then i'm going to turn it over to skyler and he's going to shout out his team and then we'll have a little bit of conversation i am super fizz i um am a dude who hangs out in each staker and um tries to positively engage the community um we think of eat staker as welcoming first and knowledgeable second and uh we always look forward to people joining us patricio worth halter hello patricio is a core member of eatstaker and he also is the man behind poep so he wears a lot of hats sometimes we're not sure how he keeps going um we also are joined by our friend colfax hey guys on vedica.eth hello uh and i should say colfax did a lot of the organization from the east staker side um on vedica uh is running our uh our systems right now so thanks to those guys um and our master organizer is great wizard hello everybody um and our dude who knows everything that none of us else know is lamboshi also known as nolan hello uh we also have a bunch of other guests just uh so jeremiah is here from eath staker um i logic beach is a special guest today we're glad to have uh i see mono mesa um a bunch of poap staff mario nakanti is here glad to have you and uh defy dude we're very glad to have you as well and skyler i'd like to give you a chance to um do your intros and then we'll rock on right on right on thanks thanks super fizz um so yeah i'm skylar i'm uh you might have seen me in the discord there a little bit i'm stoked to be here glad everyone uh is joining us on our first quest event of the road to devcon they're technically our second quest um and yeah we have a couple other team members from the dev con team here as well uh we've got a keel who's helping us out with some ux design on our website if you guys have seen that late recently updated uh he's he's uh been a big part of that franzi who's helping us out with our community involvement efforts on devcon we have tomo in here who is helping us out with a lot of our graphics and uh and branding design and liggy who assists us with everything related to anything technical uh and i think i think that's about all we have in the team here on this call we have quite a few other team members on the dev con team who didn't make it here uh as it's kind of late in their time zone but uh nonetheless we're happy to be here we're stoked to be painting pixels with you guys all and uh uh and yeah i'll guess i mean super fizz uh anything else you want to cover you are on mute it's it's funny i have a standard meat reaction that only michael knows which is to flail my arms but um patricio would you like to uh tell us just a little bit about poap art and the team that you have joining us today yeah sure um so although we are doing this for having fun and the reason why we invented polapart is because we wanted to showcase that by using decentralized technologies powered by ethereum and you can do things that you couldn't do with any other tech and because this idea that you have a collaborative canvas that multiple parties can shine that doesn't require to sign up doesn't require you disclosing any personal identifiable information it only requires a non-functional token that you could capture and elsewhere it's a novel mechanic and on our mission on putting ethereum on the hands of the mainstream this is a nice way to showcase that ethereum is not all about d5 it's not only about financial applications there are there are many non-financial applications that are enabled by ethereum that are uh leave ahead for humanity so we call this an experiment at the intersection of art and tech this is actually the second pop-up canvas we run it's been an effort of more than 20 people many of them at this call so thank you very much everyone hopefully we keep getting better and better every time and and now i'm going to focus on my painting bye-bye thanks patricia uh one of the things we realize is the poep art team so for a while this is fun for all of us they are all intensely monitoring the platform to make sure that our fun goes off without a hitch um and with that in mind i want to say if something if something goes berserk don't worry um it's this is a learning experience for everyone um and we're all gonna be fine and have fun um and so skyler it's it's funny um we've been planning this this for probably a couple weeks and i was like wait i don't want to get to know skylar let's wait until the call and then we'll be like it'll be like we're meeting each other for the first time so um how's it going it's going well it's going well so i'm curious what what is your role with uh defcon yeah right on um so i am technically i guess the defcon operations lead so helping to sort of make and oversee the team at large for this upcoming devcon um i've been involved with devcon now for the past few years since defcon 3. um super passionate about it for those who haven't attended or maybe even don't even know what devcon is um devcon's the annual ethereum developers conference um it's it's really like uh for those who are in the community already it's like a global family reunion everyone comes together has a lot of fun learns a lot collaborates a lot for those who are new to the community it's like an intense introduction into what what uh what the what ethereum is about from so many different angles so it is technically we call the developers conference but it's really um it's really for a lot more than that we do try to keep it fairly technical from a talk perspective and um and from perspectives like that but really the whole community comes whether you're a developer a designer researcher project manager whatever um it's a really really good time that's awesome uh and so i've been involved with ethereum uh well it's the beginning for me so since the crowd sale since the white paper since you know the olympic test net and i've never been to a def con and so um i've always felt so intimidated uh and one of the things that i'm hoping about this kind of event is that we can lower that that intimidation bar and so allow more people to feel like it's accessible to them um do you think that's that's gonna happen yeah absolutely so i think i think um it is fair i think it could be a little intimidating from from hearing about it at first and hearing that it is the developers conference but one thing we do try to do and are trying to do with this upcoming iteration is make it recognize that the people that people come with all backgrounds so some people are completely new to devcon some people completely new to the theater makes it ecosystem uh so making sure that we have pro content for um for backgrounds of all types while still recognizing that a lot of like brilliant intelligent researchers are there trying to discuss the latest and greatest of who knows what um we still need to have these very technical topics but also welcoming uh those who are who are fresh to the community and and devcon was actually my first introduction devcon 3 was my first introduction to ethereum i'd known about before uh learned about it's been sort of on the on the perf fields um and arriving at devcon and attending some of these talks and just hearing the like being around so many crazy intelligent researchers developers talking about things that are uh well like they weren't just talking about the price of ether they were talking about uh how we can solve problems that the world is facing right now using ethereum what kind of technological things we need to we need to improve and while some of the talks were over my head it was kind of what made me commit to the community and and made me realize that the people working on this this stuff are some of the smartest in the world right now yeah it's it's so funny like i i like to imagine i know a lot of this stuff imagine that i know a lot of it um and then i hear donkered talking about kate commitments and i'm like explain that to me one more time and i'm like i still have no idea what's going on so yeah i i think you know the important thing is that ethereum hits so many levels for so many different people um and we just need to recognize that as mere mortals we're not going to get everything but there's still a lot to be gained from participating um and so to zoom out on the big picture we're here today on the road to devcon why aren't we buying tickets for devcon it's a great question i think a lot of you probably have a hint um as to why not but uh but yeah so right now devcon is unfortunately indefinitely postponed um so it's usually usually takes place in the fall we had postponed it last year once postponed again this year um and we while we are staying optimistic that uh and while we're thinking optimistic that things are improving and things are improving around the world i i don't know how many of us here have their vaccinations but that wasn't possible just just a month few months ago probably um and so things are getting better we're staying optimistic that we can have devcon soon although timelines are still pretty indefinite um so in the meantime we launched the road to devcon efforts so we want to keep the community engaged uh learning uh and collaborating uh and so with road to devcon we have also introduced the concept of quests this being one of the first quest events that we've had where we kind of come together um experiment some web free technology talk about things related to devcon also hopefully expose a little bit more about the east acre community uh and some other communities in future quests perhaps that are are also um important in the ethereum community and good uh good representations of what we're about um and so so yeah this is a quest on the road to devcon we also take uh and accepts community ideas requests so if you're if you're sitting there thinking about um something something that we could perhaps do collaboratively with the group that you're a part of in the community reach out to us and uh let's chat about it great so and i have to say um from the east staker perspective i am elated to be engaged with the devcon crew um and with the poep crew this this synergy of three different communities working together to do one neat social project um is it's exciting i don't think you see that in a lot of different uh different worlds you know everyone keeps to their own little group uh so this is a neat experience uh and i'm really glad to be here um so we're gonna switch gears just a tiny bit um you know why we're here we're here the road to devcon we're learning about what's coming up with devcon uh and i imagine there are a lot of people who are busy dropping pixels like n whoever c h o l is um and so that's not gonna dude listen man nobody i i can't even get my paint tools up so i don't even know who drew that yeah somebody loves you man um i'd like to to hand off to patricio and logic beach and colfax um as they kind of take us through our next steps sweet hey guys uh nice to see you on colfax here as superfist said a member of the east acre community uh patricia did a quick little intro of pull up.art and sort of what we're going to be doing here on the party and many of you are familiar with po art or pull up already but if you're not i'm gonna actually show you right now how to claim your poep and how you can go ahead and get started participating in the drawing so i'm gonna share my screen here real quick all right so here i am on discord so the way you're gonna claim the poep is join the road to devcon discord server which is this one that i'm looking at right a second to load and right here you're going to look for the poet bot v2 there's the poet bot on this discord server as well as other discord servers i message the poet bought on this discord server so you're going to look for the pull up out here and then right click it and click message and now i'm going to send the message the secret word which is columbia c-o-l-o-m-b-i-a and it is going to send back a link and you click that link it's great to see that's working live um because i know there was some chatter about people having not sure if what was what to do but it's great to see that it works live yeah it's great to see it there a lot of people are claiming poeps right now so it could be a little slow to load so just be patient with it you can see this is loading here and when this comes up it's going to ask for an ethereum address or you can use your ens and you're going to click claim and then your pull-up's going to show up in your collection so we've heard many reports of people experiencing delays but at the same time we see oh you got it there we go okay it took a while uh so so we got many reports of things not working well uh but at the same time 11 000 pixels have been placed so so it might be a slow for some um we just request you to bear with us and be mindful that this is an experiment and and we don't have everything sorry um some stats there's 250 people online in the canvas and there's 200 on youtube is there a leaderboard for number of pixels um there should be yeah cut all the parts if you scroll below the canvas itself you can see the leaderboard i don't want to scroll because i actually i want to be on top so i don't want to waste precious seconds well there are people thinking correctly they are bombing us has arrived so let's click check badges i'm very glad to here so yeah um it seems that you've shown shown a screen that you just have to be patient yep hey and there we go the painting party viewer pull up quest two so now this is in my collection and you can look at the rest of my beautiful collection if you'd like over time theresa always gives me a hard time that my pull-up collection isn't big enough so i'm working hard so now you connect wallet on on the other tab so now road to devcon 6 you can see the url here i'm just going to reload the page looks like i have the leaderboard open this is great so i'm going to click connect wallet it's going to open up meta mask and so you're going to want to use an address that you have connected with metamask and then i'm going to connect here could someone explain what is that 420 number that you're paying on our canvases do they mean something maybe are you serious or are you kidding what do you might be kidding i was like i don't know maybe that's not world known i don't know and then guys after you connect your wallet you're gonna click sign and participate here and it's gonna open up a transaction don't worry you're not sending any ether to anybody or anything like that you're just signing the canvas with the address from your pull-up and you click sign here and then i should be able to drop a pixel here soon there we go so let's scroll in okay so this is dev i want to help with this because i want to get the po it looks like this should be a blue pixel so let me see if i can uh i'll do what logic beach taught me i will grab that color and i'm going to drop this pixel right here and you guys can see there we go well done so that is how you do it guys um the links should be all over the chats for both the discord server to join uh to be able to chat the poet bot the road to defcon discord server as well as the canvas and if you guys have any questions or having any trouble i just say be patient if something's being slow it'll come through just as you saw on my screen and have fun painting someone has messed up with your blue dot oh no i'm gonna have to redraw it now i want to make sure i have a final pixel on there so i can't uh get that pull up so how long this lasts so this canvas is going to be open yeah i think for the next hour or so for the duration of the call and then we'll close it up uh just before the end really that's 37 minutes uh unless we decide to yeah um i think we would likely do an extension of maybe 10 or 15 minutes i love i love the bengals bankless couldn't get their other s it became bankless i love it what is the nifty balloon eating crayons yes it's very nice so just as an overview um we're gonna hang out just a few minutes and just enjoy the canvas and hopefully i'll get our um our graffiti on it and then we will hop into some chats about uh devcon so um probably start that in about five or six minutes who are you here with are you are you are you for uh are you doing friday d uh a logo oh i see yeah i'm working on the variety logo right now i already helped a little bit with the diva but yeah as soon as we finish this i'm going to have everything put into the one with the colombian flag of course of course something i think nobody mentioned everyone that places a pixel will have increased chances of getting a builder ticket for devcon so if you are watching and you didn't feel or you felt like meh i won't bother maybe you do bother and and place at least one pixel because a single pixel will give you another power and that probably might be useful for something in the future so so don't sleep on it nice and also placing pixels is fun um it has some sort of hypnotizing sounds and you pick pick picks so don't miss your chance of placing a pixel i definitely suck at that yeah so as some of you guys might have seen in the announcement we're gonna have a raffle later in the event which we'll talk about a little bit more and among the prizes are some builder discount uh devcon tickets so yeah stay tuned for more information later in the call so claim your poeps guys i also want to mention that there is going to be a time lapse created of this canvas as it's created i'm trying something a little weird that i talked to some friends about but i'm gonna see if i can animate my little cube guy with his eyes moving around i don't know just keep that in mind when you're thinking about drawing things that this will be uh like an animated time lapse in the end that might it's easy to dream big when you're setting them up and then you get to the canvas and you're like oh i gotta get it done yeah i'm moving his eyes right now one one frame at a time do you know we should do we should engage defy dude while he's uh he's feverishly drawing and defending reality cards yep sorry guys i'm very distracted here what uh so yeah devil looks great i and again you know logic beach i was has been working really hard to um to help kind of put this canvas together and one of the ultimate goals was that we hope that it that the canvas ended up as a reflection of devcon in some way um and i i find that to be not only an awesome implementation of the design but that it's it's coming together that's that's really impressive um depcon has a red carpet uh so if we manage to build something nice maybe this becomes a background of the photo place yeah maybe we end up broadcasting this somewhere in the venue so your work can be uh shown at devcon maybe there we'll have to see what the actual infrastructure was yeah i heard about some surprises about debcon um when are we hearing them surprises about that what do you mean something about the idea of being you being open longer hours ah okay so um there are some rumors out there and uh yeah so we'll come out we'll come out with more more more official stuff later on but yeah one of the things we're planning on doing this year at devcon is keeping the venue open much later uh accompanying that with some other efforts that we're working on uh to get more community involvement which we'll announce more formally later on but uh we are excited about about about being able to keep the venue open quite a bit longer than we have in years past which has been i think five or so pm um so not going to spoil the the entire announcement there but do be prepared when we do announce devcon and and devcon will happen that we will have quite a bit of uh new improvements this year so i'm i'm fingers finding someone doing a solidity logo uh but it's very subtle it it's on the left of diva and and it is shades of grey and and that can only be solidity is someone saying it definitely looks like solidity i can confirm as a member of the solidity team but uh bit compressed right now and i can also uh confirm that i am not working on it it can't believe it the colors definitely resonate uh i will have the money that it was yours or some from your team no i i'm actually working on the orange part of diva on the nose but that looks really like the solidity logo nice shout out to whoever is working on this so something else to note um la pandita where the argentinian guys have been extremely respectful of logic beach uh cube on the lower left corner and instead of overriding them they are just painting around yeah la la pandia i i reached out to them i said hey hey i'll make a detour it's gonna be okay yeah we moved over id logo because of that and we went we didn't want to fight with them that's been smart so um the 9000 pixels have been placed so far by 300 people skylar is now a good time if you want to introduce um some of the um some of the speakers who have who are going to share with us more about devcon yeah yeah for sure absolutely so so one of the things we wanted to also do as part of this quest is talk a little bit about some of the upcoming um upcoming things we have for devcon some of the things we've been working on in the in the extra time that we've had and so i mean one of the main things that we've been trying to do with devgon is to make it more of a community a community planned event community gather a lot more involvement from our community here like it is an event for our community it is not a for-profit event we're not trying to make money off this event we're doing this for the benefit of all of you uh and so for that we want to get your guys input we we the dev con team can't don't know everything about what you guys want to see there and i think it becomes a lot more fun sort of like this community community art canvas that we're all contributing to if devacon can be a place where everyone contributes um so to chat a little bit more about that i'm going to pass it off to liggy and then frenzy to go a little bit about uh the dip processes and rfps that we've created you guys there yes hello can you hear me test one to three yeah we got here wonderful and can you see the screen yeah basically we uh decentralization is not only about code basically it's i think also for important for defcon as an event from the ef um and for that we created some things like one thing you see there is now we have a github organization where you can contribute to our website to tools we use for example for the payment for the archive and for for the dips the ips are a little bit like the um eips from ethereum or pips from python um so you can basically contribute your ideas and you see some that we have here so they you contribute them on github or via the forum um and then they will end up here so the first one is like the eip zero just describing the process one i'm really excited about is um making defcon carbon neutral um basically we work together with co token they submitted this dip and um this way we try to make um be responsible like pos uh is coming so we try with ethereum to be a bit more on the ecological side and alongside the other advanced uh advantages of uh pro stake you see it has the status accepted there are also some that unfortunately didn't make it um with audios it was a problem unfortunately um with the licenses there so um yeah we have flights in hotel booking um from winding tree basically so in the process of buying a ticket that you can use an um decentralized system to book your um flights on the hotel we have the treasure hunt game really excited about that played already uh some treasure hunts from uh from them they used the thc the treasure hunt generator and uh it's a beautiful treasure hunts also decentralized with your knowledge proves very exciting key cards so people might get a kick out everyone for defcon basically a hardware wallet it's a project from status and we will also use these it's also like building blocks basically so um that you can build up um on top of these uh things so if you wanna submit in dip um for example using the dip five the keycard so you wanna use a keycard that's your option there um yeah we have attestation based ticketing for proof of attendance yeah protocol basics um crypto onboarding escape room it's a different also a game basically yeah different stuff if you don't want to submit your um dip via github we would encourage that but not everyone is technical so and we also want to cater for those people because they're also important we have to forum so you can just put ideas there and then we can work with you to manifest it into a dip um or other stuff that you have like we want to get better get more bottom-up you know that it's not just an event put out by the ethereum foundation it's basically a first step to decentralize the whole thing and get more community involvement and just make it a much better experience um yeah with that i will hand it over to frenzy which has some more information about it yes amazing thank you leaky so how we already saw just now in the screen share we have this forum.devcon.org if you did not visit it yet please please visit it and have a look because there's basically two ways how you can now get involved in contributing to defcon the one way is you just visit the forum you look at the discussion topics that are going on right now and you um you contribute either by sharing your opinion or maybe sharing an idea that you always wanted to see at defcon so you can do that without any any further ado you can just share it and drop it in the forum and see what the response will be that's the one way how you can uh get feedback and how you can get involved into contributing possibly to the next devcon and the other way maybe if you need some more inspiration is that you can have a look at the rfps rfps are requests for proposals um so basically they are requests from the devcon team um that ask you guys um that we need specific help with or where we think that that would be a nice addition um to share so basically um you could go to the devcon dot org form.defcon.org forum and there click on the rfp category and then you see all the requests for proposals that we have and i want to highlight two of them i mean we have a lot of rfps there already and please do make sure to monitor the rfp category in the forum also in future because actually there will be many initiatives how the community can get involved much more hands-on than in other devcons before and they i'm unable to share them with you right now which is a shame but uh i will soon be able to share them and there will be more rfps coming up in future so please make sure to monitor the rfp category if you are an interest group or community that wants to get involved in devcon but for now i want to highlight two rfps already one rfp is rfp number three a game for attendees where you can just check it out if you like but i'm just gonna go through it very quickly it's an rfp which covers the idea that uh it would be nice to have a game that the attendees of defcon could play throughout the entire um defcon event basically uh maybe you've been to other conferences before where uh games were there offered that you can play throughout the whole um defcon or i remember just in def con osaka we had games um organized by the community that were amazing like scavenger hunts throughout the venue and so on so this is basically the category for those kind of games um and if you are interested in this please check out the game for attendees rfp rfp number three um and even closer to my heart and also very fitting to today's event is rfp number two which is a visual blockchain experience so basically calling all of the artists here but not only artists but also people interested in data or maybe the intersection of data and art that would be the best possible combination um we would love to in some way display in the devcon venue um a blockchain visualization or something that has to do with analyzing what is actually happening on ethereum and just transform it into art there are already amazing initiatives out there that do something like this for example based on analyzing the output of the different blocks of ethereum some analyze uh there's this uh transaction visualization which uh compares bitcoin to ethereum which is also really nice so um imagine stuff like this but maybe even more crazy or even more artistic um all of the guests that are interested in yeah data and then date and art that are really really well perm to um to apply uh basically hand in a dip for this rfp number two a visual blockchain experience if you go to the forum and look at this rfp you can also see that uh there's a link of the venue as well so you can already see it's a video um how the venue in colombia will look like and maybe that will inspire you to even better think about okay where could this artwork fit how could we display it the best but in any case if you have even only a broad idea you can put it in the forum and we can discuss it there further and yeah i guess that's it with regards to requests for proposals that are currently on the table but as i said stay tuned for proposals that are coming up and um if i am reaching any artists out there right now please also make sure to just post something in the forum or reach out to me individually because we want to display a lot of amazing art there which does not only need to be focused on data visualization so if you are an artist in the blockchain space feel free to reach out to the defcon team because we would love to have as much art displayed as possible that's uh that's it from my side awesome awesome absolutely thanks so much franzi thanks leggy so yeah if you guys want to contribute or participate check out forum.devcon.org um so that's where all these rfps are listed that's where if you have an idea for devcon anything from uh there should be a meditation space to we want to integrate our project um at dev con somehow and dog food web 3 technology post the idea on forum.devcon.org we'd love to hear so pass it back over to you super fizz awesome um great job both of you uh i like i said as someone who hasn't attended devcon i've always been the jealous bystander it's really great to get to get a a better view of the whole picture so you know while the road to devcon wasn't the ideal situation i think it has a lot of potential to improve access to information for those of us who just didn't make it before so that's that's pretty awesome i'm gonna make a quick comment always um painting it's not anonymous your etherium account the account you have the power leaks so for example we found out uh that the person doing the solidity uh image is alex bergsassy from the solidity team so so if you are vandalizing somebody else's artwork uh be mindful that you might be shame and call out in the future i love it also let's know what he did he did not vandalize anybody just no no no no no i love we have the assumption of anonymity and then it's oh by the way we actually know who you are so so for a long time we wanted to bring anonymity to po up and and to make it privacy preserving um but the technology is not there yet um making cks tough on the syrian magnet it's extremely expensive so so we have to accept but but it is nice it's nice because when i think about ethereum 2 this signature still doesn't bring privacy preservation on the base layer but the serum tree might so so it's like having a carrot for for tech development um ethereum 2 is not the end of the game native privacy preserving primitives would be something really exciting to have so so for the most technical people ethereum has plenty places to go before we feel like we have run out of ideas great um i'd like to say the mountains coming into the background are absolutely awesome if people it's funny because i'm like i don't know how many of the actual pixel droppers are here with us or if they're in their own little worlds but those mountains coming in are really great um i would it would be great to see those fleshed out and with that um i want to i want to start with logic beach you did a lot of work connecting with communities and kind of giving a grander idea to this canvas can you talk to us about how you connect with communities and how others can get involved because we're going to do more of these how can people how can they get on this uh this was sort of by the seat of my pants i had i had tried to organize the berlin canvas and ultimately i missed it because it was at four in the morning but this one i was really focused on just trying to get as many people from as many different communities as i could that wanted to express themselves um in the future um i i love the idea of you know maintaining the role of someone that wants to coordinate uh different communities to do this together so uh if anyone wants to be involved obviously they can just jump right in and do their own thing and that's fine then that's fine too but there's something special when you get a lot of people together to make like a coherent picture uh so uh i helped people uh start guilds like a few people would approach me and say hey we're this these people from this team uh what can we do and so i'd open it i'd start a guild for him in the discord and they could just like plan and everything i also i'm an artist myself so i really enjoy taking people's just images and like scaling them down and making pixel art with them too so that was actually a lot of fun for me um just like getting to play uh i don't know like commissioned artists just like to create pixel art something that i've never really done before pixel art was it's new to me but i've really enjoyed it but anyone that wants to get involved in in any future uh canvas they can obviously just do it anyways but if you guys want to plan and i like i'm here to help people like get a guild going start a plan i can help you with the art that sort of thing yeah great and i i don't want to suggest either you're the original artist for this deva um image but you did a great job of uh interpreting it for pixel art uh so and i know you went through several iterations so this this actually looks really great i appreciate that yeah i actually looked up um some tutorials about how to take an image and scale it down without interpolation so it would stay pixelated and then i go up and clean them up and make it like nice so yeah that was a lot of fun the the devil one worked out really well because it was i think it was a vector image it could easily be scaled and look clean no matter what you did uh so i actually had to turn to a png and do all this other stuff but yeah the art and like the technical side is very fun for me so i'm having a blast great skyler are we able to give a shout out to the original artist tomo is there actually in the call i believe so thomas say hi to everyone hi you're here yeah so yeah i just felt great like i mean i mean you know like everybody has you know give us some give me the feedback to iterate the diva so it's a collaborative for to make this yeah thank you it is it is a beautiful design so thank you for sharing that with us ninja um it looks like we're about time so i won't steal this thunder colfax what do you want to talk about great question fizz thanks um so what i'm going to talk about next is an exciting thing that's going to happen here on this call i don't know if you guys have ever participated in a poep.fun raffle before but i know many of you probably

thanks so much colfax um and i want to point out about the timing for this call um it is it's going to the bottom of the next hour so we're looking at about um 46 minutes left i'm sorry 36 minutes left i can't do clock math uh yeah so one other thing i wanted to point out let's not forget um devo looks really good but don't forget that if you contribute to dropping pixels in deva you will receive a specific poep and to me honestly that would be the the highest prize because you're you're here and you're contributing to the the goal that we all share of making a a beautiful road to defcon canvas so um i think i will let skyler introduce akil um and we'll go from there yeah sounds good um so next up if you guys remember we sent out a survey a while back um that was the quest number one and we actually had a significant number of people fill it out uh and it wasn't that the shortest survey ever so appreciate everyone who spent the time to do that uh this the insights were actually super valuable and to chat about those a little bit and also just to have a little bit more casual conversation here uh a keel uh it kills on the call here um part of the devcon team user experience designer so i'll pass it over to him thanks guys actually first time caller long time listener so i want to kind of commend all the work that's been done by fizz and team patricio lamboshi etc like i've been watching the community kind of grow and uh become what it has become and it's amazing to see the way that you guys operate behind the scenes how polished it is uh how much work and love kind of goes into it um so it's really interesting the topic that you kind of raised earlier uh fizz around getting more people involved in the community and making sure those individuals that don't have the technical background have some sort of representation within defcon so that's something that we've been thinking about a lot um and personally i came into the theater ecosystem because of proof of stake similar to most of the individuals that might be on this call from the sticker community i was maybe five six years a little bit too early and without a technical background so i had to personally navigate those conversations and the community myself so i wanted to kind of understand um what does that experience look like nowadays for you guys um especially with the great work that you guys are doing and then what does that experience look like for you personally and how do you think each sticker has kind of maneuvered and improved that experience for individuals coming into the theorem ecosystem oh that's so it's it's funny because i i wasn't i wasn't expecting to be asked a question then i was like oh he's going to ask me a question it's something i like to talk about um i so the development of the eat staker ecosystem has been really serendipitous like i think we we saw the opportunity coming and we worked hard to ramp up quickly for um a lot of new users who we knew would be interested in staking and we wanted to set the bar low we wanted to be welcoming first and knowledgeable second because um like it can be really overwhelming and even if you have a lot of technical background walking into this ecosystem and and just hitting the ground running is nearly impossible you've got to have somebody to kind of help you get in and so we wanted to fill that void and it really worked out especially with solo staking i i like to believe that e staker significantly increased the proportion of solo stakers um and there's no data to support that all i can do is go based on my gut feeling but i'm really proud of that perception that that we did increase um a lot of um solo staking and where we're at now is a really interesting transition and i don't talk about this a lot publicly but we're in this transition where people who are going to solo stake have and the people now who are interested in staking um maybe don't have 32 ether and as as a community organizer i'm not really confident or comfortable um promoting the staking solutions the pooled staking solutions are that are available i'm not comfortable promoting the exchange space taking and so we're in this kind of um i hate to say but it's a limbo of waiting for a staking solution that is really community-based um rather than lining the pockets of a third party and and so my hope is that we can uh sort of i want to say starve them out but i i want to urge the community to wait until someone steps up with that solution and then go in with pooled staking or or whatever solution they present and anyone who knows me knows that you know i have my eye on something and i sure as heck hope it works out um but yeah that's where we are right now it is a little bit of a tough spot because i never like to be just waiting for something but um i'm very happy with where we are and i'm very happy with the support we've provided to the community so do you see any more opportunities as far as like you mentioned being or feeling a little bit hesitant towards attending defcon are there certain opportunities or ways we could improve that or remove that hesitation it is somewhat of a developer conference as a position but there is commit opportunity for other sides of the community that are crucial for the decentralized nation of what we're doing to be a part of that conversation at some point what do you think could be done to kind of improve that conversation um you know i it's not it's not my style to like i don't have any critique for defcon the what i know about devgn i you know i almost put it on a pedestal i think a lot of us put it on a pedestal is like this this top-notch production um and i think for me it it may be that that intimidation of um just going and not knowing how to fit in after you know at this point i have a lot of friends who i know would be there um but a lot of it i think for the new people is not knowing if they'll have somebody to connect with there will there be a place for me to go where i fit in or will i be the guy who's sitting in the corner on his laptop like messaging my friends at home because i don't know how i ended up here so i think helping individuals find a comfort a comfortable spot or maybe their own click when they're there if they don't come with a group would be a neat way to help more people feel comfortable i think that's kind of been the aim with the quest and the the forums and the discord community and the other efforts that have been kind of going on with the world to defcon is finding or allowing people to find that core community to kind of latch into as we progress towards the event uh so you mentioned a little bit about you messaging your friends or maybe someone else on the call wants to share once they got like fully engaged with the ethereum community how did they describe ethereum to their family and friends in the first place or why they're on a saturday called painting pixels um with strangers from all over around the world how does that fit in with the ethos of the community what does that mean for you and your your future plans et cetera yeah this is victor uh i can speak to this actually um one thing that i really like about ethereum and that i love about devcon specifically um is that you can make friends so easily by just knowing one person at a time like if you just get to know one person not even like best friends with them or anything just like you can spot them out in a crowd um just go and hang out with the group that they're in right and then become friends with those people um you don't have to try very hard just talk to them and if you like them get their telegram or their discord or any other way to reach them um and then later that day when you're hanging out text them and be like hey what are you up to you want to hang out and then go hang out with them and then get to know their friends and then just keep going and going and you know you're not you're not networking you're not trying to get ahead you're not trying to like spot an opportunity or get anything from people like your only job and the only thing you should be trying to do is just like be yourself and hang out and try to have a good time and find the people that you like um and then just just build on that and i've been doing that for the last couple years that i've been around in crypto and ethereum specifically and now like when i go to defcon i go and just see see all my friends that i haven't seen from around the world for entirely the previous year so it is a lovely lovely experience um and it's worked really well for me agreed and i feel like a lot of the individuals in the ecosystem are connectors so like personally i got connected through the three key individuals like robbie bent and josh stark etc that were core part of the toronto community etc but those were like very key connectors in the community similarly i feel like now phase has probably become a connector to anyone that's coming into the ecosystem with each staker and then patricio obviously with his full app connections and so forth so like understanding what the connectors and connecting with them in some manner and making sure that you get out the and the fact that you're interested in doing something so even like i believe logic beach is probably somewhat new to the ecosystem and it's taken up quite a bit of a responsibility for this event so the opportunities really exist for you to make the most out of it just putting yourself out there i kind of hand it over to schuyler to talk a little bit more about defcon and any questions anyone might have yeah absolutely thanks akeel um and one thing i also note with with regards to superfiz's comments about um about coming and attending devcon alone so the way i actually got introduced to the community and my first devcon was i volunteered as a volunteer um and this was at devcon 3 back when we had only 15 or so volunteers but at the last fall at the last devcon we had i think around 100 some volunteers uh and it was a great community of people so i i came so i think if you are to come alone and you're looking for friends and you're looking to have a good time volunteering at devcon is an awesome opportunity to do so um and uh well we haven't released any details on how to do that yet they will be coming out uh so keep an eye on the twitter diva twitter and on the blog but uh but it's a pretty cool way to automatically come to devacon and have a community right from the start um and uh and yeah i guess like i don't know how much time we have left in this this part here but i wanted to open up to just any questions about um about devcon if people here on the call have have uh have questions regarding i don't know sort of like a little mini ask me anything ask us anything um about devcon we're happy to happen to answer it here and uh provide some clarity yeah i have some housekeeping info um the canvas will run for 15 minutes there from there we go to the raffles if you haven't checked the reference please do because you need to sign it into them and the process are called the raffle links have been posted on the announcement channel on discord and there's been 95 000 pixels placed already so so um stay tuned for the finish line right on right on we're almost there it's coming together it's looking good the canvas um yeah so maybe maybe a question that we get a lot obviously is when devcon so i answered at the beginning but i'll rephrase this right now reemphasize it and the answer is we don't know um we're staying optimistic on the team that potentially something's possible before the end of the year if not we're looking at next year um we are monitoring the global situation obviously and one of the cool things about the conference is how global our community community is uh and uh one of the hardest things about planning the conference right now is how global our community is so doesn't make it any easier um but there are some conferences that are happening that are taking place other community conferences that are taking place between now and um and later this year including ecc which i think is scheduled to happen in july 20th in paris um so that's planning to happen um hopefully i'll see some of you folks there and hopefully that goes off without a hitch um but if some of these other conferences and events can happen without without problems we would look more optimistically towards defcon happening sooner than later but uh it will happen at some point no doubt um anyone else in the country questions about devcon that we can answer anything um any burning questions if not i can talk about some other stuff have you placed a pixel skylar i have plays a pixel i placed a couple on on diva then i intended to start drawing something else and realized i was going to run out of space quick and so i erased it so something interesting that we're trying out this year hopefully with the online presence is webtoon integration um so we're looking for ideas on how to leverage that and maybe collabs are a part of that so the more perhaps you collect on the road to defcon perhaps there's some benefits that you'll uh get within the actual experience and so forth but it was interesting when we did put out the user survey around how many people were using web3 technologies on a day-to-day basis basis which weren't uh financial use cases and we got a the results that it was quite high so i don't know what community that was but i'm curious to hear what people are using web3 for on a day-to-day basis within the community just to kind of understand where those results came from because personally i'm not using it on a day-to-day basis so curious what are you guys doing i'll come leaving one now and you will need it and and you will need it to use cryptocurrencies for your financial needs yes so other than like the non-financial applications are you guys using any dapps on a regular basis and what do those look like usually well i can tell you that there are 324 people using co-op my primary go ahead uh connected not only to pop ad but i think one thing that is just incredibly useful is ens domain so now you could obviously also log into poep um using your ens an address that is connected to ins so now when i put a pixel on the canvas i actually see fancy.east and not some arbitrary address which is nice so uh and also connecting the ens domain to an actual domain is i think an amazing way to and then host this on ipfs that's what i basically learned uh in the last year of my job uh how to host uh websites not only on web2 but basically using ipfs and ens domains how to yeah basically decentralize um your web presence a bit further it's still a bit uh unpleasant if you want to update regularly but other than that it's quite a cool opportunity that i use i wanted to say i talk it's weird i i admit that i'm obsessed with some things i'm obsessed with poep um and i i talk about it all the time but it is a great non-financial use for ethereum and i i think it's it's probably um i don't think it's before it's time i think it's at the right time and i think it has the potential to expand to a lot of different use cases um and it's it's i was actually thinking to myself last night like why do i participate in poep so much is it is it because of the the idea that maybe it's eventually going to be tied to some kind of airdrop and if i get enough coax then i'll be in on the airdrop but it's it's not really that it is just this neat concept of um documenting my history with ethereum in a way that was never possible before which i i just i find that really neat like i can scroll back through my my poep collection and know what i was doing a month ago or a week ago um and so i really feel like that use cases is just going to continue to to grow and grow so i i don't know of another non-financial use case for ethereum that is as well developed as poep is has anyone been participating in any of the newer games or uh any new solutions that have kind of come out i want to mention this i saw you super fizz coming up but i i feel like you were gonna probably mention dark forest i love dark forest i on the they released their version 0.05 a few months back and i got so into it i didn't do anything for a week and i actually had to refrain from playing version .06 if they just released a week ago because i really wanted to be involved with this canvas and i knew if i got if i got onto my dark forest uh playing like i i wouldn't do anything else it's a great game it's a it's a non-financial application i believe it's uh it's built on ethereum and it's on the extern network it's it's fantastic it's incredibly addictive i had to give away my invite keys this time as well because last time i couldn't do anything for a week so yeah but it's i can also recommend it and the aesthetics are extremely nice as well yeah and i do want to mention that also my computer couldn't do anything else for a week because to get the map you basically are hashing pixels and it doesn't it uses your gpu like all the way maxed out at least that's what i i did it's a lot of fun it's it's fun on multi like it's multifaceted fun it makes the fact that it's on blockchain like you couldn't do what's happening on the game without blockchain and so it's super cool it's there's so much to it the team has done a great job yeah that's i i was i was in the dark forest black hole from december january and february of this year and i i know that my team was like where is he what are you doing and i'm like leave me alone i'm doing something important um yeah it's it's a great thing i just realized i have a key that i'd like to give away um and so if you want to check out poep.fun after after this call i will raffle a uh dark forest key there that should be a little fun um so i think we are oh nothing makes me happier on these canvases than to see the ethereum logo like never forgetting why we're here i don't know uh that was very religious um so i think colfax is gonna talk now about the raffle oh yeah it's that time guys so let's see here i'm going to bring up the raffles and we're going to start drawing them very soon how many of these sign up let's see just one second here i feel like one second like in berlin we got the timing right because the canvas was starting to get too crowded and it's finishing in six minutes so look very cool so raffle one we have a hundred and eighty perhaps that are signed up in raffle two we have 257 embarrassing great so why don't we trigger uh the drawing what do you say should we do one after another should we draw both at the same time so i my personal desire is that we wait until the canvas finishes because i'm protecting my stuff and i couldn't watch the drops sounds good like this is this is quite a stressful um yeah it certainly is why do we say five more minutes for the canvas yeah i think it's for now oh six sorry six perfect so then i'm gonna have the raffle start triggering right when that happens so that's gonna be at uh 20 minutes after the hour correct and could you explain how the ruffle finds random numbers which is something that you'll wonder about i will it's so cool i'll explain that in just a second while he's setting that up um lodge beach can you can you shout out any of the guilds that you feel like have really stepped up today yeah i wonder if i can remember most of them by name uh yeah a giant shout out to the devcon group making deva happen was kind of the goal for me uh like i really wanted to see that happen so great job guys that looks fantastic it looks exactly like the photoshop image that i put up so uh nifty.inc i love that group they did they did exactly what they set out to do i i don't know about the red balloon i guess you couldn't make it um but this yellow balloon eating a crayon that gives me a good laugh every time uh i like what reality cards did you i don't know if you guys were behind the color of that but that is cool uh the daily guay yeah uh he he actually looks a little bit different than i expected his eyes are open good job that looks neat um la pandia did exactly what they said they were gonna do which is border the entire thing in a the blue flag is that the flag of colombia argentina argentina right on that's uh my vexology is poor i wasn't sure which flag it was um who else do i know that it's called vexology i love that there's a subreddit called vexology okay okay the mountains are great um landscape guild i think if they if they had more human power behind this they could have really done uh i mean i love the mountains and i love the shading i was trying to help with that like i want to see that happen on a canvas like that needs to happen like the entire wash of mountains and like a sky and stuff it looks fantastic guys i'm a huge futurama fan so kudos to you yeah the artwork looks incredible the canvas this time is four times the size of the one from berlin and we've done such a good job filling it up i mean it's it's really beautiful i have to say yeah and somebody's uh got rainbow road going uh i don't i think who who is helping me draw super fizz i see if chris garner was helping me draw the super phys someone that hasn't gotten a shout out and it was a fundamental member of this endeavor it's a ramirond rameron has developed the painting but we most most are using was that bought active in this canvas i guess i didn't use it um but the work that he did on that bot was fantastic i i played with a little bit and it works exactly like you'd expect did people use it used what used the bot and what didn't i'm curious um so you paste an image and the bot creates a sequence of all the pixels you need to paint for that image to be displayed as far as possible and another thing is what la panditia is using um i don't think they have placed all those pixels one by one i placed all my pixels one by one what have you drawn mariana i helped uh i helped with the with the flag okay uh have you placed one on diva so you get the diva painter pow up i did uh i hope it stays so i also deleted somebody else's pixel and paid it oh i've done the same okay so cool i just hope nobody does that to my single pixel well i've done it like in five places just in case my friend here is uh collecting names that helped with deva as the as it happened like she's not doing it after the fact so even if you placed it and it was covered up there's a chance she got it although think about it it's hundreds of pixels she had to go and collect addresses from so we'll see how uh accurate we are uh we are closing in one minute i would like to uh we mentioned ram iran i want to bring that up because even when the raffle starts it'll still take a few moments for it to launch um ramirond not only created the the poep autograph automated graffiti tool graphic detail graffiti tool but he also um developed a um poep or sorry a graffiti wall tool that you find on um beacon chain and so we'd love for you to give that a try that's all developed by steakhouse which is the eatstaker development branch that is led by colfax um and he's going to now hop into the raffle awesome yeah again shout out to ramming around he's doing some awesome work with with art so i thought that roughly has started the raffle has started guys so this is the moment we've all been waiting for now i'm going to talk to you about a little bit about the mechanics of how the raffle works so you guys can see here again all these participating co-ops here each one of them has a number associated with them it's like this one for example is 27.90 um each one of them has a number now the cool part here is it's basically an elimination over time of poeps getting eliminated from the drawing and what is happening as you can see here the gas limit of each ethereum block that passes by the the last digit of this gas limit is uh going to eliminate the poeps that have that as their last digit and so as so pull-ups are probably being eliminated here as we go so leaderboard will climb all the way up from last place all the way oh sorry chris gardner um oh i see some familiar face here super fizz is already eliminated it looks like a few different uh philadelphia there uh so people are getting eliminated as the last number in their poe app matches the last number in the gas limit for each ethereum block that passes by so it's a very cool way to like have decentralized randomness so to speak to sort of select who is going to win this this uh this raffle and as you can imagine eventually all of the po apps are going to have the same last number and when that happens we're going to move on to the next digit over in the poep ids so how are your posts doing for facts i have 41 and 2 in the other one yet let's see here i think i so i have two i have one in raffle one and i have two in raffle two i wonder if i'm still standing let me see now i have one on one and three on the other one and something else that's pretty cool so we can actually try and identify who's remaining i think i'm out in both of them because it doesn't look like i'm here but you can click on the poe app and you can view their pull-up collection and we can try and see who these uh try and guess who these people are based on their pull-up collection okay so i'm gonna be the goofball here um i can't remember the prizes for really i just want to know what i'm going to win because i'm going to win the first one all good so i'll review the prizes so in raffle one the number one winner is going to actually get the nft mint of the canvas that we drew today they will also get an ethereal builder discount devcon ticket and a ticket to the devcon trivia coming up in six weeks the next two people will get their discounted devcon ticket as well as a trivia seat and then the next 17 people will get trivia seats and then after that we have some weightless trivia seats just in case we uh we need to call on those people now the awesome raffle is very similar so those are so much fun it's gonna be so much fun uh raffle two is very similar except we're not uh minting off at nft or raffling off that nft for raffle two that's gonna be in raffle one um something to mention while we wait uh mariano conte has been the account that placed the most pixels um has placed 2800 and hasn't been using a bot wow that's very impressive i take this painting parties very seriously i can see that you apparently take everything what are you doing on the on the raffles are you still running uh let me see i have three on ruffle one i have two on that one and i and i have one on the second i do so too and and on the second there's still 94 and the first one there's 57. uh one nice thing when we move to ethereum 2 is that we will know how long this will take because the block times are deterministic but we still won't know how long we all know because the exclusions are still random like you can have the right multiple exclusions for the same thing that don't remove one uh good point true true oh so i'm out on the second one that's too bad my remaining poep on the first raffle is the only poep that i ever purchased which it's my devcon 4 poep i wasn't there but i bought one [Laughter] oh all right guys so in raffle one you can see here we already have some prizes coming through so nan x nanex cool.e has the first hey has the first uh devcon trivia game ticket waitlist oh sweet so congratulations hopefully uh well i guess hopefully many people are excited about trivia and they claim their tickets but if not there's a chance you might be able to to join on the trivia game so yeah if you haven't seen these trivia games they're kind of a staple in the east sacred community and they're quite a lot of fun so that's going to be july 10th at the same time at 6 p.m utc so stay tuned for more details on that there's details in the posts about the quests it's going to be quest number three and we're really excited to help post that as well how many on the leaderboard on the right we'll get prices the first 50. the first i think it's 45 okay sorry 35 people the top so now everybody remaining in raffle one will get at least a prize one of the at least a wait waitlist ticket prize or an actual ticket to trivia uh so something else to share while we wait all these products in the power ecosystem for apart club fan and others they are open source anyone in the community can use them we are always looking for new fun use cases so if you run communities in your city or if you think that this could be useful in your school or elsewhere reach out to us and we will help you get you set up it's funny you say in your school because my fantasy is that like a school ends up using poep as an attendance token um well i can tell you people are using for from the mit to stanford from coast to coast bye frenzy thank you for coming today hi have fun i i'm happy your ruffles is stalled cold i don't know what's going on last digit eight let me refresh the page i saw the same view oh no it did load eventually all right cool yeah at all has something broken no it did load eventually yeah for a second i thought i was still in the in the game and i got really excited but unfortunately not all right looks like my screen might have been a little frozen so we've been drawing uh these winners this is amazing so guys on raffle one we're starting to pass out the dev contribute game tickets um martin tell has got one merchant super fizz you got a ticket did i holy crap i was like oh i've been outed well i i mean if superfits got a ticket that means we will go through the wait list because oh yeah i'm on the wailings and i think i'm going to win uh yeah oh shames currently got a ticket good wow good good and i wonder who will get the nft i got a wait list but i've written all the questions [Laughter] so all i know is i have a def con trivia ticket and i know the guy who wrote the questions hey uh quick question about the second uh raffle if i had two poeps do they both play or does it just choose one of them we both play yeah but if both of you win uh we go through the wait list of course it looks like me and my wife are still in the top 35 for the second raffle so that's cool i think i think i i i control f and look for uh logic beach and i only found one so far so something that was a programming note um i want to update everybody on the big picture uh so it's 2 30 and we were going to end the call um the plan right now is just to give the poep drawing enough time to complete and then skyler and i will wrap up and so if you're just hanging out for that we will be respectful of your time and should finish in five or six minutes um people have been wondering how to get the pixel dropper pull up um that's going to be announced on the road to death on discord stay tuned to it and and you will get instructions sounds good one more note of logistics we're gonna go once the raffle finishes drawing we'll do a demo of this but if you are a winner of a devcon trivia game ticket or a wait list uh you please reach out to us so we can start coordinating the devcon trivia game at the end of the raffle there will be an email address that pops out it'll say contact the organizer click there and there's an email and what you're going to need to do in order to verify that you own the address you need to sign a message with that key and then just send that message to the email so we'll do a demo of that once it draws but in case you need to drop off now circle back to the raffle at the end if you're a winner and make sure to email us because that's the only way we're going to be able to get in touch with you to plan the event hey nolan are these you said you wrote the questions for the trivia are these questions that i know already uh if you looked at the google sheets document i think do i have access to it i definitely posted the link one time okay i was i was actually hoping to play but if there's any chance that i could have seen him it wouldn't be fair i mean if you haven't seen it take your word for it i trust you and you trust me but there are probably a couple hundred other people who would be upset if it yeah i don't itself i did see the questions there are some very good questions a great job nolan but i definitely can't participate uh have you guys seen some controversial questions like we like doing there's there's one or two we'll see what's the right topic these questions cover are we allowed to know that in advance or just like anything to do with ethereum different community stuff technicals on different dapps and you know a whole all manner of stuff cool cool right on so you don't need to have attended a dev con before necessarily to know the answer to these questions no no no if you've just been on crypto twitter and read it and been using ethereum you should do well nice what are you saying is if you spend 24 7 on crypto twitter you that's i'm thinking uh mariano is gonna be in the game he will he'll rack up so um yeah we're down to the last couple poeps and don't anyone let me forget that i want to give mona mesa a chance to close you'll have the final word after i say goodbye and then michael we can cut the stream after mona mesa has his his opportunity sounds good i haven't heard much from you michael how are you today great just happy to be here in the screens and making sure that everything works exactly oh i say i haven't heard much from you you've been i've been staring at your screen the whole time michael you've been doing a great job in vetica uh with all the logistics everything's going smoothly appreciate it yeah i eat sticker is a really great team um in fact same with poep same with def con if you're looking to contribute anywhere um we're always always willing to help people find a place to be successful so um yeah i will it may not be quick yeah just to expand on that it was probably the point you're you're just about to make where uh you know just a quick shill for not just east acre community but i would say all communities within the ethereum ecosphere is that uh you don't you don't have to be a technical user you know i i have a passion for uh like the web two things and helping with organizing and things of that nature there are roles for you in any capacity um so don't be shy to sort of peek into some of these communities and try it out you don't necessarily have to know the the nuts and bolts of the protocol there's still definitely a need for organizers and people who are just generally curious to to lend a different perspective than what we know today so go out there and join some communities i'm still in the uh we are down to two on one of the ruffles and those are good one because the rest resuscitator and madashia test now those were both uh challenging to earn you had to actually yeah and and the third one and the first builder ticket was won by someone who's ens it's ethereum developer dot ddh so exactly what he's likely to use it yeah that's awesome yeah again sorry appreciate you yeah i want you to open the top to see who they are yeah so this is one person let me open up ah very active who they are let's see this is one of the people that's remaining it's still loading oh whoever he has many yeah um he's been on the other community call he's been using power part a lot because many pop art tokens has been to ethereal so this is a hardcore pop collector i'm like he's winning oh they were on the berlin upgrade party that's great yeah hopefully he wins the nft actually is this roughly for the nft this is for the nft yeah yeah and what about the other account i can't remember which one i clicked on so i'm gonna open up both i can tell you by the collection yeah and on the other one [Music] hey um i need to ask this is actually an important question do the people who won these tickets to trivia are they able to transfer those to another person or are they are well are they required to be the person with the signing key um that's another do you want to talk about that but i think they are given a discount code so so it's unfavorable okay so and he was asking questions i think but quick note about the dev con tickets themselves are you are given a discount to buy the ticket when we go and sell tickets of course which is yet to uh yet to come through but for the trivia quotes um the trivia tickets i'm not sure the answer there okay i i have allowed them to be transferable but we'll work it out and i just know the people who are watching are going to be a bit curious i actually won two trivia tickets and they're probably not going to let me play um anyway that's fine inclusivity if you did win a ticket and you can't make it and you know somebody that would have fun then feel free to invite them and if you don't want to then we'll go into the wait list because there are many interested people on the waitlist so um as you know here with easetaker.com we're very welcoming and very easygoing we want everyone to have fun so if you know somebody that would have fun definitely pass that along i actually saw someone last time uh attach the uh the trivia ticket to an nft and sell it at at i think wearable or open c it was kind of a really neat experience uh oh and logic beach provided the art for that it was a cool thing did i remember that that was fun so y'all we developed a really awesome canvas we learned a lot about devcon uh we had a fun raffle and we got to hang out for a while um i'm so delighted to have spent some time working with the devcon and poep folks um it was a good day uh i'm glad everyone joined us and um skyler do you have any thoughts one quick thing before you wrap it up skyler this is the button that i was talking about contact raffle organizer and since we're short on time michael maybe can we release a video of signing uh yep i will do that and get it posted right away for winners we'll do that afterwards so you all you do is click this button and then you can send an email over to the ether the organizer which is e2stc gmail.com so if you are one of the top 35 winners definitely reach out all right now off to you skyler right on right on yeah so the first thing i was going to say was is big thanks to to you guys eat sticker and and the poep team uh for proposing this idea initially and then helping us put this on i think it's been it's been really fun i'm super impressed with the canvas we came up with and uh the second thing is just um yeah if anyone has ideas or questions about devcon um submit them in the forum forum.device.org stay active in the the chats and looking forward to seeing everyone at the uh the trivia game next which um maybe it was mentioned here but i'll re-emphasize it uh everyone can participate and watch uh from the youtube live stream the tickets are just for those who are going to be joining us in the uh in the in the zoom calls that's correct uh colfax yes that's correct so anybody even if you didn't win a ticket you can definitely tune in and participate in the
