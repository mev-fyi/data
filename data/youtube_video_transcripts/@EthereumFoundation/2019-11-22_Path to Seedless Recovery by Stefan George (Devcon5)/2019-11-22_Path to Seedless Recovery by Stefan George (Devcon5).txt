[Applause] for Moses and Europe or many things among those it's a small compact base one corner the same if you haven't tried a lot I encourage you to try it out go to yeah okay you go to st. Austell and it's available for Android and iOS and you're using regular exit phrases to cover your closed accounts but we want to go beyond that because oh no the floor also see places I guess all of us have great many of course usually there's like a big 39 and you really get random list of 24 girls sometimes both works depending on how much entropy is what provider wants to generate publicity generate private key base together with an HD pop and from the sleep public key and the address and people have been quite creative about how they can make the super so it's a good person now costs about six places there's supposed to be secure like we know they are secure and they also allow us the base of the patient station tree to generate out rare amount of private key moments you just have to develop you only saw one of those whatever we still don't have to do this one data and we have a loser then use all access to all those private keys so this is nice feed by audience we changing the relevance and many have been trying to do so so ingredient created ways and one of those teams actually try to create game you're the game you select some rooms and you walk through those rules and based on your external escapes and to be accelerated and you just have to remember what kind of actions to date in this game again essentially yeah you should try it out by fun another actually with the bosses who was covering so it's adjusted X points of interest on the map and she's like my guess of the mountain like five of those then you're able to generate the drive key based on those and then one who's racing universe also just gives with no items and mootisse say give me go there over 2000 apologies and we just use this instead of the purpose and my if you remember no Jesus self just a list of girls so some small great for they are of course the issues with it so first of all if the user is doing this you just paint game was making movies for selecting front of interests and spite lightly that uses the state symbol of points of interest see kind of reduce the randomness by just wrong people to pick this their funding issues we don't ever know exactly like if this nation secure setup an off and secondly of course is to remember this and if you don't remember those 24 no T so it because remember the point of interest for like which room you picked in this game then X is loss so we have to go beyond this and fortunately ABS probably most disadvantages of using smart object based counts like know safest that we can now has his smoke from that as a proxy between you and two injections on the serum in small conflict we can define the access rights use it for the same quote when he sick you can also use it to replace ownership officers were to sing under certain conditions and there are a couple ideas service includes the loss of the private key by submit like asking anyone to submit the deposit leave David he exists cosmos and only the owner of music is able to take this deposit and if in a certain period of time the ones able to claim it this is seen as proof that excess has been lost because otherwise you know what they're taking this money and then the one who submitted the deposit is able to replace the scheme some sausage something a great idea however they all costs very pretty good and like how much time for you actually it also passed into someone's able to replaces if you know some girls on holidays and he has no internet and you can just make the deposit and the exodus account if the you know the other person or able to react in time also problem for running if you do such a transaction right here anyone can see it and eventually one planet and try to say in your account the other quite popular ideas using sovereignty recovery is basically tracing another logistic network would seek where the number of your friends can confirm that we lost exes and then they are you to replace McCain exosphere become again the big question is how reliable I reference do you really trust them also eventually they can be attacked right so if you actually just use another would you think for this then you would see like on chain would you say and he would see who are the guardians like you were the ones protecting your account and eventually they can be mapped to real persons and then if someone sees no there's a lot of money in this account they might be to attack those to try to make include and gain access to your account once we Shinto this is eventually vegetables signatures has been not work mean done also by changing and there are actually working from a concept for this the idea is that instead of a different idea becomes big and launch a ballistic just spill degeneration of offer be theory of signature like this in America bacteria among different parties they can generate this valid team connection and then they don't have to store the eto mattresses on on the on the blockchain so there are also constant any change in the setup which have to do the ceremony again and of course if you're if the members are losing access to this private key share and the pressure world of people is losing understand also access loss though some real sales not yet a perfect solution other this there are some options take from here you can combine some other thank you very much [Applause] you
