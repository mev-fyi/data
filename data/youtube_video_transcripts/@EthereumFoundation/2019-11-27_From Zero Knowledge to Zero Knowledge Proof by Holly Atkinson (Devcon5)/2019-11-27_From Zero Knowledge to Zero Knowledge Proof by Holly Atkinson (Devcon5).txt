[Applause] okay hello everyone I am high-action said this is my talk from their knowledge to their own knowledge proof and I know that's very very corny this isn't a technical talk so it's along with similar lines as Kendricks intoxicated I mean this time last year I was actually working at a green energy corporate full-time in London that was recently ranked I thing last month number seven in Harvard Business Review top 20 ng or business transformations of the last decade Iran in teams of hundreds of people to deliver new optional in the home projects so just like that one man so very different to what I'm Jana and as part of that role for worked across multiple continents negotiated internationally oversaw complex two divisions run legal documentation and ultimately oversaw the composition of multi-million dollar business cases so why am I telling you this it's obviously very different to my current role so since then I've trained I currently work as front-end engineer for a startup called tracer where tracer is putting together an end-to-end solution built for and by the diamond industry and as part of that it is using doctrine is one of its four technical pillars alongside AI machine learning privacy and security options so I'm guessing most of you are the deaths in here so believe me when I say this has been a complete change in focus and that was for me that main reason why I chose to move into my new career on the off chance that any of you are not already software underneath this try to cover some resources that I found useful on my journey and you can see 31st of October is actually the date that I left my previous role and I won't go into any more detail here but if you do have any questions come grab me after what I really want to say at this point is don't feel put off by the complexity of what you feel you're going into we've had some amazing - what's here in Osaka about new tools and obviously guaranteed tools popping up all of the time and I see a really important translating role here for those who are able to work alongside the experts and researchers to communicate the principles of the tools and how they can be used to upgrade existing code bases and ultimately be used on the road towards mass adoption of crypto there are three things that I learned in my past life that seem very relevant to my new life as a developer so firstly during my time on transactions I had to plan every one appeal probably hate I defined a clear checkpoints for my NGO noticing things as I called it so before we decided to move forward with an opportunity and I see that being very relevant to businesses or entities using blockchain particularly aetherium when the new solutions moving at such a rapid pace within the community and whilst that's very exciting it can be very valuable to balance or technical debt with the business critical path to ultimate nearly will only use the feedback and stay on track to do it as something that's going to be useful [Music] secondly I learned to expose aspects of new projects that were unclear you don't need any qualifications to us questions and over-communicate even use analogies and build your network because goodwill can go a very long way thirdly I learned how important it is to map the language of the business to the technical detail held by my specialist teams so I really recommend you listening to how others express themselves and learn the language of whatever field you're in I actively root what I really want to emphasize is similar to Kendrick who just spoke don't be afraid of bringing your new perspective to a new and new project and opening new lines of communication Thank You class everything for me if you do have any questions about anything else to look about come army or follow me on Twitter [Applause]
