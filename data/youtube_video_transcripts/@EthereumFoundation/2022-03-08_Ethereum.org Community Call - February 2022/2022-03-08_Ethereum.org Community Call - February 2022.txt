so hi everyone welcome to the february ethereum.org community call uh we'll start with a quick round of introductions uh after that luca is going to spend some time talking about dev connect and our translator's turn base and corwin will provide us an update on our thinking and progress around layer two we've got uh i've got sam here but i believe pablo is actually going to be introducing our redesigned ecosystem support program website and sarah from the esp team will be speaking a little bit about the academics grant strength that they're just about to start running and finally we've got paul who'll speak a little bit about staking ux and we've got some time for q a as well um so i can start quickly with the intros i'm joshua the community lead for ethereum.org as always you can ping me with any ideas or feedback that you have for the community or if you're interested in finding more ways to contribute to epeedium.org i'll pass on to luca everyone i'm luca i am working on the ethereum.org translation program so if you want to get involved help us translate the website into more languages or if you are already a translator have any questions thoughts general feedback feel free to reach out and i'll pass it on to paul paul here um front end dev been on the team for a little over a year um i'll be chatting with you soon about staking i hope everyone's having a good day i'll pass it along to pablo yes yeah paulo here front-end developer basically working on yeah web development for a bunch of years now working for decentralized applications and web 3 yeah i think me if you are interested in that uh pass it to not sure who is missing some hey good day everybody thanks for being here um yeah my name is sam i'm a web developer for a while now um now also yeah team lead on the ethereum.org team thinking all things ethereum.org i'm also samajamman on discord and github if you ever want to connect happy to get you involved i'll pass it over to nuno hello everyone i'm nuno uh i'm new to the team so i'm going to be doing product design and helping out the tutorial websites and all things related to design nice to meet you all and i'll pass it to jacobs hello everybody i'm a new product designer just like nuno my focus will be more on the user experience of the website feel free to chat with me on discord or in the design channel and nice to meet you all [Music] back to you sam i suppose or luca i think we've still got corwin team's getting bigger hey guys um thanks for joining i'm corwin or corwin teens on pretty much all socials i'm a web developer on ethereum.org [Music] and yeah mainly been focusing on layer 2 stuff lately which i will talk to in a little bit um if you have any questions about development stuff yeah definitely feel free to reach out in the code channel or dm me if you have any questions around development for ethereum.org yeah pass back to josh here yeah awesome thank you everyone i think that's everyone i'm not sure that i can count that high um so yeah we've also set up a slidell for the call as normal and just allows anyone to ask any questions they have for the team in advance if you check out the community call chat channel you can find the link to that if you do have any questions and and once again i'll just reiterate that this is a community call for ephedium.org website and we don't represent the the network or the protocol directly and so with that in mind try to keep your questions focused on feeding.org or things that ethereum door can do to support the ecosystem or broadly um yeah so i'll stop sharing my screen just now and hello yes so uh first up we have luca who is going to talk a little bit about the dev connect and our translator's term base sure so as you may know there will be a new ethereum event this year called devconnect it will take place in amsterdam in april the defcon team which is organizing the event has been kind enough to help us reward some of our top contributors and have reserved spots to the deafconnect co-working space for all of our top holders free of charge this means that if you hold either r5p pr po app given to contributors who have opened five prs in a repo in 2021 or our 10kpo app given to contributors who have translated 10 000 words in our translation program you can reserve your spot for deafconnect now uh if you are eligible and plan to attend please reach out to me so you can be added to the list all you need to do is share your email address so we can share that with the devcon team and reserve your spot for the co-working space as a side note there will be several events taking place in amsterdam that week like eat amsterdam for example which may require a separate registration and i really hope to meet some of our top contributors in amsterdam that that should be pretty much it just wanted to announce this uh we've already announced it in the announcements channel and next we would like to highlight one of our newest initiative the the latest in our series of efforts to provide our translators with some high quality resources to make their work easier and further improve the quality of the translations on the website specifically we are working on cleaning up and improving the crowding glossary that the translators can use to find descriptions and establish translations of key terms let me share my screen here so we want to make the glossary as reliable as possible so that the translators can be certain the translations it contains are accurate and use it as a source of truth when translating the website this will ultimately lead to better quality translations and make translations of key terms more consistent so just just a brief overview of how the crowding glossary works if you've participated in the translation program before you're probably familiar with this basically every word that is included in the glossary is underlined in the crowdin editor so you can see the description of these terms in the trend and their translation in your language just by hovering over them you can also search for terms in the terms section in the right sidebar which shows all glossary entries in a particular string the way we we're currently approaching this is we've created several spreadsheets that we are sharing with different parties for input the one i'm showing right now has been shared with our translators you can also find the link to this in the community call agenda as you can see it's just a really simple simple spreadsheet with some key ethereum specific terms and fields for translations in numerous languages if you want to help us with this initiative please follow the link and add some translations for your language the instructions on how to fill this out are available in the second tab of the spreadsheet once we've gotten some more input we will sort through the translations and import them into the crowding glossary which i showed before so that's the in built-in glossary that all the translators see and use by default when translating the website um thanks to everyone who has already added some translations to this turn base and everyone who will be adding them to the future so you already have quite a few terms in some languages some not so much at this point we would really appreciate your help and finally one last thing i wanted to touch on was just highlighting some of the language updates we've made to the website in february it's been a great month for translations on ethereum.org as we have added some completely new languages to the site and also updated a lot of existing translations we've had the updated translations for the home page and site navigation for example in over 20 languages also added georgian to the website for the first time we have updated the use ethereum pages which include some of the most basic pages on the website like what is ethereum what is ether well let's find a wallet stuff like that in around a dozen languages additionally we updated the use case pages which cover topics like nfts defy daos and plenty of other important topics in some languages um and finally we are currently in the process of updating the remaining pages in some of our most active languages like chinese simplified indonesian italian portuguese brazilian most of the website has been translated into these languages so you are if you are a native speaker of any of these languages you will be able to browse pretty much the entire website in your native language in the coming days um that should pretty much cover what i wanted to talk about just wanna end with another big thank you to all of our contributors who make the website great and a special shout out to our translators for allowing us to make this content available to everyone regardless of their language that is the purpose of the translation program and again if you're looking to get involved help us translate the website we have a translation channel or you can reach out to me at any time awesome yeah sam here just to tack on to that real quick with some numbers for you like big shout out i know there's a lot of translators on the call right now like thank you guys for doing what you do i know the large majority of you are just volunteering your time [Music] for a long time you know english has dominated traffic on ethereum.org but it's cool to see that basically every single month we're hitting record months in terms of just like non-english page views we had almost 600 000 in february um and yet to see like english as as the majority of traffic going down over time like for the first time ever last month it was under 85 of total page views um and we can just see you know like record months for specific languages across the board so really huge to see like continued adoption and like people clearly gaining value from all the translations you're doing so appreciate you guys okay thanks sam thanks okay and yeah and big thanks to the devcon team as well for arranging this for us and these sort of incentives um if you have any questions related to devconnect the term base or the translation program just more generally feel free to ping luca moving along a little bit i think corwin is going to provide us an overview on our progress and his thoughts around the layer 2 resources and some work he's been doing on that lately for sure just gonna share my screen here all right so um as you might have seen on our roadmap we're looking to expand our resources on layer twos um i think it's pretty well known now at this point that um using mainnet on ethereum is uh both cost preservative for uh everyday user gas fees are going up and block space is full on ethereum basically transactions are getting expensive because there's so much demand for it and with that there are scaling solutions coming online called layer twos which um looking to bring more information and help onboard users to these networks um so with that we're working on a kind of beginner to intermediate friendly use ethereum page on layer twos um what we're looking to provide for information on this page is basically walking through what is a layer one like what does it mean to be a layer one um and why do we need layers twos and so going into some of the main talking points of faster transactions um inheriting security on the the layer from the layer one um lower transaction fees application specific uh layer twos like immutable x just trying to highlight why users would and should use layer twos and then going into what are layer twos what are what are rollups as that's like how their twos are being built um and um basically section on do some on your own research we're gonna be highlighting l2b a lot on this page it's a great resource for learning about risk and technical assessments of layer twos [Music] and it's a great team there who's capable of auditing these projects so i highly recommend that resource when looking into layer twos i want to touch a little bit on like what's the difference between a layer two uh ultel1 and a side chain they're very distinct differences but it's kind of kind of gray when you're first looking into some of this information so we want to try and help clear up some of that uh confusion for users next we want to go into like how to use layer two so if you have funds in your wallet how do you bridge over onto a layer two from main net and if your funds are on an exchange how would you get from an exchange on to layer two so there's gonna be some l2s that are supported from exchanges for example arbitrum you can withdraw and deposit on exchanges like coinbase and binance so looking to have a component there to help let a user be like i have my funds on finance for example and then showing that you can withdraw deposit from there um and if not we'll come up with some information on how to get your funds off of an exchange and then bridging up from there as well we want to highlight what are some different types of layer twos so as i was kind of mentioning before there's gonna be generalized layer twos like the arbor trims and optimisms where gaps are being deployed on these they're very similar to mainnet where you can publish a smart contract onto them and use them just like mainnet today except on a scaled layer two solution as well as there's application specific layer twos looking at like the immutable x's and what they're doing with the nft space and highlighting highlighting projects that are very application specific and then looking to provide tools and tips for users to be as effective as possible on layer two so what i mean by that is like what wallets will support layer twos or how how can you import an rpc for your wallet to be able to use a layer two in metamask for example what are some good wallet managers so as your funds are being distributed onto different networks how can you get a holistic view of your your assets among all these networks so looking at highlighting like xerion and zapper and the bank um which lets you go to one application and see all your assets on all the networks that they are currently supporting um highlighting the dat portals so for example arbitrary and optimism have really good pages highlighting the ecosystem that currently exists on those networks um so trying to make it easier for users to go to a web page uh like uh portal.arbitrum.1 i think is theirs but go linking out to those pages there so users can get a holistic view of like the ecosystem which they may be entering um as well want to highlight like the different fees that exist on these different l2s so linking out to l2 fees um as well as explorers for these l2s um so you can use just etherscan.io you'd have to find for example arbitrom.etherscan.io so linking out to block explorers that make it easier for users to utilize the network and have the same tools that they currently have for mainnet and as well want to link out to token lists that exist on the appropriate l2s um i know when i or onboarded on tele2 i was looking to get certain assets on that layer um and trying to find the contract for those tokens was a bit of a challenge so looking to try and bring some of that information into ethereum.org to make it easier for users to get that information from a trusted resource so that they're not you know worried about finding the wrong token address that's spoofing some project that you want to buy on an l2 um as well as we're going to have some frequently asked questions that maybe don't quite fit into the content that we're looking that i went over but would still be kind of frequently asked and deserves a spot on the website even if it can't be um integrated with the content that's already been written and as well we'll have a final note on some scaling that's coming for example sharding um looking to highlight that in addition to this use ethereum page we've done some work on breaking out our developer docs for layer twos so before when you were on this page under this scaling tab we had a layer two page and that layer two page included all the content for what is the layer 2 um optimistic rollups and zk roll ups uh what we're doing now is layer 2 is our scaling solution so we've included that now on to just the base scaling page and we're working with l2 projects in the space um to help bring more uh fleshed-out content for optimistic and zero-knowledge uh roll-ups um so looking to also build out our technical resources on these pages uh working with the experts in the space um that's basically what we have in mind and what we've been working on i definitely would like to hear some feedback from you guys if you think that we're on the right track with this um we're really hoping to provide a good resource for like i was saying beginners and intermediates and how to help onboard them into the space as as we all know gas fees are very high and this is kind of the next evolution for where users should be using ethereum moving forward as you'll get a better user experience both through faster transactions so your interface will be like much more snappy like you're used to on a on a web 2 product or cheaper gas fees which makes this a way more accessible space and you're still inheriting all the security from ethereum um so there's nothing to worry about when it comes to the security of your assets there um with that i'll pass it back to joshua awesome thank you corwin yeah i'm really excited about getting this page out in march um if anyone has any thoughts or ideas about how to make this content better we'd love to hear from you or even if you have questions around letters please ask them in the ethereum channel and we can then use that to better serve users on this page hopefully and cool so next up we've got collapse i'm going to share my screen yeah so here are instructions for claiming the coax and if you click on the view um video you'll be able to see and i've just put the passcodes into this notion dock as well so to claim your co-app you just go on our discord server and the top right or just under the fpdm.org team actually ob now and you'll see the pull-up bot if you send a direct message to the bot with the secret word which is l22 so that's capital l two to two um the poet bot should respond to you send your claim link and then you can claim that and so i'll just leave it a minute or two just as everyone's doing that okay so one last time the instructions for claiming your pull up around the screen now but just on the discord server if you click on the pull up bot send a direct message with the secret word which is l22 and the poet bot will send you a link back that you can claim your clap with awesome i think we can move on um so i'm gonna stop sharing my screen now um next up we have pablo um who's going to be speaking a little bit about the ecosystem support program's website redesign and following after pablo we're going to have sarah who'll talk a little bit about the academic grant trend yes thanks josh can you turn your mic up by any chance a little quiet can you hear me hello yeah i'm not sure if i can still pretty quiet if you're having problems with this you can use discord uh in the browser instead of the app that usually works better or you can just yell into the microphone or just yell can you still hear me a little bit hello yeah just a little quiet yeah okay well i i will try to to talk a little bit louder so yeah this we have a release a new version of the esp site this is not a specific related to if.org but we as a team in ethereum.org we we help maintain different sites across the film foundation so this is one of them this is the esp program site we released this new version the new design a bit of context on the esp program the esp program basically the goal is to provide funds and support in different in different ways ethereum related projects in the ecosystem and yeah this is the site this is it's pretty small you can enter this and learn more about the the esp goal and enroll if you are a person or you are working in a project related to ethereum you can apply for the different type of grants that the esp program is offering is they have you have these three different type of grants you can enter each one of them you can read and learn more about them and and then you can you can apply here um yeah that's pretty much the site you can learn more here in the about section and the last thing to to mention is that if you find any bug or you you see something that is not working as expected you can rise an issue in the esp website repo or you can you can provide some feedback on our discord channels we would really appreciate that not sure if anyone wants to add something to the sp if not then i'm back to use looks like yeah so thanks very much for giving us a quick run-through of that pablo looks absolutely gorgeous um next up we've got sarah who's going to talk a little bit about the ecosystem support academics grant strength hi everyone thanks josh yes my name is sarah and i'm part of the ethereum foundation team what i wanted to share with you today is that the ethereum foundation just launched a new wave of grants specifically targeted targeting ethereum related academic research so basically we will be supporting researchers in universities think thanks phd students and research centers and others interested in creating open source knowledge to further advance the ecosystem so this grants round has up to 700 um us dollars in total and it is live now on the dot org page in the grants section and also in the esp um that pablo just showed so i invite you all to apply and share with your networks um this grants round is open until april 22nd so make sure you submit on time if you have any project proposals and again feel free to share among the networks who may be interested in applying for these grants i'm happy to clarify any questions that you might have and if not then i will get back to josh but let me know if you have any questions yeah i'm just opening the floodgates just now i need to i'm new everyone um but yeah if anyone has any questions feel free just unmute and ask yeah so you should be able to unmute now so yeah if you do have any questions or if you want to ask in the community call chat i'm sure said is happy to take private messages as well okay um so finally then we can we can move on we've got paul who will be talking a little bit about our user experience for staking and how we're working to improve that yes hey guys how's everyone doing give me one sec here i'll share a let's screen see your screen okay so yeah my name is paul front and developer with ethereum.org team i'm going to chat a little bit about the topic of staking today um quick disclaimer of course this is just the ethereum.org website team i'm speaking on behalf of this is not a protocol level discussion here that being said we're trying to open up staking for as many people as possible essentially when the beacon chain went live in december 2020 uh 32 eth was required at that time it was a little bit more reasonable if you go back a couple years for users to accumulate that much we're trying to make that shift now towards focusing more on solo staking and or sorry uh pooled staking options basically because most people at this point are are not going to be able to contribute a full 32 week um so that that focus is shifting and we are planning on updating this page with some more resources um not much has changed so far essentially this is the existing page um if you notice down here we do have the two main paths 32 with versus less than 32 we're looking to revamp this a little bit and on the less than 32 each side you'll see we have had a pr from a community member updated with adding rocket pool to this in a very simple fashion we're going to be expanding this a little bit more to emphasize rocket pool to users rocketpool is one of the options out there that's very low barrier to entry for people it's been audited by multiple firms it's got an active bug bounty out there quite decentralized as far as the node operators are concerned and it offers users the ability to self-constitute their funds and still maintain liquidity through what's called the r eth token which represents basically your your steak eat plus the rewards that have been earned by that eath essentially and it gives a very good option for people to join into the staking community without necessarily having to run hardware um so there's gonna be some more resources on that coming up um this is actually the rocket pool page right there um and i will drop in the chat some links for everybody that i'm gonna go through real quick um so this is this is rockapool uh like i said definitely encourage you to check it out there'll be more information on this plumbing as far as a pretty solid option for people to stake going down the list we also still want to encourage people to do home staking and do it in the way that's most decentralized and beneficial for the network uh steerium is one option that's going to be discussed on the site at some point soon stereo is basically a gui it's a graphical user interface that you can use to tap into a node that you may have so you got a little computer box in there running linux you can use this from your mac or windows pc or whatever to tap into your node and have a nice graphical interface so this is a nice option that's out there to make staking easier for users now of course there's always the command line if you're familiar with that if you have 32 eth i'd strongly encourage you to take that approach um but if you're not familiar with the command line you want to get involved with running a different type of node uh there's this page as well of course the run and node page which went live a little over a month ago i encourage you to check that out too and i do want to chat a little bit then going on to the discussion of client diversity this is something we're going to be adding more information to this site as well right now there's a there are multiple clients consensus layer clients and prism is the one that has as you see here a little over a super majority over 66 percent so we're trying as a community to decrease prism's majority here it's not because prism's bad many people have heard this before prism's an amazing client but they're all really amazing clients and having prism be used by over two-thirds of the network puts the network at risk i mean if you're not familiar with how i'd encourage you to check this page out here it's listed on the the community called chat channel um and some more places you can go to get involved with this type of stuff of course the eatstaker website and you can join their discord there's going to be some new test nets coming up there's the the kiln test net will be starting soon i'd encourage anybody who's interested in the stuff to check that out and then we're heading on towards hopefully gurley and prodder merge and uh main that beacon chain hopefully come this summer again this is just my hopeful thoughts um this is another article here on reddit that that i've been kind of that super fizz put out recently that i really like i'd encourage people to check out as well this is um aiding in our decisions to be honest as far as how to organize some of the content going forward really good article he put out emphasizes the most important ways you can impact the network at the top and kind of works its way down so definitely check that out and of course there's the whole state of the state playlist on youtube if anybody's curious as well these are just some other resources for people in the meantime and look forward to some changes on the page soon that's all i got any questions for me yeah we're about to go in the q a but i guess now this is a good time if you've got any questions for paul specifically about what he just spoke about or anything else that we've just covered feel free to speak up or ask them in the community call chat we also do have our slido which someone can kindly drop a link in the community call chat so if you don't feel like speaking up you can drop a question in there too which i know some of you are already done so thank you for that okay cool and so we'll spend the remainder of the call on q a and we have a list so you're ready to go but as i said please feel free to add some more um we've got a question from stephen reinhardt when does proof of stake on main net start do already please thank you asap i think paul's presentation he just done already covers this but um we're looking at proof of stake in q2 specifically as far as i know we're looking at around june um but again it's not something specifically that ephedium.org deals with uh i don't know if anyone else in the team paul wanna go ahead yeah i'll just add to that just keep in mind of course this is the core developers who are working on this there is no specific date set there just isn't um like i mentioned before uh the test nets are rolling around long currently consugues uh kind of being deprecated and going to be switched to kiln like i said after that it sounds like the plan i've heard is moving on to the girly and prodder test nuts and officially merging those as one of the last steps before mainnet but that being said there isn't an exact date that i'm aware of uh there is the difficulty bomb which is set to go off i think in june july time period is when we're going to start feeling that so i would anticipate some type of decision by then but yeah ultimately it's not up to us yeah i'm just gonna share a video of uh danny ryan's talk at youth denver he talks a little bit about like there's no exact date obviously like that was just mentioned but he does talk about their progress and how close that uh that they are when it comes to it and that they're feeling pretty comfortable with the current difficulty bomb but um obviously that's subject to change pending bugs in uh in the test net and i've also dropped a link to the merge mainnet readiness checklist which is a public github repo anyone can follow to see what still needs to be done before everything's ready for the merge cool thank you um next up anonymous has dropped as a link blockchain and its community effect um i had to look in advance so the question of this seems to basically be are contentious forks good for the health of a blockchain protocol um so we actually have a really good page on ethereum.org on ethereum governance that you should check out um that explains on it the utility of forking and why it is important um personal opinion but i'd argue absolutely if there's strong disagreements about the ability it's just like within the network if there is a strong disagreement then being able to fork or at least having the threat of forking allows for compromise otherwise it's just like this tyrannical majority rule and i've seen a bunch of people make the argument that ethereum today is much stronger because of the ethereum classic fork as well um anyone have anything else they want to add yeah i just i'm sorry sam here just add real quick i think that reddit thread there was a good answer of like distinguishing between the types of forks of like planned forks that are non-contentious and like a planned upgrade such as the upcoming merge to proof of stake on aetherium versus what might be a contentious fork and something that results in the uh in the actual outcome of like two distinct blockchain communities um cool misha i see the op the thread good to have you here um i'll share a couple books that i found interesting kind of related to this um one is the block size war um that's a book about somewhat like the history of forks within the bitcoin ecosystem i thought it was really interesting to kind of just like follow the history it includes a lot of primary resources of just like discussions in the forums debating the bitcoin block size how that ultimately resulted in you know bitcoin cash svu all that good stuff um and there's some some pretty solid kind of like biographies of ethereum at this point um the infinite machine being won i know lorchen just published a new book that i haven't read yet but that could also be a great way to kind of dig into the history of these protocols and to just see like how these forks have actually impacted them i know there's a lot of debate on you know is forking healthy is it not um kind of hard to say i feel like it's not necessarily a black and white thing but certainly an interesting topic um and yeah cool to hear you're digging into that yeah and i just finished laura shin's new book and i'd also highly recommend that as well and it does get into the ethereum classic fork too and next up we've got brayton are there any are there any areas and specifically ethereum.org would like to see greater community engagement and contribution loads um i'd be curious if anyone else in team had any thoughts here for me um it looks like in the next question we'll get into design a little bit which i think is something that we could do a lot better with we've also had a lot of extremely successful content collaborations and um but generally they've been one-off so i'd really love to see more people contributing writing and ideas for articles and documentation anyone else on the team yeah uh onboarding and education is one of the biggest things that comes to mind for me i know that's not necessarily super specific but anything that can be done to take somebody who's not familiar has questions about this ecosystem and giving them the education they need the tools they need and the the friendly support they need in order to to become a part of this community that's what i would like to see anyone else i think we can get into the design question because it's along the same lines as well um so scott asks i'm enjoying the new design focus channel on discord what plans did the team have to create more engagement in the future um obviously at the start of the call we introduced nico and jacob for new designers um very early days but we've spoke about a couple of things already about like working in public sharing designs of the community that they're working on potentially office hours things like that um obviously we'll keep you posted and always open to any ideas uh does the jackal burn you know either if you want to weigh in on that at all hey i'll just say something real quick this is sam again of like scott really glad you brought up this question thanks for thanks for bringing it to the table and i know you've been one of the few designers who have like found a way to come in and contribute with the pull-up designs and like the community page redesign so if you do have input on yeah like how to get more designers from the community involved i think we'd love to hear from you um if any of you folks have followed our team's roadmap over the past two quarters like you will have seen we've been working hard on actually like hiring product designers um up until now we just haven't had that resource internally on our core team um thankful to say like after a long road of interviews um and meeting people like nuno and jacob who just introduced themselves today like they literally just started this week um tuesday was their first day so um they probably don't have a ton of just like strong opinions on how to properly engage the community just yet but i can assure you like that is something they're excited to think about and yeah if you folks on the call do have input on ways that we could you know open up um the work we do from a design standpoint on ethereum.org how we could collect input from you and get feedback from you folks i think that'd be great um so just a quick preface but yeah i'll hand it over to to nino or jakob if you guys do you want to touch on anything for sure this is nuno uh i'm really excited to join the team uh we've done this week like sam they said and i know that we have a lot of work to do ahead of us i have a long wrong map and looking forward to work with the community to to help us uh bring new ideas and new approaches to design we're thinking about office hours and some open some figma files or so but we haven't touched that in detail so stay tuned for more on this awesome thanks sam thanks nuno um we're getting pretty tight on time so i'm going to skip over some questions that are maybe not the most relevant um rory is asking aside from the translation program does ethereum.org have any goals for helping ethereum reach and expand to the next billion users i think this is a really good question that i don't have like a fantastic answer for i think a lot of the work that we already do you know building up the resources and engaging with the community and getting the community to help us um expand the knowledge about ethereum that we have on the site is like a really great starting point but there's lots of different initiatives um happening as well that we aren't related to because we're obviously just focused on um ephedium.org does anyone else want to speak to this a bit i'll throw in some words too paul again certainly the ethereum foundation as a whole has efforts to pursue this type of activity you know looking to what can we do to bring in the next billion users that question exactly as far as our team i know diversity certainly been something that's been uh been a topic recently amongst the ethereum foundation as well as our specific team something that we had you know admit uh we have a little bit of work to do uh certainly we got a growing team now um some of you may notice that it's pretty much all guys at this point on our team specifically and that is something that personally i would like to see expanded see more diversity amongst our team and the whole ethereum foundation um not just culturally but also you know gender as well getting some more diversity amongst our users so we can help impact that additional billion people and i think that's one one direction we need to go yeah thanks paul i think it's a great question rory i would just add that overall like we try to stay somewhat focused as the ethereum.org team on just like creating educational content that helps onboard anyone to ethereum and yeah like getting that website translated into as many languages as possible um is a big part of doing that so open to any ideas on how we could help ethereum reach and expand the next billion users i would just yeah tack on to paul's point that like there are other teams within the ethereum foundation the grants program that sarah and pablo touched on there's actually a team focused on what we call local grants so actually doing more proactive outreach to communities across the globe particularly underrepresented areas and like helping accelerate adoption and just like education on that front um we actually have a team within the ethereum foundation called the next billion um which is a somewhat of a fellowship program that focuses on yeah like empowering um entrepreneurs across the world to to help address some of these challenges so in short like it's a much bigger problem than i think the ethereum.org team can solve on its own i think what we try to focus on most is like highlighting those programs that do exist to give them more exposure and make sure that people are discovering them so that if you're an entrepreneur who wants to help solve these problems if you're you know an academic researcher looking for funding to help on the stuff or you know translators looking to get involved no matter who you are the goal is for us to like help you find the project that can that can push this stuff forward um but if you do have ideas on how we could do a better job of that i mean that's definitely what we're here for yeah and i think also to add to that like when we build out our road maps it's something we do somewhat keep in mind when we're trying to create content so um some examples that we have on this roadmap for this quarter specifically are um helping revamp like the wallets page and layer twos and um real world like use case stuff that users as they onboard into ethereum um will be using um so trying to like provide good onboarding content for uh for users who are learning to like get into the space yeah absolutely um yeah we're very very tight on time i'll ask the team to maybe have a quick look for the remaining questions and if there's anything that you feel is worthwhile answering feel free to hop in and answer um we've got a question from anonymous i haven't visited the site in a while watch new lots um we've got a new run a node page to teach you how to run a node a new page on client diversity which is getting increasingly important as we approach the merge we've rebounded rebranded away from ethereum 2.0 terminology we've massively improved coverage across 42 languages uh someone could pop a link to our road map and the community call chat channel i think that covers just about most of the things that we're working on i could throw in an answer to one of these questions too um i see another one by anonymous when soul is taking after the penalties are unfair if your validator goes down to internet or power outage other plans to reduce the penalties um honestly my understanding is no in fact the altair upgrade that occurred a couple months ago actually increased those penalties to their i believe their final levels um i'll drop a link in the chat as well if you want to read up more that's the knowledge base page for beacon chain um you can take a look through there it does go through the the penalties the different types of penalties and why they exist um keep in mind this is what makes a proof of stake system work there needs to be penalties there needs to be repercussions for users who misbehave um and that's how this system is going to work so as far as i understand no there's not going to be any reduction to these penalties going forward and like i used to think the same probably the same sort of mental model that you have just now and i think paul done a really good good job explaining that to me but you might have a misunderstanding between how staking penalties work for being offline and stakeholding penalties work for submarine and correct votes real quick touch on that there's a difference between leaking some elixir be by being offline which is a very mild penalty compared to an actual malicious act something that's threatening to the network that results in what's called slashing which is a totally different penalty that kicks you out of the network that's a much more severe penalty and typically does not happen just by accident so not something you need to be terribly worried about if you're looking to stake and the leaking penalties are very mild there they recover just as fast as you lost them basically thank you paul sorry for anyone who asked questions that we didn't get to and feel free to pop questions in the community call chat and try and respond to them after the call but that's just about all we've got time for um thanks so much for everyone for joining us for taking the time out of your day to spend this arrow with us and we hope it's been educative and informative um yeah and we'll be back towards the end of this month so we'll probably see a lot of you again here in three or four weeks time everyone thanks for joining thanks everyone have a good day thanks everyone thank you you
