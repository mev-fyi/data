[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] big louder hey better huh Oh perfect okay who first thanks for coming plus you're a diva talk about hood dragon and a tailored for talk about nobility in general and if you haven't seen the target the short version of how its ability that you was in 2011 18 what it sucks all right now I want you to sort of an update on that talk on where we are with ability but here in town ident here's an update it still sucks and I mean and and I think it's super important but if you have like this super unscientific Chardonnay prepared to you showing like a feasibility in terms of backwards if that's the amount of work you can that's probably how much at the whole thing that we've been putting on duty I don't think it matters a lot because like what is buting a super scalable thing that nobody's using right it's sort of crazy that's way they don't know beauty beauty man like because you can get something so big but nobody's leaving they're crazy right maybe that's what your beauty man maybe that's what everyone's doing and I don't think the problem is designers we have a lot of designers in the intersection and I think at some point the problem is really fundamental right because there are two homeworks right and you need to create a key there's no way around it I need money on it right and I think that's that's where I'm saying it's not like you can design as much as you want around that they'd be pretty big nice but if you have to do those two things and much happens there's to some base in the front if you want a copy but what happened between our word a family I think that's where it gets tricky right because you can design like a beautiful experience for our first material but at some point your user is gonna have have the bike they're gonna have their little ones watching that and what do you do this right we can of course just repeat the same process and you just create them and you need some money it's a little bit easier they have money there but now that sort of sucks for the user right because certainly now every time they create a new key they're like they keep having all those tiny little amount of money yeah I probably had a bunch of features and a bunch of tiny hands that's all it's best for the user because suddenly he can forget about money you can do the opposite where thing which is just to play the kid right it's good because I don't have too much money you need to respect the key but it's super super insane because now we have to trust to devices which are key and if any one of them is compromising everything and it sort of creates teachers every penny because of course he can trust one device but if you're ditching theme that that's how you learn and there are there ways that you can do that which doesn't look like there's issues sometimes your diet be like a username and password but sweetie you're just giving away your tears your your seed phrase to little application those are very bad situation with your teaching a bad behaviour user the exact way some people do it which if you don't do any of that you just keep the key on the server with the money on that server and you can do it not only to store your way you can encrypt it and try to do it in a way that the server the owner of the server cannot activate that money easily but still you have the same problem but what if that server goes out but it is complicated like you go back to the square zero where the server goes down I hope you have someone I hope you have the secret we have everything sportin so how can we try to solve this in fact right and that's why I think about defining in person which annuity engineering because good design requires with engineering back-end and so to solve it with matter of actions which is new cool thing what they do is every time you want further advice you can have a new key right you just and then you can different key for device but notice that every device only has to keep and where are the funds store you keep the funds on a giant robot in the sky right that's a more contract and you keep the funds there and because it's the tanks for Robert sky you can keep it fun interviewee thigh and it is collectibles you can give it an en Ã©ste and if you give it a DNS name then the user doesn't need to remember his hex address the only tuna tooth needs to remember the comedian anything and then he can find the address of his robot in the sky right which is of course mark contract how and that's sort of how Universal games were acting first of all came the idea where you want board users by giving them like a money robots that keeps all their funds and the keys are stored in different place how does that look like that sort of looks like this right in Rio so this is like a real example of it working on macro maintenance and I think you'll realize it because this is kickback right McCrory is here kickback is awesome like everyone likes food to see the stuff to be back but sort of like it's only for prettier people right now it's very hard for you to people to use kickback because you have to keep that money and money comes back and it's all crazy and what I want you to do all I want you to do when you want to find them is I want you to type a name and that name we recognize who you are and you allow you to connect to their content that already exists but we are allow you to create another account of judgment and let's see how it looks when happens if you don't have so we are starting Majan a user doesn't have anything right he doesn't have never heard of crypto how fast can we onboard him from now to there and I'm gonna to account all right here's a hero right first of all you're a completely create now we are going to go you need to put money on it you can put it too but it's more complicated it's more more fun and you were a figure in the United Kingdom and we sort of look for all the wrapping providers are payable for you we're just on ramp because we say look I'm going to put the amount of money you can put it easier than what it died or something like that and the error right there are means of theories with the rebels card again this is like a real car on maintenance really working you're just like did the screen recording and then oh now the Justino are user it's to do it she needs to confirm the card she's gone I think we sort of blur of course the private information because it's it's a real car she writes a PIN number and we'll go back there and you're just passing that didn't work now she's gonna type a confirmation code after her revolute card now she the money's there the money's coming we are back now from home RAM now back from revenue Tom Ram man now back to don't want to to get back now what we are doing is that it recognized that that money arrived at a particular address we're not creating them deploying a new Morrison contracts for them and that happens very fast and boom you have yours mark on like 1 minute 30 seconds from 0 to the user having a food account but right now you're the keep back flow if you're adding more information that you don't necessarily need that what I want to show you is absolutely let's think about all those things we didn't have to do you didn't have to go in on in the next change account you didn't have to do some key I see because your card is easy for you you didn't have to imagine others even understand your hand by teacher all you need to do was we we we made a flow in which you put your credit card and boom you have an account and that is your account is in fact a Morrissey account it is like in the movie seawater so let's let's keep going what happened ever right so we just entered your your information there and you can start using kickback and you're gonna go there you're gonna select on your hand and chose one let's just because like a cheaper one because it's a real thing and we so you get back to 8 words you you are sleepy by putting some and somebody wanted anything I'm gonna send some money to prove that I'm gonna coach didn't you just click there and then you were thinking notice that he just interacted with another contract right they do one minute 30 seconds to on poor doing to achieve less than 30 seconds now for you to attract a certain first word contract and you are ready a VP and it seems like we have like three best accounts on the bottom that means Acme if you were if you go to that event now we're going to what happens now if you want one word a second time right evidence is now a great buy on your app right first we had bad experience now we were going to over there how did you do is fine look I'm just Tina I already exist so you won't have to go to the review again what you're gonna have to do is just go to keep back and confirm to you or you the way we do that we do with this little wingding thing which I think you'll find super funny okay here's a very simple we don't want you to have a man-in-the-middle attack so this is just a way for you to confirm the account that you're on that you're in right so in a way it's like typing a half address but instead of having a hectare but we just have to select from six emojis and then you can confirm that you and as soon as you go you confirm your device now we're connecting to it and then you'll be able to access it on your mobile account so all you needed to do to use your your new account was tell viewer conformance on the problem right that's sort of like the real-time on my net will work use your money and now you're already in evidence evidence the time - time standing the interesting too because it's being mechanically people have been talking about I'm standing is a useful thing but I never seen anyone actually do it because it's so complicated for you to be a good time stamp on it here or anyway become a Negro changer oh now all you need to do now we are gonna choose a photo there just add some information for for you to say look this is real this is my photo it took this in this time and when you press create we're gonna upload that photo brought the hatch to the photos contract tag it and came back come back to you the certificate saying this is the real photo that was taken and you can prove that he was put on the Block sacks and he just boom you just did it again you just interacted with a second smart contract you know even having to understand what a smart contract was in the first place and now just a third one cause it's cool that this is charm is wallet and this is actually the wallet we were gonna provide if you go to the person again we will provide view of my wallets from you from Jarvis the idea again all you need to do to one part is tell you who you are they'll be your username and then we are going to confirm that username in the other in the other side same thing you come here type for for images and you're already approved and the cool thing about this is that charges in a more traditional wallet and it's sort of where you will be able to manage your stuff and inside of it and we even had that I guess I guess picker it's not necessary I don't want you to understand what I get this you will be able to pay your gas with teacher or we've died or if any currency that you want but sometimes it's good to have that particularly right here that we have three accounts right you we have like two on the laptop and one on the icon it means that your account is not Morrison secure by three different cheese on two different websites and two different on three different website but you different devices in different systems so your account electing five minutes of just playing around is already super secure by other people and we can just transfer from these funds from one place to the other I think we we added like a hex address there I could just had added ENS login username that would be cool and and you can see like a real connection on teachers and it just happen from one place to other in accountant illnesses before we know the user ever understanding that he was a blockchain and you didn't see that the balance is sort of the same on both sides because you were in fact sharing your balance if you put your money in one account you don't need to put money in all every single account and that is sort of how security how universal again works as an experience for the users how does it and how does it work from right so I'm pleased to announce that we've done a first security audit there is no people issue speaks and you have found we solved a few others and went to a second signature that soon and we want to also be able to ensure your your account mother figure working hard on if you want you to be able to quickly convert any web tree app into Universal logging and the idea is if you have an app that is working with madness and we know that and from from experiences we have these people that's that is there is a step where you lose up to 95% of your conversions right you are you have a dance then you ask them now can you please install Mary Matthews 99% of all users there and we want what we want to happen is that if you have to add you can just add a couple lines of code you can give you a custom became provider and yeah gear is that in the end you don't actually need to choose between Universal games or mathematics or anything else what you're gonna give you it's just a button say signing material another letter will do is check if you have a Madame s account or not and if you don't have a mathematical account or if you don't want to share the matter matter come to view then we fall back to universal login right and there you can feed and there are it suppose to be you see before and I think the cool part of this this you don't have to choose between movie providers the idea is that this is tender to support almost everything you can other you should be able to put any any address that I need any personal incompatible address and be able to intuit detect if you have mathematical to work for having different login it will work right so we are super happy to say that all of this is on maintenance right now we haven't opened it covers to testing a bunch of small things but you want to have an open beta by the end of October and then if you want to join its please go to a pilot program where you slowly up adopt like ants and help under the app developers and everything so that you can test your Ursa begins by yourself so please sign up for the better learn more on universal given a go follow us on Twitter and everything else that's it I have a question excited to hear about where the payment gateways is like can you tell me more about sort of what options are currently working for the PRS so we try to get as maybe many people trying to get that many payment gateway that you can be aware to this America to be a fellow one gram and wire wire is coming so we eat right there trying to always be like what mutt learns best in whatever country it is provide that to the user so every transaction is over every transaction we land so we have a relator so basically to have any sort of eater or die like you can make used I like doing a roommate the users let's say you only have a decade diet our wallets right so you can pay its own actually with diet the retainer will pay you pay emergent we surveyed with itself if you don't have anything under water right the first time you enter what you do is we provide you with an address and doesn't have a contract deployed yet right it's called a contract or deployment trick which can send the money to the contract and after doors manager then we can divide a contract and take the fear out of it and then therefore the user is paying for that and in fact if you want to report included investors you can pay for that deployment by yourself each one's right I've been emulated I would love to we've got to make it so it kind of works and my friends like what basically recycling kids older than emojis and this is just a sacred smooth transfer from public key and the alternative was accurate or scanning or attack origins or e-type pink like money while they she will it's no difficulty is sometimes hot she's always like it's around keyloggers which is kinda cool so this was the documentation there is a whole chapter on like all the different ways for considered and the reactive component is nice but series not just better masking the diverse areas there is 40 Caesarea inspect and their respect to connect or already things I'd like to do that so when you integrate weakening so that last that that part of particular thing we want to have like a NFL getting set them in which if you have to buy a dress I got an ass that's what game connected you want to allow your children or whatever questions out who paid the ESP like depends on them privately that wants to give away like in the apples you know ans and paper for a depend otherwise that can charge users okay I ask another question someone how it doesn't Universal logins work with existing what 3d ball it's like baseball but nuts sounds like that but check if you have already electric random like finding with you you've met a massive mental but if you had anything positive you connect to Eunice we will provide you one of those outlooks ask me if you want to share the order at this you still get like medicine for get stronger if they allow Jesus I don't think so yeah from that one condom there's just a lot of a web three fingers I think that's that's my time I would outside if you talk again thank you [Applause]
