foreign [Music] okay so we're going to talk about a formal layer 2 standards working group which has been formed as an eea Community project managed by Oasis and we'll explain what that means but first I am Tosh Dinesh I work at the ethereum foundation on ecosystem support focusing on the Enterprise ecosystem so I work with the Enterprise ethereum Alliance chair of the media interest group co-chair the eea community projects project governing board and this is Dan Shaw I'm Dan uh I've got a decade of kind of bringing together innovators and the Enterprise help bring node.js into the foundation uh been a a Founder done a lot of Open Source stuff and I am the co-chair of this and uh uh Andre Dr Andres forend is my co-chair and it was a storied background uh he's the spec lead on the Baseline protocol and uh as well as my co-chairs okay so uh yeah last talk really teed up why uh you know standards are are useful um you know to have a a space and a Clearinghouse for uh discussions and you know a neutral space right uh there's so much Innovation that's happening that uh you know we need to um come together and um you know our our perspective is uh in part from the needs of the Enterprise and in order to sort of uh continue the the adoption that we're seeing um Layer Two is essential uh and so putting in into place those uh standards and specification to enable uh layer to thrive so why are we doing this as an eea Community project managed by Oasis and what does that mean so Oasis is a non-profit technical standards body that was formed in 1993 they've done things like xgml and XML and a lot of sort of technical software standards sort of along the lines of IEEE or w3c iatf um so the ethereum community projects was formed three years ago as an oasis open project so under the Oasis Sanders bodies or umbrella what happened to my slots by EF consensus and the eea so ethereum Community projects is a you know it's an oasis open project meaning it's open source Open Standards development and so it's we chose the waste because it's a pretty low bureaucracy and it's a flexible standards process unlike some of the other ones like the w3c and ietf they're a lot more sort of bureaucratic and cumbersome Oasis is kind of more ethereum friendly in that it's lower bureaucracy and flexible so uh some of the folks that are involved uh of course uh tashana and Andreas uh from the EF uh we have Accenture uh Boba matter Labs metis octane Labs uh optimism and polygon um and we'd love to have you so please come and join us um so what have we've been working on there are lots of ideas for standards development topics in the layer 2 ecosystem the two that have gotten the most work done so far first is a canonical token list format which so the the issue is that most layer 2 projects have the list of tokens that exist on their layer twos and a wave that they map to in many cases a layer one token or a token on another layer or two and these lists are not maintained in any common standard format so standardizing the way that these token lists are stored it would be beneficial for interoperability uh another project is address aliasing so the uh the goal here is to be able to deterministically derive addresses of a digital asset or an externally owned account on an evm execution framework when it moves like when it moves across chains so if you know the origin chain of an asset you should be able to deterministically derive the address of it on another chain um we have many ideas for potential future topics to work on layer 2 transaction fee structures layer 2 interface transaction transaction interface standards one idea that's gotten some discussion is about cross-chain bridging of digital assets with residuals so the issue there is that if you have a token like an nft representing a bond or something that gets royalties over time something that gets payments over time and you move that to another chain it breaks the connection between the payments and the asset so that's not a completely solved problem there's been some discussion about that we would love to have more ideas on that and if you have other ideas for topics I would love to hear them we would love to have your involvement please get in touch so uh yeah thanks a lot we we meet bi-weekly um you can uh you know hit us up on our emails GitHub is uh github.com EA slash Oasis L2 and uh you know big big thank you and shout out to l2beat Dev connect um you know we were you know we've gotten this uh Initiative off the ground but uh you know thanks to LT beats uh event at uh devconnect you know we were really able to you know get a lot of the initiatives that you uh just saw uh you know set up and and really move forward so uh um you know we'd love to have you join us thanks thank you so much guys you did it the two of you were the fastest ones
