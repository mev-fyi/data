 alright I see it yes one more give that softly sure wait so it's art are the slides also kind of hollow this dreamy yeah they're gonna be on this one scoffs well you're gonna be events in the slides in your life conflict at the same time yeah Rocklin or somewhat the center I'll be here oh so I'm seeing this I don't know if that's what it looks like a Calliope here 30 frames per second someone okay you got yourself quite tested a cloud I don't like the words out I'm like a loud voice already this is a little bit intense okay hey guys thank you guys so much for coming guys and girls thank you for your patience we've had some technical difficulties but I think we're all right now we are streaming this event on YouTube as well I tweeted it so if you guys want to share that with their friends look at twitter.com slash lol or exit rdt TIG and you'll see and youtube link there so thank you - what's that yeah okay I mean I remember that you also see you're gonna hear it's not about Austin tonight yeah won't you tell us about originally getting at watching or working space that's kind of warped in the blockchain community space we do a ton of events doing office space and just hooked up and then we're a package where you could work out to explore these for $99 a month if you don't use those then one more in the next one so you'll find yourself in San Francisco from time to time would be to place to work and so when we work please let us know we've got the part regarding this table so welcome everybody from out of town the blockchain week and yeah give it up for Elena the worst he wasn't into the grid though thank you I run a blockchain co-working space in New York don't I see so I know how hard it is to do what you guys do so again thank you it's just so really fascinating part also thank you to everyone who's organizing San Francisco blockchain week I don't know if it's started yet like is this it this is that so we should keep a lot to me so thank you guys for coming yeah we've got a real like star-studded cast of folks to come and speak tonight or hear some really interesting talks from members of the 11 team we have a special guest as well and we might see you later so we're kind of yeah we're gonna we're gonna do three short talks first one is going to be introduction to web acetylene and tea blossom that's Alex veritasium Alex is actually bopd welcome so really really for those two get like you're coming and you're going to hear from jay penc freaking while so it's super deep technical stuff and then at the end room and do another part you may have again all right oh yeah okay weird place right there's one of the things so so we've been very known for the past few months building this new technology and this is sort of our first time this is our personal really makes any blending person so it's pretty exciting a little bit nervous you get a little bit of a demo music we need to call us every two to three weeks that was the very first time we showed up last night so you could build an assessment we're going to do we're going to try to do a live demo and yeah I mean we are officially launching you also have an assessment done in a month and so this is you've never been a stuff that no one else in the world see so it's super excited I don't know all right take it away this is another oh yeah I guess a few questions up from the reason we're going to be you know what this is some anomalies didn't raise your hands if you know what EVMs if you go up the salinity contract have you ever looked at assembly before did you write that up any medicine have you heard what he wasn't before this are you excited that he was okay so ya ready yep so this is just a minute sir that's my baby and that's my gift of username and you can look it up and find a lot of things okay so let's just start with a couple of issues we PMS and I believe to look there is a lot of cancer so physically just not really designed for poor performance and it's it has some you know weird features supposedly it makes is two different things into the same instruction set it has a combination of instructions and it has instructions which would be great want high level so some of those would be anything put into the state interacting with the two-term state and tracking a better context then my personal favorite one is Shockley so it's a construction it it's way more high level then you should be and Leslie there's not too many marriages for you there's no need to be so anybody here go to contact any certain provide no one let me hear the bank's L&L people but still nobody is doing anything in debt right have you done it no way so it's really just a little ESS or language put in EDM to this really started and and look at it later okay so what are some of the many of you have worked with I've seen you before just a couple of notes it's designed by the nutritional state which makes all the companies behind this excitement disease exactly from using any medicine there is this design purpose a second set and if this design could be much closer to Allegro community because it designed for that as a result in the hope that if others certain benefits some wonderfully students probably hospitals because one of our existing by the semi-finals you to mission what ability but it's also designed to see much more extensible didn't know we had this understanding that the EDM is timing and it's controlled by the smaller set of people and as a result it will be much more easy much more easier to change it included addictive but they're the first two years we haven't receive that passes to be quick to be kind of all that webassembly because it was designed with accessibility in mind it's going to be much more quicker to extend if any devices just people ready this is what five an assembly or love area languages can be compacted at the center I just want to mention a couple of those Russ Russ is the one which has the best support it's a lot of things in the space especially watching space are being written into us now because or the fourth and final episode and it is a result a lot of things right that is written in us and not an existing when it's a selfish grip but that's with a nice tribute work so pledge tip is a typed version of JavaScript if you put it that way it kind of looks like JavaScript but it has types and it's not the script is a virginal type script or something which looks like that strip which never you can type the website the impressive part would assume this grip is it's done by a team and they really they really wrap it infinitely chantix and eventually work with them to create one in support in a sense yeah there's some language about it but the only couple of them an excessive one lies you'll and wiper under this that you have a uniform material but solidity so U is a language used by the Soviet team where we exploited input and it's not stated to you'll and eventually translate that to medium fight third or he was so I see cygnus in present but this is this is it actually to like now so this before we left for the next year to have this pipeline and as a result so limit equally capable of comparative XM and the last time a generic a framework which is an entire so pink rebirth is yeah it's like pivot well you could say it's it's the form of an application copilot network when you can specify syntax and semantics of languages and it has a lot of different features but essentially you can execute these languages where many sensitive between them 50 can't work has support submit question that is why what is the velocity why do we do this so our labels that he wasn't against to include the execution engine of the into your network and the main forces that is we wanted to have an extensible platform we don't want to a platform which can open easily change penalty to it doesn't have a lot of people behind it when we started to working a lot on religious two years ago and we didn't review of all the different instruction six okay for example we looked at Dow and who is viable but they're all the possible options and that would be a service any seemed to be the best option the being benefits you're gonna get a clever similarly is there's so many different people and companies behind it and some of the languages being I did it's hopefully a lot more tools and a lot of languages be a new main for lesson and the main one electrical sites here is the analyzers and optimizers and so analyzes fear being any kind of tools which can use on medicine they like what languages splitter by Devon sent me to analyze skills for security vulnerabilities plan hai pass the evening ecosystem or the solar system has a limited set up to this sorry what more mature languages such as phosphorus seed which aim to do that so that's one good the main benefits do you hope to do is stepping into this much of your space of toilets and security tools especially for medicine and of course we would like to include some additional coming to have to give you a so I'm not you're going to go to uni be what you want honest but before that's shortly we didn't we change anything about assembly so that's an idiot we didn't need to change anything we just series whatever solutions status on the offers to extend it and each senator so in practice so that means is you can use functions expose by HTML and you can use it from any language center so that is an example say if you see this theta C code and you can use assembly library let's see you can do the same thing like a contract and this fall season seven library the offensive intercourse into between five or mysticus send another if this is what specific senator library but there's no need to modify a compiler but there's no need to modify and it can be the dish just a framework supplied by us yeah I think that's all we said so let me send right now we do have a white student yeah teach a class that you're lost and therefore it's we will be there to discuss why they will apply the women's however they didn't expect changes to happen on the API so it's all set into so but it's flat state we're ready to be used in a test neck so we're going to test the demonic see that perhaps the support native support for two different clients are you speak here at which attends maybe simply leave that to Alice and that's been a very private if something to you is fine you know the mainstream but the disease it is where what she is for test generation in the experimenter so it's very importantly so quiet out there and that has support for he wasn't but other one which struck everyone is heard about this disability community to support into it now this is missing part there and we do have the universal support so what that means is there's this tiny remark EPMC so we're not gonna be talking with the agency but evening seditious an API and it's you happen to be a meeting and find developer all you need to do is a support dtmc of yeah think deeper he wasn't engine to wait to get coming into the city yeah and you have there's something that's at 60 today and this is their butt to try get to see actually focus on is less and this in this way rust is our main focus for system level contacts which which I like context which do system level things so anything which would be which would be commonly used while the focus is on the script could really poured into the context using the play well if you happen to be muscles so you can attach of this people highest and system context it she's gonna talk too much work with that we have all of these [Music] somebody base the same person so basically people class are they to fix a shortcoming in between your network as you know engineer young every kind of execution is measured in s and the main first purpose of this measurement is symptom at the time the execution takes and this is kinda a lot of things which would be very commonly needed such as session methods or recovering a public to use the signature all these if implemented using given instructions would take so long we take so much gas that you want a to run it in a single block so therefore people high school on which are actively subsidizing innovation of common contacts and every single client today has to demand that they make deep anguish and what's mean at not here is they'll replace that and we supply a seamless of all on the sea comprised of which there are today I think AIDS Orion so we supply any permutation of these Inlet assembly and the clients all need to infinitive one Bible this section would be a discussion topic but nothing keep them both being like that the main two focus points to you that right now is looking to opportunity with more lot to me because watching projects are also exploring to subside and it will be cool if there would be Senate basically said there that would be more ways to move contacts across these different systems so that's nice but the more important point where he actually have made progress is researching two tips and I'm not sure already guessing they're legit or so just a quick note basically when you have any kind of like oh yeah the couple that were a simple way to do that is basically instruction pipeline which is prednisone it shouldn't be that so but he never has to decide the signals which maybe even was still in space today and you can do very same thing in that assembly you can't execute this line by line but you can also speak more advanced technique like the by Terry since they've all of that to your master and he's exiting this you put that could be ahead of time conviction but there's an even more complicated way with this one tip that make sense for it just an accommodation and what it does is it first does miss my byline execution what if it finds a certain parts of the code are humans again again we stayed with me and ignore my dues to machine code because it's all this sounds really great but there's an issue with this can you guess attention with this yeah I don't want me to learn but it's like so they see when you execute your hands back you want to have this gas cause accurately some of that clearly defined so that no time with any circumstances which then what type then they should they makes them less time but it shouldn't spend more time on executing any impunity superb the main problem agents is that in many cases it is possible to cut a certain piece of code which may not be used it doesn't matter but it is possible to practice certain piece of code which will blow up this combination process and what it means what I could should be second nature to take too long to do this simulation but if you didn't make this video setup curve you can pull it out 10x hundred s has an X and what it actually means is that you better meet the denial of service attack in the neck so this is a quite an important thing to research so that's our you may notice point right now I see you're really excited to practice stare at this and a lot of different ways to do that so you don't actually have to write code there's no need for that the first thing you could do is just listen and ask questions because we need to get better xfinity all of this document in all of this so the first thing you should do ask questions and then you can also have this write documentation that's known as documentation but if you want to write everything you are so please yeah actually if you're gonna go for my got it okay so the first one consolation one doesn't represent and there's this sits the organization citizen representative we know that yes come on deck one thing is c'mon c'mon is the deck communism agree to serve but I can't have to accept the best written documentation so you get a lot of questions so please ask this question I believe is that you go we're just join your channel and this question is dead everything is great please ask question we also do 5et more light you know every now and then calls to the community which anybody can join it is usually recorded put on YouTube and usually I believe you'll see more people can join us so maybe another option ask you questions and we go together to talks and super support even what I taught that there is redefined expected to work and we actually managed to find a few second to your feels the places probably this exists and then we got to your question better [Music] [Music] that's a great question and make sure you have some networks you could look up correct for it so that's that which has come off the bench monster but also right now what we focus on here is doing these networks so right now there's like three people with it I see what a people that works I think so in a show business yeah I almost think that we have known artists at the 19-yard because it to participate Marxism what which smart is something something against Evo morning they represent the engine and NOx like that is in the engine starting gives the same effect niobium that's one of the best tracks you have to do and the other printsmart is a very different focus on the engines using the same concert on different representing engines and there's a big difference between whatever's in the engines to get reports which we hope to share that month but I don't expect others to share one last question I wonder whether we need your bottom links you guys face duty or your advices in the last it's fun you might see one of the major part on the screen that's there it's like the best Asus there's nobody in the most of my test cases even though it's one of the most important things to do luckily we have this we have a I gotta jump and be a really good test coverage of all of these features but I can get this is the nature horrible yet lacking tests exist [Music] [Applause] alright guys this is Jake it is super smart and he's gonna talk to you guys about he wasn't recompiles Alex introduce the topic a moment ago I got curious what they are hello everyone as they already said primarily I hear oh it's the he wasn't just want to be issued and various everybody wanted to invite us but anyway I'm going to be talking right now briefly about one potential route to introducing webassembly me on the main team it that he wasn't seeing is exploring and that is that's he wasn't making packs so using new Azam as a common medium for executing written files on the chain as a variety of benefits including student mining the process of developing and introducing new beacon pilots on the main that safely and efficiently working on it sorry too many things open everything okay alright so as you guys show of hands and they say there they were lots of you have some experience in salinity and you have them that makes the rudimentary understanding what could be miles are how they like today but you know I'll be going over them briefly right now so we comprise today are essentially special contracts that are used on the maintain the complicated actually even one now okay so uh among these some types of problems that the GBM velocity to put the graphic primitives kings very basic photography and well over an occurrence for example we have Ian went to make a cheese existing as name we compile is great element year ago and it's also in this generally mystical things like for example the the identity function which although it's kind of happy to have it's such a simple function as if we compile it sometimes is useful for keeping data we haven't watch the maximization which is also you have ECB s a private did you write the address me so well Ricky - my definition are pre-compiled there isn't a natively by each client and and they're they're deploying the artwork because that couldn't be created using standard so I'm going to be giving you a brief mspaint style name demonstration of why the existing system for deployment we compile is so here we have who led to the IP the CDs he wants to be compiled to be deployed for its favorite type of non-avian suitable computation and so here we have that Susan smart you know import it up say yes you could do it if you we had a fully set that include you know next hurdle alright so father's friends different teams got on their respective clients and well because of the implementation specifically you essentially have well consensus but resulting from the fact that people were great in different languages for possibly different native targets that somewhere along the line it's the buttes behavior that it's not directly in - basically so you watch some promises to streamline this process by as long as you have a each be compiled implementation we pretty much the same across each so it works so for this isn't happening we need qualifying sue was suddenly excitation engine preferably agent because as I mentioned before we can use compiler to reach very close to native speed and with what they were circuits up don't worry less about the denial of service factors that previously described it so well when we have this we can essentially have the implementation of the recompile be the same invite her across all clients and that means that all of the implementation specific behavior assuming that same pre-compile bytecode is running on all clients all of that behavior advice so in the long run it's much easier to maintain an execution engine and keep in mind a single spec that have to do the same process for every single freak of it that lacks to be introduced on T so now on any cases of byte code you're more focused on making sure that it's in line with the specification for the free compile rather than in mind what the other implementations of recompile for other clients that may or may not be wrong or right sorry so well I just talked a lot about what we could change and so what we'll essentially saying about recompiles it's been selenium in a host and so well first of all we're not going to track all the existing ones because they're they're pretty good baby good job and there's no point it's going however right okay we decided and the next one is well pre-compiled well financially will still be deploying it by art forth rather and through a more usual means a process like sending a create transaction because we need return addresses so there's also potential my DNA a different class of contact that has some of the performance guarantees and they more precompile like set of restrictions that would make it easier for users to deploy higher performance contracts on on the chain but for now that's kind of dumb that's out of so right now but yeah this has been compiled excellence in this yeah you guys have any license how do you guys feel who we have another 15 minute presentation and oh yeah I don't you guys want like a 5 minute break now I'll do anything just shout out the other opinion anyone over my dead body a really really brave okay so we'll do it we'll do one more quick talk and then a quick play going to be penalty they don't get the slides when they're the ones that slice need to be manually a little bit they're separate so that you could just dance that one line I'll do this one you could do that all through this slot there's just too many slides here it's just gonna be rapid-fire so it's not oh this and Enza my bestest am afraid this mop is kind of experimental so they're with me this is not like this is a little bit out there it's just kind of exploratory and I kind of intend this talk as a bit of a conversation starter like hopefully you guys do have questions and good 3d kiss jump in any time a minute so lunch guys yeah alright so slightly before my time so what we got so when you late lately back so today I think even before programming computers and you were basically writing machine code instructions directly into the punch cards eating minute machinist and so the stack so actually I was important that assembly wouldn't even thing at this point I was basically just kind of sucked and we're going to do this for a while and then said hey is painful so let's build some cool the top of that that kind of macros or the throat that's that make it easier to write code X and that's going to wear it so many people the next thing they're not gonna be weather is people to pay we got these these tools maybe the macro that we can make more coffee to programs so let's write their operations and so you're not going to operating system that's I'm in assembly that compiled some key to explain teammates right so we're still kind of or the computer the next time an era of computing with the mainframe so maybe the such parts have gone away right and people writing picking programs people's so let me now now well we have an operating system that's written in a programming language we'll probably some assembly components to it that's compiled some utility in the clinic Parker and as you can see this being a bit full so I'm just a mechanical axis that people it's gonna call this collectively the operating system we all know women operating system as I said is you know written in some pertinent language collection of languages a machine code what a nice view and the next thing that nice this is against the world limited sleeping a lot of sex is that we get interpreters so now being a languages the modern versions be things like Furler Python that's our blending in sign interpreter wage scripts which is running sign interpreter bridges which is written in a programming language which compiles the machine code it's just running another consistent partner we're kind of yet don't lean over here and and that's more or less time to see the computing there wasn't a whole lot of other stuff so he doesn't say circa 1995 so what okay so what else happened there so the next ten big evolutionary computing was virtual machines and so this concept of a hypervisor is a piece of software that allows you to actually run an operating system inside of it it's manipulative and a hypervisor is a piece of software that's written in for any language that is compatible machine code running about rates today you can see things are beginning to climb up and different acoustic so here's some news releases the first kind of like black magic from your copy now this nice little recursion like I'm not pretty we're gonna tie the hypervisor the files that machine code that's running inside a little little operating system that's running on and then we're collapsing the sec so now we have what can we do we've inside this virtual operating well we can do anything that we did before but it's so so that's for example writing scripts let's think about Python script it's running on a present interpreter that how's the bytecode and there's a distinction between quite for the machine code on today that is running its operating system which is running it which is a virtual machine that's running the hypervisor and it turns out that we can actually buy multiple virtual machines I'm single physically and so we kind of introduced another abstraction here he's a little refer to today as the function this is super super super fun technology today we finish by the simulation and if we abstract slightly further you keeping up this is a super fast thank you it's not just the ends right we can do other interesting things like container isolation so this is San Francisco you guys don't know the doctor it is containers aren't like they do and so it's not just picker advisory they have very complex interesting process isolation support within to print it out and see anything that absolutely and containers that you do not are a lot of proteins which means all in it and that that's assume you know more or less effective right so we have these server parties each of these Iraq that probably has and a twenty physical computer is an advantage of those probably guys I don't like to six you know some number of OPM's when you I am using with a severe bottle the centralized computing infrastructure at all today what else hanging system well we can run a web light so look riser is a piece of software it's written in a we're going to have something like C it's compiled the machine code is 20 miles and once you have a browser you can do some interesting things like reduces display later actually out things that the HTML CSS web pages but the display to the browser compiled to machine for those winning any operating system and hardware then we can also have a skeleton so this is we're just beginning our holding into the JavaScript runs inside this thing for a long time sort of otherwise known as a JavaScript engine if it's like basically runs inside the steam which is sort of like a virtual machine inside a browser inside a non-existent and the displayed piece is not to please talk to me I brought that and can you do the JavaScript well I can go aah like this this is basic HTML CSS maybe some JavaScript so this brings us up to late 90s early 2000s so it's collapsing again what else can we do the JavaScript well frameworks you know so this is the query 32 people basic ability likes vanilla JavaScript because leverage just right much better code with frameworks that's running that's running on y'all strictly the JavaScript runtime inside the browser for 20 minutes parlor and finally you can build enough ok so I don't even have lost traffic comedy layers inspected back here but this is this is a modern come on Friday and we can run of course multiple applications in the browser and as I said this brings us to the library without the future desktop mobile so this is using the APIs that interact with every day this is a tangent but my maps in some sense I'm going to pick it over the world consider desktops very fast but about to the packages electron so slack if you like Spotify actually because again the same price okay so now is what was his average it's introduced that's to it before and when assembly one dunno standard was just finalized last year it's really really really new as I said it has the backing some religion that companies not as effective crazy block Jenkins like us but it is Microsoft that's how cold it that's firebox a lot of times appreciate so it's a really like it's kind of a game they're getting carefully this is a real thing this isn't you think like talk to your colleagues and I just want to emphasize that's why one of the reasons I'm so excited about Adam he wasn't at $19 period with this we are adopting really so where does Washington in it well you can argue whether or the sake of this thought that's just assuming that wasn't it's running on top of JavaScript which is control by Koscheck that need to say JavaScript a JavaScript application and low in control he wants to run inside the browser probably machine code running on the other side and what can we do with Lausanne well everything - awesome so what can we compile to Waddle my quick answer what's the what could be run them all anyway pretty much in here so any any application written in a programming language targets Olivia we live in Lincoln Park that's pretty exciting to develop so it acts like it when you talk about my anything so I'll just pause that's a quick it's just pondering the implications of this for a moment right you can like anything near native see that's something like 90% maybe see inside wall I mean this is this is this is this changes everything that's why I person it implies I'm excited no one fun thing we can do is he can kind of run an operating system inside the house maybe not a whole lot this kind of a thing and the Lakers what our operating system really see mostly and secant piles together so it shameless act a bit more I had someone on top so in theory what a browser would see its whatever so you could in theory with a browser it's written in a programming language compile it down so we're looking to be talking to an operating system of thinking it's all running inside of awesome being the JavaScript Wertheim unit browser which is running on is an awesome partner and the possibilities are limitless right I mean this is a nice recursive probably right so in theory you can finally talk and eventually the whole thing will come after screeching halt but the text any better than a classic so this is kind of a holiday this is positive cruciate how important a moment intimacy of competing with a cube like this it's beautiful that's it and this is my favorite example of this so this is analysis at this hall again you might be familiar with because I focused image application which is basically a pile of C and C++ which here is compiled down so it wasn't like and it's lending it's like phone and what is current see it as a possible successor function you don't see so chrome is a lot morning at sapphire class which of course is about that micro tavor a cheap little operating system and if you zoom in you will look if you're fina I will notice that like the chrome controls here are like Mac controls require oxygen folder like University policy so you actually this is actually explained like that so you have get running inside a windows emulator running inside x-rays which is C C++ compile to water running inside Chrome with source version code which again is privacy just compiler walls running a side higher class and again this particular example is not mine since when I've been eliminated very very bright and it's all super visionary to four years ago this is before this fog is fantastic it's super inspirational it's the inspiration for what I'm talking about here competitors it's the partner isn't gonna know everything so it's people asking you recently why am i working on emails on supply chain cool so we kind of talk about hearing it so let's talk a little bit about creator so what is superior now right I mean you know C++ or about go over rush into this which is compiled into machine code if anyone out there to see my pecker and etherion today in production Isis beeping so what we begin well we can that's not contact but it's something nicely I should have inserted be a smart contract we've written them salinity or Viper how the heat gained by code running on the interior penalty inside get your client compiled to machine code which is running an operating system executed another thing you can do is you can add frameworks so this is early days where theory immediately became aware that there seems like seven of us which application and it consisted in Turkey Lawson the Hennessy want to change a bit about it such morality it's in the cell so it's going to begin inside anybody want to guess where we're going next so we've won seven to the one Center where you can run any photo send a bike though I don't once anywhere so you can take a framework that's open to us and it's my contract and you could really enjoy putting up here you know how does anybody else executed plus okay so we've got a spirit Excel but we can do other things on this appeared so what if we just run a lot on I've ever that's had a theory and there's several of you so it's a comment in this perception about whether somebody's okay absolutely specific characteristic for mice incineration security oolitic biggest house again pretty parallel so this is merciless to pay attention this side so what game over there like what we do this this is a question right and this is where I've just set up and we're now in your and will clean build a common salt in your house this is just hypothetical what if everything so so once we have wall support on chain right to the left side here is this the right side of the boat burning boss they're both capable of running the same accessing bike later white hat magazine to do all right why not just have everything run through the scene this is exact now honey there's you're probably all thinking that's crazy level you were running on you know with you know there's that what would be better what if we just kind of like collapse this a bit quick and just say you have this it's what you want to call it something that was very little s it just it just has native support right so there's one on the cereals and what the senate means you know we're we're well into the future now we're at least finding the future realistically and I'll see a good computer this is Miami credit the directions go but if you buy that's every device disconnected every device comes another quick you have sort of baked letters really blocking clearance before any happens every device using the currently living in that network it's not so hard original wall so we have a bunch of appearing those that are running things that you just saw that they're running ass yeah anyone home absolutely compile to watch my coat so it's the less light so this is the kind of question when we do it what is it out we have something super basic let me do that in a world like this if all these nodes share state same kind of scene again whatever you want to call it and what's not in that much place like could you envision a world where they keep at transcendence the harlot where the happy is just this thing that exists silently makes it everywhere and nowhere it's just part of the state of the network and you can envision aspiring up and out on one note again if you find it I do the rest of the day and maybe freezing it because it's like it's out there somewhere great assess and moving and running on some other parts of July this is kind of that the client side vision that we've all tried you know start sitting at my phone and I get home I put my pull in a clock I'm good but at the same time I like this and it's literally to see that what the same see that's possible because these are those devices to share space somewhere without pollen period but who knows if this wherever it's come to pass then you know you know who are under there example here we've had happen to run into one device and the assigned a need more security but we need consensus and from higher notes but we need more compute power so again can happens this thing that's just out there everywhere over the same time could we just crank up the violence and instead of running you know this piece of software I'm at home I want to run it across all US isn't it in social work this or all the all the movies Felix are on you like maximexi oh thank you for seeing us as I said this this finest television it's next I'm sitting there some questions now specifically about this we can take them otherwise oh yeah - on here you know actually I think I'm afraid so thank you oh is it like i can
