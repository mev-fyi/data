party last night but it seems that the people that can answer that is not in the room yet but today we're going to have an amazing talks uh before to start I want to tell you that you saw the day today right was amazing an amazing weather that's not the weather of Bogota the weather of Bogota is the weather of yesterday so we have been lucky with the weather this week and we are so honored to have you here and very thankful with the organizers where for having a Defcon here in my city in Bogota and we are going to start with a very interesting conference from William George of clarus that is going to talk to us about economic incentives and souls in shelling Point oracles uh welcome William where are you William please thanks for being here so early in the morning uh so my name is William George I'm a mathematician and a researcher with declaros Cooperative uh and indeed I'm going to be talking today about economic incentives uh and souls in the sense of slow down tokens these kind of social layers people are trying to add to ethereum to get Beyond just kind of limited Financial logic particularly in the context of shelling point-based oracles uh which close is an example of so I'll briefly Begin by describing plaros which will sort of like give a sense of the kind of examples we're interested in so claros is a blockchain-based dispute resolution platform uh what that means is that so imagine you have a small business owner who hires a freelancer uh and they put the payment for the free Lancer into an escrow on a smart contract and then if the smart business owner is happy with the work of the freelancer she'll just click a button and say okay great and release the money from the escrow but if she's not then what happens in Claro's is that um there's a crowd-sourced pool of people who are willing to rule on on whether the freelancer did good work and you pick some random selection of them uh and then they're incentivized to vote um for who was right in a given dispute based on what we call a shell but a shelling point or a focal point uh so the idea is that they're incentivized to be coherent to vote the same way as kind of the broad Community consensus that ultimately the Oracle produces uh and then any given participant looks at the case thinks okay I think the small business owner has the honest position here uh and more I think everybody else all the other jurors people in the community are going to think that the small business owner was right so I want to vote for the small business owner because I think everybody else is going to vote for the small business owner because it's the distinguished decision and they all expect me to vote for the small business owner uh and ultimately this boils down to a notion of shelling points or focal points this is an idea introduced by Thomas shelling in the 1970s uh shelling went on to win the Nobel Prize uh that uh selling points are solutions that people tend to use when trying to coordinate in the absence of communication because they seem special or natural uh so here we have like a table of coordination game where everyone wants to either vote for x or I'll vote for y but they just want to vote for the same thing and then what people tend to coordinate around are kind of special seeming Solutions uh so here in Clarence we think of honest resolution disputes as a kind of as a shelling point or a focal point um others blockchain oracles that use this include of ideas related to this include ogre and Numa uh so close is a kind of like Oracle specifically designed for dispute resolution but more broadly you can think of it as just being designed for the subjective decisions people need to make on a blockchain uh so another aspect of the title of my talk is souls and sold down tokens so for those of you who aren't familiar I'll briefly introduce them so the defining feature of Soul bound tokens uh and these are introduced by in this paper decentralized Society finding web3 soul that was published a few months ago by while olhaver and buterin uh so these are tokens that first of all are non-transferable uh and generally are thought of as representing some social aspect of people uh like maybe you finish a course in blockchain from from some like online course and you get a diploma from that course like it doesn't make sense to transfer that to somebody else like you have a diploma everything in your knowledge um maybe you win an award uh for for your your good work uh so these are these are things that represent some aspect of identity about you and an interesting thing that the authors of this paper discuss is that you can have negative Soul bound tokens uh so like a running example that they particularly consider involves as trying to enable undercollateralized loans so by adding this sort of richer notion of identity uh you can have kind of enough information about somebody to judge whether they're credit worthy and should be given an under collateralized Loan in a kind of similar structure to how banks in the traditional world work uh because we have this richer notion of identity but then if you don't pay your loan on time maybe you get a soul bound token that says you know late payments and then going forward you kind of have to present people the bad with the good you can't get rid of the negative sell down tokens short of burning the whole wallet and starting over with a new identity but when you present your wallet to someone they'll be able to see okay the ones award and have this this uh this diploma but uh he had a late payment and they make sort of a balances kind of evaluations on your identity using all this information together uh so a related concept that has to do with sort of social layers on blockchains but it's a little different uh is something called proof of personhood so particularly uh the Claro's team developed proof of humanity which is an example of a proof of personhood protocol so this is supposed to be a civil resistant tool it's a registered list of of human beings such that no human being can be able to get more than one identity on the list and if there's another dispute about whether someone has a duplicate profile or doesn't meet the criteria that triggers the Claris dispute uh so how this works is that you submit this video saying that I'm a real human and I'm not already on the registry uh and then you provide a deposit uh and you go into like a pending submission challenge period uh where if somebody challenges you it'll result in dispute but if nobody challenges you or you win your eventual disputes you eventually get on the list um but uh if you're not a human being or you're a duplicate uh then you when you submit to the list then this decentralized ecosystem of Challengers will say no you don't you don't you don't develop you don't satisfy the rules and this will raise a Clarence jury that rules into some kind of subjective Oracle way that I described before using selling points uh okay so now sort of an interesting thing about proof of humanity is how people remove themselves from the list uh and they do that by providing another video they provide a video that says Okay I want to remove myself uh and what's interesting about this is that maybe in a future version of proof of humanity if you had a soul-bound wallet uh that um has your various cell bound tokens in it then maybe it's tied to your proof of humanity profile address and if you remove yourself in recently with a new address it can just automatically point to the new profile and this allows like a very interesting kind of social recovery um like rather than just having social recovery based on you know your friends saying that you are who you say are now you're being verified by this like broad community and moreover this has an interest sort of philosophical point about how we think of identity on blockchains normally we think of someone's core identity as having a private key that allows them to sign some messages but here what's fundamentally defines your ability to interact with these slowdown tokens is your ability to make these videos which is a bit different uh so that that's something interesting another way that these perfect personality ideas relate to slow down tokens is that um how gets to questions about how you distribute so about tokens to begin with so I imagine they'll someday be a rich ecosystem of southbound tokens that will be distributed potentially in different ways a sort of a natural thing to do is if there's an institution that can attest to whatever you like aspect of your identity the solvent token represents then it is issued to that directly like you come to Devcon and get a pull-up and like some organizers sign some message saying yep she was here Paul awarded into the auto appears automatically in your wallet maybe your blockchain based like course online has some some University attached to it and they sign something and give you your spt um but like maybe you don't the institution that's like naturally giving out the tokens it would test your identity just isn't equipped for this they're not very blockchain friendly moreover maybe there's some aspect of some sobound token that doesn't naturally have an institution behind it and something you could do is create a career a list similar to how proof of humanity Works where you claim that you deserve a sell-bound token you say I'm an expert in subject X the submitted deposit you do the same kind of thing people can challenge you you provide your portfolio like previous Works proofs of your expertise uh and if you make it onto the list you get a sell-bound token saying that you're an expert okay so now I'm going to change switch gears a bit and talk about how these social layers interact with the kinds of Economic Security models that we traditionally have in a lot of crypto economic systems and my two running examples here will be Claro's juror selection and quadratic funding which is the sort of motivating example of a lot of the decentralized society paper so how does juror selection currently work in claros well people stick a token and then each token has an equal chance of being drawn and you kind of are forced to do that if you don't have another form of civil resistance because if you try to get people like unequal weight uh say people that have tons of tokens or like weighted quadratically or something then people would have an incentive to just cut up their tokens over multiple addresses to try to pretend to be different people uh so you're kind of stuck with this like linear odds of being drawn in terms of weight and then every time you draw someone the odds of the next draw don't change like in any given draw that that 45 person still has 40 five percent uh and then you can look do sort of a binomial distribution calculation and look at the total odds that the you know like a large sticker will get a majority of the votes on a given case uh so that's an economic security system uh whose security model basically boils down to not no one having more than 50 percent of the stake uh and um particularly like close has an appeal system without going into too much of the details you can get larger and larger panels of jurors and particularly if you have a really large panel of jurors it is very unlikely that anyone would be able to get a majority of the votes on that panel without actually having 50 of the stake okay so that's like a purely Economic Security model uh quadratic funding my the other motivating example suppose you have different participants one Decay and they submit contributions C1 to CK uh to a project p uh and then the idea here is for those of you who aren't already familiar with it is it like quadratic funding is used often to kind of kind of give matching grants often for public goods according to this formula there uh and you might look like a kind of strange for me if you're not previously familiar with it but like notice the square root in the first term it basically has the effect that if people submit a lot uh then their contribution tapers out because like square roots you know grow a lot and then kind of level off uh so one individual who submits like a tremendous amount of contribution doesn't have too big an effect even though like they're the more they contribute the more of an effect they have with better to get a big matching Grant is to have lots of people contribute because each person contributing gives you an extra term in this sum uh and then as an example suppose on the left um we have someone with you know an Innovative ethereum project that wants a public that's a public good and wants a grant and on the right we have like a fake proposal by someone who's just like please give me a grant but I'm not going to do anything uh and the person on the left you know they get contributions from a lot of different people uh and you notice they get like a pretty good total subsidy whereas the person on the right is the only person that he's he is the only person that contributes to his proposal uh and you notice that his total subsidy is zero uh and generally if only one person contributes to a given proposal the subsidy is zero but this depends on having a good proof of personhood scheme uh and you can imagine if your proof of a person in this game is broken then the attacker can like pretend to be and different people each making a small contribution instead of one person making a large contribution uh and can basically steal the subsidy pool uh uh so your security model is your proof of person it's game needs to be secure uh now what if I consider jury selection in cleros with a proof of person at scheme where each person can only each person has to be on proof of humanity or a president's game in order to be drawn and you can only be drawn once uh then the first draw I'm kind of the same as before uh so maybe the the 45 dude gets a draw uh and but then he can't be drawn again so everybody else's odds go up and you necessarily draw three different people and the overall odds of anyone getting more than two spots is zero uh but what happens if I have an insecure proof of person at scheme like take the pessimistic case someone just completely breaks proof of personhood and the attacker has tons of profiles uh then the first draw well nothing happens and the attacker can be drawn more than once because he has all these profiles and he probably cut up his stake into different profiles so the attacker is still in this pool somebody else gets drawn and now she can't be drawn again because she only had one profile uh and so the attacker's odds and everybody else's odds go up a little bit and then on the last draw the attacker has a slightly higher chance than he did before of getting more than half of the votes but what's interesting here is that it didn't like he broke completely broke the proof of person in this game but still doesn't completely break this security it's not like he has an overwhelming chance of getting all the votes uh so the security model here is that either your proof of person needs to be secure or No One controls more than x percent of the stake well what's X it depends exactly on how many jury spots there are in the distribution of the other stickers if you have like a handful of whales in your staking pool then when you remove one of them the attack results go up a lot but if your staking pool is really well distributed and it has lots of people with small Stakes then X can approach 50 percent uh where the attacker needs as much resources as he did under the model without proof of personhood so these like economic and social layers layer together and don't like only slightly kind of dilute the security of one another and add multiple layers of you know different kinds of security without having to choose am I going to like have a Social Security or Economic Security so that's really nice so now like an extension of this that we're interested in in research doing research on is what if you try to wait people by sbts can you do something that's kind of like this pulling in Social information but with an even more Rich way uh so here people have different kinds of sbts some people have a diploma from there that blockchain course other people got their pop from Devcon some people will want to contest want a hackathon or something uh and then an idea that's introduced in the decentralized society paper um so they consider various ways that you can weight people's contributions to quadratic funding uh and one of them in particular is very general so that's what I'm going to focus on and it's called the offset match and the idea here is that you assign correlation scores between the participants you say okay like participant I has so many syllabound tokens and she shares so many of them with participant K so I'm going to give this creates like a like a correlation score out of that and then I'm going to solve for these weights Alpha um that uh solve this like weird system of equations so that looks kind of abstract but I'll show some examples and give some of my think how I think about this uh so here the woman in the blue shirt uh has two po has two spts and she shares one with the great do and the green shirt so the correlations are the half and if you solve for the alphas you get these outfits uh and notice that like the idea here is to kind of give weights to anti-correlated groups if like there's one group that has an spt that's like really common and they're all kind of aligned with each other because as sort of evidenced by having the same sbts they should get less weight uh so here like tons of people have the diploma so each one of them kind of gets less weight uh whereas the two people that have other co-ops collectively they get more weight uh however there's this like weird Quirk where the women with the blue shirt got no weight and they can do with the green shirt got like more weight uh so I'll come back to that Quirk um but um so then how what's the kind of philosophy behind this so you have these like systems of equations you have this like big Matrix of all the correlation coefficients and then you're trying to solve for this row Matrix of the alphas uh and if you squint and you take like a really extreme case and you're like okay like all of the participants probably fall into like a handful of clusters and the Clusters are really highly correlated with each other but not very correlated with the other clusters uh then you get a kind of Matrix equation that looks like this so like in each of the blocks with the ones those are clusters of people that are very similar between each other but then zeros show that they're not very correlated with the others and then if you solve this Matrix equation it basically gives you one equation per block uh and it says each of the blocks gets roughly equal weight uh and that weight is shared over the people in the block so if you have tons of people in your group in your cluster as characterized by the syllable tokens they have uh they don't get as much weight as like a smaller block that has like different experiences and different cell bound tokens uh that each one of them will get more weight uh so this has some issues and the people the authors of the centralized Society paper already point out some of these points and they you know they sort of propose this as a place to start to think about these issues uh so first of all the alphas may not be exist and they may not be unique if they do exist moreover you can produce negative Alphas uh there are ways you can sort of like patch this you could say okay I got a negative Alpha I'm just going to round to zero that might mess a little bit with your linear algebra philosophy uh generally this handles how much weight you give it to groups pretty well uh but it doesn't necessarily distribute that weight naturally to individuals uh so like there's a tendency based on how the linear algebra Works to give participants with a subsuper set of spts compared to somebody else zero weight and this was that Quirk that happened with the woman in the blue shirt she had strictly more spts than somebody else um and um so the motivation for the quad the centralized Society authors was to modify this formula for matching in quadratic funding to put Alphas under the square root so now in order to get a big matching Grant you not only want to have lots of contributions for lots of different people you want those people to have big outfits and how do they get big Alphas well by representing groups that like don't have so many people in them and generally in order to get a big matching Grant you're going to need a lot of people from different groups uh contributing to your project uh From clarence's perspective so this is what brings me to this uh you can imagine re-weighting the stakes people have by the alphas so you could use these these like formulas over here for people's drawing odds so we have this example from before we get the same weights that we had before and now like the woman that has 40 stake she doesn't have very she has very common sbts so that kind of dilutes her influence a bit uh whereas like other people with less stake but uncommon sbts get get more of a chance of being drawn uh and this is a potentially natural thing to do uh at using spts at all in Claro's to sort of like interface with zero selection will allow us to have an explicit procedure where in some courts in some decisions in order to be drawn you need to have expertise in relevant cases by having an spt that says that you were an expert in that case so currently claros has like a game theoretic mechanism to discourage people from staking where they're not experts but this would allow us to have like an explicit mechanism that's an extra layer of security more generally by having people that come from anti-correlated groups as have different svts attest to different experiences uh you get a tying into like wisdom of the crowd's ideas there's been a lot of research that shows that groups of diverse problem solvers or groups of different experiences can often produce better results than more monolithic groups uh so potentially we could produce better decisions by by having this social layer in class uh then you have to ask okay what's the security model here uh what happens particularly if an attacker breaks the distribution of an spt if there are lots of spts being ordered by lots of different entities you know maybe some of them will be more secure than others uh and then you have other questions like are the participants incentivized to keep the sbts all in the same address or split them up like you you want people to sort of take their identity well if you want people to have at least certain aspects of identity all in the same wallet rather than having like different sbts on each one like one spt per wallet or something uh um and um so imagine this for the first point what happens if an spt is broken a simple example so imagine that like the attacker can break the distribution of this like diploma he hacks into Coursera or whatever and like can produce tons of profiles with the diploma if you have a group as evidenced by this that sort of pulled out of this like clustering algorithm anti-correlation mechanism that has it's basically just characterized by having the diploma uh then the attacker can perfectly copy them he can make an infinite number of profiles or a large number of profiles that exactly mimic people in the group so he can steal all of their weight and that's inevitable you know no matter what weighting you use uh what's a more interesting question is what happens if the attacker well what happens if the group is characterized by having ksbts so I have a group of people like most of whom have the same ksbts you know maybe they share a few ksbts with other people but mostly like they have those ksbts and other groups don't uh and the attacker just breaks one of the sbts the diploma uh well then now you get this like back to the block Matrix you have something that looks like this uh now the correlation between the attacker and the victims is like one over K because he has one of their sbts and you can solve for this and under the offset match or the offset waiting uh the uh the attacker still takes almost all the weight because of this Quirk with people of supersets and subsets uh where super people with super sets of spts don't don't get any weight uh so that's not great but like you know you could imagine adapting this somehow to try to be resistant to this kind of attack ultimately you would want something that kind of looks like what we had with proof of personhood being matched with the economic sticking where adding this social layer kind of adds security and mesh as well with the existing Economic Security so some there are other potential waiting schemes one could imagine uh so this idea is related to eigenvector centrality uh it's similar to the idea used in the pagerank algorithm uh so in the original version of eigenvector centrality there's not this like one over in the in the equation and conveniently simple enough you can kind of turn into a measure of anti-correlation or anti-centrality just by putting one over uh so this still doesn't fully work it's a little more resistant than the the offset match to the the um this like question of what happens if the attacker breaks one of the the tokens uh so more research can be done here uh I know Glenn wild at least is also thinking about some of these things he had some similar ideas about like in Vector centrality that uses a different formula uh so we can continue to think about like what one could put here that will be attack resistance in the most robust way uh and just to conclude so proof of personal protocols can provide a natural base layer for certain types of social recovery in some cases distributions and sbts uh ideas developed around weight and quadratic funding contributions by sbts are also relevant in other applications like juror selection maybe you have some airdrop and you want to give your airdrop to a diverse member people contribute to your community in a lot of different ways uh who've interacted with their protocol in different ways and maybe that could be expressed by having different spts and but as we move from a purely economic model to economic proof of personhood proof of personal economic plus spts this can have effects on our security model and like the ideal thing to have is to layer security so that as we add these things like the system gets more and more secure rather than having to have to make sacrifices or we dilute the economic security but there are questions about the various security models what happens if an SVT gets broken and do users have an incentive to split their spts so thank you um if there's time for questions I'd be happy to take some questions thank you very much William we have a space for questions if someone have any questions any okay thank you very much William it's amazing presentation in five minutes uh we're going to continue with the next presentation about self-sovereign identity is going to be amazing so let's see you in five minutes foreign don't wanna walk unless you walk with me cause I wanna feel like I was feeling it at the start keep me in the dark [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] keep me in the dark [Music] foreign [Music] okay we're going to continue with our next speaker and talk and a question for you it's our identity important it looks like it's an obvious question right but historically governments have our Identity or take our identity and in the recent times also the companies but today we're going to hurt a different story from The Innovation director of the city of Buenos Aires Diego Fernandez welcome Diego to feel alive to feel alive well hello everybody this is Marissa my worries you mentioned my name is Diego Fernandez I'm the secretary of innovation of the city of Buenos Aires and uh I will share with you basically however we're dealing how we're planning with self-sovereign ad approach and how do we got to the point that we are right now so I'm going to share with you quarkid which is a self-server ad protocol that we promoted but let me start thinking about how do we deal with identity in the analog world let's think for a second about our wallets in a wallet we have a chunk of attestations of our identity maybe we have a driver's license in my case I have ID from two different countries Uruguay and Argentina I have a credit cards from two different banks I have a card from my health insurance company I have a card for my football soccer team Raver all of those institutions gave me at the stations that make my identity all of those institutions don't know that the other institution gave that credential to me nevertheless all of them agree on a set of given standards which is quite basic it's the hate and the way on the width of the credentials and why is that because we have our own wallets we have our wallets I have a black wallet and maybe each and every one of you chose a different color of wallet we choose a wallet that we want and we put the credentials in the water that we choose and how do the verification of this credential works in the analog world it follows this triangle over here the most important part of this triangle is the line that says trust in the base of the triangle and why is that because let's say for example that they want to say the city government issues a driver license on my behalf stating that I am able of driving a car then a policeman stops me and say hey show me your driver's license please that when I showed my credential the policeman needs to trust they want to say the city government needs to know how they want to say the city government makes credentials in order to be enable of verifying that the credential is valid and there is not a forge but let's think of these last 30 years when internet took over and we became digital how do we deal with identity in the digital world well we have a huge problem there why because we don't have yet a digital ID primitive and I'm really excited that I think that this is starting to change that we are starting to build a digital ID primitive but today and we are all familiar with this in order to ensure let's say a bank an insurance company or whatever in order to be sure that the other party is who we think we it is each company needed to make their own security Frameworks their own security approach hence we have tons of apps in our in our cell phones we have an app for the bank an app for the government of the of the national government an app for the local governments apps for the health company except for the airlines they can listen to the analog perspective will be the same as uh hey sorry I I don't have a timer here [Music] sorry going back up comparing this to the analog to it to the analog model will be the same as if when they want to say governments gives you a driver license the driver license came in a wallet that says but inside the city government when Visa Gates gives you a credit card comes in a physical wallet that says visa and you will we would be carrying a pack full of wallets it doesn't make sense in general world but we do it in the digital world and we have pages and pages of up in of apps in order to be enabled of interacting with any given organization what is the Great advantage that the self-server and digital ID model proposes as you see conceptually is quite the same model of trust that we have in the analog world but it's much much better why because as you see in the base the trust line is not more solid line and why is that because the blockchain comes into place and we go into in deep into this in the next few slides this work creates a digital identifier and writes that this is the identifier with its Associated cryptographic materials needed to decode it in a public blockchain when the issuer means a perfect credential to the wallet of Any Given holder the holder is first able of accepting or rejecting the wallet and this is really important in this model nobody can airdrop or give a credential to a user if the user doesn't accept their credential when they verify requests at a digital proof of that credential this request is claims based not credential based let's say I have three daughters 19 17 and 15 years old of course when I go to a bar and request a beer nobody asks for my ID because everybody assumes that I'm over 18 but that's that's not the case of my daughter in in today in the analogues world we have a credential based the authentification or verification so we give for example my daughter when she requests appear in a bar she's forced to give all of her information all of the information contained in for example her ID card to a waiter handing her uh a beer in this short story ID model it's only claims base and you can give proof of certain aspects of your identity without needing to reveal all of the claims containing of given verified credential so for example my daughter could just send the proof to the waiter that she's over 18 not giving her name not giving her address not giving with any other characteristic of her persona and as that proof contains the digital identifier of the issuer the verifier doesn't need to trust or to make no integration whatsoever with the issuer because the verifier is stable of checking in the blockchain that the perfect credential is valid and that the that they was signed and created with the private keys of the issuer so what goes on chain and what goes off chain and this is really really important the only thing that goes on chain is that digital identifiers and the associated cryptographic needed to understand that digital identifier they are on your right hand side you can see what's the structure of Any Given District identifier the Quark ID model has every verified credential every every person data goes off chain every personal data is stored in the user's personal device in the Quark ID protocol we are using an open source wallet that opens as well it is non-custodial and everybody asked me in this point hey what happens if I lose my wallet my phone well you have two choices if we were if you were safe enough of storing your private keys and backing up your confidential storage then you will be able of recreating your digital identity already immediately if you didn't do that you're in the same situation that you are today in the analog world you need to go again to each and every institution organization that gave you a perfect credential and request that credential again I'm going to do a group review of the four layers that the quarkid protocol has following the Quark the thrust over a p Foundation model in the level one is the blockchain level the the distributed Ledger levels where we write every digital identifier so that is available to anyone in the world that wants to verify it in the layer 2 we deal with a peer-to-peer communication with the Asian Communications in this scenario that we were thinking before when a waiter comes to my daughter and say hey are you 18 years old he will establish a peer-to-peer communication with no agent in the middle whatsoever this is based on the did come protocol which is an evolution of the hyperledger areas the third level relates to how do we deal with proofs claims and credentials what is the way that we interact with those proof claims and credentials and the layer 4 is the ecosystem level is where we store where we sort of announce all of the issuers all of the entities available or authorized in order to issue credentials one very interesting thing about the trust of European model is as each layer of this technology stack has a governance stack as well I'm not going to go into the government stack I invite you to go into the trust of European model Transformer Foundation website because it's a really interesting approach so let's go in deep into clock ID how do how do we envision work ID we had of course the chance of saying hey let's we're a government let's go and do this government implementation let's make the one outside the cells over an ID protocol but we're convinced that that's not the way to go why because we're convinced that the way the governments interact today with Society need to change we believe in open permissionless blockchains and we believe that any God any protocol created by the government wouldn't be trusted just let me ask you a question would you draw us a protocol created by the government now okay I wouldn't either so what we did is we called Argentina has a very big and very thriving community of developers of companies of projects most of you for sure know open sapling decentraland sandbox uh pull up with Patricia or rsk iob Labs I mean I can keep on mentioning we have a really strong really strong ethereum community in Buenos Aires so we called all of these guys and say hey you know what we're going to pursue this goal why don't you help us why don't you help us developing disease and that call was pretty successful and we started building Quark ID and one of the definitions that we the one of the first definitions that we made is this mustang this shouldn't be a government protocol this should be a community protocol you have a white paper on the Internet it's an open source protocol it follows the standards that I measure in here the centralized identity Foundation the w3c Thruster therapy foundation and we decided to implement within the product called compatibility with the open ID connect because of the huge uh possibilities that that in that implementation brings us and of course if we are ambition in the self-solving ID model as a way of identifying ourselves not in Buenos Aires not in Argentina but in planet Earth we need to be compatible with all of the implementations that are being developed around the world the most important of them all perhaps the ID Union which is the Sovereign ID model that the idea Union is proposing with the ngi lab Sovereign [Music] ID model which was developed and ion which is an implementation developed by Microsoft over the safety moderna protocol quality is also developed over for a slightly modern protocol so how does quarkid Works imagine quarkid as a as a sovereign ID layer it's like a layer that goes on top of any given blockchain so the fir we needed as I mentioned before in the layer one of the thrustography model we needed we need a distributed Ledger blockchain the first blockchain which we anchored the the quality product was ethereum level layer one we made that uh that anchoring not envisioning to use really ethereum as a as a security layer because of of the gas cost which will make it impossible to mean for example I don't know one million credentials but anchoring the protocol in layer in ethereum layer one made it extremely easy to encourage in any evm compatible blockchain the second thing that we did is we took the ion implementation that Microsoft made of the cellular in a protocol using Bitcoin layer 1 hence you can use quality and code in bitco layer 1 and then we started with layer 2 world the first implementation that we made is polygon the second one that we made is rsk rsks and evm compatible blockchain which anchors itself in Bitcoin and the last one was stocknet as you can see the division in Quark ID is this protocol needs to be chain agnostic and that is a for us it's a crucial definition we are planning on adding different anchoring blockchains so that any ecosystem that decides to implement quarkid may choose whichever security layer they wish we as the city of Buenos Aires decided that the first implementation that the first anchoring production that we that we would use is start met why did we chose strongly wall because they're they're CK proof technology is pretty sound and it enables us to do a huge scaling because we can do a quadratic scaling we towards case transactions in stock net and then we scale transactions in Quark ID hence we are able of using the social 18d protocol ID protocol with not even cents on the dollar for minting hundreds of thousands of credentials that is extremely important for us took so as I mentioned before we developed this and we were able of achieving this with a strong set of Partners premium which is a a deaf house located in Gibraltar Stark War which is a a plugs that you probably all know based from Israel eye of labs which are the creators of rsk Beyond OS series X carpet Etc a very important thing what is the road map for quarkid in Buenos Aires city we're rolling out the MVP in November this year we're launching the protocol in January 2023 and what is our our adoption plan we hope to create 30 different verified credentials that mean 30 different documents let's say birth certificate marriage certificate driver's license so have a road map of 30 different verified credentials and we plan to Mint between 300 000 and 500 000 these identifiers that mean this is their identities within 2023 just to give you an idea Buenos Aires is a three million sorry three million City three million people sitting but actually where seven million people community why because we have nearly between three and four million people that commute every day to work in Buenos Aires so we plan to start in 2023 having between three Hungarian five three hundred and five hundred thousands sorry I speak English the second language and uh we would like us all to have and we are looking forward to that three different private sector uh organizations using this security framework to meet their credentials this is very important nobody needs to ask permission to any government to use this any given organization May mean their credentials without requesting permission from anyone and any any community in the world can use this protocol for free because it's an open source protocol so Quark Idina natural first it's an open standard self-serving ID protocol second is multi-chain thirst is interoperable with most of the solutions tackling this is in the world fourth every private private data is off chain five it's it's gonna have autonomous governance I'm going to do a small Point here today the governance is being made by this ecosystem of Partners but in the protocol roadmap is generating a Dao in the next 24 months so that the protocol is being able of getting governed by the ecosystem of I mean communities Partners or whatever use the protocol this of course is a very hard and difficult thing to tackle we have all seen the problems with calling both in ETC and it's something that we're working quite currently six we're creating a work ID is creating a growing public private ecosystem and seventh and this is the most important point the government is a user we don't want users of the government we want to be users as a government that this is a change of Paradigm which for us is quite important so last but not least why did we choose this path what is the Dilemma that we face when we tackle digital ID are we going to prove positives where are we going to approve negatives what I mean by this a Solvang token is a negative proof it's something that you can you can say no that you receive and that proves certain negative aspects of you I mean for example you don't have credit uh you don't have credits outstanding credits you don't have criminal records or whatever proving positives is where it just described within the perfect credentials model which is data that you have in and that you can show or not according to your will in our view both things are necessary and both things will occur but self-ownership and positive reputational systems come first we need to develop what I was mentioned before this identity primitive that we don't yet have on top of the of that identity negatives will unleash a great power of course and that great power would be immense for disenfranchised Community which will be able of requesting loans for example just using the reputation as a collateral but it has certain potential negative things that we are we don't think that we are yet in a position to sort of deal with just to give an example if I have a negative reputation that I'm for example a woman or that I am attending a mosque in the united states in the United States that person will have 68 percent chance of not getting a job compared with a Christian woman I took this out of the podcast of Evan McMillan and bitterly button which I strongly recommend you all to hear because it's it's really really interesting so thank you very much I invite you all to get into the quarkid.org website download the white paper and we hope that in the next I don't know let's say 30 days 60 days we will have the code available in in GitHub and published in the the quarker day website thank you very much thank you Diego we have some time for questions and you want to have a questions there there's one two questions yes three questions come on four oh okay the first one uh can I made you in Spanish or in English I think okay my friend um I am Vladimir from Ecuador I think the concept for a solo tokens and Sovereign identity we converge in this in some point completely I completely agree I completely agree I think I think that solvent tokens and verified credentials are two different aspects of our of our identity the positives the verified credentials are the things that I mean that confirm my identity the solvent tokens rebuild certain certain social interactions or resultant attestations that of course will at least a huge potential the thing is that in our view we need to start with the verified credentials model and then evolve into the reputational aspects that the southern token proposes which and then we will because those are all all of those are Unchained and once you write something in a blockchain it's written forever so we need to deal first in our view with the perfect credentials and the the digital identity in a self-solving ID model and then move to the solvent tokens uh proposal proposal next question there please so great great talk I really like thank you very much um who helped you on building that strategy sorry who helped you on building this strategy for this project and who helped you on the vendor selection sorry to find the right vendors like polygon and the others who helps you to find the right protocols and partners well actually we did this with the with the set of partners that I mentioned before with the guys created from extremian from the guides with our iub Labs from the guys that with the guys of Beyond with a lot of help and I want to mention this with a lot of help from the ethereum foundation from Maya from Stephen from Schuyler and how did we choose in which blockchains to Anchor of course as I mentioned before we started with ethereum because it was a no-brainer and uh I was lucky enough I mean we were lucky enough of being able to chatting and And discussing I mean and I would say every big player in the blockchain arena and they were more than willing and open to share the details of their protocol and to offer support for us and and I feel very proud about that at the end of the day we decided to Anchor the city of Buenos Aires since Darkness because of the hope that they provided us and because we're really believe in their technology and we think that's your knowledge proof technology unleashes a whole deal of implementations in a self-serving ID model which we want to take next question here and there is some hands there and there can you hear me yeah so thank you so much for your presentation and then as a lot of American I'm thinking about the user experience so I imagine my family all my friends using verifiable credentials for reputation or um any other use cases but my question is what is your roadmap or user experience like if I lose my phone are you thinking about other ways that I can recover my wallet um are you thinking about other ways to store the verifiable credentials because in Latin America for example WhatsApp usage is huge but people sometimes don't have a lot of storage to store different apps so it's better to just have WhatsApp for them so I'm just wondering what are your thoughts on user experience in general for these use cases okay just I I kind of get who's speaking could you please raise your hand oh here thanks well it's a very good question I mean user experience when you're planning in millions of people implementations are they the thing that you need to deal with I always like to say that we're giving you this possibility with this protocol first you can use we're starting with three different wallets the quarkid protocol wallet xcapit is building and which is a crypto wallet is building an implementation for the quarkid protocol and oscd has a digital identity the wallet that is also being made compatible with Quark ID as I said before in my talk you are able if you have the technical knowledge I mean if it's not taking that I mean if you go to settings and you export your private keys so you store your seed phrasing whichever place you wish and you do a backup of your confidential storage let's say you put it in your Google drive or you take it out in a pen drive or whatever then if you lose your phone nothing happens you take your private Keys you recreate your wallet you take your confidence or storage you signed it with your private keys and then you have your wallet you digital wallet online like online in your phone again of course if you don't have that knowledge you will need to go again to each and every one of the mint of the issuers of your credentials and request and reissue the same way that you when you lose a physical wallet today you need to recreate all of those documents in our view we're really focused on giving users the best experience whatsoever and start sort of a sharing how users May back up and Safeguard their own data in our view those I mean the share of people knowing how to backup the data will increase over time and we hope that in the next few years everybody will do it I each time I get this question ask I share a personal experience that I have I have I am 50 years old my mother something like 30 years ago said you know what son he was 60 something I want to learn to use the computer would you show me how so I say okay sit with me rub your mouse and put it in the start bottom it was a windows 95. so she took the mouth she did like this in the screen said you know what matter no you need to get a you need to get somebody I cannot teach you today my if she hears me she will tell me that today my 83 year old mother uses WhatsApp does FaceTime sense mail configures her own email I mean 30 years past but uh we're positive that people will get to understand web free and we think that we have the power as a government of onboarding a lot of people into web free Technologies and that is using the power for good in my humble perspective thank you very much Diego and thank you all for your questions if you want to ask anything else he likes to talk a lot nah it's a joke a lot of people in Argentina and and in Latin America is very proud about this leader in the public sector thank you very much thank you very much no my pleasure we're going to continue with the next talk what no thank you come on last day yeah come on you're probably tired guys come on stand up stand up please come on come on come on shake your body shake your body another for the run to the blood to flow to our body and come on come on come on good the ones in the back come come here it feels so lonely here you know I come from the climate change world and you're from the blockchain so we need to work together some energy in this morning the last day in Defcon guys [Music] how was the party okay our next speaker Augustine Matari is going to talk about climate change or social change the role of blockchain place that Applause welcome you're very well are you better now well you know 15 days ago I was a diplomat I used to work for the UN for the last seven years until I get to know how hard it is to change the system from within so now I'm here with you guys in order to change it together right and I wanted to share with you some of my some of my learnings my thoughts my feelings from all this experience especially regarding climate change right and I would like to to work with you in order to get a solution that actually really transforms what is happening now with the climate action which is just a symptom of something more deepen which is our production and consumption system so I really wish the blockchain ecosystem does not fall into the repeating the same but with a nicer technology or a cooler technology so where should I point this I think it's not working Ah that's it well here is our friendly dinosaur coming from 66 Millions ago giving out advice and the the cool thing of this is that this was a campaign issue by a una agency you probably when you think about the U.N you think of a most conservative or maybe Century 20 organization but the guys were encouraged in because of the whole science we are reading the whole day to launch this sort of campaigns right and this is related to the potential Extinction we're about to face due to climate change you are probably have heard about the Paris agreement and you we need to understand that the Paris agreement was built over the biggest consensus scientifically and politically in the history of humankind this is this is strong right so we when we when we hear about the 1.5 degrees we we shouldn't surpass in the next years what is that because I think it's very difficult to embody it right so or having like a tangible data in this term you can read the latest War material logical organization together where the U.N disaster risk management office saying that the forecast for 2030 is one point disasters a day this is the latest report so 1.5 degrees more is 1.5 disasters a day in this world so that's earthquakes tsunamis Flats heat waves everything that affects obviously people lives but also infrastructure electricity infrastructure and so the internet and so this blockchain so we we really need to be a specifically concerned on this I really recommend you to see this documentary is very it's very new because it it actually appeals to how we create negation mechanisms when we hear all this information and it happened to me even at the UN reading all the reports and being part of the report so what what what are you going to do once you know but what are you going to do once you feel it once you get to know where get to feel what you know you have to believe what you know so this kind of paralyze you or move to action real action so going into my diagnosis of why we are here in this situation I think there's a clear misleading the approach that is the all the all-in sdgs you know sdgs have very incredible targets of poverty zero hunger zero clean energy for everyone etc etc right sustainable consumption production but we have this sdg which is number eight and promotes indefinite economic growth so going into a very precise example everyone's wants to go renewable right renewable energy but what if tomorrow today we all decide to go 100 Renewables well we need minerals for that we need extraction according to the World Bank we need in order to be aligned with a 1.5 degrees of the police agreement we need three billion tons of minerals lithium Cobalt graphite which is under the Amazon the Amazon so and that will imply a lot of trade-offs in other sectors in other sdgs I know obviously a massive amount of burnt oil of burnt oil because we are just moving the the mission of git to other sectors transport extractives and the industry so I was willing to enter the here dancing one song of The Rolling Stones but due to copyright stuff we had another one but the the Rolling Stones said it in a very nice Way You Can't Always Get What You Want and that's my part of the song like all in sdg but if you try some time you just might find you get what you need so let's see a concrete example of the misleader I'm telling you about 25 years of the voluntary carbon Market this is a future few approach while emissions Rising as you already know so in the demand side the reach offsetters the buyers Coca-Cola Airways car Hill whoever principally from the food and energy sectors which are the most polluting ones the principal generators of climate change look at this data from from Oxfam during the pandemic when the economy was shrinking 453 new billionaires in this sector that is supposed to offset in order to get below the 1.5 rich middlemen in 2021 one billion dollars for the current market few Traders made in 2021 and in the this is the worst part of the of the story because these are the guys in the supply side the guys that are protecting the ecosystems we need to thrive look at this at this notice from from a community in in India sorry in Kenya these projects are sending people out and they can even not afford to put into the market there there's their own Supply their projects because they are made for the reach in order to credit and be able to sell a credit to present our projects you need the transaction costs are huge so that's why you have big landowners with with trees with forests claiming reductions from I don't know a hundred thousand hectares Baseline and next year I will do 70 000 you can pay me that is that the sdgs what else are they supposed to do that so getting into blockchain what is happening right now you probably heard also about the hype of the Eco tokens of tokenizing this voluntary carbon Market credits into the blockchain and it's very interesting you read this research published by Thomson Reuters also like one month ago from a scandal that's what that was raised in Brazil due to a a person that was living in the community where the project was being held that died he died in the project and due to his death everyone paid attention to it and the scan was off what was leaked so just look at this this crypto company in Brazil has been accused of packed more than 2 million carbon credits and turned them into crypto tokens at times selling the grades for eight times more so they mixed in those two million they mix very low quality credits with Middle grades and they packed them I mean you know a low quality credit is the one that has no environmental robust asset behind the token right that's a so the editor who this was a WhatsApp message leaked the editor who initially approved the project a decade ago found that deforestation may have been displaced to land nearby and that is a violation of one of the main principles of the carbon Market or the voluntary current markets with these permanence but it's very difficult how can we ensure we measure our project it's perfect how can we ensure that the deforestation going on there does not go to the other land or maybe another country is a global problem and they didn't even trust they created 150 green job 150 green jobs for 2 million carbon credits so it's a huge for almost nothing so we need to know that although this and we we need to remind I think what blockchain has been built for the the the core principles of blockchain right how those could be applied into this you know Upstream we need to replace those few offsets for those big polluters making new billionaires in the most polluting sectors we need to replace one offset from that those ones from like a participation in that one from all of us savers then we as vitalik said we need to automatize the center that's blockchain about and downstream allowing those humans those real populations but probably there's a gap because they cannot reach internet in many cases but anyway they are the ones that really have a ignorant willingness to defend ecosystems and the forest because they live in the forest that's that's inner and transparency right and that's what blockchain I think in my humble opinion should be about so but what about the agenda right I think we need to consider and I would like I've been talking with a lot of you in these days about this because I I I'm not an expert in Dallas nor blockchain as well but these guys are 500 Scholars and former Ministers of environment that presented a letter in the last U.N disaster risk management um conference asking the U.N to replace the sdgs for a more sincere agenda an agenda that is really aligned with science that is focus on locally LED adaptation climate adaptation that's not mitigation to reduce an adaptation how to create resilience for this for infrastructure loads plus we we've seen before and also this disaster risk management which is very very important not to lose among other staff the blockchain so are we willing to put ourselves in a position to help these guys to put because they probably don't know what blockchain is they probably haven't even think of this so what if we put what if a ethereum foundation or whoever here wants to collaborate in this We Make some noise and help these guys or through the blockchain governance tools we have create a capacity building and create a pilot project to really change the world so going back to the many-to-many approach I told you in the in the carbon Market or the Eco tokens this pilot is is not just has not been already executed but it's very interesting how it has been designed because it was really designed from many to many although it was it was it could not be so ambitious at the beginning it was really what I'm trying to say in an example you can see those investors in the middle with the project tried to gather from the application of a bank where almost everybody in Argentina this is for El Chapo Argentina in the North um where everyone received their salary so they give the now with this project they should give the option instead of saving with something else you can buy an Eco token and in the supply side this is a very interesting interesting part and Diego I think before me he spoke something of interesting things about this but how the jurisdictional authorities how can we somehow we need them in our part they have the infrastructure to reach those territories we don't have it yet so the government the governor of Chaco committed at least verbally so this is just an idea remember that but he publicly confirmed that he wanted to do this and he wanted to reach the territories of those ecosystem uh sorry Echo tokens Revenue to reach directly their populations living in the forests through smart contracts and he committed himself to sign a bill in order to sort of delegate his mandate in in that regard not not the jurisdiction because that's a legal problem but to delegate and I think that's a very important role for this for uh for the estate for the government for the old parading to become helper of these two to to actually be Unleashed right and another example I wanted to share with you which is also very brand new they're working already and they they are from Colombia they're from here Echo registry because we need to know what what to do about the transition because we we have those Coca-Cola Delta Airlines car Hill buyer whatever willing to and and the demand for carbon credits has grown exponentially in the last years not the supply because of what I I told you there's no money to create projects but yes the demand there's a there was a two billion annual demand for credits in 2021 I think we should harness on but how this is a very interesting model here in Colombia that is spreading into other countries so they are not going to they don't just tokenize a carbon credit whichever the current credit asset quality is but they migrate into blockchain every part of the process of our of the life cycle of our carbon credit from the project design formulation validation verification the issuance the buys and sales that could be before retirement that is when the company the corporation claims the emission reduction and they are making this very transparent and very efficient to the point that the average in the market of reaching money to the developers is like 25 roughly these guys are reaching now 50 percent and they have a short-term plan of reaching 70 percent so that could be a smart transition that could be because those numbers those efficiency numbers could make the the transaction costs easier and and lower for the small communities actually to to be involved so finally if ethereum vision this is a web page of ethereum is to grow remember my slide of the icd-8 we need to we need to clearly think and be aware and be aware of what kind of growth and for whom because humanity is at stake thank you thank you Augustine we have room for uh some questions somebody want to ask to Augustine we have here I'm gonna go there just five seconds thank you so much for the the talk really really loved especially the ideas about making you know these markets these processes more inclusive many to many I think that's a transition that like all the impact space really needs to go through when we think about that though how does that marry with the fact that like carbon markets and the capital moving into that space just needs to increase because like the two billion dollar number is a lot but you know it's probably a tenth a hundred of what we're going to need exactly yeah even more um no a good question yeah obviously it's not the it's not the solution not at all I think we need to remind the the slide of the of these guys presenting a new agenda that's trying to redirect all the international cooperation cooperation system that or the the Paradigm under or the agenda under which this with all the money that he that enters the U.N and also the bilateral corporations and also corporations are flowing the money to so we need to I think my first answer would be to we need to really find the politics in order for the tool the blockchain tool to work to to make it happen but we need the politics right we need to get to edit them right so yeah voluntary carbon markets is just this but I focus on that because of the hype of the Eco tokens thank you for that question any other question if someone wants to do it in Spanish also right another question there please is with technicals in English or Spanish English or Spanish in English in English Okay please um well it's it's actually it's a crazy idea you know it's idea that popped into my mind and I share it with Paul here my friend from ethereum and I just saw that I I am very involved in the I know a lot of scientists in in the former ministers and everyone that came from the U.N so I I get I get to see this this letter that has been presented in this in this so it it was just an idea because I think my opinion is we need to connect the dots we need to integrate these two worlds those guys that are in my opinion very well aligned in the policy defining the policy for what we are going to need for those 1.5 disasters a day and for the NLC energy transitions by taking taking a look at the territories what if we I don't know think together how could that hour could look like or many daos or not but the other governance tools coming from from the blockchain so it's just an idea that we can discuss and we can create it together so thank you thank you there is another question there please here the white hi thank you for the talk I wanted to ask in relation to the idea of many to many that sometimes means and and the idea of taking away from the big you know offsetters and empowering the little local impact makers that requires taking the technology to places where it doesn't really exist right so how do we Empower how do we create that impact so that it's local people doing things for themselves instead of the blockchain industry trying to decide on their behalf and think they know what they're dealing with cool very very interesting question and obviously my first concern when I thought of this was yeah how are we going to reach a person that does not have a cell phone so I think that it's a gap that we need to try to reverse in a way and and I think that we can build over some projects right the other day in the sustainability blockchain Summit I've heard uh there was a a girl from Coco I think it's a it's called Coco project or coco and she was working in this ah here you're here great Amazing Project well you should you should ask her and we should bring it to the table this is us this is not me so so let's link that together thank you any other question we have time for the last question English or Spanish or thank you very much Agustin amazing talk an amazing job in four minutes we are going to continue with the next talk with Antonella talking about usable Security in web free four minutes again [Music] Your Love Takes Me Higher [Music] than I've ever been before and [Music] on fire [Music] your heart is [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] and the course [Music] in love I know it and I know it your heart is in love I know it and I know it your heart is and my Lord your heart is hola [Music] well there is a lot of talk about how to onboard the next billion citizens on on blockchain and a very important part of that is that to have a very easy to use products the ux UI but but there is also a concern about how improving the ux UI can have some problems in the security part so where is the balance between the security and the user experience that's what we are going to learn today from Antonella that is going to talk about usable Security in web free welcome Antonella hello web3 is redefining the level of control people have in ways that was deeply different and how this had been done before not only that white tree has started with literal Financial value even though this is an empowering proposition we see how meaningful um has their money compromised every day I'm Antonella I do block security at metamask my folks are there before that I will let the user experience team by the tour project for half of the decade deploying privacy and Hyson technology is not a crime wallets can be a lot of things we can't Define wallets as a container of private keys and their system affirmations to manage them every time a dove asks the wallet to execute a transaction the wallet is asking the user to confirm the usage of this keys Dan Finley and Eric Marx made a beautiful definition wallets are built around the responsibility of myriad in the the interactions between untrusted applications and users keys on the computers getting appropriate consent from the user foreign model of a non-cutiele wallet like metamask we will discover that the two more important Assets Now we have at stake are a pair of keys and the permissions to use these keys sounds simple this talk is not going to be our private Keys it's not going to be about artifacts to protect this privacy like ah see it phrases passwords fast prices or attacks or that today I'm going to talk about permissions and I want to talk about permissions because permissions is the elephant in the room usability topic Dev foreign users in this ecosystem there is a lack of interest at protocol level on how protocol decisions affects Everyday People lies and the responsibility of giving users the chance to understand what they are giving permissions to false on wallets when we talk about permissions we talk about an invoker requesting a wallet access to certain user information it can be different depending on what the app is prompting the user to do during a connect flow for example the Reap is requesting access to users public Keys the address to be able to push requests in this way and this is the user-facing interface on how the request looks on user's computer I'm sure some people has been facing these screens before the wallet is making an epic effort to expose and Trust information in a secure environment in a legible manner so the user can consent to execute or not this transactions we do things like treating television treat analysis human review we have a lava mode for preventing supply chain attacks you should check out on kumari's talk from yesterday we have fishing detect block list to Medical efficient attacks our vanity program and more people who work on security knows that this is called elastic security or Security in that but this is not enough to enable users to consent in transaction and I will stop and I imagine that some people is questioning why we are talking about consent in a usable security talk and Friends because they are not secure systems without consent consent is the radical idea that one person must voluntarily agree to the proposal of the size to another thinking about this why Building Technology is to give a feminist perspective to active consent to apply it to the social information system that we work with every day these are not my ideas these are ideas that came in the backbone from the feminist principles of the internet for open humans under design processes and more basically when we talk about consensual technology we talk about having control over our digital bodies which of course include our data and for sure our money so how a transaction based on concern should be a few people has been thinking about this defining a framework on how to approach um a consensual way to have any interactions I really like the five principles defined by false uh Alien media you can check this and more in the website is consentful touch.io so good consent is freely given his revocable is informed it's enthusiastic and it's specific and what we mean by all these things the fact that the consent is freely given puts the person in a position of doing something with another that should be made without pressure with force or manipulation anyone can change the mind on what they do at any time trust is not forever this is why transactions should be revocable people should be able to understand what their trade-offs are of this decision people should be able to read what they are going to consent to people should be able to comprehend what is going on consent should be enthusiastic if someone is not excited or really into it that is not consent consent should be specific saying yes to this now today here in Voda in October doesn't mean that I said yes to other things so we started questioning our interfaces and how they can become interfaces that could enable people to give real consent the use of a security design question that we put over the table with our teams with designers with developers we project managers with people working on metrics with people working on Communications was if we really transaction flow grounded in consent how could it look like um you spoke and we are listening we read social media we read the photos we read and we are working hard on improving our confirmation screens even when new transactions methods are being defined right now in other rooms on protocol level without considering how to expose users to a consensual interaction let's see the case of approvals token allowances is like a fundamental pattern of with free a in with three to allow a smart contracts to interoperate tokens and provide a better user experience what interacting with the apps in order to perform operations that require interactions with demand contract like minting stocking swapping users are first required to permit the invokers more contract to transfer a number of tokens on their behalf sometimes they have required improving this infinite amount of these tokens even if the user thrust it up it could be problematic this is our current tokens allowance screen um we have the original mind requesting this transaction we have the contract explicit who is asking for this interaction but the point here is we don't have allowances in the first screen of this flow and we have been working on that and we iterated this this new UI aims to empower users to the final allowance that they want to give to the lab we split the flow into we now have gas fees in the second screen which was something that people was looking um too much on the first version and now we have a specifically who actors are interacting in this transaction we are allowing users to verify contracts we are making explicit which assets are we in transfer we are adding friction to warn users when the site is requesting um the entire collections on a MSD to be transferred users can yeah I say that before can verify contract details and more things yeah going on what Taylor said this week we should be responsible of what technology we will we should be there which will technology that we expect people as developers as wallet developers we have the responsibility of critical thinking about how to expose users to give consent to a decision that directly affects the digital values and these allowed us to explore opportunities to design the centralized technology that respects people but practicing open design metallurgies balancing security and usability is complex we do a lot of complex things here it requires inadequate thread modeling the possibility of including people in your development process and trying to understand people's mental models too much with the flows that we propose as a facilitator of consensual transactions we are trying to generate more Open Spaces to discuss ESL Security in the decentralized hardware if you are a product if you are a designer if you resonate with this you can find me I will be happy to talk about this if you are a security researcher if you are a hacker if you want to punch our services we and get money we have a hacker one program in place hackerron.com metamask foreign if you are a developer and you have ideas on how to improve metamask you want to extend it you want to connect your API to metamaski exposed in a metamask UI you should check out metamaster IO slash snaps and edit stocks from yesterday I personally believe that there is a long way to go to rethink how the information systems to which we delegate trust interact with consent this is an open call and I invite you to think about that with me gracias thank you very much Antonella and we have several hands up we are going to start here but we have to there oh we have a lot of questions Anthony hi uh it's representation thank you a quick question the UI that you presented is there is a date when they're going to be released we are working on that later Quarter Two quarter four uh yes yes you can we work in an open environment we have a git have repository so you can check stuff thank you next question we have some one two and three say hello hello um thanks for your talk uh and you presentation told that a security researcher you have to do balance between user appearance and security how do you draw the line of saying the user is supposed to know the thing and I have to teach the the user that did the thing that happened now good question um I don't think we are here to teach users I think we are here to inform people to make informal decisions the balance between how much information we're showing on the screen and how this information resonates with people and also the time that happened between the people make a decision and read my body and change I think that is the most fun part finding this violence and I think it's super important also to work with users if you have a product you are building a pro a protocol whatever you should have users in your development process so you can expose users to your product early and you can get feedback and that it's so rich because you have people using your product before your life or whatever so that'll answer your questions a little bit there is one two and three and four we have time okay so and I see the fifth here please uh thanks for uh great talk uh part of the your definition of consent uh you you uh discussed uh revocable um and uh you know where does uh metamask or the ux fall with revocability and helping the user know that they can revoke or what what they've given consent to in the past beautiful it's a protocol issue it's not our problem no we should work together on protocol level to make sure that I mean to comprehend that we are human and we can make mistakes and I know that Rick vocability is like a Hot Topic in this space there are a lot of ideas on how to make transactions revocable you can do things like I don't know having a space of nons in the middle and you have a certain time that you can revoke and stuff they are smart people thinking about that um but yeah it's it's an open question hi great and great word using is consent how do you think to is possible to handle a psychnic message concern specifically when we sign some structured information on metamask you will see an adjacent that is really hard to understand and there's been a lot of hacks lately based on on our erc20 tokens able to permit user to sign message in order to allow for transactions so it's very hard for a user to know if you're approving uh genosis multiple or giving permission to someone to spend your tokens on your because have you thinking any kind of mitigation for this problem on metamask there are a lot of initiatives they want to make transactions readable they are you know I mean I remember five right now but there's a lot of people working on that I think it's the next step for big adoption should we have in transactions in every double manner um I seek companies making their own versions of this we should aim to have a community level consensus on how we are going to expose these two users I think it's like it's more powerful if we were all together then if a company says that they are doing clear singing or something like that so yeah I think it's a work in progress and I hope you are willing also a solution for transactions uh to be read a thank you hi uh thank you so much for your presentation today I just feel like I learned a lot so uh one question I just really want to ask is uh about metamask product design so I as far as I know initially minamas didn't want to launch the swap function and you know on they launched a swap function I just wanna I just feel like uh in the current space the switching network is really you know a significant problems that in you know improving ux I just want to ask more about what's the future plan on Madame mask about this interoperability issue and uh does metamask have in plan to solve this network switching problem yeah amazing question um I can open my computer and show you our designs after the talk and we can discuss it we are working on network abstraction it's super interesting because super early in the morning right now and the options are in Phoenix like I don't think the version we are going to ship first is going to be the best one but I think it's something good that we are going to iterate and we are going to learn also how people is using different networks um we are thinking we can talk in our uh but yes please find me and we can discuss like how this has not left hi I actually have two questions if allowed but one is a follow-up to the question before last about signing um and permissions and how those interact and even where they are readable if there's one particular thing that's being asked for over and over and over and over and over again user will get alert fatigue and just be clicking and to avoid that I was seeking to have a permission for that particular thing that gets repeated many times and was here for the hackathon last weekend and wanted to use made of mask snaps to make that easier and was told oh no actually me and my Snaps doesn't support working with the permission system to do that I was wondering if there are plans to allow snaps to work with the permission system in the future uh to follow up on that question I think the most powerful thing about snaps is like the list of formations we have a variable right now it's not static it's something that is going to grow in the future so I'm not uh here to say when but that may be something that is in the pipeline okay and the other question was you showed earlier some designs where you were making it clear that like oh you can set a limit for how much of a token a particular dab can be authorized for and you have a line in there like oh you can raise this limit later but you aren't telling people that there's a cost to do so like a financial cost of doing so later and I think that that seems to undermine this idea of consent a little bit because you're not telling people that there are going to be costs if they want to limit things now and then add it later do you have any thoughts about why that decision was made to obscure that I agree we we are not exposed in future cost of the transaction and maybe something that um could be part of some documentation on user-facing education material or something like that estimating how the thing is going to cost in the future it's weird and but I don't know maybe something to explore thank you for that question and the last one uh hello yeah thanks for this uh great presentation it's really insightful um so I have a question around the the fact of give it consent you mentioned that um it's quite complex because it's either you give too much permission and you fall into like an area where it's dangerous as a user or you you give too much restriction and then you hurt the usability of a user because the user then cannot do that much um what's your opinion on that like how do you find the The Sweet Spot of the right balance like this right area where it's not too risky but in the other on the other side is not too unusable great question um it's it has different parts first you should have and interdisciplinary team working on stuff because it's more powerful you have more views when people when building something for people then there is something very strong having enough metamask right now and is the fact that we are really in a program for the entire world um put us in a position to hire people from all over the world so basically we have people working everywhere and this is powerful because you have people sitting in tables making decisions that have different biases mental models this is one part the other part is talk with users I think talking with users is um it's so insightful you are going to discover things that you even imagine in the first second three rounds of user testing so diverse team users first and try and iterate I think the finding the balance is the most fun part of being working on this thank you very much we have time for one last question in Spanish can be foreign so proud to present this kind of leaders Latin American leaders working in this very very hard problems in two minutes we are going to start with our next um talk and Adrian is going to talk about the post merge ethereum client architecture two minutes and we will start this is going to be very interesting I don't like distance but if that's your decision if that's what you need me [Music] foreign success [Music] talking about being proud in the ecosystem we have to be proud because the merge was so bored what was so perfect and we finally have it in the good system and we are going to talk with someone of the team that makes the merch possible and I'm an honor to to introduce you in this stage uh and Adrian Satan is going to talk us about post merge ethereum client architecture bienvenido [Music] thank you very much g'day everyone hola what an awesome stage to give my first Devcon talk on uh it's fantastic to be here thank you for taking the time to come and listen so I've got a fair bit to cover I've had to kind of keep cutting slides all week because I realize how small 25 minutes is so let's get into it my name is Adrian Sutton I'm a lead blockchain protocol engineer with consensus I started out four and a half years ago actually working on hyperledger Basu before it was first released back when it was Pantheon and more recently I've been focused on techu the consensus client so I've had some experience with both the consensus side and the execution side building new clients and bringing them and getting them ready for production and then going through and uh yeah probably the highlight of my life now will be having having seen the merge complete and go through so very proud of that and very excited for except for ethereum but kind of talk about today some of the things that we didn't actually kind of get done um and some of the consequences of the way we did the merge which was fairly minimal deliberately so we could get it done so we'd get rid of all that burning proof of work so uh I wanted to tell you everything everything you ever need to know about ethereum clients I'd love to talk to you for a couple of hours about that about consensus and execution layers but I've got 25 minutes that's a bit of a problem so we're going to cut the scope down a bit and we're going to skip over some of the finer details we're focusing on the more high level stuff here the architecture how things fit together this isn't the kind of talk where I'm going to tell you about the nitty-gritty details of how the engine API works uh a little bit of assumed knowledge that you know ethereum here but I think that's pretty safe for this audience I think you should all be able to follow along pretty well give you some background it's three thing three key things that I want you to know about ethereum clients and that'll form a real grounding for the things we're going to talk about post merge and what they mean and the impacts of that so the first thing is there is a lot less difference between consensus clients and execution clients than most people believe yes they do quite different jobs yes at every opportunity when we were designing the beacon chain we said nah mate we can do that better let's pick a different technology so there's basically no shared code between the two but there are a lot of shared concerns and Concepts and there is a lot that we can learn by talking to The Other Side by consensus client developers talking to execution client developers and vice versa networking is probably a really good example of that in that the core concept of it really has three parts the first is Discovery we need to find peers second is Gossip so that new information flows around the network quickly and the third is request response which is the ability to say hey I missed some data can you give it to me or I'm syncing how do I catch up each of those are quite different Technologies for Discovery consensus uses Discovery V5 executionally uses Discovery V4 for the other two it's lib P2P versus Dev P to p and in terms of the formatting on The Wire it's ssz versus rlp as well so completely different Technologies behind underneath it but still this same concern of how do we find peers we can trust because the world is out to get us in client development we don't trust anyone and there's this sea of peers how do we find the good ones how do we find the honest ones and how do we get a good view of the network and know what's going on things like civil resistance are common across clients dos prevention and those kind of peer scoring algorithms the trade-offs between reducing latency when we're gossiping data by broadcasting it to more peers and then the the duplication of that data and the increase in bandwidth and then ultimately they're both blockchain clients they're both dealing with this tree of blocks and this concept of reorgs which is fairly unfamiliar for people who are new to client development this idea that the world is is you know fixed here it's not like a single database suddenly we we realize hey there's a better chain over here and we reorg how do we pull out say transactions or attestations and other operations from the chain we were on and check that they all made it onto this new chain lots of code and lots of logic flows around that and lots of impact throughout the client in the way it's designed the way it works and the kinds of things we have to think about when dealing with algorithms so on the consensus side probably the big thing that we keep coming back to and drives a huge amount of our decisions and has impacts everywhere is the fact that proof of stake is not just a block driven blockchain it's also time driven so even if no blocks are produced the world State continues to change now that we're in proof of stake every 12 seconds is a slot whether it's empty or not we apply rewards and penalties and and concepts for for validators and as a result of that there's a fairly limited amount of time or blocks to be produced gossiped around the network imported into other clients and then out of stations produced and that's that first four seconds of a slot uh it's pretty tight and particularly post merge we're seeing more and more uh that sometimes we don't quite make it that blocks are coming out late uh that they're taking too long to import and then attestations are being produced before that block is actually ready and before and so we get a wrong head vote which reduces the valida's rewards and you know slight impact on the the performance of the network so if you ever propose something to a consensus client Dev and it's going to slow down that process of getting a block out and then brought into the client ready to be attested to we're going to have a hard time and we're going to push back on the execution side it's a bit different time is still important obviously in performance but the big thing is this world State a beacon nodes database is in the order of 50 gig to 100 Gig for the total database on an execution client it's more like 500 gig to a terabyte very rough numbers I told you would be high level in hand wavy um but you know this order of magnitude difference in size and that has all kinds of implications for performance and it means that there are all kinds of different approaches to how you handle sync to how you prune that data and manage it as it changes how you index into that data and that impact then flows through the rest of the execution client so every time we're touching World State everything that has has operations to do whether it's transaction gossip and so on all comes back to this world State and getting access to it and that's what drives a lot of big things for execution clients and we want to give them scope to keep inventing new ways of dealing with things okay post merge world now that we've set the scene um the deployment model you've probably gotten the hang of these days we have two separate clients you need to run both a consensus client and an execution client and they both connect to their own P2P networks for gossiping data and retrieving stuff the blocks come through the consensus client pass through the engine API to the execution client and it's it's that engine API that allows the consensus client to control the execution client and this is one of the first things people notice as something we probably should clean up post merge of why do I have to run two pieces of software for a single ethereum node well there's a couple of solutions we can look at for that the first is embedding a light consensus client into an X into each execution client I really like this idea it's simple for users to run a node it reduces the system requirements like client consensus is a lot less impact and a lot less bandwidth and CPU than the full consensus protocol but it does come with some trade-offs uh you will always be one slot behind head because you've got to wait for the sync committee to do its job you can't run a validator node this way and there is it's a reduction in security guarantees for most nodes like if you're the type of person who really just wants to run one thing because you're running a home node and you just want to send some transactions it's probably a really great solution but it's not for everyone so often people suggest that we should combine clients we should take a consensus client and mash it into the same process with an execution client I'm a lot more skeptical of this it does make it simple for users to start a node in that they've got one process But ultimately it's really bad for client diversity we've got something like five consensus clients and four execution clients to choose from there's 20 different combinations are we really going to maintain 20 different combined clients so you can run them as a single process and who's going to do that and even if we were prepared to do it there's all kinds of dependency conflicts that we're going to get into because all of a sudden two separate development teams work is being pushed into a single process um and to resolve that means development teams working much closer together and being restricted by what they're doing so we get a lot more cognitive load for core devs a lot more coupling and we lose this nice separation that we've somewhat accidentally got between consensus and execution layers um and that's that's a real disadvantage for the ethereum ecosystem because that separation and the ability to have people who specialize in consensus and people who specialize in execution allows us to build stuff a lot faster and build stuff much more in parallel the final thing is it encourages clients scope creep and that might be a little unexpected here so let's dig into it a bit more this is what a real ethereum deployment often looks like and it's not as simple as the first picture um because we learned ages ago even before the merge right we let ages ago that putting your wallet inside your execution client is just dumb it's really bad for security and so we stopped doing it you know I if you've managed to load your private wallet key into yes still and you're using those Key Management apis please stop um use a real wallet and so you're already using two processes you're already using two different things to access ethereum then not every consensus client supports running the validator client in the beacon node at the same time in the same process some do some don't very common requirement for people wanting to set it up to have a separate validated client for various reasons and you might even take it a step further and want to secure your keys more and so you use an external signer that possibly has an actual database for slashing protection you probably should be monitoring your 32 East investment at minimum so you get something like Prometheus Everyone likes flashy graphs so now you've got profana and then you start adding on things like Mev boost so all of a sudden we've got a lot of stuff going on uh it's you know you can't imagine all of this being put into one process it's not viable it's not what we want to do and it you know if and we don't want to lock people into saying hey get started with ethereum here's a single process oh you want to do something well ah yeah throw out everything you learned do it a different way it doesn't make a lot of sense so what I think is the real solution here is eat OS important note please don't make it an actual OS right we've got good operating systems but this idea of moving up a layer of coordination is going to be really important so that we can maintain this decoupling of consensus and execution clients they don't need to know too much about each other they use the standard apis to communicate but we can start with here's a single process you run and it will spin up your execution and consensus client and have them hooked together ready for you then if you want to add a validator it'll add in a validated client for you it's just another config option without having to start again same for Mev same for metrics and so on the really good news about this it already exists um in in fact it exists in multiple forms things like East Docker East wizard dap node sterium all have some version of this or that that makes it easier to run a client kind of hides the details of of the fact that there are multiple processes and coordination required of course the downside is exactly that we're hiding the complexity underneath the hood lots of different things going on lots of moving parts and we need to be very careful to ensure that we have good definitions between each of those parts so things like building execution and the engine API well and making sure that all those little details get fleshed out and documented and so on and that over time we keep making it more robust okay beyond the initial deployment what are some of the other problems and opportunities that we now have because of the merge and and the way that these two clients work first one is a pretty big one we got a bunch of data duplication so the consensus client blocks include the execution payload which is what your execution client sees as a block and kind of by default both clients wind up storing that data so we've duplicated the execution payload which is what contains all the transactions it's pretty big and that increases our disk space requirements overall so you will probably see if you're running a beacon node post merge its database will grow in size faster than it did pre-merge because of these extra transaction data there are a couple of ways we can address this the first one is that there's a proposal that's been around since pre-merge but just execution climates didn't have time to deal with it basically and I'm not sure consensus clients did either uh for get payload bodies you know what this is is it's a fairly efficient way for a consensus client to say hey I need the payload for this range of blocks and that way the consensus client can simply stop storing it and instead it can rely on the fact that the execution client will be storing those blocks anyway the consensus client does need that data and it needs it fairly quickly when it gets it because things like queries to its rest API if you ask for a block it's got to give you the full block so it's got to go and get it and the same for uh networking when peers request a block it's the full block that we need to send back that in particular we want to be fairly fast and we really want it to be efficient that's probably the Big Challenge we have with this deduplication right now is that we're asking the execution client to store data and give us access to it on our terms if you remember the big thing for execution clients was managing data they have a lot already their database is under a lot of pressure and that's the performance bottleneck uh so Lighthouse has a feature where they will kind of emulate this get bodies this forget payload bodies through the existing Json RPC Cool Tech well done um and it turns out it puts a lot of pressure on the execution clients sometimes it works well if you've got enough I O sometimes it hasn't and they've added an option to be able to turn it off and just go back to duplicating the data which for some people has worked out uh better the other issue that that floats around here is that we get an increased coupling between the two clients again um not so much in terms of The Logical side of it in terms of you know what their responsibilities are but more in that if your execution client is rethinking your consensus client just lost a bunch of block data it thought it had and there's a lot of complexity around how to deal with that it's it's reasonable you'll probably just start getting errors from the rest API and say oops don't have that block um all of a sudden same for peers it's quite possible that you don't have that block anyway um all these details can be worked out but it's kind of part of cleaning up the mess we left behind when we got the merge done such as life the other solution which is a bit easier and kind of cheating is let's just not store all the blocks so we've talked about this with eip44s on the execution client side for quite a while and the consensus client learning from that actually put in the spec that we don't have to keep all the blocks all the way back to Genesis it's never been spec that way it's about five months that we need to store so if we just started pruning those older blocks and deleting from the database even with this data duplication we wind up with a pretty small database for our Beacon node it's probably enough it certainly would be for a lot of people and we can do the deduplication as well to make it even smaller the really nice thing about that is that uh for for consensus clients that aren't trying to form an archive node that would make their disk usage almost static it would grow but only really slowly as the number of validators grow and the the beacon state grows which is it's relatively small foreign that way we're kind of avoiding this this ever-growing creep of disk space usage that we've kind of seen with ethereum because of the growing World state it's nice to the consensus client doesn't necessarily have to have that problem drawback is obviously if you're running an archive node then you want to store all the blocks you want to store all the data and you're really going to want to lean on the deduplication to save this device instead of this approach and the other part which things like the portal Network are aiming to solve that those older blocks are harder to find you can't just request them from any peer on the network and they potentially become unavailable it's technically okay but it doesn't feel good for a blockchain to kind of lose old data so it's not really something we want to encourage and we want to have systems in place so that we do hold on to them there's a bunch of research going on there uh for example era files are defined and and we can use a number of things like that Okay so the other place where we see an interesting interaction excuse me between the consensus and execution clients yeah that water didn't help yeah so this interaction between the two clients into in terms of non-canonical blocks so blocks that we receive that we don't believe are part of the canonical chain maybe we receive them really late um or whatever for an execution client particularly ones that only store one version of the world State rather than the full tree of all the world States they're really tempted to want to just not bother executing the transactions because they don't want to store that world state they're only storing one anyway um and so the the engine API allows that and allows them to say this isn't worth executing I will store it and it's here if it becomes canonical sure I'll execute it but I'm not doing it now and they can return accepted the problem is on the consensus client side we have to track that that block isn't fully valid so the execution client didn't execute it because you know World State's big that makes a performance problem that kind of thing on a consensus client though that delay in execution might become a problem if we have to reorg over to that block because it's going to add delay right at the point where we're likely to not want it that time sensitivity thing so we're about to create a block and we've realized hey we're on the wrong chain we're going to reorg over to this one all of a sudden we've got a block we don't know is valid that we think is now the canonical chain we have to wait for the execution client to execute it before we can safely perform any validator duties that are involving that lock that might delay the validated duties best case but it may just cause them to be missed um so it's going to be really important to to have some understanding of these different pressures between clients because for short reorgs it's actually really important for the execution client to go ahead and and spend a bit of CPU and this i o to execute all those blocks to avoid potentially causing the consensus client to be in a time pressure scenario but then for long reorgs that's probably okay it's less common uh and much less likely that we'll need to reorg to something that that would cause a long reorg Danny Ryan's talk and the opening session particularly showed that where we're just not seeing many realgs at all which is fantastic okay so summing this all up there's there's a bunch of other problems that that are there and and cleanup that we need to do these Loose Ends but they are loose ends they're not going to require more hard Forks to fix they're not going to require massive amounts of effort it's just the normal day-to-day plugging away of engineering so keep up with the latest versions of your clients and life will keep getting better I think we want to continue to learn from the other side right consensus and execution clients through the merge process have really started talking to each other a lot more than they did back before we've really worked focused on the merge we want to keep that going we don't though need execution client devs to be an expert in consensus layer that split is powerful and we want to really leverage it and look for other places where that kind of split can be useful and that's part of embracing this kind of multi-component future of ethereum that you don't need to know everything about every component of ethereum you can know your little part even just within the the layer one that's all I've really got time for um so uh you know thank you for listening and I've I do believe we have some time for questions which would be awesome hello yes we do we have time for questions uh do we have any question from the aliens please raise your hand there is a question hey um uh cool talk thanks uh so you mentioned multi-component and embracing that um aspect and I think for the most part you know we're on our way towards that I think one area where that is not quite on the case is between like the beacon node and the validator across clients right for like prism or Lighthouse whatever um do you know um is there a road map with like Basu for example or sorry teku um for that to allow like validator I took a validator talk to like a prison Beacon node and um like what are your thoughts there what are the challenges to be able to accomplish that yeah absolutely I think it is really useful to be able to have all right you know I take your validate a client talking to a lighthouse Beacon note the good news is that the standards are there for that um so from right back before the B can change launch this is theoretically possible in practice it's been a bit hit and miss we've actually seen really good compatibility with everyone else except prism so prism uses grpc they kind of got in first and did it and we didn't listen to them and did a rest API because we liked it more and we kind of outvoted them so we put them in a hard place there um so their validated can't use this grpc they do expose the standard rest apis so most clients can their validated clients can connect to prism but prisms valid a client generally can't connect to anything else otherwise they generally interrupt pretty well and particularly for teku because infuro was exposing the beacon node apis which they've deprecated and removed now because people kept running validated clients against inferior which is kind of terrible um so it is possible it is something that we need to to ramp up testing on more every so often we find a little corner case that didn't work as well as it should and those kind of things but yeah a lot of the that the base layer is there for it mostly it works and I think particularly with post merge it's going to become more and more common because you so often use a validated client that failed over between two Beacon nodes now any other question there is another question with another hand there hey Adrian thanks for the talk I want to ask what are your thoughts on current design that the consensus client is tightly coupled with the execution client I mean one consensus cloud has to talk to One execution class that sound like what's the reasoning behind it another thing like what do you think about DVT distributor validator Tech and how will it influence the the future of clients yeah so on the first part there it is pretty much um I probably should have mentioned this that that one consensus client generally has a tight coupling to one execution client the key reason for that is that the consensus client is is writing and updating and controlling the execution client there are some solutions and I think this is part of the multi-component stuff that you can actually run a middleware layer that will take the option the the calls from the consensus client and spread them across multiple execution clients I love that I love that it's built as a separate thing and not something that is a client Dev I have to do myself because it's hard and there's a lot of different policy scope there in terms of do I trust this is my primary execution client you know what if they disagree um do I want two out of three to agree all these kind of details we can build that really well with a dedicated product rather than um trying to build it you know five times once in each consensus client uh in terms of distributed validated technology I'm not a huge expert but again that's pushing towards becoming a middleware layer and I think that's again really powerful and really good it's certainly uh is a great technology to help de-risk some awesome operations with ventilators and have unique deployment models that are that are around there so it's something I'm really Keen to see keep evolving and keep uh kind of finding new ways of doing it and and ideally that we find ways of adjusting pretty much the the validator apis that we use those rest apis I talked about before adjusting them so they're more and more conducive to an external piece of software just being able to handle it all and handle it well there might be some trade-offs there we might hit some limits I don't know but yeah definitely a technology to keep investigating thank you oh thank you thank you very much Adrian with some an amazing conference and please a big Applause for him thank you everyone [Applause] by the time okay we are ready um for our last talk before the the launch and talking with Philip uh there is a keyword in this next talk that is um user fairness and Philip Diane is gonna talk about maximum structure as instruction value for the next three Leon not billion it's time to get serious so thank you very much and PM Benito Phillip thank you so much for having me so great to be here all right everybody hello hello it's so good to see everyone I haven't been in a stage like this in about three years since Devcon Prague back when I was in obscure PhD student and giving a talk in a similarly sized room that no one showed up for so very emotional to be standing in front of you all here as the steward of flashbots and looking at how much has happened in our industry in the last three years I also am a PhD student at Cornell but this talk is in my capacity as flashbots so today I'm going to be taking you all on a tour through the Dark Forest and this is actually the Dark Forest where I spend my time where I live right so I know I'm taking the meme a little literally but I'll also show you some pictures I've taken in my journey over these last three years finding Nev and really trying to fight for uh user fairness um so I learned in teacher school that some people only learn well with an outline so we're going to talk about three things today the first one is where did Mev come from why are we here second one is where are we today so I'm going to talk a lot about flashbots and the choices we've made as a collective how they relate to things like the base layer of ethereum security and fairness for users as well and I'm going to talk about where do we go so what is the goal for Mev what is flashbots doing this is a question I get a lot from the community and we're going to start to answer it today and how can we all do it together as an open source as an ethereum Community to really build these systems for the next trillion I'm not kidding about that um so this all started for me with this academic paper I wrote at Cornell called Flash Boys 2.0 where we looked at the market dynamics of several dexes that were popular at the time around 2018 2019 and we looked at basically the game that Bots were playing to Arbitrage these decentralized exchanges and how they related to things like user fairness and consensus security using extensive measurement infrastructure so if you're interested in that and you haven't read that paper yet I highly recommend you check it out but in that paper we Define this term called Mev maybe you've seen some talks on Mev at Devcon here so we Define this as saying oo fees or ordering optimization fees represent one case of a more General value we call minor extractable value or Mev and that refers to the total amount of ether miners can extract from manipulation of transactions within a given time frame which may include multiple blocks worth of transactions um so there's a sort of Duality to Mev that we've been exploring and pointed out basically after this paper we're on the one hand Mev is this financial potential energy that runs through everything we build every system we build um and on the other hand it has risks so what we said in the Flash Boys paper was Mev poses concrete measurable consensus layer security risks and we show that Mev poses a realistic threat to ethereum today that was four years ago so today it's even even more so so how do we get to a place where we preserve the decentralization of these systems we're building where we make sure that this Mev is used for good and not centralization that it doesn't entrench actors into our systems which are not aligned with user fairness how do we make sure these systems actually work for the people that are using them uh well there's one simple answer to that and this photo is actually from a hike I took after Devcon Osaka again all these have like a little emotional story for me so I'm kind of indulging myself here but we do that by playing the long game um so this is what what I spend my entire time kind of for the last three years obsessing about what is the long game of Mev and how do we get out of a world where we're all captured by Citadel where we're all captured by Robin Hood's new crypto wallet where we're all captured by metamask where we're all captured by flashbots or a centralized Builder this is the world we need to get away from and we need to play the very very long game here so what am I doing about this well one thing is uh stewarding this project called flashbots which we announced in this blog post called front running the Mev crisis and it has three goals number one illuminate the Dark Forest Mev when we started was an opaque obscure Niche area that no Searchers wanted to really talk about publicly you couldn't get the kind of data in The Flash Boys 2.0 Paper without doing months of academic research and that's not good right we need to communicate to the community to the users and to everyone exactly what is going on in these systems and exactly how it affects them so that's Illuminating the Dark Forest the second thing we need to do is democratize Mev extraction so if we want to preserve the decentralization of the systems we're building we need to make sure that our validators aren't these vertically integrated monoliths that essentially operate as hedge funds that would be basically a worst case scenario for our Network it would be a direct capture opportunity for entities like Goldman Sachs Citadel Robin Hood Etc who you already see moving in this direction on ethereum today right so we need to make sure that Mev extraction and the benefits of Mev extraction are available to all and the last one is to distribute Mev benefits so it should not be the case that only the users or only the validators are benefiting from this concept all right let's talk about where we are today uh this is a picture from West Virginia also a very dark Forest it was cold there um so now we're kind of on the heels of the ethereum merch one of the largest most massive system upgrades we've ever seen and flashbots has been working towards decentralizing itself so before what we had was a vertically integrated Builder where it would plug directly into get itself and basically build all blocks at that point we were building upwards of 90 of Mev Laden ethereum blocks and we decided to democratize this further by splitting this role into several interfaces with many participants and this was a direct kind of attack on centralized buildings Builders sorry to let new block Builders and new entities that wanted to participate in Mev have a direct channel to connect rather than needing a high upstart kind of Legally heavy world the way we see in Trad Phi Pfaff which I consider highly sub-optimal so what do I mean by decentralization so this this picture is actually a perfect example of it what we need to do to decentralize is build many many parties with many many utility functions that work on the system together and that cooperate and these parties need to have meaningfully economically distributed power so that's what we're working on after the merge the adoption of this system has currently reached about 56 percent of all uh uh all uh kind of ethereum blocks and flashbots dominance currently on this system is at 81 it's a number we're kind of actively looking at here and you can see that you get a you get a quite substantial uh validator payment Boost from running this system so generally up to like 300 percent of the fees you'd make otherwise but often spiking as high as even 80th in some blocks um okay so that's great Phil but how is that Illuminating how are we doing today on these three goals illuminate democratize this tribute and and what are we doing here so the first thing we're doing at flashbots is we're aggressively committed to open data we believe open data is the only way to escape centralization and get to a decentralized fair Universe um in that regard we've been pioneering much of the data used by a lot of the ecosystem on Mev it's very hard to read an Mev article without seeing flashbots data quoted therein and we provide open data on both the public goods blockchain transactions that do not flow through us as well as transactions flowing through our node not only are we a leader in this space ourselves but we also have inspired many other parties working in the Mev space to start by releasing transparency dashboards which was Unthinkable three years ago so several other companies that are doing this include Western gate jump skip zero Mev and much more inspired by the illumination culture of our Explorer and we're taking this past the merge with Rich public data from all the centralized infrastructure we're running as well as dashboards where people can see how this infrastructure is kind of progressing and we're going to continue this culture of open data and illumination through this talk through proof of stake and through any future we're in one last thing I want to say and this is the biggest font I used in the entire slide so this is important you cannot illuminate without research flashbots is committed to doing research as a first class citizen in its activities and having a dual research and development engine you can see that in Devcon here you can see the representation of flashbots researchers both in the audience and the number of talks they've provided I recommend you know looking at the schedule that we've listed on our Forum with several amazing talks there and it's extremely hard to look at an Mev event or an Mev article or do Mev research without using this public goods research that we've been doing all right Phil that's great you guys are Illuminating what about democratization um so democratization is extremely important to me that means that every user has to have equal access to the system uh that we are building here of Mev and on that perspective much like my friend the little frog I believe we're a Long Way From Home um so I want to address kind of the elephant in the room this is one of the memes I've heard a lot at the hallway track of this conference which is ofac so we run a lot of centralized infrastructure in our systems today that is not the long-term plan at all but today we do and we do kind of comply with U.S regulations on ofac which has become a meme so this threshold actually crossed 51 today what does this mean this kind of shows two things number one we've been like very successful in our mission to democratize Mev almost too successful um we've almost grown too quickly to outpace and build these competitive ecosystems we're striving towards so the next thing we need to do is ensure as much Global cooperation on these systems and as much diversity of participation with different utility functions as we can if you look at what the ethereum blockchain looks like today this is a picture from last night of ofac compatible blocks you can kind of get a scope of the situation so the reality is today there are not many uh transactions that are actually under these regulations as well as you have about half of blocks complying with them what this means is you may generally have to wait 15 to 30 seconds longer for the inclusion of a sanctioned transaction this is not the same as a 51 attack on eth because it doesn't operate at the consensus layer that being said it is concerning right if this number gets closer to the full proportion of eth block power that would be kind of a upsetting for the ability of a lot of uh parties to get transactions included and also for ethereum to operate as a system um and as a foundation um so how do we get out of this and make sure that doesn't happen well there's one thing from me as flashbots that I'm going to say and then I'm going to go into really how do we get out of this on like a technical level so what I have to say as flashbots is we do not intend to impose our utility functions or our legal risk analyzes on the ethereum network full stop that stands against everything I believe in it stands against the last seven years of my participation in this ecosystem in the last 10 years of my participation in cryptocurrency in general I'm here for censorship resistance everyone who knows me knows that and I I've also researched this issue you know long before ofax so how do we get out of here we believe one key tool is open source so open sourcing as much of our infrastructure as possible is the only way we get out of this centralized Builder morass right we need to make sure that people can easily build this technology that the barriers to entry are low and almost non-existent if we want to have a diversity of participants A diversity of competition and meaningfully economically decentralized power in the systems we're building um so this is something we're actively working towards here so this first graph is an adoption graph you can see on the bottom basically the adoption in purple of the Mev boost system on each blocks and it's steadily increasing in adoption adoption as we reach 50 but if you look at who's actually building these blocks where that bright purple bar is flashbots here you can see a number of new uh industry players are coming in to uh building blocks and as well as relaying them we have several relays as I showed you on a previous slide um and this is to us key to democratization so in our opinion the relay is not a piece of software that will exist in two or three years it will be replaced by PBS or more sophisticated kind of interfaces on the other hand the Builder is extremely concerning to avoid centralization in because of the entrenched incentives in that level of the stack so how do we avoid centralization open sourcing is one way supporting our competition is another and a third way is making sure we Lobby aggressively the entire ecosystem to avoid entrenching centralized choices like private or exclusive order flow into the way they do business because these will destroy the system that we love as a whole um okay Phil so how do we get out of here well like any Forest when you're in the middle of a forest and it's dark the only way out is through so come with me on a journey and let me take you through uh where we are today so the first thing we're doing is on the left we're supporting not only Paradigm as our partners but many others who are asking these hard social and legal questions about the base layer about validation about how this impacts everything we're building we're supporting them as much as we can with discussions with engagement um and and in many other ways the other thing is on the top right you can see part of a tweet storm of mine where I talk about how to actually achieve censorship resistance and neutrality through decentralization through Geographic distributions of the preferences of different utility functions um I don't think you can pressure any one validator to be decentralized and I think that will ultimately make you more centralized if you knock on coinbase's door and you say guys you have to shut down now or you have to like mine transactions that will get your public company sanctioned by its relevant authorities that's not how you build a maximally robust system that's how you push your system to the edges this is Mev for the next trillion we're trying to go to the whole world the entire Financial value of the entire world here so we are absolutely trying to go beyond the preferences and utility functions of any single player um the other thing we're doing is these are research posts you can read from vitalik and our team that we've been engaging on for a while on how do we bring back the status quo of proof of work style censorship resistance where the validators have Agency on choosing only builders that are not censoring um while maintaining the revenue that they can see from Mev optimization so we don't want to make validators choose Mev optimization or censoring we want them to be on whatever point on that trade-off point they want to be at and we want to incubate as many points on this graph as we can and how do we do that we do that through research again research is absolutely key and we cannot get out without it alrighty so much like tree roots the last step is to distribute this Mev to our entire Community organism uh in this room um so here is actually the the part we've done the least work on but the part we're really going to focus on next so we do have this product called flashbots protect which you can plug into your metamask and essentially get the benefits of private Mev auctions um uh and and extend these to all normal you know retail kind of users of blockchain so that you don't need to be a sophisticated party to access the benefits of what we're building at flashbots but we have a much much more richer set of features to come on this front and I'm going to talk about that next the bottom line with distribute is we've been too slow like I'm not going to lie with you we must do more here and I think the other two have kind of Taken priority but it's time to kind of make sure we really give users the benefits of this Mev so my guess is in a year people are going to be happy to be sandwiched because they're going to be saving so much money on transactions so don't call it a sandwich attack call it a sandwich and let's make sure it doesn't lead to a centralized Builder world all right let's talk more about walking out of this Forest over here so where are we going so this is how I see the the Nev Marketplace as a user validator Supply demand optimization problem where the user wants to minimize the fees plus Mev basically the rent it's offering to the system and the validator wants to maximize this basically the Commodities offering to resolve this potential Financial energy of our our universe into a single collapse discrete state um so what do we need to do in this market we need to make it more private privacy is the key here you can't have freedom without privacy we need it to be more decentralized economically meaningfully decentralized we need it to be more competitive geographically so one actor cannot dominate the preferences of the system we need more user tooling so users can be sophisticated on their side of the Curve we need a market that's more robust efficient and geographically diverse to me this is self-explanatory if we're not building towards these three goals we're going to fail and we don't want to have externalities on the ethereum network Corruption of the validator set changes of incentives and proof of work or any of these other kind of externalities of Mev and we want to maintain the success of flashbots in democratizing Mev to the Searcher Community already and prevent first party deals between Searchers Builders relays and other actors in the system these are best done when you communicate on a technical not a political API and that's what we're aiming to build so WTF do we do next at flashbots well we're going to decentralize the crap out of this thing that's the answer so we are here to avoid entrenching centralization at every step this is my commitment to you as long as I'm here in this community I will be working whatever the status quo is to further decentralize power in Mev in an iterative way and I expect every single person in this room to hold me to account okay now you can collapse [Applause] so we're not going to end up owned by Citadel no no I'm not done sorry sorry just a little Applause um so what are we doing at flashbots this is the question every Community member asks me and today I'm going to answer it for you and please kind of follow up with me and start the conversation um we're building a project called codename Suave it's something we've been working on for kind of the last uh almost a year now and that we're going to be releasing iteratively to the community and building towards further it is not an end state but an initial state to start the conversation about how we decentralize this existing ecosystem that flashbots has built to all of our friends all of our competitors and all the other projects in the space so what is suave Suave is an Mev aware privacy first encrypted mempool for users and wallets so Suave will make the maximum leverage of a user's economic value to force the system to provide them fairness essentially and vice versa as a negotiation tactic in this market it features Progressive decentralization so along with the iterative steps on our centralized infrastructure that we're going to take towards Suave we're also going to have a very clear decentralized roadmap that we expect you again to keep us to account on and for our friends at roll ups l2s you know any other whatever you want to call them side chains multi-chain we're going to give those uh actors a turnkey decentralized block builder for both their validators to maximize their revenue and for their users to maximize the output of their economic transactions without entrenching further centralization into the roll-up or into the uh other chain so this is very very important cooperation without centralization is what we're doing here um I'll give you some more keywords about what we're building and spend a little bit of time kind of ranting about each one of these so first is a fully decentralized block Builder we stand against centralization in the block building market and I know that may seem inconsistent with our previous views but it is my belief that the only way to achieve decentralization is to front run the Mev crisis and credibly decentralize every modular component of it this is going to be a fully open source system that's going to be developed in the open so starting in about a week we'll start releasing information specs possibly even prototypes and code we'll see two weeks TM right like for for users to play with and we want you to come discuss with us that's what decentralized means if you consider yourself a competitor of us we want you to come to the table and we want to build this together because we really believe truly that the best outcome for the space is if we're all doing this together rather than fighting each other in zero-sum games um it's going to be ethnative so that means aligned with the eth validator set and intended not to corrupt the validator set of ethereum or impose things like undo token incentives or other centralization risks on the evm layer and it's going to be fully evm compatible to kind of bring the benefits of all these evm chains and their interconnectivity to Mev we're going to provide optimal user execution that harnesses Mev so we're going to use Mev as this decentralized engine in the long term to make sure the users get really the best execution on their trades in a way that's really going to make tradfy look embarrassing very shortly in my guess um we're going to offer full compatibility with flashbots today so many of you may search on flashbots made relay blacks blocks to flashbots may do whatever um and we want to have full compatibility with that system going forward um we want cross slash multi-chain support so this one is kind of self-explanatory I mean everyone asks us are you going cross chain are you going multi-chain come on what do you guys think of course like um yes but also ethnative and etherlined we think this is the key combination for these systems in the future so they serve the whole world not just one area or one set of clients or people um last thing is we're going to maximize competition and Geographic diversity so this is the most important point that I kind of wanna everyone to leave today with is we don't get out of the Dark Forest unless we have a competition and Geographic diversity and unless both of those are really meaningful so we can't build systems Solana that uh for example privilege certain economic zones or require you to have low latency to an existing set of infrastructures because then we lose out on the benefit of these Global utility functions and the amazing cooperation that these utility functions enable so every step we're going to take is going to be intended to maximize this competition we're going to enable open order flow for ethereum's future what is open order flow open order flow means no first party deals between wallets Builders and or validators because we believe that these first party deals in tradfi have led users to have absolutely horrible execution and have entrenched extremely predatory uh rent extractors rent extractors if you will and the last thing is we're going to have programmable privacy so how do you achieve all this how do you give users back their bargaining power they need to have control over what information they're giving and that only comes through privacy it's it's one tool that we need to get out of the situation we're in although it's not quite enough by itself for reasons that will become you know clear over time so this to me is the Genesis of a new phase of Mev a new Cooperative positive sum phase of Mev to get us out of this zero-sum negative centralizing uh ecosystem that we're headed towards even though we have avoided vertical integration we now need to avoid Builder centralization so that will be the next job of flashbots I want you all to help please please please please please please please Louise every person in this room let's you know all these photos are from my hikes and when you're on a hike the best thing you can do is get to the top because then it's all downhill from there it's all nice and easy the Cool Breeze is Flowing on your back so I want to hike with you all we're going to have to climb the mountain first I'm sorry it's not going to be easy but we're going to do it we're here for years and years to do this together especially if you're a user a wallet or a roll-up we want to be talking to you now about centralization in your system and the rest of the stack we're hosting a round table on this later today so please reach out with an application if you're interested in that lastly please check out our Forum where we make all these discussions and come troll the crap out of us about ofac centralization competition unfairness you just Hammer us you know please please so we really want you to participate in this because you can't meaningfully diversify power without diversifying participation so we look forward to talking to you all and hopefully this makes you feel a little better about us not being like the evil Goldman Sachs Borg that censors us all thank you [Music] that was awesome we have time for one or two questions make them spicy yeah there is another there is a question here one and two hey um thanks Phil great talk um so I think uh talking with the community recently one sort of trust issue that people have with flashbots is um you do all this great open source work and it's not quite clear what's like the end game what is the way you make this into you know something sustainable profitable for flashbots obviously it was a research Collective there's also accompanying your foundation or some sort of of entity there so can you talk you know to people about like what is flashbots the company organization trying to build and how do you see yourselves integrating with that ecosystem in a way where like others can also thrive the truthful answer and this doesn't satisfy people internally either as we don't know yet we think it's too early in this market and there are too many kind of variables and competitors to make a call without entrenching something that further provides centralization in the long term so we're intentionally avoiding that people ask like what do you pitch the VCS why do they invest in you well we pitch then like look guys you own eth we're going to solve this problem for you and like do you want your eat bags that are worth 100x more than us to go to zero or not and yes we also pitch them that we do want to be sustainable because as a mission-driven organization if we're not reasonable and sustainable we won't be able to to continue operating so that the more specific answers I think there's three things we still need to do at flashbots and they were all on that slide so one of them is to decentralize ourselves completely and meaningfully and economically one of them is to enable benefit to be redistributed to users much more efficiently than it is today and the third one is to enable support for any zone or trust domain in the world that wants to use flashbots without harming the centralization of ethereum those goal are still open research questions and once we've answered that we'll look into being sustainable and reasonable and monetizing I realize it's not a satisfying answer but personally I would rather die right now than entrench something shitty so it's kind of what we're going to be doing we're also going to announce much more about this in the next month or two because I understand this is a question people have it's a question people have internally as well so totally reasonable and totally understood hi um so I was wondering how do you think can small Builders become competitive with the big ones because it does seem that order flow is a very strong centralizing force right and if you just have more orders you can build more profitable blocks so this is what decentralizing the Builder role is about in the future I don't think there will be such a thing as a monolithic Builder that builds a whole block that's kind of the future we're working away from what we want to build in the future is much closer to a network of Searchers that eventually chaotically kind of produce this block hash output and in that case any economically meaningful information that you have in any possible strategy in any way can be expressed into the system without kind of ruining its decentralization properties so I agree with you uh open order flow or sorry closed order flow does make this whole thing like much more centralizing that's why we want to get rid of it and that's why we want to move into systems where any Builder no matter how big or small can access the order flow of the biggest parties in the space you know metamask coinbase whatever else like that would be how you get out of that equilibrium you make the order flow Democratic as well as the Mev extraction API and that that is what we're working on so okay thank you very much Philip was an amazing and awesome thank you so much for having me yeah we are getting to uh the break for lunch but before telling you what is going to happen this afternoon I want to thank you all of you for coming to Colombia I'm local and it's this is like a dream um as a member of the local community this is amazing and I want to thank all of the organizers the ethereum community and the ethereum foundation for develop this amazing Defcon here in Bogota we're going we're going to be back uh 2 P.M with the with Ben Jones with the talk fixing the internet we layered to governance thank you all again closer [Music] [Music] closer I'm driving setting something for one past eight years [Music] in California cause I'm in love [Music] in love with you winding through he gave me [Music] no future [Music] in love with you my California foreign [Music] it's like like your dreams come [Music] thank you five years the slides up Tyler this is yours so tell me when you come back foreign do this foreign hello everyone well today I'm very excited because this is the last day for Devcon 6 but I'm already excited for the next year so today um we are going to start to have a talk about governance and coordination this is called fixing the internet with layer 2 governance with Ben Jones from The Optimist foundation so let's give him a blouse and a blouse oh there we go what's going on y'all it's the post lunch crew how was lunch good good yes okay I think we need to get livened up a little bit so I'm gonna have some heavy crowd engagement to start this off are you all down y'all ready yeah whoa okay I always bring this to my talks I don't know how I'm going to hold it maybe we'll do okay this is going to be the most ridiculous thing but here's what I need you guys to do just uh can you do that there we go come on you got it okay [Music] foreign [Music] there we go okay so that's how we we dust off our uh our post lunch energy there okay so thanks all for being here cool so hey everyone my name is Ben my stage name is weird eth Yankovic I discovered that I can do music if it's about crypto and it covers how bad I am at music works great um and I'm one of their co-founders of a project called optimism oh yeah thank you okay I'll take it and uh today I am going to do a talk on what we are building and why because if you thought that we were building a blockchain if you thought we were building a scalability solution you are dead wrong um and by the way this is the most ridiculous talk I have ever done like by an order of magnitude so in addition to thank you for being here thank you for coming along this ridiculous ride and uh yeah brace yourself okay I believe that we are here to change the future and hopefully if you're here at Devcon you feel that way too when I discovered ethereum I dropped everything I saw something something clicked we call it going down the rabbit hole but whatever the heck it is it's this kind of vibe here's one of our great ethereum shows Mr David Hoffman crypto wasn't created to make you rich it was created to set you free so we've got a lot of shills out there but the reality is that we all have to acknowledge we have a lot of haters look at some of these communities that are all dedicated to poo pooing what the heck we're doing here right so what's going on why is it so hard to convince these people and what can we do to make that happen well I think really what this comes down to is that when we talk about these systems we describe the properties of the future that we see we talk about decentralization censorship resistance digital value but what we don't talk about are the paths that we're going to take to get there and the reality is even if some of these properties of the future are inevitable the outcomes resulting from the paths we take there simply are not 30 years ago Silicon Valley had an explosion of technological utopians that knew that the internet was the next big thing the information superhighway the World Wide Web according to Popular Mechanics this was going to be the greatest social Revolution since the automobile and probably it was but nobody really saw what was coming in 1996 this guy John Perry Barlow often called the Thomas Jefferson of the wire generation wrote a very famous piece called a declaration of the independence of cyberspace let me read you something from it governments of the industrial World You Weary Giants of Flesh and steel I come from cyberspace the home of mind on behalf of the future I ask you of the past to leave us alone you are not welcome Among Us you have no sovereignty Where We Gather this is good stuff weary Giants of Flesh and see yeah I mean that deserves a plus totally it's great it's incredibly moving right weary Giants of Flesh and seal what a phrase right oh my gosh and this thing went viral back in 96 within months it was on tens of thousands of websites and it had taken a subset of the community by swarm but it's hard today also not to look back on this message with 30 years of hindsight and feel that in some ways it's a little bit naive what we learned was that the roads of that information superhighway were not equally paved and the reality is that those weary Giants of Flesh and steel have been replaced today by Silo Giants of concrete and silicon this is what runs our internet this is what things look like today so how are we not going to do this again with crypto what can we say about what's to come well the only thing we know for sure is that technology is keep is going to keep accelerating it is going on and on and on you can feel it in the air guys I don't know about you but I certainly feel it seems like every week something crazy is going on the AI have started to do our homework the homework of our children and better then those children are able to I think probably whereas a year ago it didn't exist half of the people at Devcon used an AI to generate the slides that they present here at Devcon here's an AI generation of depicting someone using artificial intelligence to generate their slides right it's crazy this is going on all the time and look it's all fun and games until we start impersonating world leaders happening right this is the world that we are headed into sure in that video our world leaders were getting it wrong but the reality is we are on a March towards something much different and they're not getting along folks we are maximizing our profits with no regard for the long-term consequences of what we're doing we are civil attacking ourselves with fake accounts and even Faker news and we are literally straying dangerously close to nuclear war call it what you want Call It The Singularity say it's something else but it's clear that we are moving through a phase shift right now into something new and whatever that is if it's not our destruction we'll change how life is expressed in the Galaxy fundamentally or at least our solar system anyway I don't know about those aliens maybe they're already there and in many ways the crypto dream is to forge a path through this uncertain future right open source software knowing what code is being run digital sovereignty going bankless living in the metaverse working for Dows right these are things are the promise of crypto they're the dream what is the reality today though it's a little bit different coin voting that's what we have today folks coin voting there are exceptions but by and large this is what exists in crypto today right and this is just sad come on guys look at this guy this is a 400 year old mechanism this is the founder of the Dutch East India Trading Company who is basically the first person to make a coin voting structure right it was a um you know it was a company that you could trade the shares of it's 400 years old um his name is Johann Van Alden barnabelt crazy right the United East India Company do we really think that this guy the mechanism that this guy made if we take it and we make it Unstoppable by putting it on a blockchain we're suddenly going to usher in a new era of unity and freedom for the world it's just not enough what a joke it's a joke and I want to be clear we should still stand on the shoulders of giants these mechanisms are 400 years old and worked for a reason but the reality is we also have to use those mechanisms in new ways right much of the anger at the world today that we at crypto in crypto feel like we're trying to solve is the fact that we let this coin voting mechanism run unchecked and we talk about late stage capitalism and all of that and so ultimately our anger is about these systems so it's completely ridiculous to say that we're going to go and put it on a coin vote and suddenly the world is saved so we're facing an inflection point we have to ask ourselves right now do we want to live in a future where those autonomous giant where those giants are now autonomous Giants of biting bites and steel and capital or do we want to be in one where there are benevolent Giants of life and Liberty these are the questions that we must be asking ourselves right now so he's going to do something optimism obviously okay so we're not going to do it alone but this is what I meant at this beginning when I said we're not creating a blockchain here we're doing something more optimism is a collection of optimists we are here to Align Technology with Humanity and reject those Futures in which capital alone is King because capital is already King today we don't want to just make it autonomous and unstoppable that's crazy crazy look at that Echo the technology that we're talking about today is necessary but it is not sufficient it is one half of the picture if we're going to align with ourselves and with the technology so this is something that at optimism we've been dealing with for a long time so actually we started out as a non-profit foundation called plasma group plasma was an early precursor to the Roll-Ups and scalability we see today and basically what we did was we created this non-profit we released a bunch of code and Designs out into the world and pushed forward the space of scaling but very quickly it became apparent that the incentives were broken because everyone was going and using our technology and we couldn't raise more money we couldn't hire more people it was incredibly difficult to get by at the same time cookie cutter defy projects and scam artists were having money poured into them poured these are the early signs of the dangerous future we need to avoid so after a year we round down the non-profit and we said you know what we've got to solve this we created the thing known now as optimism it was a public benefit Corporation and our goal was to solve the problems and make it so that we were the last ones to encounter the issues that we had faced as a non-profit so that's optimism after that we got to building again the technology is critical it is very very very important and we spent the last three years building some awesome awesome Tech we've gone through a lot of iterations and what is now known as the op stack which is the core code base that we have is modular it's scalable and we're confident that it will form the basis for scaling in all forms not just optimistic and not just uh roll-up for years to come so it was time to look again to the other part of the story because the technology is only half so earlier this year we launched the optimism Collective okay what is optimism Collective the collective is a band of communities companies and citizens united by a mutually beneficial pact to adhere to the Axiom that the impact to the collective by an individual should equal their profits so you can read more about that here another thing that we did was created a working Constitution so something to imbue what we're trying to get after and we have a few core principles here one of them is governance minimization if you can do something with a mechanism and without more complex complexity you should do that another one is forkability and in particular here I mean Pro forkability there's a difference between calling your code base open source and having the ability to click Fork on GitHub and actually creating systems which are easy to Fork this means we need to build tools that make it possible to Fork optimism as easily as possible this is very very important it's not just about being able to make a copy of the code it's about being able to deploy the exact thing in a new instantiation okay so the world is going down this crazy path what is the optimism Collective really in all that context the optimism Collective is a spaceship built to care Humanity through the singularity I told you this was going to be ridiculous crazy presentation okay I think this is a Perfect Analogy but it's an interesting one you can think about the different components of the spaceship in particularly things like the engines and life support and things like that as the technological aspects the execution the settlement the consensus but there's also a key component to a spaceship which is the navigation and the AI presumably that helps you navigate this ship and that is the governance does anyone recognize this ship in the audience anyone yeah oh yeah of course this is from 2001 A Space Odyssey and of course the AI navigator on that ship the discovery xd1 or something like that was HAL 9000 the most famous AI villain probably of all time and the entire premise of that movie is basically that how goes Rogue and how becomes an autonomous AI that doesn't care about the people on board it only cares about completing its mission so how do we present becomes the question in optimism governance how do we prevent op9000 this is what we need to avoid we have three strategic pillars that we're taking here to try to prevent these outcomes number one is identity humans over Capital we need to give humans in these systems not just a voice but a fundamental ingrained notion of control it must be that the op9000 AI listens to its crew another we have is retroactivity reward after impact if we want to prevent these dangerous Futures that we might be headed towards don't put money into something which might cause the future instead reward once we know that that thing had the outcome that we were looking for don't let things backfire and the third I already talked about is forkability but I just want to stretch it again the optimism code base we'll talk about a minute the op stack should be a one click a bit should have a one-click ability to deploy everything about the optimism system in an entirely new instantiation and I'm not just talking about a chain I'm not just talking about a sequencer I'm talking about the governance the voting the off chain tools which we use things like forums to actually come to consensus on things everything should be able to be forked we need Escape hatches if one optimism may not the one we currently know goes down we should be able to very easily fix that problem and create a new one and get over to it okay so how are we doing this in practice the op stock is the code base it is the blueprints of the spaceship optimism that we are building and like I said that includes not just parts of the chain which my uh my incredible teammates Kelvin and Carl gave some great talks on and I could do a whole another hour talking about how incredible splitting up consensus and execution and settlement and all these things are and how this is going to summon an incredible crazy scalable blockchain future but they've already talked about that so I'm going to talk about the governance go watch their stuff and be a mace so the first thing we're doing with our governance is it is bicameral I love saying that word it sounds very fancy but really it's for something quite simple it just means that optimism has two co-equal houses in its governance this is an example of us borrowing and standing on the shoulders of giants uh it's very simple but it's very clear and it's been very effective something like 40 of the world's governments today are not run by a single entity there are two entities that are co-equal these two houses that need to come together to make decisions keep each other in check so what are the two houses for optimism house number one is the token house like I said before token voting is a very powerful mechanism it has a great track record of extracting profit but left unchecked that's where we've seen the issues so the token house is the plutocratic profit-seeking house of the optimism Collective what does that mean well it means that it sets the parameters and sets the chain up for Success keep the chain healthy the other house is the citizens house the token house is one coin one vote the citizens house is one person one vote and its goal is to distribute the profits that are acquired by the token house how does it do that something called retroactive publicist funding there's our retroactivity again who in the crowd is familiar with this let me say raise some hands for rpgf oh yes the mean is spreading I love it okay I love it although I will say it's important to think about when you're thinking from a mechanism perspective about the retroactive funding as what we're doing here right you can use retroactive funding for other things in public goods it's just that public goods are the most important so in a nutshell what is retro pgf it basically says two things one it is easier to agree on what was good than what will be good this is this retroactivity we talked about earlier and two it doesn't mean that a Dev working on optimism should wait for their code to be merged and like it to be good to be able to pay their paycheck it just means that it's not the collector's responsibility it's the responsibility of the market so the other piece of this is to basically take VCS and free them oh yes so a key piece of this puzzle is that Venture capitalists are very good at predicting what things will succeed and they're very good at what they do the problem is that they are constrained because they need an exit and if you need an exit then you can only invest in things which are going to extract value to provide that exit so rep the point of retroactive funding is to give the VCS an alternative way out and mean that they can invest in things that are just pieces of code that don't take a fee that don't do anything because they will be rewarded in the future so we're going to change the game for those those sneaky VCS okay so that's what we're doing I'll talk a little bit about what is next for optimism and how are we going about implementing these designs I'm talking about here there's a whole lot more I could say about the modular retro pgf and some really cool things we're doing now that is very connected to how we're building the tech on the blockchain side but I think the most important thing to say is that when you're building Rockets you should expect some failures look at that these videos are amazing if you guys haven't watched some of them just truly truly awe-inspiring the reality is to get the spaceship optimism into orbit we're gonna have some crashes and we have built that ethos into the core of what we're doing iterate iterate iterate the governance will self-destruct that forkability that I talked about is built in and expected as we get this thing into orbit the governance will self-destruct we even put that in our constitution the Constitution can be modified for the first four years until we reach a final one and another much more practical thing that we do is we run optimism in seasons so we've had two seasons of governance so far we're going to enter the third very shortly and in each one we take a step back we have something called the reflection period and we look at what's been going well and what's not we fix the things that are not going well we emphasize the things that are going well we run in seasons I'm very excited for season three it's gonna be so good I want to just say here as I close up is that this is not a purely charitable endeavor while we now can see in the distance the end game for blockchain scalability it is going to take a very very long time and a very large number of people to bring us to the technological feature we're talking about here there is countless Innovations countless pieces of code callous improvements that we're going to need to make so it's not just that we want to fund public goods because we're nice it's because we need to create a global Collective of people that are contributing towards this technology no team alone is going to do it no team alone is going to do it so we're focused on the critical technological impact it's not a charity hopefully I convince you at the start that public goods like solving global warming Ubi deforestation is the right place to go but the op stack is the most important public good for us today so last thing I just want to say is like okay this is a big Grand Vision what does it look like for success for us I think that if optimism can build the blueprints for the spaceship prove that these Kinks can fly and create an initial cohort of citizens that are ready for whatever comes next personally I would consider that a success and what we're trying to build at optimism so I'll leave you with that thank you very much thank you so much ben there's still time for some questions maybe someone somebody has a question here yeah we got someone coming around with mics how do you see that governance playing with the other uh Layer Two Community participants so I think that so the question was yeah how do we see governance playing with other layer twos what I hope is that we don't and I I've certainly I think that we can avoid having negative some games right what would be really bad would be if we saw a bunch of layer twos that we're trying to basically pay different people to move one place or another and just doing extremely negative some behavior that doesn't really do anything so I think our goal of the governance should be cooperation and I would also love to see more cooperation like I would love for other uh layer two projects to be retractually funded by optimism for building code that we can use um so I hope that I see it going in a Cooperative Manner and that's certainly a culture that we're trying to imbibe with optimism yeah hero hero question Walker hi Ben I'm Han hi great talk great great enthusiasm and I think we're all learning a lot from your governance thinking um I think I kind of followed the slides but I really got lost on the VC one can you just elaborate on are you trying to disrupt the VC model what's the thinking there yeah so I'm I'll go back to my my red slides let's see here see here so retroactive public goods funding is basically about the collective as prescribing a budget to some thing that it is going to fund in the future retroactively so what's an example of this an example of this is dependencies in the optimism code base right so if someone builds a tool we use that tool in the optimism code base that has a value to us it has an impact on us and it should be rewarded with profit and so the point is once we start using that and once we see that it has an impact we will take that and we will give it money what this means is that a VC can invest in the person building that tool even though that tool is not taking a fee it has no Revenue model it has nothing but the knowledge that it or the hope that it will be funded in the future will allow the VCS to invest in it so I don't know about disruption I think the point is to Leverage What VCS do really well which is predict outcomes and put Financial bets behind that what we want to do is we want to unconstrain those investments from having to go towards things that are profitable because they extract money out instead of extracting money out of some system these projects will receive money from the collective yeah hopefully that helps time for more yes thank you Ben you and optimism are awesome my question is about season three how can one get involved oh get on the Forum get on the Discord start talking I mean look if you are a believer in this vision and a participant in the community you are an optimist and something the whole point of doing these seasons is that we have periods of time called reflection periods where we don't do any votes we don't distribute any Capital we just talk about what went well and what didn't and everything that's going on is out in the public so the best thing you can do is come get involved if you want to sign up to be a delegate and get some people to delegate to you and get some voting power you can even do that but I would say you don't have to do that just come watch what's going on and make suggestions on how we can improve that's how you can get involved yeah thank you so maybe the last one it was over here Okay so um I said it was similar but uh yeah I had a question but it was similar but let me just ask again so I'm one of the projects who wants planning to launch on launching on optimism so just curious how will this model of redirect funding um maybe affect the current model where typically go you apply for Grant after that there's like some potential VC fundraising so would it potentially bring more VCS early because or like maybe you can give example a little bit would be great to understand yeah so it's really interesting there's a lot to be said about how and we're thinking very deeply about how to make retropgf work and work well and the reality is if you want to have people make upfront Investments with an expectation of future return you need to prove a track record of claiming that you're going to give out money and giving out that money and that is not going to be a one and done thing you could take a perfectly working retro pgf mechanism and at Day Zero it might not generate any interest after a year of proving that it does Investments it might generate a lot of interest so effectively one way to interpret that question is how do we scope the kinds of impact that we're going to reward and when so at the beginning we're very focused on the core elements of the op stack which are the technological basis for what we're building and part of that is because we think it's something more manageable it's a community that we're very very well connected to it's something that we think we can take on over time we need to expand that scope of impact and I think one of the fascinating open questions right now is how impact works on the application layer because clearly if you're a project you know a uniswap V1 is a great example of this didn't take any fee was massively important created an explosion of value for ethereum that's the kind of thing that probably should be retroactively funded too so I would say that's a little bit farther off because we need to give a really good track record and we're going to start with that code but as we expand that's going to be one of the most fascinating I think components to how we build out the collective so just like this guy get on the Forum start talking about it we'll figure it out together Amazing Ben thank you so much cool thank you guys a lot of optimism so now we are going to talk about opportunity and Global impact the future is collective with the CEO co-founder of open Collective and chair of democracy Health foundation with Pia Mancini in two minutes [Music] yeah here is Pia let's give her a blouse please thank you foreign ER and CEO at open Collective and I'm thrilled to be here and I'm going to be talking today about Building Bridges between the Legacy and the decentralized ecosystems to fund public goods for the future so here we go we're not going anywhere yes so the tldr if we want to make philanthropy tech for people who are already the winners then we continue like this but if we want to lift people out of poverty and co-design co-create this technology with them then we must Bridge the Legacy system and help people over okay that's what I'm gonna try to argue now so let's start with the thought framework that I use for thinking about where we are in the world right now and my kind of tldr of the thought framework is what you what used to be is no longer fit for our needs but what will be is not here yet so the current system is declining we're seeing a paradigm that is um it's on the way out and we can see maybe far in the future the Paradigm that we want to build but we're not there yet so where we are um this theory is called this framework is called the three Horizons framework and it's super useful for me to figure out the type of technology that we want to build the type of questions that we should be asking ourselves and kind of try to make sense of what's happening in the world today where where are we so these three Horizons framework that was developed by the international Futures forum is now being applied by Daniel Christian wall to the transition towards regenerative culture so let's think about this right the first horizon is the world in crisis is um what's what's on the way out it's the system that it's no longer fit for the type of society the type of Technology the type of education that we have today so this is in Decline and at the same time far far away we have this third Horizon that is the viable world and we are bam Stuck in the Middle where all the messiness is it's called the second Horizon and it's a world in turbulent transition it's not clear what's happening new technologies are opening you up new opportunities but maybe if we're lucky we can identify the signals of the future but the future is not not here yet at least it's not here for everyone right so what happens with innovation in each of these Horizons the first horizon the type of information that we want that we can do is sustaining technology essentially building stuff to maintain the status quo business as usual right let's keep the lights on things like that the second horizon or the type of innovation that we see in the second Horizon where we are today is called disruptive innovation this means that we are seeing opportunities we are seeing kind of shift happening we are taking advantage of those changes and we're building um we're building technology that is kind of redefining the scope of what's possible the issue that we have here and is what I'm trying to argue today is that the type of disruptive technology unless we're very careful in how we build it and with whom we build it we're going to end up sustaining the life of the previous Horizon of the of the existing Paradigm because if we we the risk that we face is to build technology that is just for the winners of the previous Paradigm those who are already winning right but when we go to the viable world the world we want to build the type of innovation that we can see is transformative Innovation it's Innovation that is really building a new paradigm and that means redistributing power that means changing who's who are the winners and who are marginalized who are the losers in the in the political economy right so what I want to argue here is that web 3 and this space needs to start thinking about the type of technology that we we are building oriented towards this viable World it needs to be informed by a long-term perspective so we don't fall in the Trap of building Innovation that looks great but it's sustaining what we have today okay so you know just to land it with a meme old ways the future we want and how do we build that bridge right because when a paradigm declines and another one is arising it's not a clear cut it's not like oh this is going to disappear and then something else is going to emerge it doesn't happen like that we need to build Bridges we need to build bring people over okay so in my mind open Collective is or can be one of those bridges so we've been sustaining decentralized communities since 2016. and we've been doing it off chain before Dallas were a thing what are we at the core we are um legal admin and financial infrastructure for decentralized communities to unlock access to money we give a platform to organize and fundraise under Global Network of legal entities that act as custodians of the funds I'll go into this a little bit deeper but those legal entities are connected to the Legacy system so that is the bridge that we're building so we created this open source transparent finances platform and we have a network of 245 non-profits around the world that help communities have access to money that otherwise they wouldn't be able to access so the tech platform gives them fundraising tooling it's open source transparent payments um it's you know it's an International Community but like really the secret sauce is in this combination of the platform plus this network of fiscal hosts the fiscal hosts give things provide things to these communities that these individuals need and what I'm arguing here is that if we want to bring those who today are marginalized by the current system over to the new system we need to give them what they need today to survive and sustain themselves and this is is boring right it's like trust me I I do this every day it's like not fun right proof of income employment and benefits reporting compliance tax deductible receipts right you want to make a donation to a collective we're giving you a tax reactable receipts right we are you need employment you have a collective that has funding we employ you um okay so how you know did we start it all started with this need that we saw in the world back when we started open collective in 2015 to fund open source projects open source projects are the building blocks of the um economy today there is no company out there that is not using open source projects but funding open source is very very difficult I really like this quote that I read recently the original ethos of the web is a desire not only to idly exist within the world but also to take part in its Collective creation right and I think that the few things that have embodied this idea as the open source ecosystem so we want more open source but we need to fund open source Because unless we fund it guess what the only ones who are going to be able to contribute to open source are those who have free time who are able to have the time to to spend in open source who are privileged enough to be able to participate in open source without being compensated okay so why is it so freaking hard to fund the open source ecosystem because of the attributes of Open Source it's a non-excludable public public good it means that it's not scarce and there is no marginal cost for another person to use the cost right there is no cost for a user to use open source so it's very difficult to create scarcity here and so but open source is not free right it's not free as enough freebie here someone else paid for it and the person's paying for it are the maintainers that are spending time building these technologies that we are all using um and for us we were seeing this huge Community imbalance at the core of the open source ecosystem and we wanted to step there and make a difference so posting an issue has zero cost right you have a company and startup you're using open source something is not working for you you go on GitHub on a freaking run and start asking the maintainer so the dependency to fix it for you and you have no cost what like you spend five minutes posting a toxic issue on GitHub fun companies are hooked on open source everyone is using open source because it doesn't have a cost more people are extracting value from an open source project than those who are maintaining it right so those who are creating open source technology are not extracting the value of what they're creating shared code but not share responsibility and it's easy to start a project but it's very difficult to live it right once you start a project you have six million applications using your dependency well you just have to maintain it what are you gonna do right so this is how um so we started thinking okay how can we move money from all of these companies to the hands of these decentralized communities that are not organized around anything and then pain point that we see is that in the open source World formal contracts and Partnerships agreements do not happen like they do in the business world right so Google wants to give money to the chromium Frameworks ecosystem and they're like okay can I get an invoice for my you know donation and the developers are like we are just a group of people doing code right we want to get paid but we have no formal way of doing it so that's where open Collective stepped in I really like this quote from Swift on security and if you follow them on Twitter but like they're amazing I'm convinced that many developers have no freaking idea how business actually works and what operations departments have to go through to make things happen enrolling a new vendor it's more than difficult it's demoralizing it eats your soul make it easy and you're a God I don't know if we are Gods but we're definitely making this easier for them so this is what we created open Collective is like this digital interface that connects decentralized communities to to existing legal entities that deal with the clunky and old operating systems that are states and tax departments and you know all that boring jazz and yes open Collective and the non-profits go through the vendors process and I I kid you not it looks like this or worse it's sap right anyway 3343 open source projects are hosted by us we've um given 30 million dollars in Project directed funding and this is Project directed funding we'll just keep putting money in the hands of these communities but we are now funding with this model multiple public goods Commons graduates Grassroots communities um social and political movements so we have we moved from just open source that was the beginning and we've exploded to thousands of different communities in the impact in the solidarity economy the climate Justice Global movements civic participation we have 15 000 communities Now using open source um the open Collective and we've given you know we've transferred 65 million into the hands of these communities and we're not asking for anything in return like we're not opinionated about how communities spend their money they know what to do we're just moving money from the center to the fringes and our approach to sustainability has to do with Grassroots cultures of governance and Tech I think this is this is very important for me to kind of communicate we've learned at ton from how Grassroots organizers are operating and when I've seen so many talks today and the last couple of days about governance and doubts and dramas and this and that and I'm serious like this is like happening it's been happening for decades in the Grassroots organizing movements they have a lot of really good Solutions some processes and ideas and what I want to do here is connect these two worlds so for the way I Define sustainability refers to the resilience and thriving of projects communities and individuals that's around them right it's everything it's not just the community or the token holders that are maybe addresses right I'm talking about humans here about individuals um and communities started compensating themselves right obviously they're raising money but they're also spending money so in the last 12 months we pay 23 million 23 million dollars in payments to 100 thousands of um community members around the world they're getting uh they're submitting invoices they're getting 10.99s which is the tax form in the United States they're getting proof of income they can prove to their landlord that they have a pay stub right we are helping them be a circle in a world that is made for triangles Okay so what can we Bridge um with the Legacy system to make decentralized Community sustainable so in my mind web3 is operating kind of a little bit isolated from the Legacy world because a lot of these things are still missing and I think that it's time to start making those connections the acceptability for donors in over 30 countries right that is something that we can provide and we can support like all of the amazing decentralized philanthropy Tech do invoices pay stubs insurance benefits employment I mean I get it it's like it's not sexy it's not high tech but you know what the people that we are supposed to be helping need these things today right the marginalized of the previous Paradigm they're very much embedded in the Legacy system right so we need to provide the tooling the the support the infrastructure they need to bring them over okay what is the trade-off because there's always a trade-off otherwise I'll be lying to you and I'm not the trade-off is that there's a power Dynamic that happens between the collectives the communities and the platform and the existing legal entities that give them like a bank account and all of these services this is true this doesn't happen in this December in the web 3 ecosystem this type of power dynamics don't exist I think it's a cost worth paying today as long as we are building enough um as long as we're building what we're building with the capacity to change as the conditions change in the future so we want to build resilient Tech as well and we're here to offer a bridge from Legacy system to the house right to co-create and co-design philanthropy Tech with Grassroots culture and load Tech Solutions again folks if we are not inviting those who are marginalized by the current system those who are not the winners today to co-create and Core Design Technology with us we are just building stuff that looks amazing but it's only going to sustain um the the the existing Paradigm is not going to be transformative um innovation so like a fear I preach for those I don't know why my design team lets me do these things but you know sorry but you get the idea and it's happening already right over climate is a really good example over climate is a non-profit on the open Collective network is a host but it's also a tao so what they offer is a legal entity for those and Grassroots initiatives which are also those but they're just off chain right and so over climate is used to breed Grassroots citizens with old school foundations and it's used to bridge those same citizens with the web 3 ecosystem it's about coordinating those bridges between the two paradigms another example is the work we did with my good friend Kevin owaki a couple of years ago or maybe it was last year who knows pandemic I know um fando assessed we wanted to try quadratic funding in the web to open source ecosystem so we did one example we did one experiment and I think we're gonna keep doing this because like web3 is this amazing tool for creating sandboxes of innovation iterating on governance and doing some radical experimentation some of which we can bring to the web tool world um another example is I was talking very recently with a radical team and so maybe some of the radical developers or the developers that are on radical when they need to get funding from an entity in the Legacy world we can create a fund for radical in open open Collective and so we can offer both things you want to get paid in tokens amazing but you need employment you need pay stubs you need invoices we got you right now pay attention here please democratizing is not about um just opening access right it's about Open Access and shared and participatory governance right it's about both things right um and so open Collective Inc the platform part of the equation is a company in Delaware of all places sorry we have investors and you know cap table Etc so but what what we want to do what we're creating is infrastructure for the common so what we want to do is to transfer ownership of open Collective to the commons so we're doing an e2c but it's not a token ic2c is like an exit to community done with a trust so we're building a a Perpetual purpose trust that is going to purchase and own the shares of open collective in the name of the community and then on top of that we're going to build like governance structure with the community now the governance piece might have a dial eventually because we are very Global and it's quite difficult to do um to organize this governance when you are like in one country but it's not clear to us yet how we're going to organize this but this is this is our approach what we learned through all of these years of managing helping working with decentralized Technologies is that the challenges that we have they did not change with technology they're the same right participation is hard and today I saw this incredible talk earlier today by Chandler I didn't catch his last name but he was talking about why the Dao experience suck and most of it has to do with participation wanes over time right first you have this burst of participation but then it's very difficult to keep folks engaged and that it's not it's not that it only happens it happens everywhere right so the challenge is that we all face are human they're cultural they're not technological so please pay attention again this is the last time Democratic culture is Upstream of democratic institutions folks if you don't figure out your Democratic culture first you are not going to have good governance in your dial right it's just not gonna happen and so for open collectives e2c for example the exit part is the last step in the process right you first we are starting this learning in public we're engaging with the community we're bringing them into the design of the thing of the structure of whatever is going to be built but we are co-creating doing it co-designing it with them because we don't want to be like a referendum right what happens with a referendum politicians can't you know figure it out they throw the decision over to the people they call it democracy and then they they boil it down to a narrow binary should we stay or should we go right we don't want to get to the you know to the exit moment and then tell our community go govern the thing you know that's not how it works we need to you know to learn with people how to participate how to engage um okay we need to something we need to build this kind of radical narratives together about what we're doing what we're doing but we need to do it with those who are not the winners of the current system sorry like I know I sound like a broken record but unless we do that like why are we here you know to do disruptive innovation sure but that's not going to bring us the world that we want to see so do not sleep on culture if culture and Humanity get away from you then there's no consensus mechanism that is going to solve a save your community specifically do not forget of Some Humans those who can more easily see the pitfalls in the technology that we're building right so those who are not the winners in the current project time are the ones who can see and spot the biases more easily right because they have no vested interest in maintaining the current narrative and so please have a have a conversation have an honest conversation about what the negative externalities are of what you are building today and how you are going to absorb internalize those externalities what are your biases right who's who are you talking to that is able to poke holes on your narrative the people closest to a pain must be the people closest to a solution the last thing I want to see is a bunch of broken dials or dolls with no communities in the base case you know in the best case or just that we continue building a bunch of profitable opportunities for the winners of the current system that have all the interest and all the incentive to keep the political economy and systems in place that made them winners in the first place right okay I think I've repeated myself enough so what are we doing here what do we do at open Collective and I think that these are good learning experiences for everyone who's building dials or who's building projects in this space what are we doing it to Foster Democratic culture remember Democratic culture is Upstream of democratic institutions right so artists organizer fellows we have a fellowship for artists who are helping us build build these radical narratives we're learning in public we have the solidarity School P2P learning context setting context setting is key for everyone to be able to act right we need to have this because it's an co-creation whistleblower policies do you have we supplier policies in your project are you thinking of an ethical framework in your project do you have conflict resolution are you interested in learning conflict resolution anyway please think about these things um so to recap Democratic culture is Upstream of democratic institutions sustainability is about communities and individuals we are in a transition Horizon so it's messy it's ugly but we need to be informed by long-terms perspective we need to be balanced and provide opportunities to bridge the systems folks we're at the same time you know caregivers in the previous Paradigm and midwives of the new one right we need to be balanced we can't just say we're building here we don't care about like the old Paradigm because there are a lot of people in the old Paradigm that we need to work with and bring people over right so a be balanced governance is hard is hard for everyone build more sandboxes I mean the web 3 has provided a wealth of interesting experimentation to me it's fascinating and I want to kind of encourage more of that but please do it with those who are not on code today do not understand your attack um and be radically honest about the negative externalities right that is it my friends let's talk I'm all of that thank you [Applause] thank you so much Pia for uh for all your work and your amazing presentation so yeah let's keep building and support public goods yeah and I think there's time for one question I see one there yep thank you so much Pierre I'm Joyce um to know more about your thoughts on using incentives when building the Democratic culture a lot of style communities today would incentivize people for engagement and participation do you think that this is a healthy practice and or if this actually acting against the build up of that culture itself thank you I think it's a really good question I think it can work in certain um Frameworks but the kind of paid to participate tends to have a very short life right because once you get those initial tokens then your incentives to participate are are low and so that they weigh in time right and so you start being on like the the outside of a project but you still have those tokens that wait and you can really you know you're not really contributing but you are a part owner so I'm not a fan of that but I think in certain like smaller communities it can work well because it provides ownership and Equity of those communities but when you start growing and scaling those communities that type of in incentives I think that it tends to ruin the community yeah perfect thank you so much thank you and in one minute we have Diva Awards so don't miss out one minute [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] so now we have a very cool moment because we are going to recognize and celebrate all the great work done by the community so this is Diva Awards with Akil Muhammad when the ethereum foundation so go ahead [Music] Michael [Music] [Music] how are you guys feeling it's been uh been quite the week uh hopefully you guys saw the passion and the love that has gone into the event it's been quite a few years until we've had the opportunity to get together and really celebrate as a family as a reunion of all the work that's been done in the ecosystem over the past few years we did have somewhat of a middle ground with devconnect and a lot of people were not able to join because of travel restrictions and so forth so it's really good to have the community come together celebrate learn together and really appreciate all the work that has been been done in the past few years so the diva Awards kind of came together as a replacement for the ux awards that used to happen over the past few years in Defcon uh shout out to Amy she kind of used to organize these ux awards that would highlight all the ux projects that would be nominated and submitted and there will be judges and so forth and as the ecosystem has developed and grown it just meant that those Awards wouldn't really be very impartial and be very difficult to judge those projects in any cohesive manner so we've decided to just kind of lean into the fun side of things and just appreciate all the work that's been done over the past few years and just say thank you to certain projects that we felt were core to the community and also encourage the other projects to kind of work in that direction so it is it is a a lot of hard work that goes into these projects they don't see success they stick to their guts and they keep continuing forward we don't want this to be something serious it's just fun one and it's just supposed to signal to the communicate the community that we appreciate their amazing work so there's a few of our categories uh that we would like to highlight the first one is the Trojan unicorn award so this is basically a project that kind of broke through to the mainstream and did not lose its core values within the ecosystem the next one is a ethereum Educators award so ethereum education or education onboarding for web3 is one of the biggest challenges and projects that are working on this are quite imperative to the success of the ecosystem as a whole and we'd like to encourage more projects to be kind of involved in this ecosystem as well and then the most important is The Cypher Punk award so there's a lot of issues and concerns around the the core values of the Webster ecosystem and we want to keep sure that there's projects that are working on privacy that are working on census super resistance and that they get highlighted in some Manner and that we keep encouraging people to kind of keep that core of web3 close to their heart and the last one is you all really thought we wouldn't award this is a project that was delayed and delayed and delayed and this beat expectations of not ever shipping so we'll start with the Trojan unicorn award as I mentioned this is supposed to Signal the project that has the largest impact on bringing Mass adoption to the ecosystem and not really letting go of their core values that are close to the ecosystem and really breaking through so the nominees are pull out open c e and s and uniswap so all these projects have had quite a few moments as far as their break over success you might have seen everyone in every event that we went to using Pro apps even at Defcon everyone's just taking that opportunity to scan each other open C regardless of how other people in the ecosystem feel was one of the biggest breakouts over the past few years as far as getting normies or people no coiners to encourage and engage with our technology ens so coming from a very small team that was working on this core technology for x amount of years six years just sitting in a get a channel then a key base Etc to see that every celebrity in the whole world was now having a name attached to them was amazing even swap the amount of different ecosystems that kind of branched out from that organization and how many people were engaged with D5 and trading was amazing to see so please put your hand together for the winner ens I'd love to welcome Nick and the ens team to come up on stage and accept their award and tell us a little bit about ens congratulations thank you so much thank you this is amazing it's uh yeah yeah thank you anyone anyone from the team please come up and and show them show everyone um Alex what are you doing come up here um so it's been five six years since we started ens it started off as a part-time project in the ethereum foundation at rapidly expanded to consume all my time uh the EF made the very wise decision that we should graduate to our own project uh gave us very generous funding to get started and even so it's been a long road to get here but if you saw my talk the other day we've had wild success in terms of uh the the popularity and the adoption and more importantly the the usability uh improvements that's allowed to the point where I think everyone just assumes ens is everywhere which has always been our goal um and so yeah I'm absolutely delighted to get this I couldn't be happier thank you so much thank you can exit this thank you very much so the next category is education and developer onboarding so as we start to scale our ecosystem we need to make sure that people are that are coming into the ecosystem understand what the technology is meant to do what they should be aware of when what David should be focusing on and as we get into different ecosystems and come to Bogota come to different regions we understand that our understanding of ethereum and the webto ecosystem is drastically different for people who could actually benefit from the technology and there's a lot of work that needs to be done as far as language as far as people understanding the core technology people understanding what they should be doing what they shouldn't be doing and we really need to as a community come together and make sure these resources are put together in a way that is understandable is accessible and it's friendly and able for any individual to kind of get onboarded and attract the right type of individuals who aren't motivated by the wrong incentives so the nominees for the ethereum Educators awards are ethereum.org hard hat remix and speedrun ethereum so as mentioned a lot of this work has been done around creating developer resources making sure that onboarding and resources are available for people to get involved make sure they're testing things and then also make it playful and fun and the winner for this category is speed run ethereum so Austin can be here but the build Guild is here to accept the award as a core team and they've done an amazing job making sure that getting onboarded to the developer ecosystem is fun playful and easy to understand so thank you um yeah I wish Austin was here I know he would have done a better talk than what I'm going to be doing yeah yeah but it's been great to be part of the build Guild and work with developer onboarding and yeah I'm gonna keep it short but basically our message is always to go to speedrun ethereum.com if you're a developer or if you know developers to tell them to go there and yeah that structure came together and what yeah for sure so basically Austin created a starter kit called scaffold eat and this is basically a decentralized application starter kit where you have different components involved and after you kind of get the basis of okay like how do I create a starter kit application on ethereum then you can go to speedrun ethereum.com which walks you through a set of challenges which are a bit more advanced like you go from building your staking application multi-sig and kind of like get the sense of how you create applications and yeah and then come and join build Guild so we're the build Guild which is the group on top of speedrun ethereum [Applause] all right the next category is The Cypher Punk award and I think as different individuals coming to the ecosystem the core values of people coming in and working on the technology changes time to time and it's important that individuals that are working on this core technology for privacy preserving censorship resistance and making sure that we have complete ownership of our data are highlighted unfortunately due to legal reasons and us not wanting to dock some of these projects or the individuals that would be coming on stage we just want to kind of highlight all the individuals and the communities and projects that have been working on this stuff and will hopefully be able to encourage you and encourage the people that are sitting in this room to continue some of this work but it's very because it was very important and we're very very aware that it's under attack by different forces whether it's government agencies whether it's different organizations Etc so I would encourage everyone to make sure if you do or if you are aware of these projects to appreciate them and whether you send them messages or you utilize their products make sure that they feel appreciated and then that that were hoping and we're wishing for their success in some capacity so thanks to every project that's working on any type of zero knowledge proofs or anything that preserves our privacy our data security and anything to do with moving this ecosystem forward towards the ethos that we believe in so I would hope for you guys everyone to kind of join in and appreciate anyone that's been working on this technology as a whole [Applause] and then the last category is basically you already thought we would an award so this is basically a project that the ecosystem has been waiting for for a long time and time and time again it gets delayed people don't expect it to come together uh people hope it doesn't come together from different ecosystems and the story goes on and on and on and on and the nominees are serenity ethereum proof of stake ethereum 2.0 the merge the docking and the winners are the merge so I'd like to welcome Tim Trent and Danny on stage if they're all in the room I appreciate it [Applause] I guess the whole GTD wasn't able to make it on stage no it's coming we're going to hit it soon cool I just got here the people say stuff it's been a long time coming you know uh yeah so first of all this is T T and D um ctd has arrived but the uh the tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny subset of the effort that went in here so um there might be more in the audience and they're certainly having intense technical conversations all throughout this venue about the next stuff um and I always thought it would happen I I know there's some haters out there but I I had no doubt you know ethereum was going to transition to proof of stakes so it's just a matter of time and the time has come so thank you any other uh yeah no no thanks all the client teams researchers um I gave a whole talk about this on the opening day so everyone mentioned that talk another thank you um and thanks for the prize that's really neat yeah so as mentioned all the nominees for these award categories were sourced by the community over 2000 different unique nominations are provided and hopefully this was just a fun activity for us to lead into the closing ceremonies which will hopefully start within 10 minutes so tell your friends sees are going to be limited we're going to have amazing talks amazing activities followed by our parade so stay tuned and hope to see you guys soon thank you for coming and enjoy your day thank you foreign never find nothing foreign we've been to this a million times but it's never really over to finally [Music] [Music] I wanna just wanna feel free foreign foreign foreign [Music] you could have been together [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] hear me hear me [Music] I will be foreign [Music] hear it for you this is not alone [Music] I don't know why [Music] thank you foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign we are back and we are going to have an amazing musical here with Ben Jones music Jamboree with weird eth and Friends one two test one two what's going on y'all how's your staff con e okay so hello there my name is Ben I work on a project called optimism oh there we go that's what I'm looking for and I'm here to embarrass myself um in front of you all with a couple of songs does that sound good yeah okay so I go by the stage name that's not the instrument I was expecting in a world where cryptocurrency doesn't help Humanity okay what's going on there [Music] okay we're gonna restart the keyboard and we'll get our piano sound back oh well I hope you all had a wonderful Devcon how about a round of applause for the ethereum foundation and all the incredible organizers [Music] some good stuff y'all see it's my laptop doing this okay we're gonna give it one more try one more heart have you tried turning it on off and back on again there we go whoa oh I've got some help but my help needs help I think I got it [Music] okay so I'm just going to perform a couple of very poorly uh executed but funny crypto parody songs you all ready oh welcome to a theory I'm gonna have a look around to any coin that brain of yours can think of can be found we've got mountains of contracts some better some worse if none of them are in interest for you you'd be the first welcome to ethereum come and make a tweet are you in it for the attack or just to shill your bags let's head straight to mainnet this isn't a test just hit the play and the Apes do the rest welcome to a theory I'mma want what you prefer would you like to buy some stable coins or stake all your ether be lending be loading or make nfts we've got a million different ways to pay fees welcome to ethereum Yuma put your tips aside you don't have to pay the miners eip1559 we've got farmers and Arbors and a thing called Ice Age there's like a million different ways to exchange welcome to ethereum don't you get too small to cause that hand on a must founder might decide to pull the red now it's dropping he's selling like he never cared don't act surprise he said it's buyer beware contract call Robert if you were sure the price won't slip to stay up late the market cap keeps falling thought you bought the dip send transactions pay for a gas and go to sleep and miss the action read about account abstraction don't forget minor value extraction this is not trading advice mortgage both your homes crypto doesn't have under collateralized loans should you provide liquidity take this quirky quiz metallic remind all these to feed Hearts to your kids can I interest you in finance that's not nine to five a little bit of Finance that's decentralized dumping is a tragedy and pumping is a crime Wall Street but transparent standard decentralized [Music] okay so you might have seen that on my Twitter before we're gonna try one more that I have not debuted at least not on my Twitter and uh it's about a man that's very near and dear to all of our hearts Mr vitalik Buddha okay so let's get up maybe we can get some audience engagement if I can uh if I can manage to keep us afloat here so there's two parts of this song so in one part it goes and you clapped there okay so if you hear that clap along and then there's another part that's [Music] and give this clap I don't know we'll see how it works oh pardon my French are you all ready here we go [Music] it was born a brilliant man in Russia long ago he dropped out of school with that perfect 4.0 he took an interest in cryptocurrency so he co-founded Bitcoin magazine he got bored inflation and Bitcoin it had a one-track mind he realized the entire applications couldn't be centralized very first ethereum satoshi's Vision just couldn't complete cause he did a brand new that these State transitions should really just be turning complete [Music] paper showed it to his dad who by the way is another total chat at Bitcoin Miami there was great interest in pre-purchases [Music] as when he destroyed Dr Craig Wright it was impossible for everyone to please all the haters said this loses way too much energy metallic said okay your arguments all break so he turned his eye towards solving proof mistake all the time the haters they would argue it was an impossibility but with some help he found a new solution a weak subjectivity [Music] began to converge had just done it again and then we got the hammer 's [Music] all right that's all I got on we got 37 seconds left thank you all so much have a great optimism I have a great optimism have a great optimism and a great Defcon have a good night everyone awesome awesome awesome absolutely incredible van let's give another round of applause for Ben nice job nice job man super okay what better segue into our closing ceremonies than Ben's beautiful voice I'm not really sure there is one uh so we're gonna kick off our closing ceremonies we're gonna kick it off for the talk and to enter that talk a little bit it's important to remember that ethereum ethereum is not just a technology it's a community it's a movement and within those movements within this community we have values and one of those values is the importance of civil liberties civil rights and protecting those and for that I would like to introduce Kurt opsahl from the Electronic Frontier Foundation the deputy executive director and general counsel so big round of applause to Kurt opsel VES ah thank you everybody thank you coach so great to see so many people here today I've had a great time here at Devcon and I'm excited to talk at the closing ceremonies talking about some of the value of cryptocurrencies in supporting human rights these civil liberties privacy free expression these rights that this whole Community holds dear a little bit uh there we go oop back sorry about that so a little bit about the Electronic Frontier Foundation we are a non-profit organization that has been around since 1990 fighting to preserve your rights online fighting for free expression for privacy for Innovation trying to make a world that we would want to live in to make sure that the dystopia is that are possible won't happen the Sci-Fi we read is not going to be necessarily the future unless it's the cool sci-fi with the Utopias all right so let's talk about how we as a community can be supporting rights and Liberty there are a number of ways that cryptocurrencies can help support these rights and I'm going to talk about a few of them today because we only have a few minutes but decentralized Financial options can allow and support political social moral views can provide more options by taking away some of the centralized choke points which are often used as a point of failure a point where control can be put onto a system and impose uh push back on unfavored or disfavored viewpoints ideologies so one of these Financial censorship this is when a centralized Financial Service is under pressure from political regimes from uh social movements to saying that something that may be lawful that maybe uh you know within the bounds of what the law has said Society can have but it goes outside of their code of conduct or their review or just as subject to pressure and they forbid lawful activities another one which I know is very important to this community is the protection of privacy and I think we'd try to explore that a little bit what do we mean by protecting private what is it doing privacy of course has its own value but it's also fundamental for protecting other rights other rights that we hold the air like freedom of expression freedom of Association and making sure that that your information is protected by due process that governments can't get access to the information without going through the appropriate stats necessary and proportionate steps to ensure that there's not government overreach and another way that we can help doing this is enabling the decentralized web moving away from chunkpoint to have other options that people can choose enable competition and allow it so that there's not a single point of failure that will enable people to choose things that reflect their values and allow for their values so let's dive a little bit deeper into this avoiding Central Financial censorship one of the ways that this first came to my attention was 2010 with Wikileaks where Wikileaks had engaged in uh publishing some material about the Iraq war that uh upset a lot of people in the U.S government and they put a lot of pressure on MasterCard Visa PayPal the sources of donations for Wikileaks how are you allowing These funds to go to this organization this wasn't a legal plan they didn't pass a law to say that money could not go they just effectively made it extraordinarily difficult for people to fund Wikileaks and one of the ways that Wikileaks was able to get around that was by accepting Bitcoin accepting cryptocurrency as a form of donation because it didn't go through those mechanisms and this is an effective form of censorship or Can Be an Effective form of censorship because these financial institutions are necessary for most people to be able to complete transactions but it can have serious ramifications for free expression by taking away the funding that an organization needs in order to put his expression out there in the world they rely these organizations rely upon financial institutions in order to enable their sites their operations so how does this affect people this comes up in a number of ways you know membership and organizations you often reflect your values by joining an organization eff is one there's the ACLU NAACP the NRA there are many organizations around the world where people band together to reflect their values and they want to join become members and show their financial support but if those organizations are cut off from the financial system it can be harmful to the organizations and make it difficult for people to band together use their right of Association to express their uh the right of expression also it's reflected in media that you purchase they buy supporting artists video artists podcasters book writers who are giving you the information that one you want to read you have a right to read and as part of your right of uh free expression and this is also essential for free expression so you can see the ideas see the discourse and participate it by consuming media but if you can't get access to that because of a financial censorship then that cuts you off and inhibits both the freedom of expression of the site that you're going to the publisher and your own freedom of expression by using your right to read and get these ideas and information and it persists to this day uh you know I pointed out you know saw this with Wikileaks but it continues persist often it comes up in the context of erotic material which is lawful but disfavored and it gets cut off by some of the major uh choke points in financial transactions and these would be things that if under U.S law and a lot of international principles of free expression it would be unconstitutional to say these things are not allowed they are constitutionally permitted to exist but by putting pressure outside of the legislative system outside of that process they can cut off funding and make it more difficult for those things to survive and the internet if it's going to achieve its future as a global forum of expression as a way for people to exchange ideas we cannot deputize intermediaries to become the morality police and go outside of the legislative process go outside of the policy process circumvent that and have a private entity become the morality police now also protecting privacy Pro and if I take a moment here why do we care about privacy what is it doing to do there's a number of ways of looking at it there's a Louis Brandeis quote I put up here on the on the slides that I think capsules are very well the right to be left alone to know your business it's my business just leave me alone and allow me to do my thing that is a core autonomy aspect of the right to privacy but it's also control over the flow of your information that whether you give information you know what consents have you given have you consented to give it to one person but then they're going to give it to another where does that go and having some ability to have like I want this information about me to be available to my friends to my family another set of information I want to make available to colleagues a third set to the public but having some control over that flow of information can help bring about a a way you can express yourself and keep the things you want private to be private and also privacy today making your information confidential today it's a protection against dystopian future a future in which what was normal what was okay was not something that you felt uh endangered about for getting out there in the public today the rules might change a new government comes into power and what was previously no big deal now is a big deal by maintaining your privacy today you're providing a protection against a change in the environment where things that you thought were okay are no longer and these are sort of one a former board member of my organization once for this protection against the robots from the future who will be able to look back datamine all the information from your past activities see what you were up to and judge it by then the future standards but if you have that information privacy protected you yourself are protected foreign privacy is fundamental to lots of other rights and we're looking in this case Financial transactions in particular they can reveal deeply personal things like we said this is the this is the mirror image of the expression issue we hit before so Financial censorship was preventing organizational organizations from receiving the funds to have your membership but also your transaction reveals something about you it affects your private information by giving money to that organization just as the the supporting an organization or a media producer by by purchasing their product helps them it also reveals something about you about your interests uh your your ideas that you are consuming uh your medical expenses can reveal a lot about your conditions that you might want to keep private and we also live in an era where some medical uh information can be disfavored some Medical Treatments are politically or socially disfavored and the information that you're using your financial means to purchase these Services can be used against you and use it in prosecution shopping history shows a lot of what your interests are and often is used to make inferences about these interests what you're going to do what what intent do you have now anonymity can provide a lot of protection we're able to do things in an anonymous manner it protects against the tyranny of the majority that allows for views which are not a majority of you not a popular view but you can have them and have protection from retribution for having these views by having anonymity or pseudonymity allowing you to operate in the space without having to reveal critical information about your identity foreign so this comes a little bit of a challenge and one of the things I want to focus on here uh is when you have a public Ledger and the public Ledger is a list of a lot of transactions and yeah they go into to a wallet and if you never connect that wallet in any public way with your identity that might be a form of protection but not everybody is able to do that most people will be using a service or at some point we'll use a service that ties their identity to their wallet and if you ever do your whole history of transactions becomes revealed this is a a challenge and then with that Revelation all your shopping history your interests and such also become revealed and this is a it's a challenging thing to have a situation in which you might be able to use anonymity but if you make a mistake you could have a whole history revealed you know more sophisticated people can do things like have multiple wallets use them for very purpose but you still need to have a uh high level of sophistication and accuracy to do it well so one solution to this which has come up a lot at least so I want to hit on it exactly mixers and in particular tornado cash amen thank you they tornado I'm sure many of you are familiar so I'll just go over very briefly what had happened back in August the uh Office of Financial assets control of fact are part of the Department of Treasury they placed tornado cash on the specially designated Nationals list and they they put a number of wallet addresses and so on but they also put you know tornado cash by name on there and they had a parenthetical AKA tornado cash classic AKA tornado cash Nova and this was on the list and this struck everybody as kind of weird because this is a you know piece of software it is a smart contract on the blockchain there's also a dow associated with it there is you know the open source project but what do they really mean by tornado cash because this list is usually for entities it can also be about property if you look at the list you'll see some like oligarch boats that are on there but on the whole it is designed and and built up to be about entities particular people and they're listing tornado cash without any further definition was it was vague perhaps deliberately vague uh so this led to some consequences one of the most immediate consequences was that GitHub which had hosted the canonical tornado cache Repository took it down uh they also took down the accounts of three of the primary uh Developers and this really uh hit home for eff because code being speech is one of the core things that we've been fighting for we've been fighting for this since the since the 90s coming up in the encryption Wars uh and this was code being taken down uh for well putting on a sanction list not even with a law about it but just placed on this list perhaps even mistakenly perhaps they didn't mean the code itself though if you'll notice in the way they defined it they akas are not easily confused like Katrina cashinova was a beta that they had issued it's not easily confused with an entity now I I tend to think that it's more likely that this was they had no idea what they were doing more than you know uh malice or at least malice in the sense that uh they intended to take it down but they still had no idea what they're doing Secretary of State blinken tweeted out right after the uh ofac listing saying that they had gone after the the North Koreans and and taken them down reflecting a very strong misunderstanding of what tornado cash was that tweet was deleted very shortly thereafter but it might be a clue into some of the confusion that they had but nevertheless it was on the list so one of the things that we did was to uh we represent Professor Matt Greene he's a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins has been involved in uh zcash and zero knowledge proof and he also teaches about the blockchain and he wanted to use tornado cash as part of his teaching but he also wanted to put it back up there in part to show that you can put it up there you do have a right to it so we agreed to represent him in this he made a fork he put it up back up uh and OPEC well didn't do anything about this and this helped show people that the code could still be published and that yes and I believe that both GitHub had the right to do it and Professor Green had the right to do GitHub is a private entity as a private entity can choose what is on its platform but they had the right to keep it up and they're at the right to keep up Professor Green's copy which they have been doing but there still are a number of unanswered questions so why why do we care about this well I'm sure you all care about this but I think it's good to say what are the principles behind the code of speech issue so cryptocurrencies blockchain Technologies they're expressed in code and you always were saying this is part of a community community that has values you are expressing those values in the code that you write that code has both function and expression but function is a part of this expression when you're making something which is a privacy enhancing technology you're expressing this through the source code saying how it works that has a very clear expression but also having it be functional is part of what you're trying to express and part of that speech recognizing code of speeches I was mentioning we've been fighting this since the the 1990s uh it came up in the encryption context in the first instance and in the export control contacts was very similar to the sanction context it was a program called snuffle open source encryption program during that time there were expert controls because encryption was being treated like a munition it was something that was a military technology it was a dual use technology but as a dual use technology you had to get permission to export it and there was a silly time period where Netscape Navigator The prominent web browser of that day had an international version and a domestic version and the domestic version had much stronger encryption than the international version with the idea that now the NSA can more easily break the communications of the International Version and uh that you know make their job easier it was ridiculous because it was trivial for someone to get a copy of the domestic version outside of the United States it wasn't very effective but also it was interfering with the free expression of you know the cypherpunks who wanted to have a world which had lots of cryptography in it and expressed that by making freely available code so we had support the first case Bernstein versus the United States recognized the code was a kind of language they likened it to uh German French like you know human languages but also music as a form of a language music isn't done in notation it's much for closer mathematically to code and it is a way of expressing such and established that the source code that was put up by Dan Bernstein was speech uh later there's a case younger versus daily that another point which I think is very critical recognizing that the fact that it coursework is not just speech it's not just a poem but it is a functionality it can be compiled and do things and that does not preclude the Constitutional protection it's still speech now to be clear establishing that something is speech is not the end of the story uh there then if it is speech in the United States the government has to pass a test if it is content-based regulation on it it has to go through strict scrutiny and there's intermediate scrutiny and you can look at the functionality as part of that scrutiny when trying to determine is the government doing you know the minimum necessary in order to achieve their function they don't have collateral damage they are not going beyond their power the higher level of scrutiny the harder it is for the government to pass the test but it still has to have that protection and the government has to show why this is the thing to do that is necessary to solve their problem and they are not hitting untended consequences collateral damage along the way now these are United States courts but I wanted to say this is not just a United States principle so a while back uh we did a white paper on the American convention on human rights which is an international treaty throughout Latin America most countries are signatories to it also enshrines freedom of expression in it and we developed the argument looking at cases looking at president that under the American Convention of Human Rights code should also be considered speech and I think this is should be a universal understanding where you have free expression which you have protected and many international human rights treaties that we need to make sure that people understand that code is a form of that expression and should likewise be protected whether you're coding in Latin America in the United States or anywhere around the world which respects human rights so thank you [Applause] so the ofac did have a response they issued some frequently asked questions and answers they did clarify that mere publishing of the source code was okay so that was great Professor Green was was in the clear they said that there's some dusting that occurred after they did the sanctions and they said that was low priority they didn't say don't worry about it but that it was a low priority prosecution uh and they provided people with a way to apply for a license to get their money out of the the mixer though you have to give up the reason you use the mixer the Privacy rights you're trying to protect in order to apply for this license so it's not a really great solution that way they also use this word saying it was okay to interact with the sort of code but that's pretty vague word and the examples they were using like teaching a class about it publishing it studying it um well those are good examples there right but or interact was too vague and I would like to have ofac clarify or maybe we have to have the courts clarify that things like contributing to the code is also okay that publishing the code publishing a compiled version is also okay now there's other questions that are open what did they have jurisdiction to do this in the first place as we were mentioning it's super weird to have a piece of source code a piece of software on an entity list and the entity list is a power that is granted through through the statutes as it have they gone beyond that jurisdiction beyond what they're lawfully allowed to sanction so there have been a couple of legal challenges uh coinbase is funding a lawsuit brought by a number of people who are challenging the treasury Department sanctions they're asking for alternative cash to be removed from the sanction list uh this week coin Center also filed a lawsuit uh they're getting together also a bunch of plaintiffs and then in themselves included uh again to de-list tornado cash and their raising a number of these issues some of our focal points are on the jurisdiction of ofac to put software on this whether they have exceeded their Authority whether they've acted arbitrarily and capriciously outside of the scope of what their administrative Authority is and they also raise some of the code of speech issues uh in the coinbase lawsuit it was talking about the ability to write the code to develop the code and brought that at issue in one of their claims and the coin Center they're talking about receiving money anonymously as a non-profit organization or member organization the ability to allow people to fund them in an anonymous and private manner the right of Association which is also under the first amendment in the United States so these cases will be we'll be moving forward and uh you know we may uh file on Mika's brief to help support them uh I think you should continue to follow them but now while we're offending let's take a moment to think about why this all matters why do we care and a lot of it is about open source there's a lot of Open Source as part of what this community builds and it is vital to be able to have lots of contributors adding the code to be able to research develop the code make a pull request modify it find security holds fix them but if the contributors are going to be held responsible if later that software is used for something bad they shouldn't be held responsible merely because they contributed coal that would have a chilling effect on the development of software that is vital to our future and not only is this chilling effect going to be you know bad for Innovation but even the very information that you know the people who want to prevent money from going to uh North Korea and ransomware might like to see The Innovation that might be able to improve upon the code so it can be providing the Privacy that we need and allowing for a way of stopping money from going to ransomware so privacy as we said it is a fundamental right and take a moment to think not just about uh tornado cash mixers as a privacy protective tool but all the other ones that are out there that could be used to protect the privacy of someone who's hiding from the law but nevertheless are important for a free Society encrypted messaging crypto Communications being able to encrypt your information when you store it online anonymous browsing Anonymous servers file transfers all of these things rely on being able to you know protect your rights by providing encryption anonymity technical protections and they are vital for our society even if they could be misused so we want to avoid that chilling effect and I would say that I think that this is your rights to have and that the chilling effect should not dissuade you from writing the code but we want to establish that so hopefully in the courts or by ofac relenting but getting this clarified so we all know that we can go ahead and keep contributing to this code uh and so to wrap up I'm out of time here but hopefully some time for some questions so saying together we can make a brighter future you can help chart this course you can do it through getting informed and getting involved talking to your representative getting involved in policy discussion trying to get your views known and acted upon and you can do it by building tools by building civil liberties privacy into those tools making things safe making them usable making them so that they have privacy built in from day one make sure that they're decentralized there's not a single point of failure that the government can go after can go to try and stop things and together we can make that brighter future thank you foreign awesome incredible we do have time we do have time for some questions uh so we have a couple runners in the audience who has questions in a couple minutes I see one back there one hand up one hand up okay uh hi there um hello I I definitely agree with um all that you've said um except like then how does a criminal get caught if they're using like the internet for nefarious purposes like um there's been some recent cases uh like there's this documentary I saw on Netflix of uh like a sex cult that was um in South Korea and they only caught them because they were able to find the chat rooms um the secret chat rooms in telegram um that the cult leaders were using um a good question right so how how does the police able to do its job when we have all these technological protections well I mean my first response to that is we live in a golden age of surveillance the law enforcement authorities have more ability to conduct surveillance at scale surveillance of uh people like records about where you go your phone uh is constantly talking to cell towers giving your location they can get that information correlated with some other person's phone and see who's traveling together and get an idea of relationships uh the the ways in which the government has investigative tools at their disposal Are Legion and for going into a telegram chat room well traditional investigative measures having someone undercover pretending to be interested in that kind of thing and getting into the chat room that is the most often way in which they get inside encrypted chats opsec is hard and traditional investigative techniques continue to work and what privacy enhancing tools most protect you against is suspicionless surveillance where they want to do it at scale where they don't have a particular reason to go after you if they do have a particular reason to go after you there's other methods like trying to get a network intrusion tool or a knit onto your phone and just look at the endpoint so it gets decrypted by your phone when you get that down there and they look at it at that point and if like the NSA or the Moss ad or the gru is interested in you in particular then probably a lot of these privacy enhancing tools you're going to have to up your upset game a lot and the tools alone won't do it so what I'm trying to protect against is suspicionless mass surveillance the government has to have a reason and want to spend the resources to go after it and not doing it on millions of Ordinary People all right okay hi it's me it's Alex here so first thanks for your work and I definitely agree with everything you've said thank you I was just wondering about something you didn't say right I missed seeing a name being talked on the tornado cache and that's of course it's Alex Bert's case and I wonder what any purpose are you did you do you want to say something about the case or about him or about like so yeah you're talking about the case in in the Netherlands yes so one of the challenging things about the case in the Netherlands is that he was arrested but not yet charged so he's been held and he went to a hearing and asked like hey am I free to go and they said no but he still hasn't been charged and I'd like to see what the charges are that they're trying to bring before analyzing that situation because what I don't want to see is that he's been charged merely for contributing to the code but I also don't want to speculate as to what they might have against him that you know it is the government's job to say why someone is in jail why someone has been charged and bring and then we can look at what they say and say why that's wrong why you know what the defenses are so I try not to speculate on things that are not charged but that is not to say I'm not sympathetic for a situation I'm not a Netherlands lawyer so I don't know the Netherlands law uh particularly well but I think as a policy matter it is unconscionable to arrest somebody criminally one and not charge them and not let them know what the charges they can build to defense but also to create this chilling effect implication that because he contributed to some code that that's why he was charged and I wish they wouldn't have done that okay today all right we have time for one more question one more question yeah great I'm not hi Kurt uh I had the pleasure of seeing you at the Z cash convention in Las Vegas a few months ago and now you're here so you're really making the rounds I'm excited about that uh my question is with all of the ZK technology the Privacy protecting technology and Z cash ethereum the competitions that are happening what what's your general thoughts on that and also is there anything that's missing from a lot of the maybe philosophy or values perspective when they're building this so the good good questions one is that like I think uh zero knowledge Technologies are extraordinarily interesting and the way of being able to prove just one thing without sending extraneous data I think I I've heard like while being here talk to various people and ideas that are underway or being researched that if they come to fruition we'll be able to allow for a number of things that don't have this leakage of metadata around them that we often see so I'm very excited about the possibilities of these Technologies the other part is what more could be done and I I think one of the things that is going to make all of these kinds of Technologies goes on on the blockchain generally smart contracts especially privacy enhancing ones to have the most value they must be able to be used by a wide range of people people who are not technically sophisticated who might not have the latest versions of software who are operating on a five-year-old smartphone that doesn't get updated all day the time and still they can make a secure transaction because they can do something in a manner that they feel comfortable knowing what they're doing they're not going to make mistake and you know lose what they're trying to do so usability security keep it secret keep it safe and I think that would be I mean people are all working on that but that's the area I want to be able to have it so that everyone can take advantage of it in an easy to understand and easy to use correctly way all right thank you everybody awesome amazing let's give let's give a bigger round of applause for Kurt from the Electronic Frontier fantastic thank you incredible great to be here thank you thank you very much very nice amazing so to continue a little bit and get back on with our our closing ceremony for Devcon uh as as many of you know as I mentioned before we have we've had we introduced this initiative called Devcon Improvement proposals uh over the past few years and we've had uh roughly like 50 different groups suggest ideas and initiatives to happen for for for Devcon uh one of which was the treasure hunt uh the treasure hunt that took place over the past four days purely for fun created by a team of ethereum enthusiasts and so I would like to welcome the treasure hunt creators to the stage to announce the winner hi I'm Griffin this is Aaron this is Chris uh we're Daedalus Industries and then not present is the Social Distortion protocol they are creators of the treasure hunt Creator framework or THC for short um and yeah this is less serious this is just for fun we are aimed for denial of service to curiosity-based denial of service for Devcon and I'll let Aaron talk about the game yeah thanks um we managed to snag quite a lot of you um we got some great feedback from some people like I didn't go to any talks and was only playing your stupid games or screw you guys and you're insane so thank you very much we appreciate it um we have uh on the slide that's gone um you'll see the progression number of players who made it through some people made it through level 24 which surprised us we only had 23 levels prepared so they went above and beyond um yeah great stuff does clicker is not working but maybe um you'd like to announce the winners ready ah here we go um yeah there's a list of them a lot of cow icons all right make this short the grand prize of 100 ether on girly test net goes to the cow swap developer team give it up give it up come on stage come on stage if you're here if not you know where you are okay okay congrats congrats yeah thank you very much guys thanks everyone who played and um yeah always remember to have fun awesome big round of applause for these guys who created this just for fun just in their free time because I mean it was it was a lot of fun from what I hear about and uh it was absolutely impressive so next I'd like to uh just welcome introduce a video recap of this amazing week that we've had very well to to enjoy that to the video [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] we're a little late that says Ah cool awesome so thank you all thank you all for coming here to devicon for coming together for for for for for continuing to collaborate and move this ecosystem forward so we can have a positive impact on the world I'd also like to welcome to the stage someone who is integral to the success of this event Natalya who is the devicon production leader who is our our Devcon production lead big round of applause for montalia [Applause] so Natalia maybe you could tell us a little bit more about uh what it took to get us here today whoa so it basically took us three years uh it uh three years since last Defcon three years in which this might be kind of a secret but we internally postponed event twice and we ended up running a new event in between we ended up running devconnect uh in between those three years and and today and we basically promised to do it right we didn't want to run half double con we didn't want to run a virtual event either so we just were there being patient and waiting for this moment um we did it all for you so we really appreciate you being here today thank you very much foreign to be honest amazing um Skyler I would like to hear from you something that I think is really important and relevant and it is the impact Devcon has had on the region on Latin America yeah big round of applause for Latin America Latin America and Latin Americans in this room right now you all made this room you made this event incredible so I mentioned this in the opening I mentioned this opening Devcon came not just to Colombia not just about guitar but to Latin America and we really wanted to focus on that uh we spent time growing the community and trying to help the community all around Latin America before Devcon but we need to make it sustainable and and and if the community would just die or stop after Defcon moves to another region which it will that would be a failure and so we're we're committed to continuing to support these communities in Latin America and we hope that many of you met many of the Regional Community here in devcom uh and for those of you who are from Latin America and aren't yet involved in the communities around here you can join them you can join them they're open or if you don't have a community in your region you can create your own as well all of these communities that you see here on this map are communities done by Volunteers in their free time because they're passionate about ethereum they believe in the positive impact it can have on our world and so so yeah I would say we need to continue growing it you can contribute to these communities or perhaps create a new one but I want to switch it back to Natalia and talk a little bit more about what we saw here this week so why don't you tell us a little bit more about what was Devcon this year what was Defcon 6 whoa we basically had nine different stages running around six six K attendees from 113 different countries and I think that's very very very important so [Applause] 34 of our speakers were Spanish speakers so so we also had amazing different spaces as the hacker basement that the compression room the picnicer as the community hubs the chiva lounge and we just wanted to have and to create different spaces to fulfill different needs of our community so did you enjoy those faces did you have fun in those those faces the basement that had the decompression room sweet cool glad yeah and if you haven't seen one of those you can still go and have a look what else we have over 200 hours of programming 77 sessions 44 4400 speaker across 10 tracks so all that and much more happened these days amazing and that was all thanks to you thanks to you these these the programming the speakers it was all of you who came who submitted the tracks who came here to speak and share your knowledge and so we want to give a big round of applause for all the speakers okay yeah and shared their knowledge for all of us [Applause] and I think a lot of people here is wondering what is coming what's next what's next what is next what should we expect so what do you have to say about it so you're all probably wondering where the next Defcon will be sadly I'm not gonna announce that we don't know yet uh so but I can tell you what what what what is next I'll tell you what is not next okay this is the end of Devcon yes this is the end of Devcon but this is still the beginning we are still we are still early ethereum is still young and we have a long ways to go to change the world to impact the world with ethereum so yes Defcon is ending but but our our mission is not uh and I would like to also invite Aya to the stage to to talk a little bit more about that as well I amiguchi from executive director of the ethereum foundation we round to Applause big round of applause come on come on come on it's late it's late getting harder to climb up on the stage um so I I'd like to just say a few words that you you know Skyler and Natalia talked about the impact the step gun created to the region um when I was a huge advocator to bring them come to Latin America but something I can come more confidently say is the impact was two ways all the Latin American communities are so strong I just so uh the the leaders of the each Community this morning and you guys are fantastic and yes this Devcon you know a lot of people say this step comb was the best best I've gone ever do you do you feel so um so if you feel so this wouldn't have happened without all the Latin America communities being very strong and being very passionate organizing things on their own and speaking of subtraction that I talk about the opening with the philosophy of subtraction scholar you just said I'm not going trying not trying to go against what you said but I feel like Latin America communities don't need a support that much anymore and that is the great feeling to see at the end of this step gone so thank you again Latin America community members please give another round of applause to them [Applause] um and then when I say the impact these two ways what I meant is those people who flew all the way to here I hope you are able to view what I said and I think I heard that from some um some of the people I talked to I again I'm saying this opportunities the opportunities you will receive in these regions is opportunities for ethereum it's not just us supporting them they are helping with him to get to the next being so that I I hope you were able to experience that and and again thank you again for everyone to attend like this was also not possible every single one of you contributed for this to be the best ever gone ever um and lastly I like to invite all the Defcon team members up on the stage let's go let's go um nice nice so I cannot say this enough I I suggested the location and I subtracted my my power a while ago and these guys are the one that did everything and they didn't they didn't get to really enjoy it because running around all the time and then solving problems so please please give another huge amount of balls to these guys [Applause] also thank you volunteers who helped them to organize this yes all the volunteers the volunteers I'd like you to stand if you're here in the audience so I'd like to just stand all of those are all the volunteers we had we had 200 volunteers who contributed Defcon would not have happened without the volunteers huge huge round of applause for volunteers thank you so this this officially concludes our opening ceremony I'd like to say thank you all for coming again to Devcon we hope you really enjoyed it and let's go back to building [Applause] hello yeah estamos Melos [Music] foreign [Music] thank you oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] my God [Music] done [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we go [Music] foreign [Music]
