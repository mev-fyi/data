so it's a say she didn't want zero with one word exciting feature negative but now this idea is tight right now this guy's bridge for my ears at work and when she would build aside sheet on the pH probe in Africa which is exciting we didn't responses but we created a project that friend about three weeks after it is pretty practical we partnered with many ago I watched ascension but to understand how we figure out this idea as I have a little bit about UAE and the other side kids so do it was a size is based on parity with smart contracts which defined governance and Zebo control mechanism of this of this edge he also the key point of this H is equal to zero means that negative 22 disaster drag a fourth using custodial village and the breach is a essential part of of this construction because we don't have we cannot be so chance there we can it's hard to define what is the token of this network right so our idea is to make human 12 for some types of operations which allows a less requires for full centralization enter some text which need you know firsthand the less expensive network migrated through this platform so mostly it used as a staging temple right because I'm usually services like internet services we have something by tasting compartment stated environment and production but what change we usually first testing and production we don't have something you know small which is protection but also and so it's also part of this this saint-jean is that thank you totally bridge to achievement back so we are think we are the first side genome which bridges proteins back before we launched at the May 2018 with security settings of two signatures from three independent auditors high quality relatable between efforts and up to date this which reached 13 billions of purity the prices market but it's exciting that about 5% of it we each of the independent network is represented in the form of four years acquainted with mr. Kim it was great progress AG not like you know some networks he was some other pockets and they use sometimes they make that one with processor oculus just move on watch it right here is a beautiful site launched with its own distribution and emission and after the center protein was reached to Judea in a form of peer support program and after talking holder decided to move part of this big food each year just receive from instrument where they can you know defined how many tokens they want to move and they hold we don't know attack these cases what people impaired mentally consent through years in 2013 but I think that so many use cases are there are between that was on the right side the table you can see that the protein is list of one separation disappears acquainted with the page based on changes and you can see that people using this every day so it's very exciting that this type of it's a larger protocol between two India based networks exist and in production and still secure not hacked and works in casualty environment so total is a sari for some place but here basically itself and it's much more ties on to networks which define which token they greet and the group of workers usually it which was started as a form of parentage but after we wrote the brief and it has five components of workers which absorbers and servers and religious events in the fortress of transactions smart motorized operations on both networks your application is breached you every issue where users can decide to define which multiple teams they want to monitor which your balances can report to both numbers to the users of this total breach that time the serve different for example if the bridge is held in one hand check this using pointer and also this is which was deployed using the Equality 20 books so we know when we do for instance of this bridge that of our data's from the same say for our saves over separate deposit strategy but for our case it's worked well so we know the body judge did well they are a bridge using standard Department tools and this departmental is independently audited by party so this bridge supports three modes the first page for Dewey was negative three years of money so basically the two sets of recreations what a lot can beat the girl when a protein is worth of the world and this because usually poverty [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] with Reggie we figure out that century in which we can experiment with consensus and we can launch a new Chi with with consensus Paris to the beach right so in this gene idea 2013 has worked on a lot on the right hand side because we cannot print and meet the girl diet ourselves the following rules of the smart contract and so what is what is that everyone knows about diet right so it's a stable program I disable nowadays because the food is so under here what's the producer extension I thought that energy is a should be hard phone first phone is what we take her we did your one network and move another and make next network complementary to the first sample I brought some people taught me that it's not the right definition a repetition of heartfulness when we move this repeat you cannot move between dipper [Music] right you moved it h20 now we backed by privacy 0 or the complementary network or if you don't so we decided ok fine I can slice slice another but with the move this way sir so on this transport of knife recognition right so one blast great that divorce is 0 so when we start this network the worth is 0 for each block no pre mind there is no reward to my support so empty network and the only way to get negative going on this network is to breach yes it when it broken you finally smart contract with this this psyche promethium to this 18 so one network they started all balances of all native partners are zero right my first user move is die this is a gene then bridge relate this event and even see pictures of this quality tests are performed on search inside and sign change intelligence so good think about settings that we can define three guys for this more conscious we can make this execution free right so princess babies like systems project and execution every agency insurance me and this is also good for perfection of customer funds regular stuff think about 300 signatures that it's all they does well run out of process on this of this side to be afraid and after the aggregate of their signatures it usually can really disadvantaged so basically it's quite because plasma from my perspective is what it was last night so once our benefits of this ratio is compatible with you know one module right there's open piece of pipe network is skillful horizontally and vertically so vertically is curable because probably just redesigned Rodriguez the shredder is not a suspect figure cover but his blood sizes and horizontally is that networks came to watch the previous port for extra or for other genes so if a security model is working the other process can launch their own chains and and we will see this model more and more this year with apologies important note with zones and cosmos with side genes with pure and also the most important of the most exciting for me is that everything is stable with every just interpreters right yes prices stable platform users just a it's not enough someone can launch another station with off this price right and it's defined so people actually use 1278 users who breach their time back and forth 25,000 work so this said she had market cap of 3000 right we could go now it's one of something and it's also very interesting example right so it's a it's essentially probably you know try to have this you know it's very hard to catch you know all these all these parts are audited and presumably decentralized product market cap of the constructionist is very small so can be created this side chains from credit for different use case and for different deals different buttons right yeah but as a botanist poor for this edgy you know people send transactions and there is a there are some personal problems with all safety is based on these type of consensus even though we're trying to make decentralized and reintroduced our security model which we call self govern Yuri so in some current doing other predictors can decide for about the personal network by themselves so they have on shared governance and they had ceremony when first group of leaders was awarded his number and that the body does decide or apologies for m13 our body does from the same industry but they're independent entities it's the one the first body either spewing ourselves so second ballot does make you doubt and solid white people of all ages from a fire superiority so we have four validators at the moment and each of these father leaders can decide to create a pallet or removable data from the network a majority of two world leaders in 72 hours will any mother interval removal is so no one can start to auditors of had to be positive or remove this that's what we call self guarantee we for our first networks with restricted with the propagators mark 23 partners and they tried to add 25 thought it was till the end of the year for density we have four auditors but still has some doubts about digitalization of this notion and that's what we're trying to solve and second person approach they cheat so with that that's upcoming the procession will trend to replace Toa consensus through GPS basically replicated some good parts of egos consensus to as more contracts and sodium and to this week all practical purpose take four four zero control an incentive model but other line consensus is our implementation of than any kind of a liability which is well known and sense was his strongest features are video Western standards of resistance and integration so for comparative line which would hope to merge with radiant flavor last year and yeah this sudden shock resistant gives some great features for any traditional network the smallest of don't see all transactions but they do the class in an encrypted form before they create the order so when I'm well determined I'm slated to create the block as his son created and some transactions done equipment to achieve consensus signatures and as a good friend and the beautiful part is a part of consensus search for censorship resistance and keep us even some other features that we don't know all the other stuff they can see this consensus and taking the token and make it program can be different for example this network can use deterministic in protein and may have died as native and any yes it mania or native taught him to be a stay in token and also latest work it can be any years between your beta version so these twelve combinations what you can do Pecora with zero as as a staking token and pen horror as a native protein right and it'll run first race on this and it's or liquidity or first eighteen mechanism will be in my network other compatible network and for hours talking  we were editing the features that set up a little will be the same set so that we have some time for Emma I don't have to show and just just a network running somewhere to have you watching for a full-featured watching sport called West out we can see here the market careful this network is $1600 it's very very small network so effort to break it will be much much more ready so parts are fast can be faster can be second one second what subsection plug with that high pressure PFT will be instantly final see some people use four minutes ago three hours ago it's ugly so why stop support so much more time verifications API our REST API gravity light gray purposes but for free and you can install on your service and Vegeta's camel not show you ads right master data so also paid contract eight properties with reference operational support grab your pc so basically depends [Music] that's a for race day you can see some stats you know 79 users to use that which 26000 drive back and forth so this holds 165 th day so it metered this- token 1600 make it vegetarians perfected and market travel time and you can see that people used more deposits their withdrawals which is good so who are about deters so now there are three world leaders no names yet but this model is not very secure at the moment so what signature is required to really develop it from three or four each of them can delay this for a photo for our new image which is production which pigeon-holed subs it's 30 million fewer chickens we have three partners it's a subset of pollinators of to network and two signatures are required three voltage that's relatable so none of them give it away depends out for instance for not so one signatures required from the authorities and that's because we're before work body turn from I think comes from probably from waked from given it's sometimes but after which is what what well this would be the easiest from more about this is very quality related and also there are limits as for as for our other bridges so for example all about the first effect we know that the maximum damage would be per day so it's defined benefits of these networks so it's not something what we have have 17 J on maintenance and it's our fork of metal mask because Mehta master not fed the two side chains and force yeah if you have a section you try to add a meta master I'll say no so that's why we built our own fork and this is friendly and faster and some other works but he was switched to everyday wines which infers that because transactions on edge dies faster so less confirmations so what I need to make to relate my next date back to die trying to specify mouth and same transaction and that's it so after I sent destruction pollinators was see this event they will wait it was you know why we're so there is no this probabilistic penalty at the same with GUI which is based on right now further on also with the probabilistic penalty and with funny budget would be instant analysis over the world central EDI G 2 1 0 very very much will be zero time to make work fun occupation [Music] [Music] he so after after he waited for for date request and my head is burned so how do we pronounce the sentence I think we just sent it to this and burn the place holder [Music] that's what after after body does it was we created the transaction on site enter the way this to x-ray beam Smart Response Team set and this mark contract will send me [Music] you know it is interesting because you're something that is creative hackathons usually should be example right but also to change how you think about things here why we do them think about it before and only figure out of the hackathon because for me yet I think ok ok make it work usually there's some officials how we create native tokens and no one will allow you to create parts about emissions worth or some inflation model but here is basically network is empty and on demand on event it creates new networks so for me it was ok we can we can do right because it's a chain we have this exciting feature in furniture called black they weren't smart Manchester where we can define award reporting and the British smart contracts are hooked into this block reward and what rewards on the back front of the bridge produced native projects and plasma can be plasma yeah so the same puzzle can be used as plasma I think that concept the breaches of bridge operations are free on-site inside and then you want to deliver this event and also the valuables of the breach of the simple details as body of consensus and consensus is anonymous and equality for anonymous consensus or decentralized security model defined by market needs so I think it's very nearby it's dirty assumptions on one side and other side decisions are very small I small side chains and now is to implement something working and give it to users but this X that she will be used on each is different anyone coming to be used for operations between participant Socrates Denver and brothers so if you buy food at each Denver you use X day but actually in web form of high status I'm something interesting anyone knows why we will wrap each day on XT into usage whether it was engagement for X I know it's not easy so I think like first idea was of us but let's give this to any participant whether some fun as something let's say but with special purpose changes to change between return especially transferring are inspected for and to maintenance that's awesome so just as a technique of ascending currently the notes watching they will listen to events right and then wait eight blocks or something yeah today weekend from the state if this is still pumped you to call because what the state and can be obviously or your security settings if you want paralyze validator note you will use or PC like the book version of the beauty where you have the decryption and on top of that is not compact governance is then like a supported we delegated reversed a possibility sir is a way for note of Allah dangers to achieve consensus on set of messages and include them into words and governance and physical control define who para validators and when their auditors and I will self governed Puri there's a so there is a governance for each father became proposed abroad and his brothers confirmed then father intercept has changed with DQ s should be taking ground expert a a week and whoever states more more likely will be included and so what is the unfreeze period for these states once taking and voting participants why mm well 400 pager number of faults calculate the three x number of host plus one and special security consensus for example the one 740 nodes after seven fourteen months then it's a 3 x server so it will be enough to take deductions [Music] from these matters you want to control the [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] before you know I haven't followed the recent developments so much for the poor but and now you said that you will implement cybertek resistance to stay in yeah but what's the original idea to have actual like super authority by be registered through legal notaries or something like this is this no like on the table or did she abandon that idea the entrance are some people and that's our first Network which is volatile and list of our leaders of this verse networks you can see 23 for the moment soft apps rabbits all theater from watching that's my dress now this proper physical risk is open source and supports your system up to 500 contributors and so forth origin Network creates the leader prostate cancer well that's what market is demanding right now right you have two cups taking and coins created by a perfect origin network can just take it in deleted local state network so for our first operate will use pure taking it's finding both models are working it's hard to be getting it like let's say you on our governance model because it's very conservative area and people don't want to accept that watching governance of you in network it's just some centralized because it's or some other arguments it's quite hard to just some independent opinions about about this model there's all all balance of this all governance decisions on chip and they went by of chain decisions by individuals but but you can see that they have some agreement and disagreement about adding or removing validator so this guy was aided by 60 votes for three games but before he had a problem before he was simple they required few months ago decided why because he was traded from the perspective of the others because he used both boxes is proof of his progress they figure out they made their own but now they figure out that he's working for Google and of his office beta they voted him in this father was working as we think about this governance is that it's enforceable automatically so on finish any interval leaders and finalized for cessation and so anyone can propose new product with type of proxy contract basically anybody can propose a place so you want to add a new type of but like we did with emission paths I copied this model from use so the never produce additional mission values can decide how to spend destination so this was added by foreign governments enforced by supermajority she said less covers new functionality and yeah this is enforceable consensus the same model will not work for any consensus but it will work for deep us for the viewers to transmit of medium of governance token which can be used for great bridges and our greatest asset so the same here you have another proposal because my key is not voting here and voting is a part of my my identity on chain about it and when I own borders as well there are three keys from a very basic the pool of my OTP mining and penalty from other bandit restore include my body can take him with us what will give us I have to I have to be a part of active what producers and also I have to stake some government if it's more easier less [Music]
