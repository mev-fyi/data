[Applause] as a present or ideally actually half an hour designing conversation okay [Music] yeah yeah oh really it basically choose your own risk insurance actually think about in the United States your risk pool is your coworkers but if everyone's familiar with microfinance companies like axial or Grameen Bank you have a social mechanism involved with policing in a way that you would not have a traditional banking system right so the idea in microfinance is that because you get a joint loan if someone is lazy the other people who have the responsibility are going to come count in the door and say get out of bed you need to work because we're all going to suffer as myself so the social mechanism is in a really important part of the success of microfinance well apply that same lens to insurance so what happens is you put in one piece to this pool okay whatever you don't eat it into it you can of course pull that out without any meeting for any votes but if you need health care and let's just say you need point to easier to get a shot or something that no one needs to attest to but anything beyond what you resent would in you have to have other people vote to allow you to be able to remove the money the maximum that you can never remove from the pool can never be higher than fifty percent but what remains in the course you can't have one person take all the money so you will have this injury so you can have your family if you want to have your family be there for school or you could actually have your friends you all know that you keep healthy and in these festive things everyone sticks their money and and there's room for two different to have a larger patron or a benefactor also participate so it could be the government or the Gates Foundation or whatever happens to be and you think about the work that the Gates Foundation does - they're basically donating their money to help people on the health care approach in this case you say put in some money that we could actually act as a patron and then if the money is put in and then you convert it into a stable thing so that you don't have a fluctuations then you could walk that money is sitting there you could actually put it into someplace like compound to a generating interest and that this in a sense is kind of working as endowment money that continues to grow and then people if they need to pull money out they can now be incentive for you to remain a participant in the system is that for every year you participate the cost for you to be able to participate goes down so it goes down by 10% for every year anticipates the first year that you purchase it is to compete if you don't pull anything out or whatever is great but the next but you can pull up as much as 10 inchh of your name then in the next year going to be better if everybody is you only have to put in point ninety but you can still pull out the ten so across time there's a necessity to hang around for ten years and participate in this you have the room for the larger infants to be there as bad vectors and then of course you have the the social mechanism of you know and this person needs it broke their arm and you're like I'm comfortable with them pulling the money out and then voting and allowing them those claims yeah so we're taking some shot might be better you actually want way was the long run to get much better outcomes of ever before something preventive health care rather than always just consumption okay yeah and investigative name go [Music] this Mary doesn't like Jim there is society's work in order supplies scams an acceptable your antennas to the next level in yes I just tell it aren't you is on two slides quote [Music] it's about minutes [Music] are going to be healthy so he is presenting his energy [Music] all right so I might introduce you guys to do it basically is a renewable energy fund that gives micro loans to people want s or solar panels because the package port Cygnus the problem is even though we did your government gives you an incentive don't want on that upfront cluster is for solar panels and it's not a reason why the packs on our condolences because there's nothing that nature became to give out loans to based on future projections even though Sola has probably in something very predictable very stable returns they always require some sort of collateral a fixed deposit or a car and property okay to back it up that is quite a lot of these certain problems and awning so I'm walking I'm storing solar so we are proposing to create a renewable energy from ok managed by a town essentially we collect funds from investors put into the fund which to cut it out and then we give up these and I close to the anybody in the world who wants to install solar panels and a fun performance is dependent upon how well fund managers in the Dow select and give experiments and capitalize on the government Thanks so the user experience is very very suitable okay investors make money okay because they have a new income to invest in and other interests so if not and the hopefulness I can get access to credit to those because the banks don't give it the opportunity here is a win win win for everyone because we get to earn okay so imagine a plastic waste offer you're getting a loan instead of putting out one hundred percent and seven percent of energy what if because of the solution instead of saving 100 percent you save five percent of your energy bills and 95 percent of whatever you say goes to repay the loan plus interest so we make money you save energy okay and the Dow is dead ensure that the trusses long beach so that's basically the power in your body [Applause] no I come to that expense called dream die québécois dream today Wow nothing and here's all their this weekend and there's other prizes yeah there's like first place anyway alright so keep thanks thank you oh sorry god it's okay everybody you know I'm just telling the camera because my bosses are Nazis so guys let's have a rich discussion about what it was the experience give me some feedback on the canvas what you wish was better what you wish would change and then we can call it a day [Music] that made a lot of crystallize did you actually showed us your doubt and some of the infrastructure and like went through a sample voting mechanism Jewish that would come first yeah I think that would be I think my bias is to create the need and help people operate under a certain amount of the certainty and then throw the water let you walk through the best Yahoo get a little thirsty but you have no reason to actually yeah so we don't know we don't have to go in a circle like everybody speaks or we can if you guys won but I would like to know like what was that open what are the possibilities in your mind in life that have you have look at the canvas was there any misconception that you had about the house that was rearranged I don't know it was a lot [Music] [Music] Senate French they think also we're drawing parallels to existing systems right and if you think about it a lot people were using analogies you know like to think about explanation I was giving this analogy used in analogy and the other day that the jewel was like well you elect members of Congress and here's what they do I think actually having a place in here for is there an analogous system it being used it's the other thing that people are familiar with that could help us to wrap our brain around it because in the end there's only certain ways that we can organize and there might be other norms so I think even adding appeals to this and saying is there another example outside of where you're trying to this work but maybe even the goal feel like this isn't is there room for analogies or better for for sure we always use them yes that's it thank you guys for coming thank you for putting up with a large checking around where we really talk about where we are at that type of stuff super important it's a way of the co-creation time mine my bias that I like to seed into watching spaces that the intelligence isn't in the audience more more often than not and they go to these conferences and watch these panels like three brains of stage but the 500 brains of the room are aware the magic is set and that's why we have shape so super important for me to know who's in the room you want experiences to carry what are the things your research this is where the magic comes from and that's what we find also making use any down fast as I can so if you have a desire and organized a needs size event around those please reach out let's make a Hellfest happiness which would be the best oh and my telegram is elementary complexity altogether small [Music] [Applause] you
