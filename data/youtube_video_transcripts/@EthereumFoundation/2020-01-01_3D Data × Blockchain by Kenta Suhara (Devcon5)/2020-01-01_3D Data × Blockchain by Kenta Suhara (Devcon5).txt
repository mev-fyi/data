[Applause] I am an engineer at workplace we are started focusing on digital content and nmds today I'm here to talk about this 3d data so I'm going to give you a brief overview of problems with 3d data and an idea of a basaltic so one strong strength of the 3d data is that you can choose how to use it you can either display on the Virtual Reality world or you can put it out using the 3d printer and in fact 3d printing market size is increasing each year but behind the right side the 3d data can be harmful sometimes with the 3d 2d cam data and 3d printer anyone can create their own guns and not only that if the data is broken somehow the user there's a possibility that the user is injured in the opposite way something like this and we can take many cases that 3G data should be well designed accurate and reliable so something like the parts for the vehicles as for the houses gossipin equipment and even artificial organs and we thought we need to help our you thought what we can do to solve to help solve this problem using the blockchain and we came up with one possible solution making 2d data very fireballs and as some of you may already know there's a concept of the viable credentials in the context of decentralized identity so the issue issues credentials to the holder and a vampire will benefit and we need into the 3d world the be sure such as creator of the data or subjective fire to some kind of organization money is going to issue the credentials to the 3d data and the user can verify it so who created there and authorized and Fuji Leila will be something like this so there will be a link to some potentials that are verifiable we started this project with some very specialists called - the lights on and you are created they have this cool solution they can model 3d data in under 10 seconds we are still working on this project so if you are interested in this contact us and one quick attachment is that we are going to organize Japanese join us [Music] [Applause]
