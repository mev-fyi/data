foreign [Music] cookie we are both part of 327 that's an r d Collective and our goal is to stay up to date with web3 Technologies So today we're going to talk about that and to go there we can start with the challenges that we ran into during the last couple of years while researching and building in webtree many times we would go deep into specific ecosystems so that we would miss all the innovations that would happen in the other ecosystems secondly uh even though when we would like to enter new ecosystems we didn't know where to start we didn't know what is the current state of the tech or there or where to watch where to find useful informations and finally somewhat different situation is when we would go deep into specific technology we would research it build trying to build something with it and then we would realize it's too early for it it's too early for its adoption and we would move to something else however in the meantime the initial technology would experience some changes and it would become somewhat revolutionary but we weren't watching at it anymore and we would miss the opportunity to innovate and to utilize the fact that they were over there before it was popular it happened to us many times with MMS with DK um etc etc so to prevent these kinds of situations from happening or at least to decrease its number uh we decided to uh create a web 3 Tech reader that's a tool and what we actually did is that we mapped as much as possible of apply Technologies for this first version the mapped Technologies tools languages Frameworks etc etc uh we divided them into the ecosystem and we visualized and arranged them using the radar metaphor but let's see how it really looks in practice uh the first thing you're greeted with is like a fine choice of different ecosystems uh I know we're all here huge fans of evm-based systems but like if you want to fool around I won't tell anyone uh so inside each ecosystem we give some general information about it which this guides us to figure out if that ecosystem is the right fit for the web 3 product that we want to build we have some basic information here but there's also the full report where we dive deeper into specific of each ecosystems and then of course the Highlight for each ecosystem is its technology radar like milosh mentioned we take all of the Technologies we find for a specific ecosystem we put them into these tiny little blips and inside of each blip like let's say for solidity we have a brief description of it a link where you can find more if you're interested or uh and our opinion of course um and so this is what we end up with and we wanted to uh have a better understanding of what's happening so like milish mentioned we have uh different quadrants so we have platforms tools techniques and protocols and languages and Frameworks but on the other hand we also have rings those tell us how close to mass adoption a certain technology is in the web 3 space so the highlighted ring that you see the assess ring that's where all those like new and exciting things that have been popping up on Twitter but that really haven't been fleshed out um on the other hand adoptering is for those like things that are indispensable for any web 3 project and On the Border like far away uh is the whole ring that's for um those like things that you probably want to be careful with or that you should just totally ditch for example proof of work yeah give it up for them words yeah so of course some of you may know this is like inspired by the great folks over at thoughtworks and with this um we at 3327 have a better feel of what's happening in a specific ecosystem we know what new things are popping up what things are getting fleshed out and what things are kind of maybe getting deprecated so we use that to stay and stay in touch keep up to date without having to like scroll on Twitter all day and it also helps us decide which Technologies we might want to use for our next web3 project so we'll keep working on it because we use it all the time but we also want to make it like a community effort like to make it a project that's by the community for the community and if you want to help us please reach out to us you can reach us on Twitter and also uh on the link below um this is something that we want to make a space for uh having a sense of this crazy and dynamic web 3 world that we're all building together um just add one more thing that you can go on the link on the Twitter you can check over there the current Alpha version and in two weeks we're gonna come up with a new one how often you plan to update it is it a quarterly release yes because we want to be thorough with each one we want to really assess each technology we want to do it quarterly um that's the general idea the app You're Building here Dapper um I'm curious how do you how do you measure what is valuable on how do you measure that value and what is gets closer to this another Circle so we measure like how how well adopted it is like if you think about stuff we have a huge team of developers inside our team so we see out their experience it's our subjective opinion but that's why we want the community to come in and or challenge those opinions and to see like really okay if we all band together okay let's really see what is good there and what's something that we might want to skip
