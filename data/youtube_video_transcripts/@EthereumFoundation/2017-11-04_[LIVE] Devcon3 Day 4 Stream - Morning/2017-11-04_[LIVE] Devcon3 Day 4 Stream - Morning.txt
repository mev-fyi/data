as you as it and we're gonna start on time now and I'm gonna introduce Guillaume of our Whisperer team lead Flagler house key and whisper developer Guillaume ballet I strongly believe between Liberty and oppression in our world is ultimately determined by the balance between offensive and defensive technologies imagine the world were defensive technology always prevails in every area of human life basically nobody would be able to harm anybody else any kind of coercion would be impossible imagine the unprecedented level of liberty and security for all and so if we want to if we want to advance the cause of Liberty we should strive to develop all kinds of defensive technologies and this is whispers all about so today we're going to talk about achieving darkness with whisper so whisper is a messenger system for distributed applications and the most secure mode of operation is supposed to be able to achieve darkness at considerable expense in terms of processor power bandwidth etc so what is darkness it's a property of the system when no matter information is being leaked and goes hand in hand with plausible deniability for example if the message is found on your computer nobody can reasonably assume that this message was addressed to you because this is part of the protocol the nose stores and forwards all the messages so whisper was designed to be integral part of the theorem ecosystem and offers off chain communication between the DD apps so it has nothing to do with blockchain it's off chain the reason for that is because of change communication is much cheaper and if you don't need consensus you just need to send the message you use whisper and so whisper uses underline etherium communication protocol to take care of message whisper is is a gossip protocol it means that every message is delivered to every node so now we are going to talk about the technical details all right thanks yeah so this represents a network and you have notes on on the network obviously and each nodes has has a key and if I know that the sensor wants to send a message to a recipient what it does is that it encrypts the message with with notes the recipients key and so it will then forward the message to other to its neighboring nodes and those nodes will try to decrypt the message they will fail because they don't have the right key and therefore they were forwarded to to their nodes as well to their neighbors as well and so on until it reaches the recipient that manages to decrypt the message you will notice that actually this doesn't stop here even though the message has reached its recipient the recipient was so forward to its neighboring node and that's to not be identified as the recipients other words that would leak metadata so how do you that these are a lot of messages how do you prefer prevents people from spamming do net network we we use proof of work I don't I assume I don't have to tell you what it is but yeah that's how you throw all the traffic on the network so there are some advantages to this approach first it's decentralized obviously because you you do not have to send it to one central authority like whatsapp or Google Talk you can also generate like you can also agree with the protocol and on a protocol with your recipient on how to generate keys so you do not have to store the keys on disk and you have two other advantages well darkness and steganography but flag we'll be talking about that later we were not kidding when we said that would come at a significant cost the problem like the problem the problem of this approach is that it has a high latency or high bandwidth obviously everybody's sending messages to everybody else there's a high processor load because you need to try to decrypt messages even if they're not intended for you and on top of that you need to keep a copy of the messages in memory because you might be sent messages that you already sent and you do not want to to overload the system with sending extra messages so you need to keep messages in memory a bit longer and that's that's costly as well so the way the message works we have time to leave in an expiry which is what I described how long you should keep the message in memory you have the nonce which is related to the proof-of-work and you have the encrypted payload which is the message itself and we also provide a heuristic to to help the note determine if it's worth decrypting the message or not to try to save a bit of a processor processor load so this this heuristic is called two topics it's four bytes of arbitrary data it's very short it's on purpose and the goal for that is so that you cannot be identified with your with your topic so other participants on the node on the network will probably set the same very probably set the same topic so you will be able to deny that the message was internet for you in version 6 we also want to be let the notes what kind of topics they want to receive and that will reduce the darkness but that will also reduce the workload so it's it's an help for to improve adoptions so that people do not spend as much as much resources when when adopting whisper very powerful more than half of network also it is capable and willing to target individual nodes so it can broad for generate whisper the entities of its nodes in such a way that they fit into the network topology completely surrounding the target node and with the purpose of performing the traffic analysis so for recipient it's quite easy to achieve darkness because recipient gets all the messages tries to decrypt them in case of success reads the message and nobody from outside can detect it the only thing the recipient should take care of is treat all the messages equally so even those messages he can read should should be forwarded and if you use default implementation of God then it's already taken care of for the sender of course in some cases the adversary can see that the message was originated in this node so how to achieve darkness well you can try to maintain certain level of noise for example you send messages every so often and if you have something to say you encrypt a meaningful message if not and you encrypt some random data and it will be indistinguishable and also I would recommend to use different topics and keys and whatnot for incoming and for outgoing messages because imagine if you have two nodes on the network they communicate with each other so you cannot really detect who communicates with whom unless those two nodes send messages with the same topic or those messages other trades message size frequency proof-of-work and so on and so it's better to have that messages outgoing and incoming don't share common traits so message size is another important trait important metric which you can potentially liquid information and that's why we have introduced a parent field so imagine that you have you maintain a certain level of noise so you send messages every so often and every message is approximately one kilobyte and then all of a sudden you need to send this short message like in this case goodbye big brother and then it's it's very different so what you can do you can randomly generate some data and put into the parent field and then you encrypt the entire message and those fields are indistinguishable so you can adjust message size and default imitation already includes that message size which is factor of 256 bytes so you can actually set any size you want also our default implementation allows symmetric and asymmetric encryption for messages the case of symmetric encryption if you engage in this communication with somebody else it means that you have already exchanged the secret key through some kind of secure channel and I would recommend to use exactly the same channel whatever it is to exchange also the topics and all the other related information and yeah so it's easy but for a symmetric encryption what usually happens is you advertise your public key in some open channel and you probably are not willing to publish the topic because in this case message sent with this topic adversary can guess that message was addressed to you so but if you try to decrypt all the incoming messages it might be too expensive in terms of processor power so what you can do you can require a higher proof-of-work for messages without the topic and also you can advertise partial topic so for example you say if the first part of the topic contains certain value for example 0 then you will try to decrypt this message I would also recommend to use the learn long-term keys only to establish the session so you generate session keys for outgoing and incoming messages you generate the topics preferably randomly and you sent the first message to establish the session and this message will be encrypted in with with the long term key and then you proceed to communicate normally with ephemeral keys and after the session is over the keys are deleted and nobody will be able to decrypt those messages again if you don't store them so another important so we have this but our API allows easy access to this field so what you can do you can stop stitute add-in with some secret message for example you have some secret message in this case lorem ipsum and then you encrypt the message with some completely different key you put the encrypted message in the padding field then you can post some innocent-looking message like in this case I have nothing to hide and then you encrypt everything and yeah encrypted message so in the future if you're compromised if you see this message this message because all this and therefore you don't need any requirement so you can abandon that and also the number of nodes is have bandwidth constraints and so you will not have latency and you can engage in instant messaging you can engage in voice calls video calls whatever and the only in the adversary can say about the participant is that they part of this network and in case of some organizations it's it's already known also some people ask me if it's possible to use the custom encryption instead of whisper encryption because they don't trust our whisper courage and I'm always happy to see to hear such questions because it shows that people are serious about security and the answer is that you cannot substitute with to encryption by the custom encryption but you can encrypt on top of our implementation and in cryptographic community is usually discouraged to use custom encryption but in this case if you do it on top of whisper encryption with unrelated keys you can do no harm and I actually want to encourage people to continue research and development in encryption because first of all you should not be complacent it's very promising technology namely cryptography offers such a huge advantage to the defenders over those who try to attack and of course what kind of self-appointed with the bodies are going to be very unhappy about it because they see the writing on the wall the technology makes them obsolete and they will no longer be able to control the free speech and all the king's horses are not going to help them and if you hear them saying that encrypted communication is very dangerous and especially if they advertise the services to protect you from those dangerous just remember that we are talking about very peaceful technology here which can be used solely and exclusively for defensive purposes so here our contact details please join our Gator channel write to us on Twitter and especially if if your project seems to contribute to the cause of Liberty so we of course cannot help everyone everyone but yeah we will try to assist whisper integration with any substantial project and yeah now we have a little bit of time so maybe we will take a couple of questions so one is the proof of work and investors version 6 is going to be dynamic so you can dynamically send proof of that proof of work and if traffic is too high you can increase it on the fly but also we will have bloom filter exchange protocol for the topics and so you will be able to set up those bloom filters in such a way that you can probabilistically assess how many messages you get for example you you want to reduce your traffic by 90% and there will be formula how you can set the bloom filter sorry so yeah you can hear refute the question how do you access the system just using a normal email so if I just want to get some protection of my normal email can I use this for doing it it's a bit embarrassing but could you please repeat slowly so I'm gonna straight in so yeah put all my words together and once they do say so if I'd like to use this to protect my standard email and I want to access this level of protection with my emails how do I do that so I guess it's a question for the day app developers so those the apps who use whisper for the communication they should take care of that maybe there will be some the apps which provide email like service based on whisper and maybe it is gonna be status may be somebody else so we hope yeah okay so I'm just you know I'm developing a D app that's gonna have a front-end in JavaScript connecting with thorium so you kind of envisaging that this gets implemented in the front-end Java library library to communicate with all the peers around the network so you want to use the idea here so you want to use the Java yes so they can even use it to spread heresy apostasy and all kinds of dangerous things and if we so why I mention those quasi-religious things is because government usually uses yeah so my answer is that people did conspire and people did commit a lot of crime and they use all kind of stuff to do it roads and out cars and whatnot and so this is what we are doing this is purely defensive technology you cannot use it to attack somebody you can use it to defend yourself even if you're a criminal or if you are a normal person you can only use it to defend yourself and whatever the the the people will later say that is aggressive and whatnot it's it's obvious that is purely defensive right all right I suggest you come to us and we'll have a longer debate because we are running out of time and we have one more question how much can we expect the network to scale with our current computational resources I mean of the home users in terms of how many nodes can we run so it's feasible for the network to support all that traffic yeah we're actually working on that one it's it's it's pretty I mean right now I'm given the protocol it's still it's really really high like the load is really high so this killing is still a problem and this is where we're going to introduce v6 so we don't have numbers yet but if you're interested we can keep in touch and I'll I'll send you when we send you the results when we we start developing it thank you [Applause] thank you a next session is using whisper and ipfs to improve customer experience and a peer-to-peer marketplace with Michael Tsui and Stefan ponit hello well good morning my name is King Furcal Michael lui and this is Lynette and were with swarm City where's the clicker I'm sorry where do I click with this gonna have the next slide please oh yeah nice light please oh okay good morning so swarm city so just as many other eternian projects who are trying to this one thank you we are this is our vision just like many other team projects we want to enable humans to transact create and share value without a middleman or a third party on a global scale generating contextual reputation our mission is to do this in a way where normal people like our parents actually understand what you are doing so we don't wanna have people experience the blockchain basically we want to really make it really easy to use today we want to discuss two topics we are trying to solve a Tyrian byte problems that we encounter in creating an app that is consumer facing so the first thing we want to talk about is the IP of s consortium the second one is the gas station so the first thing i PFS consortium so if you want to create an app like we do that's totally decentralized you still need storage we need to find a way do you have data persistence so even if you do it on ipfs you have to make sure that your data is persisted over time the way we came up with that solution is really interesting because it's the way we came up with solution actually is kind of the solution it's collaboration because it's key in the blood world so we sat together with givethe in barcelona and many other people and after a night of brainstorming we came up with this really simple solution open your data if you've been mined for an in-depth or more in-depth technical overview of that solution I'll hand it over to Spinelli ok good morning everybody so the solution we came up with for the ip-based consortium is actually that we created smart contracts so by the way this works on top of another persistency consortium project by piper Miriam so we try to extend it a little bit and make it more in general for that everybody could use its in like a more flexible way so we created a smart contract the I previous proxy contract and this contract will just emit events so we have true to events like hash added so we have an IP this hash gets edit or needs to be added to the consortium it has a time to live for example and then the ipfs has itself and the hash removed function so if you don't need the data anymore and you want it's out of the consortium so it's not IND anymore you can do that then in the smart contract itself we implement the two functions at hash remove hash which basically just emits these two events which very low on gas to actually call these two functions then all these members in the IPV assistance consortium they will install a script on there respectively respective ipfs notes which is a proxy listener with just a script that goes and listen to these events on that IP this proxy contract so that's a general setup now there are a few more things there for example the IP this proxy contract contains a lists sort of a white list with all the members of the IPS consortium members so that means that's all there's their public keys are in there so it can I actually verify if they call the contracts so that only IP this member hashes are pins in the previous notes itself so there are different ways of adding your hashes to the IP this consortium so first of all if you have a DAP or a script which one - which wants to pin content you can just call the function add hash or remove - so that's the way of from doing it from your tab itself for the front-end but we also expose these IP of s events as a separate solidity file which you can just include in your own smart contracts we here the the logic of your DAP actually needs to store IP this content from from on chain basically they can just create your contracts by implementing IDs ipfs events and then the consortium members can add their contracts to the IP of s proxy suite has a second list in there and if they added to the I previous proxy contracts then this proxy listener scripts will also start to listen to these same events in all the specific smart contracts that they use now concerning the governance of the IP based consortium so we don't want one single owner to manage the consortium so that's why we added multi members so that's basically the multi C codes to vote on adding or removing members all the members they pledge to persist each other's data and they allocate an equal mount of disk space or the sort of donates all in equal amount of disk space in the consortium so it's interesting to notice that so we can deploy one of these contracts which has a certain quota m-- and all the members there they say ok we are going to do this like for example with the quorum of 10 gigabytes but it's very easy to deploy a second contract we then has like for example a quorum of 50 gigabyte so you can just choose to set up new of these contracts some of the future enhancements that you want to bring is that we can also do painting via whisper so the ideas attitudes just call or create a data data payload in whisper which has the same command so add hash and remove hash which is the IP of s hatch itself and time-to-live they we create a hash I will actually sign with an elliptic curve signature this payload and you can just send it to a whisper channel and we can have them the script listen to this whisper channel and just pick these things up so to give a round up on the IP vesicle sourcing so we have the possibility to do on chain pinning by smart contracts we can do off chain pinning by the tab or the script which then performs the transaction we can with using the whisper solution also do off chain pinning without a transaction so this is my sign it with your with your own key we have the multi member voting to Adam remove participants without a quotient but on top of that we also supports that the network is permissionless maybe I'll give it back to cubes or so that's that's a really interesting case so anyone can run this proxy script at home on their own computers and like we saw in Barcelona a couple of weeks ago when the Spanish government tries to block ipfs host names that we think it can be powerful that many people can actually have a voice and run this software just on their own computers currently yep ipfs consortium is of course in in kind of prototype or or it's it's like we we proved that it works but of course we are inviting everybody to to join us in to make sure that we can have leader persistence in a central way so the second thing we want to talk about is the gas station so what we do if we want people to on board our project of course we send them some smart city tokens but then we always have to say and you need a little bit of heater to actually do something with it because every transaction and then you have to tell the whole story about gas right so for a lot of people like my dad for instance he was saying why why do do I need two coins now or two tokens so our ideal solution will be that it is a one click solution in the front and in the app where people can actually exchange a little bit of their tokens for gas our design process it's kind of funny I think because we always use the metaphor of the city so if you drive around the city you of course need gas and what do you do then you go to a gas station oh I'm gonna hand it over to someone else for this thank you so the way many of the existing etherion projects solve it currently is by just giving away some free gas just sending some gas to a certain address which is created in a wallet in the hope that they will actually use that gas to perform transactions in their ecosystem or to use their app but most of the time it can't be sure if they will actually use the gas for that or do just do some sort of similar tech and just try to collect as much free gas as possible another problem is also that if your app becomes very successful you have to have a lot of eater somewhere just to provide everybody with some free gas to get started so we try to come up with a solution where I can actually just do the exchange we have like a durable solution that people just are able to pay with our tokens for getting the initial gas so it's always it's also a two-part solution so first of all there's an API which needs to run which is the gas station service and next to that we have a gas station contracts that's deployed locks it with that so people can actually just run it themselves so first of all you decide which ERC 20 token you would like to support so in our case it's Warren City token and then you send some initial eater which is this one eater because just about providing initial guesses it doesn't need an big amount of feature you send it to the gas station to sort of fill it up with eater so that's the setup if you then have a dab so the use case here is that you have like a new user who someone just sent a couple of this swarm city tokus but it doesn't have any gas so he can't do in a transaction yet so the thing he can calculate is how much way he will actually need to perform you know do the first transactions that he wants to do to get started so we will ask to the gas station service what is your price for this amount of way that I will need the gas station you will consult a public price API to see what the current exchange rate is for either to farm city tokens and it will reply to say ok this many way would cost you that many swarm city tokens the next thing that happens is that the device itself or the tap will sign an allowance which is a twenty function to the gas station contracts for that amount of swarm city tokens and on top of that he will create an elliptic curve signature for all these parameters with the amount of swarms is going to give and all that we are going to adapt one of the next slides so he will send the sign transaction back to the gas station service and then the gas station service will verify the transaction this will be coded and if it all fits all the prerequisites you will actually send gas to that address so the address of the tap to execute the allowance call when you see that that gas has arrived he will execute the allowance transaction by just putting it into the transaction pool and when that transaction is mined the gas station service will call a function in the gas station which we call push fill so let me quickly show like how it begins it's not a complete function but just to get you to give you an idea about how it works so what is it if we push fill so it provides the token address which is the ERC 20 token a to support or you want to exchange it gives you a validity date which is expressed in a block number so this sort of personal exchange rate is valid as a validity period we had a random number to create some entropy on the but that will come later awesome you will say how many of these forms the focus you can take from him in exchange for how many way in eater you will give them they also provides the gas tank client which is the address of the taps the wallet address from the tap and then the signature so the thing that the contract will do it will actually recreate that same hash with all these parameters and here he will verify if the signature of all these parameters are actually match up to the address of the gas tank lines if so he do the actual exchange the code is not here and he will mark that specific would say contracts or that specific configuration to be executed so we can't repeat it twice concerning risk mitigation there is one problem because you have to trust the gas station service that it will actually also perform the second transaction to you if you give him the allowance transaction you must be sure that he actually doesn't does that push fill thing so to mitigate that so I told you before that's the API service response with so many way because that many sworn tokens but actually is also going to give a liquor signature on these parameters with his and then we create the second function which is called push sorry pool fill and it will verify the same parameters which will actually just verify if these parameters were signed by the owner and this function can be called by the gas station served by the client who uses the gas station so he has a certitude that if they do the exchange they sort of mutually give the allowance to do exactly that's transaction so why would you participate or would you run a gas station because we we can define or you can define an uplift for the price you sell your eater for so it means if you would for example say 10% uplift if your gas station sells out because the amount feature decreases the amounts aren't tokens increases you will end up with when you sell over your eater with an amount of swarm city tokens which equals like one point one eater so yeah so the result of that is that anybody can just download that API script deploy its own contract primate we call it with eater then configure it like what er see 20 tokens do you want to accept in your gas station then tell it how much either markup you want to sell it for and just start it you can find everything we are doing these get up links and also on this is dot swarm city you will find more information but there is of course one more thing the time you create it so as you see the gas station it's at a certain time it needs some maintenance because it's needs to be refilled because like the eater gets depleted in the ends which also try to solve that and we have like prototype code of that which we can you can also find an archetype so we created an integration with eater Delta so the thing is that's the gas station service itself it contains a wallet so when it's it has a certain amount of swarm see token sense almost depleted of eater the gas station service can actually look into the eater Delta and try to find by order for swarm city tokens for eater so when it finds one you will actually purchase it because it's like anonymous I mean you don't need an accounts or registration or whatsoever so we just created like a machine to machine trading that actually buys eater in exchange for swarm tokens so the thing is you can actually refill or automatically refill your gas station with easier to start again and closing that loop and so this can be fully automated so you don't actually need to manage the gas station anymore you just can have it run when it does the exchange you will actually end up with more ether than you started to it so you will end up in this situation with like one point one eater instead of one eater so yeah we thought it was appropriate to call that the gift that keeps on giving so thank you thanks for your time for your patience so yeah just we invite everybody to check out what we have been doing and it was really an honor to be here thank you for that [Applause] thank you an excision is the data and mechanics of saving the planet by gregory landau and restore carolina [Music] [Music] [Music] all right hi everyone I'm so grateful to be up here so my name is Gregory I'm here with Reece tow and we're going to be talking about region network so I'm gonna try to start on a pattern level to talk about what it is that we're up to because we're doing something that I think is sort of a unique and unusual at this moment use case of blockchain and distributed ledger technology so what we're up to is nothing short of completely reversing global climate change how are we going to do that how are we going to do that we're going to create a large ecological data network and a token system that incentivizes regeneration of Earth's soils so you know I wanted to talk a little bit I'm I'm a farmer I work with farmers I've spent my whole life working with soil so I'm not a developer we have some amazing talented developers on our team but I sort of wanted to just ground this whole conversation everyone here depends on farmers a hundred percent so who ate today alright so there are 500 million small family farmers that feed all of us every year and they're also the poorest people on the planet and they also happen to be the only people who can save us from climate change unfortunately centralized compliance based systems simply will not work and I think we could all understand that in this room so I'm going to show a really brief video that frames the carbon cycle and the potential of soil before we dive in a little bit deeper into the data mechanics of what we're up to if you're like most people you're probably feeling a little hopeless about climate change and the damage we've done to our planet well now there's a new way to look at climate change and how to deal with it that might just turn that hopelessness into hope climate change as we know is all about too much carbon in our atmosphere but carbon is not our enemy it's the building block of life everything alive is made of it even us the problem and the solution are simply a matter of balance let's step back and look at the five tools where carbon is stored on planet Earth starting about 500 million years ago when plants first appeared on land carbon began to cycle in an amazing balance between these pools a balance that allowed for life as we know it to evolve then one life form that would be us figured out how to extract carbon from the fossil pool which was pretty much a timeout zone for carbon we've been burning it for energy putting into play and disrupting the balance the way we manage land and do agriculture is moving even more carbon into the atmosphere specifically we've moved eight hundred and eighty billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which is heating up the planet and destabilizing our climate the oceans have absorbed a lot of this excess carbon throwing off the oceans balance resulting in ocean acidification and accelerating a mass extinction of sea life so in order to save life as we know it of course we need to stop burning fossil carbon the big question is where do we put this excess carbon to get the cycle back in balance the good news is that the answer is literally right under our feet it's the soil plants using sunlight and water naturally perform photosynthesis they pull carbon in from the air and turn it into carbohydrates sugars then they pumped some of these sugars down through the roots to feed microorganisms who use that carbon to build healthy voila carbon moved the plants pump it in and the soil stores it nature's living technology is amazing scientists have recently discovered that applying a thin layer of compost can help regenerate healthy soil setting up an ongoing feedback loop that brings more and more carbon into the soil each year together with other regenerative practices like not tilling the soil planting trees and cover crops and planned grazing we can build and retain billions of tons of soil carbon this is carbon farming this is regenerative agriculture unlike more carbon in the atmosphere more carbon in the ground is good for us it makes healthy soil which is nutrient rich and full of life and holds way more water this means more nutritious food and crops that are more resilient in the face of drought that's good news for farmers families and everyone who eats remember this the way we grow our food fiber and fuel either puts carbon up into our atmosphere or pulls it down into the ground the regeneration of soil is the task of our generation our health the health of our soils and the health of our planet are one in the same well I don't know about you guys but that gets me inspired every single time because that's a big crazy problem and it turns out it's actually not that hard to solve the challenge is being able to verify what's actually happening on a farm so that we can support farmers and incentivize them to be actively sequestering carbon so I just wanted to go through a couple numbers here to sort of frame the bigger problem and hopefully show how completely achievable it is so the the world soils have 320 gigatonnes of carbon stoy storage capacity we only need to sequester 128 gigatons over the next 20 years to completely reverse global warming Wow okay there's 500 million small farmers so you know we need roughly a third of those people to be participating on our network in our program actively regenerating soils so we've been working on two core aspects of our protocol one is proof of regeneration so that is the ability through farm IOT sensors and satellite protocols and drones and user smart phone interaction to be able to prove what's actually happening on any given farm in a decentralized way that is not owned by any central authority and to creating a reverse mining protocol that is the ability to mint tokens by proving that you've done something that's in the public good which is sequestering carbon into your soils so those are the two foundational pieces of region network so we're going to spend sort of I'm going patterns to these details here we're gonna spend a little bit of time coming right up with Rhys toe going through one of our pilot projects which is actually calibrating the proof of regeneration protocol at this moment with real-time sensor data from a farm in New Hampshire we're actively working right now on some of the scaling problems our network is going to have to be sharded there's no way around it and we also have to work a lot on identity because you can't have we actually have to have proof of identity proof of location as a core part of our protocol so just to sort of frame some of our technical challenges we're looking at validation of claim and outcome as a core part of the protocol verification of location identity the ability to validate data authenticity and also verify data integrity so I'm gonna hand it over to restore here so that he can talk a little bit about the role that streamer is playing and helping us develop a market for this highly valuable ecological knowledge that drives the incentive for farmers to be participating in this program thank you very much Gregor it's great to be here Grigory of course and his team are the experts on regenerative agriculture where streamer comes in is on the data side they're the key aim is to verify if the conditions are conducive to carbon accumulation in the soil to answer that question you need lots of data from various sources and that's where we can help there's a number of things which can be monitored on a farm taken together such measurements give a pretty good indication of soil health and liquor Librium and that's important because the carbon sequestration is one of the core functions in a healthy soil now we've got lots of data in here I won't go through that all just to mention some of these low-frequency like satellite images soil sampling some a higher frequency like temperature measurements numbers on electrical conductivity and so forth but the thing is that you need to combine data from many different sources in here low cost sensor data are important in the calibration of the low frequency carbon sequestration models in practice what you have to do is to collect transmit and analyze all of the data in real time that's the what we have here is the data mechanics how it works best reamer it's in you start with planting the centers in the soil the that's typically done maybe not by the farmer but by kind of specialized REI or tea companies next thing you do is the every time well sensor called vesicles life they send the data data points as JSON to streamer end point and then reach Network subscribes to the data as it arrives in here they analyze the data in real time calibrate the models verify the carbon sequestration what happens in between is that the data automatically kind of flows through the peer-to-peer stream network from source to subscribers the nodes in the network are incentivized by getting paid by data token for their efforts moving on each data point as it arrives is time-stamped appended persisted in the stream this is kind of the user interface of the streamer system the concept of three makes it easy to let analyze the data to historical playbacks of the row numbers and the analytics thank you let's move on and quickly show you an example of the data playback works on the streamer platform here we run through the sensor data from literally until a few weeks ago on the farm in New Hampshire the final points I'd like to make is that the same data can be valuable to many different audiences and data consumers in this case of course the region network is the prime user but this value in the data doesn't stop there apps companies can subscribe to the data user services such as day-to-day file management performance monitoring yield optimization irrigation harvest forecasting and so forth you can even think if there's any kind of financial people in the audience for other uses like having real-time information about the state of the crop weather events which can be immensely valuable for commodity traders in storage companies with a thought let me hand back over to Gregory for great to recap thanks Risto so [Applause] we believe that what we're working on here is creating a marketplace where farmers own their own data and can sell it at a premium to all of the people around the world who need that data from governments working on climate change initiatives to people who want to anchor supply chain transparency into their relationships with customers to commodities traders as Restore speaking about but fundamentally the beauty of the project is as those tokens are used to access this data the price of region tokens remains stable or goes up which incentivizes farmers who are the only people as I noted earlier who can mint new tokens so the only way that a new region token ever is going to come into circulation after the initial token generation event is by a farmer proving that they've regenerated soil so all of a sudden farmers are back where they should be which is at the center of the economic system as the people who are providing the base layer of wealth for everything else that's taking place so we're really excited about that we're really excited to be moving forward with new pilots in very challenging conditions this is a photo of a farm in Ecuador that we're about to be starting another pilot on so working with cacao farmers to measure the carbon cycle and carbon sequestration dynamics in in their ecosystem and I sort of just want to leave everyone with an invitation because you know what I've learned here at DEFCON 3 which is my first Devcon but what I also know from my work with farmers all around the world it is all about collaboration and the beauty of this space is open source collaborative approach to big engineering problems and I know we have a whole stack of them so we're looking forward to being members of this community and continuing to work on this amazing potential to have blockchain driven community empowered solutions reverse climate change and many of the other big problems facing humanity so thank you all very much [Applause] hello hello next up this morning we have Anton kalana vetch PhD and Serge a longshot with the presentation decentralized autonomous organization integral platform for climate initiatives the previous topic and climate change but from a different approach and I thanks to my colleagues that were speaking before us we can you know bypass the first slides but the difference of the approach is that we consider the environmental damages including climate change as a as in fact a damage which is caused by human economic activity in a general sense so more specifically every deal transaction or contract has its collateral damage and when you buy a gas or air ticket your air travel it is there is a collateral damage to the environment to human health related to it and in fact in the nearest years it has already become a business custom to assess the damage related to any sort of economic activity transaction deals in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent it is a very convenient thing to you know to evaluate environmental damage because it it reflects not only requirement change damage but also a combustion of fossil fuels out air pollution energy efficiency and that's why it's not only important but very convenient thing to quantify the environmental damage for example a few years ago there was a notorious study evaluating the damage related to indoor cannabis production in in the United States and the damage is as you can see the energy expenditures equal to five billion dollars one percent of electricity consumed in the US and one kilogram of indoor cannabis production equals to four point six tons of co2 and the recommendation was to you know to legalize marijuana because outdoor production would eliminate the need for indoor production so that's the the basic scheme that we're talking about there are three principal participants of the of the model the seller the buyer of goods and services and there is an you know mitigation outs of mitigation outcome provider and the mitigation should be equal or greater than the collateral damage produced by the deal between buyer the seller and once these three participants agree on the amount of damage and on the price for mitigation outcome then in the ideal world you know the the problem would be settled so but in real world it's far more complicated because there's all there should be someone who evaluates assess what the collateral damage is and there always is a person or an entity who wants to be in charge and tell the buyer the seller and offset provider what should be settled what shouldn't be settled what how they the damage should be assessed and everything there there is a regulator who wants to be in charge and that's why you know they although this market for mitigation for example of climate change damages is is tremendous and it's you know at maturity it will be at least ten trillion dollars and but it is fragmented into pieces and numerous barriers prevent from you know fungibility of the instruments there are dozens of climate mitigation programs and and new programs appear and units and instruments carbon units and I guess that one of the example was a previous presentation that a new very interesting program and the new carbon unit is proposed but basically they all operate with one in the same unit one in the same acid one tonne of carbon dioxide emissions were one ton of carbon dioxide reduction absorption but they are not integrated and the regulator's really you know choose and select who can assess the who can assess the damage who can participate and the on the market and our initial target wasn't still is to to provide an opportunity to overcome the barriers external barriers between those dozens of markets and systems and registries and to internal barriers which do not let anyone who would want to participate really participate in it so that's why we've created a platform that allows anyone or any existing or new mitigation program to launch its program on blockchain and to you know cooperate integrate to the extent they want to they might be fully independent or they won't or they would want to merge the markets or they would want to have a you know unified talking a unit but any of those dozens of markets carbon programs or instruments carbon compliance units may enter this this blockchain and anyone can actually right now go and launch his own mitigation program so what we have achieved for the moment we have you know issued transferred the units from a conventional registry to the blockchain and performed pilot transactions and we have also performed a issues of environmental units of carbon credits by passing a conventional registry directed to blockchain which is not easy because in a real world well you still have to you know to have a very reliable auditor in our case it was KPMG to verify sure that those reductions are real and comply with the rules so actually right now you can enter the the decentralized application to trade or to retire to to offset the carbon footprint or launch your own problem in fact as you know cryptocurrencies also have quite a significant carbon footprint and for example the Bitcoin network related the carbon emissions are equal to those of emissions of Cyprus and etherium Network are smaller emissions are smaller but still they equal to the annual emissions of Moldova so it's pretty easy to imagine that there is a there might be a talking proposed to offset the exact amount of emissions related to one Bitcoin or to one either we have a very vast you know development plans and developing the smart contracts and and everything but for the moment we might say that the the proposal of a high quality assured environmental units is already provided at the platform now that we are working on the on the demand as I've described you know the problem is related with regulator registries opposition to a new technology that would basically deprive the regulators of much of their authority and would probably kill the traditional registries so that doesn't go easy and a very one very important thing is to you know in the strategic perspective to eliminate the need for really physical auditor verifiers participating in this process and substituting it by Internet of Things algorithms plus a validation by the network and from this point I'd probably like to forget to take over [Applause] today my name is Sergei menshikov I'm research team leader at arrow up and our hit scepter in eyepiece I project my part of presentation will be about how we can prepare Mars for difficult 50 as you know Mars two days and not the good ways for humans it's a very cold place and atmosphere is not friendly for our breath and if we resolve issue with logistics with space six or other space program next question will be can we make Mars a little bit comfortable for deaf confusing and it's will be surprise for you but Paris climate agreement can help us because if you try find some abstract or executive summary about Paris climate agreement you will find main tasks of Paris climate agreement main task is keeping a global temperature rise below two degrees Celsius and it's mean the Paris climate agreement is the first planetary terraforming experiment based on economical game my main work is research capability of using human to machine systems and was three years we working on robot economics concept we want to build first planetary spine chain with direct economical communication between humans and Nations but Paris agreement today is not a human to machine system it's a human to human system with strong reputation requirements and this requirements boom is reticles because we cannot do in planetary experiment with this requirement but if we shift Paris climate agreement on zero Network Paris climate agreement can be human to machine system and look at the screen I will try to explain how it can be work we have five manufacturers around the world who want to be involved in Paris climate agreement at the same time we build smart cities around the world and this smart cities have many types of different sensors which can collect data about carbon footprint around manufacturers smart cities can send a no wrappers to serum Network we can install additional package on a serial network validators additional package with carbon created emission algorithm and after that zero Network an issue carbon credits green humans can buy this credit and our collected funds can be spread between green economy manufacturers smart cities who collect data and in serial network validators who involved in this process and if it will be work we just can't change the reforming task from Paris climate agreement to prepare Mars to DEFCON filled with the same scheme is the same software so today we have a smart contract package for carbon credit market tested with real participants we build the sterilizer application for human to human communication and my team error our team now try to build first carbon footprint sensors networked with serial network validators base it on our error distributive in the next year we will show first algorithm for carbon credit issues based on a serial network and we want to build herself for reducing your carbon footprint only with carbon credit based on a serial network here you can find more information about project and if you interesting in error distributive you can find more information error dot life website so keep on the way to DEFCON on Mars and we will try to prepare and do it much more comfortable thank you [Applause] hello up next this morning we have greg doogal doog orion so I hope I pronounced that correct with his presentation how cryptic payroll can improve the plight of temporary workers Claudia Martinez is a young woman from Guatemala she works in a pickle processing plant in Pittsburgh and she's a temporary worker and for most of the day she does this can any of you guess what someone who does this on a pickle plants assembly line is doing yeah she's a brine displacer she removes a certain amount of brine from the jar so that they can screw the cap on and move it on its way sounds pretty bad or a pretty pretty unpleasant type of job well it gets worse Claudia works Monday through Friday usually 40 hours a week and she doesn't get paid till the following Thursday that following Thursday she gets a paper check and after work she drives down to a check cashing place and she pays a fee takes her about a half an hour to get fee I currency and then she'd rise again to go to a wire service place something like Western Union to send some of that money back home to her mom and three sisters in Guatemala again more time more fees usually ten dollars to say send a hundred dollars back home pretty bad right right the fee yet system gets worse than that though because Claudia has waited so much time unfortunately she's organized she doesn't have to resort to this but they're 10 to 25 million temporary workers living similarly in the United States alone and many of them can't wait to get that money they can't wait all that time so they take recourse to something called a payday loan have any you familiar with payday loan yeah we probably know it's a very expensive unpleasant thing because a lot of times these people never get out of the hole they're constantly paying more and more interest it's a real sad situation the current Fiat system Jamie Dimon and his band of crypto capitalists and their Fiat system is screwing these workers and we need to fix it in crypto thank you so a little bit on me I'm Greg de Geary and I'm a founder of temp works software it's a software system that my dad and I wrote in the early 70s and I've been evolving from the early microcomputers and now my oldest children run the company were based in Minneapolis but it's very simple on a mature payroll system to simply add an adjustment that would go to a crypto pay card of course we have a number of challenges in this system right now first of all these pay cards aren't universally available we need them to work not just in London or New York but also in a remote village in Guatemala we're talking about tens of millions of transactions a day that we would need to be able to process for people to really take advantage of so I have a lot a lot a lot of challenges ahead of us whether we can get a show of hands how many people have worked a temporary job in their life Wow well it's almost everyone I was thinking okay these people only worked per hour decoding something but so you know what a tough job is like sometimes I feel my toughest job ever was to get Python etherium to work at my Macintosh so anyway temp works we've developed two different products on the etherion platform one is if you're familiar with DocuSign or hellosign it basically allows you to create a contract have different parties sign it post it to the blockchain we put a note up on the etherium reddit about that if you want to check it out the other is this crypto payroll system and basically it's it's wired together right now I got into this in 2015 because I was employing a large number of Filipino Filipino virtual assistants who were setting up sales appointments and and every Friday it was me who was going to coinbase and paying fifty hundred dollars seventy-five dollars and these people were perfectly happy to accept a crypto coin based users here how many like the interface yeah no no hands that I see it's pretty hard to do that using most most client software for sending crypto so the idea here would simply be that our our system as it evolves will simply be pay check just like any other paycheck with an adjustment that instead of going to your retirement account would also go to your crypto account it's something that we need to do we need to do this for humanity we need to do it for all these temporary workers we need to make it so that we're living in a world where instead of cloudiest spending all of our extra money and time driving around dealing with the Fiat system instead she's studying Python and aetherium and it's going to develop the next generation of our crypto solutions I'd like to thank the etherion foundation Mexican government all these wonderful workers who've made a it's so nice I'm just blown away by the quality of the other presentations I feel real honored to be up here but I think I think I'm really eager to hear from any of you can help me advance the solution and make it become a reality faster thank you very much [Music] [Music] [Music] okay next up we have human Haddad with his presentation blockchain for humanitarian assistance good morning my name is woman had died and I'm here to tell you how the United Nations World Food Program is using etherium to distribute aid to refugees this mission is to end hunger and traditionally this has been simple where people are hungry we bring food in kind like corn rice and so on and so forth and we give it to them so they can eat for a few years now we've also been doing something what's called cash based interventions which means that instead of giving people food in-kind we give them the means to purchase their own food and this can take the form of bank cards mobile money a voter's and so on and so forth and the idea behind it is that the beneficiary is in the best position to make their own purchasing decisions so that essentially you know instead of saying okay here's some food eat this they can make their own choice and there's the element of dignity in there and also that it can have a multiplier effect in the local economy in order to enable this sort of modality we normally have to rely on financial intermediaries such as banks Mobile Money companies and cash agents so what the services that these financial intermediaries provide you falls onto two broad categories one is practically accounting which is creating accounts for beneficiaries providing a distribution mechanism such as SIM cards or bank cards and so on and so forth authorizing transactions when beneficiary spend their entitlements and then eventually reporting to us so this let's call it accounting overall and separately it's actually paying the supermarket's or retailers where benefices have made the expenditures so a typical setup could be that at the beginning of the month the WFP gives a list of beneficiaries to the bank saying here's our beneficiaries here's how much each one is getting and they will create the accounts and load them and we also have to advance money for usually a month to the bank to enable this essentially transfers to happen the bank then contacts the beneficiaries saying here's you know you got some entitlements the beneficiary goes to a store initiates a transaction the store pings the bank for authorization the bank checks the account if they have enough entitlements they confirm back and then eventually pulls back some money periodic basis the bank will pay the store for the actual transactions that taking place and let's say at the month end we get a report from the bank saying okay this is what actually happened so a number of issues that exist with this model one is cost of course the bank will charge a fee for this and at all volumes that that cost can be quite high there's the element of risk because we're advancing money - to the bank and especially in the kind of places that we work that risk can be quite elevated if the bank goes bank robber accumbens fraud or whatever we have to share beneficiary information with the bank they need to know essentially who they're opening account for and you know privacy could be compromised there's the issue of reconciliation so when we get the report back from the bank we make all sorts of efforts to verify the report to make sure that the transactions that they say took place actually did take place and this is very laborious and time-consuming and we can never really be a hundred percent sure there's element of control so normally for [Music] everything we want to do to add a new beneficiary increase entitlements whatever we have to formally advise the bank and they would do it on our behalf and in addition to the administrative burden there could be a time delay which could mean somebody goes without food for a while we make a lot of effort to reduce our financial risk and also to protect anniversary privacy but this also means the contracting can take quite a long time which again would delay operations and then there's the issue of flexibility so for example if you wanted to do Eve hours and move our money and ATM and these companies don't talk to each other and we don't know in advance where beneficiaries are gonna redeem their entitlements we can't really enable this I mean the best we can do is you know divided a third third third or half and how but it's not ideal so it's not quite flexible so what we've done essentially is replaced the financial intermediary with blockchain and so what we do is now we load the you know create blockchain that accounts for beneficiaries load them with the entitlements we inform the beneficiary they have entitlements that they can use they go to a store they initiate a transaction the store now things are blockchain instead of the bank for authorization we check the entitlements provide confirmation and then at the same frequency that the stores got paid before we know essentially which store to pay how much by when and we make the transfer to this door directly ourselves just a clarification here we have bank accounts and this transfer currently is happening through regular banking channels in the future it could be crypto for example a digital national currency but the difference is that we have 350 global bank accounts that we use for you know banking staff payments buying corn and so on and so forth and the cost of payments directly for us is really cheap the main expense to us with the previous model was this accounting issuing cards he was terminals that was essentially the main cost so yeah just to clarify that you know we have our corporate banking emperor bank against our and then usually we have to have a separate bank to provide those distributions and that's what we've replaced it and so we did a quick proof of concept in the overcoat village in the same province of Pakistan in January and based on that learnings essentially we've launched the pilots in the ad hoc refugee camp in Jordan since May this year in the past five months we've been assisting 10,500 beneficiaries we've distributed 1.6 million dollars two hundred thousand transactions without a glitch and we've reduced the fees essentially by 98% so that is what that accounting portion cost us and the 2% is what's costing us to make these direct payments in the future with crypto or something else that could even go maybe near zero we're not sharing any beneficial information with anyone so again in a refugee context that's very important we're not advancing any funds to anyone financial risk is greatly reduced we have full control so if we want to change entitlements add someone new we can practically do it in real time so the assistance is not delayed and very important for us we've authorized every single transaction so we have hundred percent certainty that you know what we think happen actually happened and that significantly improves our reconciliation process and they associated payments so it actually reduces the effort on our side then because we don't have to worry as much about financial risk and Privacy Protection then we can actually contract people faster which means we can operate faster and we're much more flexible now because all the accounts are on blockchain we can connect to as many outlets as we want and they're all coming out of the same wallet so we can provide that flexibility to beneficiaries which again it's it's great so you might ask why are you doing this on a blockchain you could do this essentially on the traditional system and that's completely true we could but one of the main reasons is that there's currently a lot of fragmentation and duplication in the system and this is only for illustration but essentially imagine if we have Bob and Bob is receiving assistance from four different agencies each agency would have their own identity system for Bob they would have their contract with a separate bank and they would channel assistance through each one of these and of course you know there's a cost and effort required to maintain all these system the contracts was the bank and they don't talk to each other so that really the things are not optimized or harmonized in a way so what we're hoping to achieve and actually one of the reasons this exists is that that the technology in the past has prevented collaboration among the agencies but it's various ownership issues so if we have a system and we have a contract with a bank and someone else has something else we don't want to use theirs because it's not cool and vice versa and what we hope is that blockchain can cut through that as a neutral mutual mutually interoperable equally owned all of that you know open-source system then it's not really owned by anyone but it's just a mutually operated system that one can use and this way we can have beneficiary let's say identities or wallets on the blockchain for Alice Bob Dave and Aaron and various UN agencies can link to that and provide whatever service they want to provide and giving our various networks like frog for us this WFP was food retailers someone else might have health network like hospitals schools whatever else in my bibim can really dramatically increase the convenience to beneficiaries and if we're all using the same system we can really optimize and harmonize the global effort into unprecedented degree with big data artificial intelligence whatever it might be and i think extremely importantly the element of Financial Inclusion I mean even now without using crypto you know we've we were quite adding quite a bit of that to the people who may not have a bank before bank account before but with the advent of that you know investments loans micro loans insurance international remittances would be available to many hopefully soon at a low or no cost another reason of why blockchain is that essentially so we have now let's say not entity for a person on a blockchain and we as W if you are adding a financial transaction histories to it and just showing that you can spend money is not very meaningful but if you show that you can save a little bit of it that that might actually counts towards the credit history and this credit history now is not tied to a specific financial institution let's say in Jordan so if a stereo' refugee a Syrian refugee were to go back at some point they could transport this history with them and maybe get a small business loan and get back on their own feet if we managed to then bring other actors on board we can maybe add education data health data acid registries work permits and make this profile increasingly more and more useful to the beneficiary wherever they are without the fear of persecution for example because of their origin or whatever else it might be and I don't think it's unfeasible to think that one day maybe even government IDs could end up on the blockchain and we've heard here a lot a lot of things about our privacy protection zero knowledge proof and I know it's at an early stage but essentially this is the path who've just started and we hope as technology advances connectivity becomes widely available the price of smartphone goes down in a few years time this could full-fledged essentially to for beneficiaries to have more convenience and flexibility so our invitation is to other humanitarian actors who don't have a profit model built-in is to not reinvent the wheel so we have not set up we have essentially small contracts for cash transfers and we're asking event you know they have resources they join us open source free and dedicate the resources to making the system better more secure add additional modules like identity supply chain health whatever and also make it available for free so that it can essentially grow to be a system everyone can use currently we're using a private chain and mainly that's because the transaction throughput that we require can't be handled on the public chain but one day I mean philosophically were leaned if we can ensure security and privacy and all of that to move there so the system is self-sustaining and doesn't even require the backing of WEP or do you one or whoever else for it to function so yeah please join us to empower the world's vulnerable we really look forward to collaboration this is a photo from our proof of concept that we did January of this year and in Pakistan essentially and for this we use the test net to distribute food and cash to these beneficiaries essentially to illustrate the point that it can be done and using that learnings then we've done our gen pilot which is now going well as five months in production and we're soon going to scale up to a hundred thousand beneficiaries and a few months after that to five hundred thousand which is all of Jordan and from there other countries could follow that have you know that could potentially benefit from this solution I have many many people to thank of course WP itself for providing this earth the safe space for this idea to take root the etherium community at large was been very supportive the etherium foundation for allowing me be to be here today and get this message out and also rich poor oh rich put your hand up who we met at the singularity university around this time last year where this was just an idea we had very little resources and supports and we told him about it he helped us think through it and he pretty much hacked together what we used in this proof of concept in the photo that you see and he did it for free no matter how much we insisted he didn't accept any funds so in a way he gave us that initial push that we really needed to get this pilot flying essentially my email address is there if anyone is interested in more information and since I have a few minutes left I would actually like to show you a video of how how the system is currently working so in Jordan they happen to use iris verification even before we went so we wanted to seamlessly integrate into that so we don't change the beneficiary experience especially if we're going to fail and the system would have to be rolled back essentially so what you would see here on one side is the cash register at the supermarket in one of the refugee camps that you know they bring up the normal bill the amount comes up the amount is put into the iris scanning terminal the beneficiary scans their iris that iris then goes to be checked against an identity the identity comes back and at that point the terminal has both the amount and the identity of person trying to do it they pink or blockchain can this person do this transaction would reply and that's essentially the a lot of oranges you're on the bottom right to briefly see the amount 1218 teen beneficiary cancer iris transaction goes the iris imprint goes to the database comes back with identity now it's coming to our blockchain with the amount and identity and that's it I have four and a half minutes so maybe one or two questions I think there was one already there but in general in order to have you would need a private public key pair and do you have any solutions in place providing people with public private key pairs in such a way that they can control them and they have adequate security with them yes it's a good question the one of the things we cannot assume right now is hardware and connectivity for everyone especially where we are right now in fact the internet is cut off again we're building towards the future so as you might know Google SpaceX one web a whole bunch of people are working to bring affordable satellite internet everywhere in the world and the price of smartphones is dramatically dropping so I think by the time we're ready the standards right entity have been sorted out zero knowledge cruise whatever we can then transfer beneficiary private keys to them potentially under devices and the device could even have a biometric authentication to trigger the private key but for it to be it data to be stored with each beneficiary and not centrally not sure if answer the question I'm working with this handling the refugee crisis with Burma or Myanmar it's about 1.5 million people first question how many beneficiaries can be scale 2 sorry how many trees transactions can it scale 2 can it do a billion a day because we're looking at these kind of numbers with 1.5 million refugees the other question is can it also not just do payments but learning outcomes and then settle with some incentivized collection of meals or some kind of incentive and what do you think can we connect later because it's a sure get in touch my email is and so on the first question as I mentioned we did our proof of concept on the test nets but we're doing we're doing a private implementation right now and I've you know we can handle quite a bit of transactions per second so million it they won't be a problem in fact we're shooting more for more because the WFP itself has 80 million beneficiaries that we serve in 80 countries and you know we've heard over the past few days the efforts are in place to essentially speed up everything potentially even the main net and so we don't foresee the throughput to be a limitation either now on what we're doing privately or even in the future and then yeah I mean definitely that's I think the beauty of small contracts that you can program whatever logic you want into it so for example we have school meals which means that generally speaking let's say if a child attends school then the child and the family gets food so it's in a way to ensure children attend school and also that some nutritional outcomes are met and with smart devices and everything our yeah we can essentially sort of automate that so that you know the entitlements going to a small contract in escrow and if certain conditions are met then the trigger to the end recipient or recipients 56 seconds were really quick one in case cool thank you [Applause] okay next up we have Julian booty Lu and he shall be presenting ID box-cox cost-efficient device for self sovereign identity [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hello everyone so today I'll be talking about something called ID box ID box is it's a project for nonprofit building a foundation for identity in developing country so I will try to stay high level because it's I don't know much off time to view a very technical aspect to the product I would rather prefer telling you what I've been doing what we've been doing in developing countries around identities and I first bought myself from a developer entrepreneur and I've got a master need to Kona engineering and Master in computer science and I've been building different projects around FinTech transportation energy or kind of project and then I will tell you why I'm telling you all of this so the main problem worldwide already people a lot of people already mentioned this problem but you've got 1.5 billion people in the world don't like official identification and we're talking about countries where you don't have internet you know electricity and you don't want smartphone so if you think about all this different starter that try to solve the identity problem by building a very fantastic smartphone application for those people it's it's not relevant because they don't have a smartphone so they can really use the application so we we building we're using starting to use blockchain and we're building all this kind of crazy application but still those people they cannot really profit from the the new technology so I've been for the past nine months I've been trying to build something that developing country could use in order to first create a unique identity and then access to different services and the main goal is having a device that don't really need internet don't need a grid electricity and doesn't require a smartphone so and the people can use it by having either analog phone or by having a smart card and also has to be has to be cheap so anyone can actually buy it and the private information from the user is not saved into some database like the Estonian government is doing or like the other project from India so we'll quickly show you a video what I've been doing the video is a bit is nine months old so the project involved well you don't have time to date the video so that enables people within developing countries to create a unique identity the ID box device is composed of a Raspberry Pi SMS chip fingerprint recognition and a solar panel by combining these components it allows us to create a secure identity based service that will revolutionize the way that developing countries participate in a range of activities from Papua New Guinea to Ghana to Samoa we are able to ship the device to any local area even if they don't have power or the internet the devices which cost less than fifty dollars are hosted in a range of centralized areas like schools churches banks and coffee shops people use their SMS phones to text the ID box device to create a unique mapping of their phone and fingerprint creating a personal ID once someone has created an ID they don't need to use the Box again unless they want to assign their ID to a new phone across the country millions of people do not have an ID this is John he has recently heard about ID box using his phone and the local ID box which is located at is nearby church he is able to create a unique ID he sends an SMS to the ID box to activate the registration process he puts his finger on the fingerprint scanner the box then encrypts the fingerprint using an advanced encryption process and then sends the hash of the fingerprint by SMS to the blockchain attached with John's phone number if the identity doesn't exist it then creates a new identity on the blockchain and sends a confirmation message to John on his phone to confirm his new unique ID with his new identity John is now able to view his balance history of transactions he has made and to securely transfer money to other people who have created a unique ID each time John wishes to make a transfer with other active users his unique ID is verified against the blockchain he is quickly notified of his transactions on his phone he can also participate in voting systems health care registration and ownership of land thanks to ID box John's engagement with these activities has been revolutionized so this was the video from nine months ago so you can think about all the different problem is not possible today the private key or unique here from a fingerprint or it's not actually entirely true if you stay to your very local village and you use like kind of like fuzzy logic extractors and other stuff that's what I've actually been doing in two different places in the world that was the first implementation of the ID box looks like a bomb but it's not so basically use IV's sensor you got the phone number on the bottom of the box don't text it that was my mistake I put the phone number but no I had to delete it because people were sending me SMS and you've got a SIM card on the right hand side so basically the SIM card can be bought from anywhere in the world so you ship the box to this do the idea this is the main idea basically you ship the box to any local area and then you just have to buy a local SIM card to have either Internet communication or SMS communication and then the solar panel charge the box because you don't have electricity and you can also add a password and information on us on the screen then I build this new version that was the new version of the ID box version one I called it I want to Papua New Guinea to run a proof of concept that was using private private data based through for three different institution the central bank of Papua New Guinea the micro economy loan and mobile mobile mobile providers but the problem is this kind of box can be very easily Hucky and people can perform like if you try to copy your fingerprint from someone and then try to create a new identity so then I sorry I forgot to be moved and stuff then I raise quite a lot of money from private grants not ICO so with the money I was was caught with a lot of money but this was my new desk so I move from my desk desktop to my living room and I build open to the printer so basically the idea was to build kind of open source open to the entire project and build AI that everyone can actually build the ID box to create a unique identity so I designed and I put the file online so everyone can actually don't know them and can they can play with the ID box that was version so version one on the top and actually I'm I'm the first one I mean ID box is the first one to create a first 3d printed a Java card that ever can print and modify and can save like a personal token inside from a dairy fingerprint template I will show you why it's it can be used for so that's the that's a new ID box so you've got a Linux distribution system and a screen inside rather than having just bus baby pi because what we spiteful for people they're not really a technology they don't really you know I interact often with screens and technology in a very remote area so you do you have good screen and you can do different kind of you can access different services so you can you can involve yourself so you can create a unique identity and you can you can use the box as a vote system or send money or receive money so if you if you remember the previous presentation they were talking about how costly it is to receive money for those people in the village most of the time they have to travel and six hours into the capital to receive money from the son who for example walks in Australia so the sense and money to to Papua New Guinea to Western Union Western Union most of the time thirty forty percent and then the person's the village us to travel to the capital six ours cost them about one hundred hundred the local money over there which is almost the money they will receive for them son from their son so it's a complete disaster but this it can use that to get away from receiving money using an ATM card so you've got the sim card on the side you got a solar charging port you got charging port so people can actually sell electricity to other people in the village why is it important for people of the day they've got analog phone but they don't have system to charge the analog phones so they need to travel six hours to the top of the mountain and find someone who carrying very huge battery system and then they buy the electricity with this system a local shop they can actually buy the box and then sell the extra city back to the people in the village and it's a modular modular box so basically what it is is you can increase the security oh if you're talking about a big village and you you you worry about collision into creating your private or public key then you can add re sensor and blood sensor you can add different biometrics system so using the multimodal biometric identification system the at the end of the day the private key obviously is never saved because you are the private key that's the main idea of the project and you can encrypt either you can sign whatever you want so i canta fication system using you you body so Nick Johnson is over there so I create the I talked to Nick Johnson and a few people from from the same foundation like God and also other people from Swami know et cetera so I built this first ID box card they helped Nick and so basically we've got like but the entire village now has got the card so I can send you the unique public key of those people and you guys can actually send them money without passing by a Western Union so it's dark money from them which is very quick and I've been working on something new haiji box ad wallet using a new java count applet and using NFC and fingerprints the USB token I put it there because it was cool but it's not actually functionable and the idea is to basically use this card to sign transaction because those people in have a smart phone so the ID box will transfer the template or the private key to discard and then the user can actually put his fingerprint on the card and then sign a token transaction and then verify into the box that is the old person the pool concept so I'm gonna talk about this one this one's very cool so we we decided to go to Papua New Guinea not sure you guys know it's Papua New Guinea it's on the other side of Australia between and so you got New Zealand Australia and then a little bit further you've got Papua New Guinea Papua New Guinea why Papua New Guinea if you look at the statistic Papua New Guinea is probably one of the biggest country in the world where they people don't have their identity it's about ninety percent of the entire population that are not registered so they don't exist so that was a big big challenge if we can build the ID box over there if we can create identity in this village on this country then ID box can walk it can work anywhere so we won't day it's about five hours we got a little bit stuck on the way like it was like five hours and so imagine those those people first didn't have a car if they have the bike it's probably impossible for them to go to the capital and then get founded get the money from the Sun from Western Union because they got to travel six hours some time to take the bus I'll actually imagine what the bus would do in this on this road so the village it was very fantastic we scored and aloha you can look online and we register people from the village and they were really so for the main was very interesting because they can sell extra city back to the people into the village so they got incentive of buying the box because then they want to if you can sell electricity by charging the box then people are more they want to carry they want to take care of the box and then so basically what it does you create you create your biometrics send it to the card and also the public key of first the eastern card is linked with your phone number and linked with your public key of your biometrics and it's a village of 150 250 people so the collision into the village is not very high and you use also GPS based location system I know like proof of presence of of position is not very it can be hacked but if you add all this kind of boundary trick into the system then you can make hundred percent sure in a hundred percent sure but that the person that was created was unique and this is the local shot the man so you see we've actually done first transaction so this woman receiving from the Sun was in Australia and they want to local shop to get the money coming some looking at the time coming features so I've been looking to will be looking into knowledge proof so making sure because the main idea about identity which is very difficult to build is you want to build a unique identity system but at the same time you don't want to share your information so it's a bit competitive you you want to make sure I mean any service for businesses like Bank insurance and all these kind of big companies what do you want to do what they want to know they want to know that they want to be hundred percent sure that the person is dealing with is unique that's the main idea they don't really care about your information the only reason why they actually get your information they ask for your information is for them to make sure they are unique but if you can provide a system first if we can make sure is they are unique then there's no need for them to get to take your identity so I've been looking into and also talking with Fabian as well like it's building the editing tip protocol into the eastern which is fantastic so you also like system where you can add multimodal biometric system my fingerprint iris and blood sensor I'm saying that remember that this information is not saved anywhere that's the main idea so only the day with key who the public key is saved and then you always need to go to the Box to sign transaction well if you use the only the fingerprint with your card then you can use the card but you cannot use Ivysaur or finger blood sensor I've been looking into something called well actually I think we are the first one trying to do that but it's called them I called it then it the identity a I am it's basically like an ATM or more like for identity system and the road map so we've done version 1 version 2 done yeah we're playing a second phase of the photo type in PNG so we got big institution over there that following the project I mean actually part and partner with the project got some sort bank all the mobile provider insurance micro micro loan micro credit so you can all those different application can obviously be used by the ID box so it's for nonprofit so if you guys are very interested in trying or helping a partnering if you also building something with identity would be cool I think I've got time for a few questions and if you know so this one was a non-profit project and if only come this afternoon for I'm building a flying carpet so be a different discussion but that's it was the pups [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'd like to announce bringing the non crypto world into aetherium through social impact it's Jacob Georgia house key and Rafael Maz a [Applause] hi everyone I'm I'm Rafael I'm the CEO of Alice and this is Jacob who's our huzzah CTO and we're here to talk today about what we've built and how we're helping the non crypto world common to aetherium using social impact yeah so really briefly I'm going to give a quick overview of where we are which is that we've we've got a transparent donations platform there's been live since May on Alice dot si which is our website then Jacob is going to run you through how we built that the hybrid model that we use to bring mass audiences onto onto the platform and then I'll just give you a brief overview of the next steps for Alice beyond beyond donations so if you know Alice it's because you know transparent donation platform and the idea there is that you can give to a social project you can see exactly what impact your money makes and if it doesn't make an impact then you get your money back and the project that we have live on the on the on the website right now is a project run by a homelessness charity called st. Mungo's and they are helping 15 rough sleepers in London find accommodation and deal with mental health issues substance abuse issues and the way that it the the reason why we we built this really is because in the last few years there's been a loss of public trust in the charity sector and the charity sector has really starting to see this as an existential threat because without trust the level of donations tends to tend to fall and so that's why we built this this this donation platform the way that it works is that when you when you go onto the onto the website you can donate your donation gets held in escrow which means it gets frozen basically in smart contract during that time the charity can start running the project and and started delivering the the goals that it that it set out to achieve so it lays out in in in the pilot st. Mungo's has laid out a certain number of goals and but it's only when the goals are independently validated that the money from the donations gets paid to the charity and in this case it's the Greater London Authority that the the Mayor of London someone in the housing team that reviews the proof so if that's a rental agreement for example if someone's find accommodation then they will they will validate that and at the same time the validation triggers a notification to the donor so they know exactly what their money has paid for so it's how the blockchain works what is the blockchain all what is necessary is to have a plane without any plug in so there's no need for complicated tools like a mist browser and as the whole world mostly uses fiat currency we do not want to force our donors to change fiat into crypto get through a crypto wallet and do 98 we allow for a plain credit card donations which is the most popular way to donate and let's see how it works out in the practice so that's one of our first donors actually it's my mom she's she's 67 years old and she's not a crypto geek at all she she stopped casting Kappa the technology in the late eighties when the video tape recorder was released but she know how to use Internet she know how to write an email check the weather and recently she was able to put three transactions on the main atrium blockchain using our Alice platform how was it possible so whenever a user registers an account on our platform we on the user behalf create a YouTube account which is safeguarded by a password so every interaction every transaction need to be signed by air entering the password we also perform via tokenization so when we accept the money there are stable stable coins issued that are pegged one-to-one to the original value and the full Reserve is keep aside and we're happy to say that earlier this year we took a part in two regulatory sandbox provided by financial conduct authority which is a UK regulatory body and to our knowledge were the first company to use fully regulated digital Pound Sterling provided by trauma lexlabs and from a user perspective the transaction is recorded after he clicks on donate button and then we use and I synchronous relay just to further process the transaction and put it on a blockchain and this solution proven to be quite useful because roughly a month after we launched we noticed some strange behavior in the relay so there was severe delays and a lot of retrials and she was a day 25 June when there was an status ICO so from the point of view of our donors nothing changed at all they were able to submit donations and we process it as synchronously and they were eventually recorded on the blockchain and to be honest were first scared before we will start at the pilot because we are all about trust and transparency so even if we miss manage a single transaction that will be disaster for the whole idea that's why we are using a triple registration system so we register donation on a virtual wallet provided by a payment provider we register on our classic database and we obviously register it further on the blockchain currently we have a hybrid model but we want to go for fully decentralized and trustless solution but along the way we want to take small steps not to sacrifice the usability and safety for the donors the next step for us was to implement something that we call the geek mode it's a section on our platform then the user can browse and explore all of the transactions that will mate with his interactions and for users who has a plugin that allows to connect to block train like a web tree connector we got a very simple table but with a restricted read-only access that you allowed to check a balance and what goals were achieved by these users and before we allow our donors to enter the Wild West of the blockchain we want to equip them with safety features like one of that is a donation wallet so all of the transfers outside of the world cannot be directed only to authorized verified projects because we want to shield the users against scam attacks so if they receive offer to donate via slack channel email from an untrusted account they will be unable to process and donation wallet also offers a way to recover if the password was too lost so we can set up a multi seek recover procedure so in a case that you lost a password this you are still able to set up a connection to a new account we also focus on the security of the phones that we are collecting so we other extra features for our treasury like a two-face transfers when they need to be initiated and violated later on the transfers can be time locked we also introduced a special rollover whistleblowers that may raise an alarm if the transfer looks suspicious but without any acting power because acting powers in the hands of a curator my we found the transfer we also used classic features like freezing the treasure reconstruct and escape hatches emergency and as the project and practice are evolving and iterating and if a charity cannot achieve all of the goals it is possible that charity submit a proposal update that is later on voted by donors and beneficiaries and if that cost is valid the configuration of the project may be change we built an abstract layer around our data so we tokenized that in the forum that we store meta information about who was the author of the data at what are the access right and the full evidence is kept in off-trail encrypted database that is synchronized notarized the blockchain why do we need such a structure forward I would refer to explain yeah so this has to do with the the broader vision of Alice which actually goes beyond donations and obviously transparency is really important for small donors because they're they're losing trust in in charities but it's actually also important for a whole host of other social impact actors for example big philanthropic trusts and foundations they are increasingly giving grants based on evidence so it's very important to measure that government in the UK the US Europe and increasingly other countries shifting also their grants to payment for success models where they only pay when when outcomes social outcomes have been achieved and then over the last 10 years or so there's been a real rise in an alternative source of funding in the form of impact investment so what impact investors do is when they invest obviously they they're looking for a financial return but they're also looking for a social or environmental return which means that it's really important for them to track that data and the big problem is that unfortunately when it comes to impact data we're still in prehistoric times everybody is systematically reinventing the wheel everybody is measuring things quite differently the standards that exist aren't really aren't really widespread and really importantly all of that data tends to get stuck in the individual databases of all of these organizations so it makes it really difficult to access and compare and benchmark projects to see which ones are the are the most effective so we are going to build three main evolutions on on the Allis Network the first one is really starting to break down what goes in that impact data so we're going to require that that social organisations break down their their projects across five dimensions those five dimensions have been developed by the impact management project with who we we're collaborating it's a big open source research project that's done some research amongst over 700 practitioners all around the world to to build a framework for how to to measure manage impact and effectively the projects will be tagged across those five dimensions and we're also going to require social organizations and projects to produce regular progress reports against internal performance indicators and the way that we're going to enforce that is that they will be rewarded they'll get paid for for submitting those those reports and if they don't submit them on time so for example then they will be punished with all further payments withheld until they do and that payment for reporting is that also at the core of what of what we do because what we what we're going for is not making impact projects cheap but effective so you're probably familiar with this kind of pie chart that social organizations produce showing exactly how much money goes to admin how much money goes to PR or fundraising how much gets to the front line and actually we don't think that that's the most important thing at all because it doesn't really tell you anything about how effective they are what we prefer to focus on is tracking the impact so how many people have been helped is this social project actually improving the lives of the of the people that it serves so we're not tracking the money we're tracking the impact the second major evolution to the network is that we are going to incentivize users to take all of that impact data that's been produced by your projects across the network and crunch that data so that you can really surface the most effective projects so that funders can can help scale them and we're also going to build prediction markets that allow users to bet on whether the the proposed changes to projects that are submitted in the in the regular progress reports for example are likely to increase or decrease the impact of of those projects and the idea there is to crowdsource the expertise of people across the network to really help charities learn from each other and iterate their projects to really make them as effective as possible and finally what we are going to build is another payment module that's focused on impact investment because what we have right now is that donors give to give to the the social projects that those funds are held in escrow and they're only paid out when the goals are validated now the problem there is if especially if you're a smaller charity you might not have the financial resources to run your project before getting the money so that's where the impact investors come in they will provide some working capital some seed capital that they will give to the to the to the project so they can start them effectively what they'll be doing is underwriting the risk so if the project never produces any results if it never achieves its goals the investors will lose their money but if it does achieve its goals and it gets paid from from the donations in escrow then part of those donations will go to reimburse that investment so that's that's pretty much it that's the that's the broader vision we're building a fully integrated decentralized social impact ecosystem so that social organizations can tap into donations and grants and impact investment so that they're their impact is properly managed and transparent and accessible supported by validation market so they can easily choose validators for their projects whether those are human validators or Oracle's and by knowledge sharing markets that help crunch that data and surface the the most effective projects and that's really what we're all about is really identifying the best projects helping them scale and the cutting transaction costs across across the network now we've just published a white paper today just a few hours ago so we invite everybody to go onto our website and read that it covers everything that we've just that we've just explained in in a lot more detail as well as some some really interesting stuff that we that we're building as well that you'll that you'll be able to read about on the on the white paper like a decentralized fund to help to help smaller organizations really design and and run their projects transparently on the network thank you very much if you have any questions [Applause] over here please Christian sorry over here hello hi this is quite a tedious little question actually um just the matter of issuing receipts to donors I've always found that to be just a real pain in the backside but if it particularly for comes via a bank account so does your module have what what do you do by way of how do you issue receipts to your mother when she's paid her donation so that's that's something that that we actually spent a lot of time on currently the platform can be used only in the in the UK and we went through all the regulatory hoops to make sure that that people could get receipts when they donate they can actually apply Gift Aid if you know how that works in the UK it's a way of gifting the taxes to the to the charities and we had to get the the regulatory the regulatory authorizations to do that it gets applied when the donations come out of the of the escrow because you can't claw it back afterwards but then obviously as we expand to different countries we'll have to we'll have to figure that that on a case by case hi sorry to be a little more critical and harsh on you but how I saw the presentation is more like you're doing charity I see Oh instead of actual actually empowering civil society to perform social causes and it looks to me that like you're commercializing civil society actions which I think it's a quite a slippery slope from civil society point of view and I also want to point out that like not far from UK three hours flight from there in Romania there are only six or seven percent of people buying online so you also have to take this into account that other countries are not so used to paying online and this transaction is not going to have that big of adoption rate and also in terms of terminology when you say the nation it traditionally points to a gift you're giving money to someone or just to an entity and you do not necessarily ask for something in return well in this model you ask for performance so I would suggest turning a little bit these terms around because the nations are gifts and this is not what you're doing in this model so just on the on the first bit on the commercialization I didn't quite get where you see the commercialization of charity that when when you when you put a high pressure on different activities performed by a civil society for receiving that type of money right but so it's not so much commercialization as just tracking the the impact so I think all of the your your points absolutely valid I think the reality is that the lack of trust or the decline in trust is very real and unfortunately what happens is that then people get completely obsessed in this really toxic debate around how people spend their money and that's what I was referring to before how much goes to admin how much goes to fundraising and that for me is actually completely counterproductive because it leads it leads to charities trying to be as lean as possible they end up under investing they can't pay high quality people to run projects and so that's why we track the data so and the performance the way that we mitigate what you're saying that's where we bring in the impact investors it's also we're going to implement some models where not all of the money gets paid when the impact is achieved so you could have a model where half of your donations get paid to the charity upfront and then half of the half of the payment gets paid upon achieving the results but really what it is is just an incentive mechanism to make sure that the the the social organizations deliver on on the impact that they that they promised essentially and restore that trust and ultimately what we want to do is just help them raise a lot more money than they are raising at the moment so they can really tackle social and environmental problems at scale and I think on the on the last on the last point or the second point that you made which was a lot of people don't donate online that's true but you know what a lot less people even donating crypto so that's why we're adopting a hybrid model it has to be online for the incentive mechanisms to work and hopefully as as online giving becomes more widespread then they'll be able to spread it out to a lot more to a lot more countries and donors I hope that answers your questions [Applause]
