foreign [Music] the founder of earlier so earlier we are basically building the runtime execution and the elastic scaling layer for ethereum so before we dive into like earlier we want to know like what kind of fundamental problems we want to solve right so right now we know like ethereum posts emerge and later on we also have this product sharding and lots of like scaling Solutions will be applied like sort of ethereum at the same time we have a bunch of L ones can achieve some sort of had through food so with low latency but at the same time as we can see right for the past two years there are more and more popular applications like x infinity d y d x and also upcoming more and more games which already have like millions of users and have to handle like sort of tons of meeting requests every day so in that case as you can see right um like for the past two years we encounter a lot of network injection gas War even for some iot like sort of means like one example on ethereum is this other deed like I have to me right so basically people probably pay more gas fees than the mid fees um it's not just um like sort of the scenario on ethereum but also on some uh highly scalable blockchains like a polygon we had these sort of sunflower uh game right but at the same time just like so many transactions and the congestion in the network uh same issue to RB Trump basically we had a very successful campaign to onboard more user but at the same time it's just like so popular and at the same time the network was so congested and then they have to pause until the Arbitron natural came out so they can resume such campaigns so how we solve this kind of network congestion problems for general purpose at once so one like sort of a thing we observe and basically on our side we want to propose is uh about this application tailored out to execution layers that's something like when we feel like there will be some Network congestion for for the applications so the application probably can just spend off a dedicated layer for them to handle these transactions and in that case all the transactions and requests can be handled on dedicated layer and later we can roll up all the states back to the l1s and that's all we call it like either we call this elastic layer 2 or we can call L3 so some Matrix as you can see right earlier we can really provide a very high throughput like sort of execution environment with very low like sort of transaction fees we very fast finality um like right now some metrics with some updated and basically we can really achieve a sub-second block time and we even with like tons of thousand transactions per second I mean we are also support both evm and also wazan so there are two products we would like to provide the first one is like sort of short-lived application dedicated your lab and we call flash layers and later I will just share with you why we want to have this short-lived flash layers I mean well there's a persistent rule of solutions quite similar to the other like existing optimistic Road labs and the idea to have the flash layers is quite straightforward for a lot of Demands and requirements from the applications because we can see right for a lot of empty projects one of the biggest like sort of campaigns is the empty means and also sometimes it's airdrop right for this short-lived campaign right typically only lasts for a few seconds or a few minutes in that case they can just like sort of click a bunch of buttons via our dashboard and protocol will automatically teaspoon of a dedicated layer to handle the millions of requests for the empty means the user can just do the empty mint and everything will be handled properly within a few seconds or minutes after that protocol will automatically roll up all the states I have to expect to ethereum without sort of any like third-party interaction like at the same time right apart from the FD means we also want to provide very smooth user experience in that case there will be like sort of first account for the serve and also a bunch of add-ons to make sure like it can relatively easy to onboard empty projects and also for some game projects beyond that as you know right for a lot of games or even some direct exchanges they want a dedicated layer not just for short leave your time a short period of time right also for a long time for months or even years in that case we will have this typical optimistic roller for it either like our platform right the performance is quite good at the same time it's both evm equivalent and also was I'm compatible beyond that we also have a bunch of implementation for the like clients for example in the future users or developers can just run the like client or the verifiers in their browsers in that case you don't need to wait for the confirmation from the L2 Network so they can quickly verify the latest transaction or the latest block themselves in that case it can further shorten the sort of challenge period and plus with some Hardware hardened the sort of warfares as the challengers so we can further like sort of really reduce the verification or even the challenge period beyond that right as we all know the bunch of state of Art and new ZK libraries and also a bunch of game and metaverse sdks which are not solid compatible in that case we still want to support these libraries so we have this wazam compatibility so we can allow the developers to deploy these libraries and literally can use the solid contract to call these libraries to really have a versatile execution environment for the applications um beyond that I write we also did a bunch of like sort of campaigns and use cases ourselves to show up like sort of the capabilities of earlier one night we did one of these um OG badge mint like two months ago we got like over 12 000 people participate in this campaign and all the ifts minted within 18 seconds on the dedicated like sort of flash layer as I mentioned right so after the empty mint minted like within minutes so the protocol can automatically roll up the activities back to ethereum so right now everyone can just treat the isotherm empty around for price of 0.6 liter or something and another like sort of example is is about game and we hosted this um like Community round for that Forest like three weeks ago and we attracted like uh tons of 100 players to play the game and uh and this and basically precise around 100 000 transaction per day the feedback we got from the players died basically they didn't really notice is a full launching game so the performance and also experience are quite good and in that case right as you can see apart from this good performance and also seamless experience we can definitely support both nft and also game projects yeah and right now like uh last week we launched the evm equivalent testnet so everyone can just try out the like sort of the product for both of the systems and beyond that soon we will just connect to more air ones especially the evm compatible ones and just try to provide a much better solution for both rft and the game and also derivatives exchange applications yeah that's sort of like all about the earlier and if you want to find more information just feel free to DM me on Twitter yeah thank you very much thank you so much big round of applause
