[Applause] all right summit it's more like a game type activity with the light to them again but we are the guiness of blockchain team fun fact UNICEF has the blockchain to you my name is Ariana and you know when it is Chris and my name is Miranda we're based in New York at the innocent tech bricks so if you know maybe this stuff is the UN Children's Foundation or Children's Fund that I should say and we are part of the initiative as I mentioned we explore emerging and frontier technologies or UNICEF and kind of these cases to the bribery UN so today we will be talking about connectivity and the inference of designing with the strings in mind so it UNICEF we are focused on certain program countries in other countries that are low resource - of resource constraints meaning that they don't have access to all the same resources as developed countries and so today we will be doing on him it's an immersive game which what all these tables are for to help me think about when you're designing your table seating for programs what it may be like to have internet activity constraints thank you so the basic agenda is that I'm going to talk for 12 minutes or so and then we get to try it out this game but before we do that can you if you have a phone you pull up your phone get one phone give you a two phones have two phones if you got a Nokia 1100 yeah this is the best phone ever made ever this it we've like the pump in charge last week seven days and at one game because that our team looks a lot at how we can design solutions for people who may be using a phone that's closer to this then to the computer the supercomputer outlets that we all have in our pockets and hands and so you know just to spend that first 10 minutes to talk about why this is important to everybody in this room and to the world that we live in as Arianna said you send us this really old organization at 7 years old it works in every country in the world in some way or another and it has a 7 billion dollar a year budget which is stuff that we knew when we joined the organization but it's a big market shaping organization as well so it starts to buy things like pencils well more importantly vaccines it begins also shape global markets which is kind of interesting it uses that huge amount of money to influence the way that companies produce products and goods and this is really important because our world is faced with a huge number of issues now that we weren't faced with 10 years ago one of the examples is the outbreak of Ebola that we're finding moving quickly through the dr congo and elsewhere in to the region although still a ton of cases have appeared around the congo but people is a disease that spreads quite quickly in it as particularly when there is information around we're going to just to example some type of Ebola we'll talk about schools one of these is happier than the other the bullet is the less happy so as we look at how we as an organization work with governments to predict where a disease like Ebola is going to sprint you can do it really easily in a well connected see if you remember the Google Flu Trends stuff from about five years ago as you get a lot of data months from all the stuff that we're generating on our rich phones these it's pretty easy to track brand having a screening but if you're in Eastern B are calm down there and I asked you mercy while they're going to spread it's pretty hard to tell me as an epidemiologist or data scientists if you ask me where people are it's pretty aren't tell me because this thing is paying a whole bunch of towers and Wi-Fi hotspots and everything else so we're gathering like Facebook's gather all the creepy information about us that we don't wanted to and network operators are also but that provides a web of connectivity that allows us to know where people are in the connected world but in the world of the Nokia 1100 or less it's really hard to figure out what head of data is being generated and this from the heart to figure out where people are moving where people are moving is rare diseases move right so if you want to track if you're not me technologist as I'm tracking disease but there were people move because we're in person moves and disease goes but this is the type of tool that we often use to track diseases and so when we were are he was in Liberia during the last people everyone 2014 this was a map map that we used this was updated the refresh rate of this two days and you couldn't zoom in on it very well and so that was the time about that we were using to figure out where Ebola was moving and Liberia however the type of stuff that were able to do with data scientists and the team every smart people is to look at I take the type of big data that comes out of a mobile phone like this aggregated and turn it into intuitions about rare diseases spreading and in fact we've done this in the dr congo you can see and some of the results of our work here doesn't even predict where populations are moving might be bias in a mobile phone data and that's really important because those diseases affect all of us they affect that's us in this room here infect people in geneva and stockholm in new york because we're suddenly a connected world but we're not even in the connected world if you look at a country like Mauritania this is a map of Mauritania see through data science and the white triangles here are roads those are roads which have mobile phone towers on them that's what those triangles access the cell tower the dots are schools the schools in the Luneberg schools that have to G the schools in yellow with the 3G connectivity so the 2g schools can send a text message it's kind of mean in the schools that are gold or yellow you can do something more sophisticated the schools that are red those dots there have no connectivity at all that's where there's no seat well there's no way call to understand whether diseases can spread and if you ask a doctor an epidemiologist they'll tell you that if Ebola starts here it'll spread along this quarter and then again that's an intuition that we have it exactly work very easy we can gather that data but it's really hard to do if we don't have a good connectivity obviously to our connectivity also comes opportunities for businesses for building apps for looking at the next generation of users but the user experience has to be very different because if you're using something like this it's really hard to think of all the stuff that we sometimes take about company designing for a smartphone and so we wanted to talk a little bit about that with you today and we've all come to a hotel over you haven't had Wi-Fi it's the most important thing more important into a room so we're all kind of familiar with that Maslow's hierarchy of like getting connected but we wanted to actually put ourselves in a position in the next 20 minutes or so 30 minutes where we run ourselves through a game about connectivity and we'll explain why later on connectivity is a global problem we've been having connectivity in countries Brazil and Colombia as are the same maps that we showed you in Mauritania in Kerry soon and the number of schools all those dots the red dots but how connectivity is huge there's no way to solve that with traditional money there's not enough dollars to put into solving that problem right we need to think about other sources of value other ways they can inject capital into the system to connect people the generate the data that we need to be safe but also to ensure that people all over the world have access to the opportunities that can be taken for granted in the connected world and so it's a question of access to information is what we're going to spend the next 30 minutes or so doing with some layers we're going to look at what it means to be connected we're going to challenge you to do something very frustrating which is solve a challenge where you don't have access to your phones for the whole time the test group that we did this particular like pop your phone bill and put it away for a little bit they've all become clear in the instruction the test group thought you did this has been almost revolted against us because they found it so frustrated to do simple things like figure out a song lyric without access to the Google which is tough but we're gonna try to do it together and you may be frustrated at the end you'll feel a sigh of relief as you are able to be connected again but the reason we're going to challenge you to that is because we believe you would like to propose a solution that's like a proposal such thinking around how we could create some of this connectivity and use all of your brains in the room to do that so the end of this is reductive if you stay true home look at some solutions for how we prepare for the jobs in the future how we start to get in front of some of these pandemics that are spreading how we monitor things like climate change where they're not happening in urban environments and how we certainly do with people who are stateless or disconnected who are immediately out of the whole international context that were working on so I want to pause there we're gonna go into the next round but again say thank you to all our team into jazz for you in the back of the room is joining us from Tokyo from the USF office there and you never you mr. this from UNICEF France as well so there are a few other colleagues of ours who are here and very excited to see how angry and frustrated we can get as we become disconnected for the next half hour and how we can work together to build something pretty exciting thank you see okay game time so what we're going to do from the next 40 minutes is there will be a video that we will queue up that will begin with instructions and so we're going to ask you for the next 30 minutes to put on your goal playing hat they gave us praying for the lens of being a spy and having to solve our challenges and puzzles to channel your inner James Bond in here and solve some challenges through being disconnected so you will see on the video and we'll have the mic the sound system is a bit off so we will have the mic next to the speakers on the laptop but there will be sound q so for some parts of the game you'll be able to use your phone for other press the game you won't be able to use your thumb as Chris said it's going to seem confusing there's instructions also in the bags on the table but we're going to the few minutes and allow you to self-organize around the table so ideally there are about 20 to 30 people at each table and then we'll give you time to get adjusted and then we will queue the game so we'll take a couple minutes down can stand up you can bring your phone with you yeah so there's 30 people all max 30 people per team so some organized really introduce yourself friends all of us but we will now play the video and so I get to give you a background of the video will have instructions so there's going to be a narrator who is giving instructions they do go times fast which is why we've included a printed version of the instructions and then we're going to play the video for 40 minutes that has the time cues for the game so the video will be playing for the next 40 minutes and here we do I love spies welcome to your training session and there's only several rare and expensive items and it's in different solutions your task will be to figure out what has been stolen where it has been hidden and what are the instructions for one of our agents by giving them top-secret fill code for the location you'll find a series of hearts on the table worthless icon before the image will find parts with this lifeline no definitely need the internet for this for the girlcode you'll find parts with my Legos the Golem is a serious number excel translate to a phrase such as the eagle has landed separate results in two groups the importance of which has to be like to do would you like to find or would you like to point an image or maybe it like to work together then one of the spies will shuffle the deck and deal cards to each spy including themselves throughout the session will see a great sign which answer confuse your phones and share your card so they're spies you'll also see a red light which means to put your phones down to take parts back injury did not show them to other people remember even wonder if there is always once you mention the image created by trying on a key part what's essential no code shown to facilitator if you get it right they will give you further instructions in if you get it wrong well so in the debit card that you have there are actually three sets within that so once it has eyes on one side once and welcome back by class and one set of numbers and so the idea that there's 30 people each because it's a team your team of 30 give yourselves up make sure every part do not show your okay now deal the cards great player so useful when your curves make sure everyone has a card this is happening yeah so if you have a team that doesn't have 35 some people may have to have two parts okay we'll begin in pressure on the instructions are on your table so it's red [Music] and you can't sugar cards one another [Applause] [Applause]
