[Applause] that's okay so we know that dear listener terms it's a stream of privileged senior German ignition and something that is quite choose to because of specific formatting which is can be aggregated means that pushing your Charles 1000 signatures initial cousin all back the vilification this party this refugees that comes towards sometimes issues so Commission is home to and I simplified a little the way truth in the term to the vandegraaff say sorry other stations but thousand already the dolls beside thousand of other stations but when you intersect us at the stations when you receive in your garage you won't have each side always in each other properly you would get reverse initiatives because someone with I met them how much will happen the blood is an analytic signature and so it means that much smaller even wonder is a nice low setting so if I can multitask on what it means forget an ignition is most primitive and the specific which means that returned owner to train the order okay that's kinda for modernization we can have one set of signature argued by someone another set I will get it by someone else a very vintage this going I get producer and your mother you're done except that we small parts which means we've actually to set the same signature when you aggregate we will add something back which is basically Pleistocene your job which is it isn't really right so if we simplify when you ever get in the scene details you'd report when they get twice per section be the fact that because I give them is that they have application for the control just use one of them and then its importance but dozens of addiction public art but then an event is Byzantine jolly well fantastic some of them some of us about nervousness so if I ask what hundred is about we can guess that it's a gating via the signature being fast and we say fast it's possible signatures ability in seconds I can't internal so you're going to aggregate between thousands of notes and some of its notes we'll try to cut down by the minute we can do whatever levels and in your life which we have a family not without us that a lot of diversity I buy this but in a network you will have thousands of nodes with different capacity some of them very fast of their slope as it is some of them will be when we're interconnected there will be some are lots of course under penalty twice and that will be somewhere else what does it return a possible plan to use and improve in this one if you look at a specific issue we took what we had is basically in the south we target community size so quickly nobody tells of the size the committee in this wonderfully visited one one second over time as well become centimeters of Earth's vision is what you I forget comma become shy and at this point what you both will harvest accepting a picture of a super what you think is let's select a subset of a node from the committee's 16 unless as well variation forward become show and we have despite an education different 16000 how do you miss to be fast because the land is if you can be very fast about one or two seconds pounds for a traditional leopard it means that in two gloves to petrify deity so that's what what to do and we set some taxes to them whatever so about us so when you have such a problem as if you looking at competitively through the time complexity and message complexity annual is not porous and decided you can learn more for me on this size of his money okay and we'll see that some particles as the initials are quite easy to aggregate it's very very nice so time complexity is easy to get our message so thanks just a simple this evening solution by simple visiting I'll tell you just the fruit busy pursuing stuff not just sending your signature everybody does that and so and it's not absolutely bad you will have this time complexity and basically because such a fraternity 12 and you expect us at some definitions overtime capacity is good enjoy and the message complexity do all the nodes in the network won't assign once accomplished Nichelle's between the ends well minimum we were rooting for the quality that we probably can extend to but intonations of alcohol sweat is weapon and aggregate with you for some of us it's a fixed-size which is a vintage 80s which is especially the current survey that slow but is to travel with like this so of the DS issues twin cities and some so what we find the beginning is active then we continue on the recipe network but can be kind of confessing things like if we can aggregate so as a receiver signature becoming a get we will and instead of sending our solutions will send some a high negative it in hyper to verify this part because if someone's and to a back to nature and we get without verification when your whole thr will be bad too when you stop to do this you have to make a variation that you receive and the men will not work on that because different sending something integrity and someone else as I created and it allowed your debt coming in on a new service so what we did at this one's okay actually we know all the signups also nominees this committee so we can give our body just by using the public key that we know which is so based on the position in the power will be the light so we know that but now a set of notes with no cones so there is a component that's eight notes is 0 1 and so on and we are kind of organizing where my conditional my syndicate when not 0 we aggregate the signature on that one and that's it so if you miss you the solution for not one attacker gets is not quite by cell phone to actually run five exam and you can move on to a next event additional activity - and now we receive two and three I think it so much you're spotted you it's it's nice it's nice but good points among us or less difficult the last possibilities time again busy to actually receive two things can we wait a little bit longer and so you can do things but you feel relieved at least nothing to fight so you need to do something better at this part we produce a set of techniques so actually because someone wants a to be symmetrical okay you practice you know what we're not a baby any ideas anything instead of kind of open that you will get the signature from water to parts of us organizing things and zero is going to send in signatures to mind because you know as one with entities but this one has the time the first form Australia and disabilities you will send in signatures to 1 1 to 0 okay and then we can aggregate so it's like negative and it means that at the next level when 0 and 1 we accelerate immediate signature is what will the aggregation is for me succeeded because such way lenders know by diffusion and then you go through an experience and so on and so on so easy to block an event which is good for if one knot is now secure please lament by traditional and then we aggregate with 1250 and that's it see it's and if not loves that one is for something nothing will happen because still a little bit issue when I say how do I know what what the sound we have to wait for now by definition in the disability system I can see the time will receive anything or what does not behind us I hope not true and it's what because it's vital to context they can pretend to be very develop concern and producing a show of confidence in yourself whatever okay so the way we do at first with visual information we're not proving someone to send us something we just serve the image of yourself I get it and sing out everything happened in Paris so we're not waiting for a nun cellphone that one of an operating from a signature for not one to stop the others so zero at the beginning is going to communicate with not one but as well even a 200-person response it isn't a machine yourself from one and in this case in the right but if I get it starts so 0 would subject you can I forget my signature so at this point maybe two will add zero to three and if we look at good of deliver something we start to be that we can then develop advanced so Jen will come to find miscommunication Oregon place and power button a little bit so it's organized to communicate with everybody we got rating which is obviously an issue is you have thousands of knots because what I'm saying is our best communicate with everybody right but if I don't want to keep a network a other nice conservator at the white box we basically a dissemination biologist concerning seconds and then we charge a secondary contact and assertiveness and we progress in the others so for this calendar contacts per unit installed and serviced just matter to force it will which put pressure on just so is that has a suction task of horribles here yes yes we knew the difference between the publicity now this one is miss one remote management I will have a lot of slides at the end of the fact that you move and so you know you know this is high to us so you know other ways so in the time removalist of opportunity in fact as an indication of so the way the world is at the beginning when you're a member of a committee you say oh actually as an aggregate I will speak at a service and then you're not doing the sipping connection will drain the dark TCP connections will repeatedly but a really nice edge of a quick message but really which white 300 I will have a lot of spice in this but you understood partly basically you're doing if I simplified of something or UDP in search so you know that you to be address of this world and this one is one the probability of asset unknown to hope is sending a message targeted with food I will so different let's basically we will have originated at each step for sending you know gay messages now we have some slides so actually as well so who parties like Alba you know that you're looking all right all the notes but it's going to finish some mats and that's awesome but you need to send drug a massage too which is just follow stuff for mathematical point of view is based on consultation ability to be shown at unit either a set of nodes at Apogee the question is what is the point is we said we want things to support very different angle to someone's can be useful and we said that would be less in each of their application was very expensive and we said as well but when I get you need to check that it's correct if not you're just going to get a mess so because of this I'm not who people captured the no verification and the net site signature that on the day of testing one that's um I bigots in itself a little bit didn't we see me so because of interest I was going the technologies how much time keep moving them over seen each other but they are indeed so we've got a scope when you have a scope in the Byzantine context you can imagine to know them and also wanting each other verify these actually these neutrals it's invalid so you will have wasted five milliseconds of communication time which regulars and ID there is to have a walking of the notes before almost us to say okay at this point we should be contacted by those notes we've got a window that six Morris project so we're looking to easily into each window inside this window size difficult if we see that some signature are failing we say home someone is likely to reverse the cycle and that's basically the main mechanisms for under this fact that reproductive an unsightly because a tree based organization so we have a musician we do verify this miniature channel thickness let's go now if we take this so we jump in Amazon so some of them you can see that it's quite fast to the bill at least well maybe seconds but if you have to go for multi tools in there it's about an eighty coincidence and so we do this term returns we used the small notes on Amazon so it's and we could we wanted to thousand of them through notes on each three hundred girls engaged Amazon because we visited to process on a misapplication of so obviously when you do matter fighting overseas because you were single top of sharp and when they define use in each answer what is the final yoga one is waiting for us so we consider matted sumo critical context and only one whatever being magical Patel using too and on this we compare with okay so I will just send the signature element I mean basically what was expected is a lot of data a lot of time because it started mr. Dickinson compared to under which which is Father Knows night night wasn't a cell phone as well I also did not answer just you know maximum detection for well buddy seven minutes [Music] and we try them as long if some notes are not responding and so it compared the time to which agreements depending on our MIDI notes are available so if you try to which fifty-fifty what was the pressure on quite open note are very obviously my plastic all six on one milliseconds it's getting a little explorers and missing some not be visited this much more polka dots oneself I know along some ways so we tried uncie relations more things like attacks so for example this one is the case of this I can see not sending you try to argue project with this in a chair with 90% open nose begins by hunting to find out it's a little bit scary so it's still about 10 seconds in this context which is visually of course in this context you just open 10% questions so let's now the point that you are mentioning the fact that since the dye penetrant interesting part which means that the other hypothesis or introducing Network you actually can get access to them well it's a little-bitty that we can pretend that you're cooler than a chocolate ignore that you actually participate in certain so like it's quite easy to find user actually only disappear network but it's a little bit even while they are it's not even authority it started so a lot of points on this and five of us there's a key part which literally investing and then that the fact that you're pushing the information and we don't request okay so you have to also participate or something just pushing things which means that if we manage to have a single packet people sounds will happen so we think that because of this is super super theory but it requires some some other person the question of anonymity we know we want to be told you know the IP address and we know that words because they're stickers so we can be really high - unless forints that's that expensive that it's much about the tone phone yet but even with this network it can actually guess who is who because and in the house we move from one period to another so you just have to follow which i paralyzed having infinity look at what our wallets because represent to be considered a now after one or two will be quite travel and welcome and yes right so its own version but it's not too specific and we can actually I will mr. proposal to a few weeks ago to be misled by adding up a certain the middle and set allows us to say ok you will mourn as a validator but report know which valedictorian so it's basically basically playing with a look at the home is that they override no one private keys but I will tell you going on but I can't be spiteful inside ok so that was before and learning with other civilians during the ground and then if the issues is IP address stuff and I don't think as in right now it's worth how to either actual eyes well no solutions and in the like whatever vector the problem in this is whatever it's going to be marked and safe because times I mean setting groups in the know so we talk money twice because this we might talk but we tried in this unit of meter participants leave some notes particular set of results are behind this potential one second and what we see this will steam Academy and mr. business which went for some from inspector what's a solution ultra John the idea is you can very quickly we can finally develop Italy in our opinion it's something with three different components 25,000 people in charge validation in charge of I mean people are community we don't know your purity and there's Network anonymity which is the unitary system but not exactly but to be done anyway in the possible position we put the pepper what we use for vector notation is available and what we use for my situation let's take a question or do on which part so actually it's Philippi preserved at it but after his client is going to intimate it has been waiting to be implemented is by creating on the separate one part process some things package you will have one under process by different varieties but somewhat disorganized so the fact that it'll work with no computers and decentralisation we looked into and ignore that we will create an additional 4,000 signature for you so what let's the main thing that is menu [Music] but we shuffle them using them in each element exactly we need to suffer that point as well yes we rely on ourselves or soft ominous news which is I haven't to take this because it's not communities in the future what is too much of other mess is part it's because the world if you can if you don't important s it means that we can choose your position which we as white Americans say oh I don't like this guy well so all my by 1902 connects to him and with perfect perspective ammunition will become 2 or whatever so there's a dependency analysis incontinence and ensure that your life and so much [Music] what defense against the Phillies so we reconsider petition soonish ball [Applause]
