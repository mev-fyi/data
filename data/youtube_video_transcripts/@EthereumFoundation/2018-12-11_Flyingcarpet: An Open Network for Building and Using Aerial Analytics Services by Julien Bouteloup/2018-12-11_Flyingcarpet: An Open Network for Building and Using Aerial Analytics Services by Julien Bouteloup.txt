so we start from last year during a decentralised series of drones that could fly autonomously and capture data and then move this data into data insights that we can sell so we did have to a concept in Papua New Guinea where we had this drawn that autonomous autonomously flew over the plantation of coconut and then analyzed how many coconuts per tree then we use this data to sell to hedge fund so then we had the problem of scanning the drone due to regulation and all this stuff and then lately over the past six months we've been working on something instead of having problems of data collection now we use the full biggest satellites worldwide so now we don't have a point of data collection so I'm going to show you this is a so we're doing a protocol but the concept is you got a huge value of Ghana from space through Joe special analytics and this isn't chrisley this is growing very fast but no one is trying to actually to capture this data so you can actually make better decision decision triggers and capture data analytics to start to hedge fund or to pretty the the production of cacao worldwide or to do parametric insurance for example so what we do we build like new my unlike cargo you guys know about Cargill and immure we build a competition of data scientist then centralized to build a specific model for specific use case so we paid that assent is 25,000 die to build a model and we give them 10% stake in this model so then those models can be used but for by different companies to fetch data for example we're building a model that can predict the number of cattle plantation in Brazil so the data sent is build this model and then you get 25 doesn't die and also 10% ownership of this model so every time each founds wants to collect data from the specific model the data sent is receive 10% stake so we got a company in Paris for example they're doing this they build a model that can calculate the position of the ship the containers in the ocean and they sell the analytics to that a hedge fund they make him between three and five million u.s. dollar amounts so I'll let you know how much would be for if we dishonor us this entire market cap so we do we tokenize this model we turn them into a non for ship of token and then we give opportunity for anyone here to invest in this model and then the clients pay directly so the interesting value is the money that is paid by the client and then you can you can own a stake above this model we can also turn this model into au vehicles so what we're doing for example for one of the biggest insurance company the world we're doing we we connect this for example a farmer can link his land can sign his crops and policy through the AXA insurance company and whatever happened to this land which we get a how we call and we verify there is nothing for example we calculate the damages that happened to this crop between zero and five and we give we give a number so then we can do automated claim the farmer can actually receive automatically so this is what we building for example as model dashboard the designers will be taking from zero x but you can see all the different models for example Cofield rebuilding something in mexico beach so am a bit we believe something in the mexico beach for example you have rooftop Andamanese so we have this model that can use it's a machine learning model that can fetch data from satellite and we calculate on GPS based location what is what what we wear our oldest anomalies proof top then you can for example you can kind of form of stuff like that we're building an interesting project which is carbon offset for forest density we can monitor from space what is the density of the forest and then we can talk on us this we can basically use a carbon offset this project is called a forest term and by doing so what you can do you can buy a piece of this forest and it will show to a certificate how much you've been participating in carbon offset so then you can actually claim a tax incentive at the end here so you can see on this dashboard that we get in TN token which is called the nitrogen nitrogen token but if you had something else which is called nitrogen X and this nitrogen X is actually captured by using a bonding curve and this bonding curl lets you and we're going to show you is that loading see the slider on internet so speed slow okay let's go to the next one okay cool so we got all these different models and then we can use the model as an Oracle API so we can actually link this Oracle this model to prediction market like gnosis oh okay and we can also like link into different smart contracts we can do like this on choice insurance company like it's a risk we can also peel it down and the that would be something that will be specialized for renewable energy or climate change and this climate change down will have all the different models about the climate change so we're building a model we send someone in Antarctica that we can capture them how fast is the highs in melting so we can actually capture this data and we can also have exchange market with private people that can actually trade in this model so you can actually apply any kind of financial instrument on the top of this model so david achieved future cap swamp cat swamp so this is like for example in this example we got a down I specialize in agriculture so we got a coffee yield model carbon credits cacao biomass crops analysis so we can capture we got those five four different biggest satellites they give us access to five or six different bands which is RGB colors we got a handful rate we get bio mass spectral camera so we can extract you got the different layers into the photo color you can actually capture data and turn them into useful information for those models I'm sorry for so yet the stole the token staking is is interesting so what we do the nitrogen token you stake it in against the model and it gives you an return based on the bedding curve it gives you like this nitrogen X those nitrogen X cannot be trade they can only be used in this model so you can actually capture and you can invest noise model as an investor and then capture a veneer income for example the model can we can have this landing page of all the different models they're being generating money over the past three months and what is the expectation of the prediction of the smaller generate to generate money in an extremis for example we know there's a catastrophe going to happen in Caribbean island and we had this specific model that can capture what is the stage what is the the degree of damages in Caribbean island so we know this model will be used and generate a lot of money so you can actually take in to this model so that's what I was explaining you invest you stake your token and then based on if you early stage in the model so the molecular just created you get the most of an in nitrogen X and you can actually use it to you can use it to spend in the model but at some point the model will get up in value so then you can always sell you nitrogen X would be more advantageous to sell them to actually consume the data we go one one nitrogen X give you one access to a computer computational power for for running those data into the model so yeah that's so poor model you can see how much you've been staking against them and how much if you eat if you get if you get the stake back how much will give you natural eggs so yeah you can actually build overcomes mechanism also so this is the five different application that we're building we're building a crops plyometric insurance mechanism so you can actually link this to Easter risk so this is kind of like building a proof of observation from space so this is the protocol layer to give you another insight from space we're building carbon offset will float on monies for insurance industry community trading and checking for climate change so those models are being built internally and we are planning to give access for anyone to invest in those model to the first to like in the coming weeks but the plan is to let anyone build model through a competition like the same as Nimoy is doing Nemo is doing this for the financial stock market we're doing this kind of same model mechanism for visual data coming from from space yeah this is just like for example cat catastrophe catastrophe insurance so you can have this model that give you insight or give you like a binary input so those model they can be the plan is a long term you can also like to train or like vendor computational of this model into Gollum or like into other other platform yeah so we bring on see this model this model for rooftop anomalies so this is the kind of information you can get from from space and this can also be plug into different models yeah thank you I'd like some of the slide but it's not loading zone you
