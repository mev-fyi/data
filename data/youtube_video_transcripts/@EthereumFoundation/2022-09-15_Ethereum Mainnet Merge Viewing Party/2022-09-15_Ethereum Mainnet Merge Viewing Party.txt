[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey everyone welcome i'm superfiz from the eatstaker community if you are watching uh right now you're coming to the painting party uh we are doing a warm-up for the mainnet merge call so continue to paint um i'm about to throw you the introduction for the main call uh so don't don't panic this is not the mainnet merge call we're just getting warmed up so uh hey everyone welcome to the ethereum mainnet merge call hosted by bankless the ethereum cat herders um the daily gray and eve eathstaker we're really glad to have you here tonight our call is going to last probably about two hours as we spend an hour leading up to the merge and then an hour processing the merge afterwards we're joined here today by ethereum implementers and researchers uh and a lot of community oriented guests so we're really glad to have you uh one thing i want to let you know before we get started is we are streaming from the ethereum foundation youtube channel but this is not an ethereum foundation production uh what we did was look for um a common ground where a lot of communities could come together in one place and share the merge with you and the ethereum foundation channel seemed like the right place so we are the community and we're glad you're here with us so um david you want to say hello hey what's up everyone uh i'm actually hearing looking at the chat and saying that the volume is basically at zero uh you might need to fix that before we continue with the stream uh who who's managing the stream infrastructure michael anthetica you're working on it okay all right i'll tell chad to calm down fine that's good that's why we're doing a warm-up uh great uh glad to have you david and anthony hello let's get going guys uh puja from the ethereum cat herder so glad to have you and once again i am uh super fizz from the eatstaker community and i'm so glad to have uh the e-staker crew here with us tonight so welcome everyone before we before we get going we're going to uh check out a two-minute video that we just thought was a really cool futuristic uh imagination um a really cool somebody help me with a word take on the merge a really cool imagining of of the future of ethereum so uh sit back buckle in and uh let's let's get to it hey all right yeah so that's my intro it's not going to be the same volume seems better there seems to be a lag in the video feed cecil i don't know if you saw me uh being you i was pretty good at it yeah yeah i saw that just before i joined hello everyone hello hello 10 out of 10. okay so ah damn it oh see i broke the rule um no swearing on the stream is that a rule yeah it is okay just because we wanted to be as family friendly and like sure have it you know but i i wanted to record that and it auto transcribes so that i could have it as a script panic backup yeah we're live yeah we're currently live having some uh streaming infrastructure difficulties but not too bad well this is warm-up time and some of the the best part of this is um this will show up on the original stream but um when it gets preserved on the youtube channel we'll edit out the first hour so that the call won't start until for the public for later viewers until um right right whatever actual merge time yeah we just cut out all the parts where things went poorly it'll be great yeah exactly same thing with emerge right the nine hours after uh the the pandas will just cut that out so yeah just the pantos i'm gonna get to my painting canvas are you painting today fizz i'm just really uh just throwing my name down hey is this so this is live uh to the people that are also probably painting on this canvas that's the idea that people who are watching the canvas are also um okay um so for anybody that is watching that isn't taking part in this canvas you are definitely free to do so all you need to do is get one of the many entry po apps and if you don't have one there's also a party entry po app and i guess maybe i could mention someone's twitter we all shared this uh same sort of invitation uh there is a link there so you can go grab that pull up if you need it um it requires a 0.001 each donation to what is it against stateful stateful works staple works yeah which are some of the people that help make ethereum what it is so it's definitely going to be a good cause um also if you have friends that have entry po apps they can also just delegate them to you as well uh so they can give you a pixel placing power um and a neat feature of this canvas just two things i really want to mention uh you can choose colors in the palette um on the right but sorry i forgot uh first you need to sign in uh with your uh wallet that contains any of the entry po apps and then there's a palette on the bottom right where you can choose something like 256 colors um and also a neat thing uh like the feature that helps you collaborate with people is you can quickly see what color they're using by right-clicking it and copying their color so yeah that's that's about it it's pretty simple uh if you want to do some last minute coordination with the community uh there's also a discord link uh in a tweet that i can only mention because i don't know where i can share it what are you what are you being hokey about i miss that there is a uh the tweet that we all shared that's like the invitation to this canvas yeah i don't know where i can share that in this stream or if i even can uh maybe i can put it in the youtube uh comments second okay i'm fighting someone to highlight my own logo i'm like work with me there you go and it's gone my uh half second cooldown is being a little naughty is it taking more than a half second it's not always recovering quickly taking the torch for the ethereum symbol would there be the outline and they will come anybody else having problems with the canvas yes i think it is being held right now i know you guys are really busy with the painting party but could someone check how the hash rate is doing we don't want to miss demand where's the half rate still on a downward slope or reports two hours and eight minutes before ttd two hours 606 utc so that's 206 am for the folks in berlin can we um identify one person who is not otherwise engaged in the canvas or whatever to monitor that um ttd closely hey phys i've got an eye on it right now it's uh estimating two hours and seven minutes dude cool packs am i fighting you on the gp logo i'm trying to make it even what are you doing maybe i'm still trying to figure out my pixels over here what is moodle even doing oh we're a live stream don't hear me that's boy might be able to hear me somebody message bootlen tell him he's got to move is he right under the e well he's it says gradually and the boodle like it looks like it's all one online now co-op daughter is violently switching between like 50 and 600 what is that somewhere in the arctic right now i think he gets a pause on anything he wants to do unless it's like covering up the eve logo some things are sacred who's starting to be a barrel you're uh glitching out thorston um tally hoe is obviously using a script but it looks legit i was saying we need vitalik sombrero in here somewhere ah oh that rocket pool logo is looking real nice it's a little small there's two of them oh i didn't see yeah now there's another one you know what's better than two rocket pool logos i guess three i don't know i was promised a bankless logo and i haven't seen it yet uh sir yeah somebody uh somebody probably told you that didn't they what happened to not filling projects are you filling uh it's pre-call ah okay good excuse i did probably break that rule first uh yeah but during the main main net call let's be careful not to uh promote third party projects oh no no but no like is rocket pulled through yeah rocket pulls a third-party project you can't mention record pools no no other no other brands whatsoever nothing but ethereum it's not about being negative yeah it is about being clear yeah yeah neutral focused we're focused on ethereum i you know it's it's no big deal if it if you mention it it's just uh i just want to let's remember why we're here yeah exactly thank you oh so i mean this is the merger right so the the cut down thing will live on youtube and probably be poured over by people for months to come and then they'll look back at it years from now like what happened at that time you know and then from there ethereum went to strength their strength or from there um that other chain was right and you know ethereum failed how did they feel then it's all part of the record so we want to focus on it is the uh is the canvas frozen i'm not seeing pixels spit yeah um can we mention um can we mention uh uh press outlets or would that be shilling the press outlet i don't have a strong intuition on that i'm willing to uh defer to others yeah so basically there's a lovely quote from a podcast i just don't know whether we want to name the actual podcast um and the quote was if the merge works crypto has a future so that's the view from a um from a finance-based uh outlet yeah i would say that was really interesting like that that quote works focused on the protocol yeah the focus there is the protocol it's not it's not naming a source to draw it's just a question of whether we should mention where that comes from so since this isn't going to be in the record um this is from the babbage podcast from the economist so the question is do we mention as the economist because they have a name or do we leave that out and just use the quote well i think if you're going to cook the source then it's important to credit them but again the focus is the protocol so it should be fine right okay yeah we should probably credit them yeah i like that quote i thought that was really that was their silicon valley tech correspondent who basically you know has a isn't that deep in the blockchain stuff but has a view into it and and his take was if the merge works crypto has a future so that was a really really strong statement what are you laughing about nix don't hold back i'm the canvas is so frustrating i'm trying to i'm trying to make like the git pop logo symmetrical and someone is fighting me and i'm trying to help i don't know if it's cold facts it might be it's not me anymore it must be someone else hey you say hey if you have extra resources please help knicks with the gitpo app label help me make the get co-op ribbons symmetrical um the panda has to happen around so i'll get my legs broken so actually if you have any free versus resources get the panda drawn okay some help yeah have we fixed the uh stream yet or do we still need help on that uh i can't well i can't tell because we're now kind of zoomed out but like the audio was quiet and also the um video feed was laggy audio fixed bandwidth okay all right cool where is where's the bandwidth limitation there if i'm the host am i streaming to is it coming from my feed or is it coming from like is it going to canada and then going to youtube you know whoever's whoever streaming is collecting all of our data from zoom and then relaying it to youtube okay so this is just that one person if they're bandwidth yeah damn we should have done it probably from mine i have a ton of bandwidth sick oh you know what i'm going to do i'm going to turn on recording now recording in progress everyone's going to need to accept that but it will give us kind of this uh spare copy and i do i do believe that that should be enabled for everyone who wants to record i can't confirm that but if you'd like to record locally i'll try and help you figure it out from whatever i can control some do you think this is a good time for showing the internal magic dispenser once um yeah i think we could do that except we're broadcasting live on youtube right now so we would have to be careful way better down then so i am giving codes permissions um to a lot of people who are hosting um the the request there is um if if an unwelcome person does somehow get in um if you're a co-host you have the the ability to mute or boot them um it's better to need to mute and do proactively and ask questions later i'm sorry superfiz i was just practicing there this is like us uh between a uh waiting for epoch this is what it says it's just like the calm before the storm yeah oh it's it's like we've had the merge and we're all waiting for the first epoch to photo finalize and we're all just like dead quiet it's been like my third or fourth live stream today it's just like each one is like progressively closer and closer but like still nothing to talk about it's like the same subjects going in circles again david i heard you ambushed someone on your uh live stream today yeah i don't know if i call an ambush but it was a little bit of a it's a little bit of a whoopsie yeah it was hilarious context we gotta have contacts uh so we i we just wanted to do it on banquets like a casual casual streak like every bank list like livestream every bank of the show we have like an agenda a prep we're like we're gonna guide the conversation we just wanted to do like something completely the opposite so we just like threw out the zoom to like five six seven eight people and say hey show up a casual unscripted no agenda hangout and i think i said hang out instead of live stream i should have added live stream and i sent that i sent that to hal press uh and so like we're we have like uh there's a few of us in the stream hudson oh yeah yeah husband fizz yeah right right oh yeah wait what the [ __ ] why am i excuse me oh i'm so sorry uh i know right it's gonna be hard uh but yeah like this sounds like the call i was on yeah right yeah and then hal press comes in and starts talking about this trade that he just made and how his like otc desk like totally gypped him on like give him a bad deal on his uh on his rate and then he's like yeah okay like you know i just won't talk about this on the show i'm like dude you are we are 600 people into the stream right now you wrote kyle it's funny like um i i really wanted to invite him here but as a traitor it's contrary to our like you know overall yeah although you can see him becoming like more and more just like the way that he tweets and talks he's like he's come up a long-term believer yeah i i said that to him privately um we we had a chat and i was like you're you're an ethos leader and he's like no i'm not i'm a traitor and i'm like you just don't know yet yeah like yeah i know i'm in that same camp that's in camp for sure okay nix is driving me crazy having an obvious party there and yeah being like suck it you're not here all i see is james carnell hanging out like how am i how hilarious could that be you got the lights you have the the uh wi-fi lights that cecil uses james kindly is not hanging out he's sharply uh designing his visual modifications yeah he has that habit you can see him closer now on on nick's cameras is that sam from poep over there yeah it looks like it no no uh not to get confused with sam from coach oh okay i see madison uh that's that's gonna be what james is working on i'm sure i'm guessing you were correct james is always representing madison there's rocket pool and i don't know what the other rocket pool one is that's so i guess um some people are getting pixels and some people are not i i am seeing a little bit the collection yeah i think we're a little too successful at getting people interested about the canvas that's good do you know where that is middleweight above phonon is looks like it's being right right above phonon so there's the logic bot and then phone a lot of pixel spot drawn uh wasn't anybody that i coordinated or helped coordinate rather uh there needs to be more battle for the uh panda and it looks like if that gray eath logo is in the belly of the panda that it's off to the left of it i'm having a hard time getting pixels down uh but yeah i'm really i'm really trying to get the outline for the belly of the panda going right now i see tornado cash in the lower right quadrant i've got some tips to share about the pop canvas if anybody's having trouble yeah what i'm hearing from some folks is that if you're having trouble painting pixels you may need to refresh and right now there's so many people in there that it might be better to just stick on the tab with the canvas if you switch to another tab you might find yourself needing to refresh again that's a good point i'm actually going to try this in a completely private tab with no data whatsoever see if that helps i wonder if i got my 100 pixels oh i got to tell you though i do love this uh this warm-up like it is a great way to get people in and get comfortable with a call before it goes live like by the time it's live it's kind of old hat it's not like a big deal anymore because me and a few others are unable to turn the cameras on as they're sitting uh nolan is running security i don't know if he's working on something right now so we'll uh we'll check that in a minute are you getting that one have you changed anything what's that what's going on have you changed security settings regarding uh cameras yeah i made it so new people can unmute themselves and they can't start whiteboard and i don't think that they can screen share either only hosts okay will you um people are having trouble turning their cameras on okay start video there we go should be good now there you go thank you hello hudson okay yeah i absolutely was just using the wi-fi but oh yeah look james he hello james [Music] chat i just want to make sure i can say something okay great i just double checked out also as there are a lot of new people who've joined us i want to repost the call guidelines not that i want to be annoying but i do want to hold us to a high standard yeah uh that's a great thing thank you so much um sam so um for everyone who's watching we are really just hanging out enjoying the the poet art painting party we are not live on the call um the call will start when we're an hour from ttd so right now um really we're just warming up and visiting uh this while this is streaming live on the channel right now this will not be a part of uh the long term video this will be trimmed out um so yeah um hang out join us i may run through my intro uh one more time just to make sure that we're all comfortable for me the hardest part of any call is the intro like once you get over that hum then things kind of do their own uh take care of themselves doesn't sassel oh dance isn't he on the hook for that don't do this fizz don't what if ever if ever there was a time okay whenever there was a time to fulfill this promise he asked not to be bugs so we're gonna be good friends and kind and not [ __ ] yeah i mean there are some videos of me dancing at my fiance's 30th birthday so maybe if you're nice to me i'll post those on twitter i i figure you deserve to have as much fun as anyone without being a target of harassment so oh no it's all good it's all in good fun oh you're welcoming it oh well uh a little bit um i'm just glad that this is happening like normal australian time like i feel bad for everyone who is on like little sleep but for me it's 2 18 p.m i i only got up a few hours ago so i have got all the energy in the world but still i'm not going to dance [Laughter] i don't i i'm at this moment i'm not sure what time it is locally but i don't want to know it's not going to help me any yeah yeah i don't think so i feel bad for the europe people cool facts how you doing hanging in there i was unable to fall asleep last night so i was just too excited so i just pulled it straight through now it's 6 19. so anthony now we know which time zone the masternode is in somewhere in australia that's why it's at a decent time there yeah exactly if it was going to be anywhere i'd be australia all right it can't be in new zealand because that place doesn't exist so you wouldn't be able to find it well yeah it's full of hobbits here and sheep yeah yeah australia is is natural security too you take two steps and something poisonous bites you you know exactly exactly so we got we got good natural security here okay i'm looking at this chat i hang out in and i'm seeing these numbers and i'm like why is everybody posting these long string of numbers and then i'm like oh it's dtd sorry i was like it's some kind of cryptic like is there a new thing i don't know about this is the ttd yeah well it's it's the the td right it's not terminal yet yes the total difficulty yes yes well well quarter there what's that why is everybody everyone being so cryptic and posting these weird numbers yeah i don't know all right i need another coffee i'll be back i think oh there's balloons joseph is showing us stuff right now yeah hey i'm giving you guys a little tour here peter has just showed up so he's here to save them hello peter say hi to peter martin yes it's in the house we're live streaming so he's famous and uh we'll also get this set up so that on the call you guys can have a uh when we do the last hour sort of a live look at all of the researchers there is a little 360 kind of cam that uh and i believe proto-lambda may bring in another so that as the researchers are gathering and of course the live stream itself if you want some inception is is uh is there too there may be a balloon drop if uh uh all goes well so uh yeah hi [Music] is he breaking up for everyone yes it looks like um wi-fi coverage at the ef office i just like you better i hope the balloons aren't there in like eight hours so bad wi-fi coverage at the ef office is tradition and we're gonna keep with that even during the merge oh each sticker cabin has their own like cam now that's neat they're all yeah they're all waving now why am i not there i sam and i you guys don't know that sam coffey and i uh sam from poet the other sam from post for the one of the sams from coeps we uh had really bad fomo for not joining this cabin but we we wanted to make sure that each sticker was somewhat decentralized for this event and so we uh we're at home jealous so wait are you the designated survivor of beefsteaker superfiz who else who else survivor is is just a really elaborate way for supervisors to admit that he's agoraphobic i don't sleep as well away from home there uh uh so i wanna i wanna update anybody who's joined in the past few minutes this is not the mainnet merge call yet uh this is the right place but we are um really just hanging out for a while watching buddha eat his lunch and participating in the co-op art canvas and that will last until about one hour before ttd when we get to one hour before ttd we're going to kind of start a blank slate we're going to go off for a few minutes we're going to regroup with this room we're going to plan it then we're gonna pop back in and i'm gonna say hello everyone welcome to the ethereum mainnet merge call blah blah blah and we'll go into the real call but what we're doing right now is just enjoying the painting party i encourage everyone to get a hundred pixels down if you can and they need to stay i can't tell you why because it would be non-germane but it would be cool if you were able to do that one of the best ways to do that is to contribute to the main theme uh which you will see as a panda in the middle because uh as a part of the canvas that we expect to remain uh you're likely not to be wiped out there and so yeah we i don't really know sam can you give me an idea how how long it's going to be before we go live yeah it's looking like right now you probably have another 40 to 45 minutes before we kick off maybe a little bit earlier than that um doesn't have to be exact but that's that's a rough target great yeah so um we're just gonna hang out and enjoy company and let people filter in um but that's that's why things seem so unstructured right now um don't worry about it james adrian good to see you guys yeah hello i i couldn't resist joining i was listening on the youtube when i heard all the the whinging about how late at night it was and i just just wanted to come on with my world's smallest violin [Laughter] i know we know that australians paid off the miners we're not you guys probably wrote a nice check to the miners i nearly spun up some of my own hatch rate but it's just just landing beautifully the only thing is you know at the moment it's it's looking like it might be about 4 30 our time pushes past five you're gonna have to knock off the day and do it tomorrow i uh i've been sincerely tempted to fire up a gpu but all of my cards are in machine like one of them is on my zoom machine and i'm like i don't want to mine during the call and then one is in my staking machine and i'm like i don't want to run staking i don't want to run mining hardware on my staking machine so i'm like i'll just sit it out are we conflicting with any important sports ball event uh is the wnba finals tonight again or did that happen the other night and even still it's too late for it to still be going on so now there you go i wanted to say do you think anyone in this room would know of hunterness hi everyone by the way people posted uh about 30 minutes ago he posted an artwork for the march so adrian is it is it off to the pub at um at 5 pm is that what happens uh over there uh i i don't leave the house i work from home been working from home 10 years kind of got to catch a bus to a pub i it's really not an australian place right here it's you know you used to live in a town where there was about 20 people and four pubs um that was australia but i do have some homebrew chilling in the fridge looking forward to getting into that if it all goes smoothly so i i was going to say the real merge isn't what we're going to be talking about with ethereum it's you and anthony finding each other in australia and giving a big hug and merging had to go to amsterdam to meet anthony that that might involve single prop planes yeah somewhere in the outback yeah excited to see uh jonathan here hello jonathan i'm a big fan bought your album um i keep refreshing that metadata it's good loving it is that working i'm so glad that that that functionality is working it it uh it takes a little bit of time i but but it's it yeah it's definitely working it's very cool i really like it a lot thank you yeah yeah really well done i feel awkward already owning so many of those nfts like i i didn't plan it i just wanted them super super biz owns four of the 12 merch of the one of one merge songs so you must be doing quite well is well i i did calculate my my gains and i think it's almost like 0.28 so you know i'm making it i'm making it in in years from now that 0.28 is going to be something to talk about maybe and sadly the keys to that wallet will have been lost years before unless i used i was gonna say i was gonna make a joke and advertise for a social recovery wallet and then i'm like is that really good for me it's interesting to watch uh bordell how the the merge line i'm sorry the difficulty line is diverging from the projection like it's clear that miners are shutting down or not that's not that's exaggeration it's clear that hash rate is decreasing we've done remarkably well though yeah ashford state stayed pretty like pretty high much higher than i thought it would um before we get into the mainstream i want to give a quick shout out to my mom because my mom has a family group chat where they sent a prayer request for the merge on my behalf and that caused my uncle to call my mom and say what is the merge and for 45 minutes my mom who is just an educate like a teacher or like a curriculum coordinator explained proof of work proof of stake the merge she was like the one thing she she messed up on she was like you know i explained that there was like the normal ethereum network and there was like rinky dink or something i'm like if you mean rinkaby and she's like yeah yeah rinkaby and i explained that rinkaby was a test network and that things are really you know nothing's going to go wrong with the merge because they've worked so hard on it and i was like that's great thank you this is great okay in retrospect rinka dink would have been a fantastic name for yes that's and that is the most wholesome and beautiful story i feel like i've ever heard i love that story my mom has been a big ethereum supporter since 2015 when i was getting into it she was just i would call her you know every few weeks or whatever and just talk to her about what i've been doing in it and so she would follow it and so she yeah shout out to rhonda that's actually kind of a neat idea and pooja suggested it as well um hudson do you want to uh you shared a personal anecdote do you want to pass to someone else and while we're just kind of hanging out we can um you know we have about 30 minutes just give everyone a chance to share a personal anecdote sure that sounds like a great idea um is there anyone that wants to go next just so i'm not putting someone on the spot i think i can go next like similar to hudson's story i have a story of my son my own son when i talk to him about that we are going to join this merge call in the middle of the night and by the time you guys will be asleep i have to wake up and join the call and he was asking me is it the merge much call like you guys are actually going to have merged like you guys have been talking for over two years and are you going to be having this upgrade now and i was like okay if my son is asking me these questions i wonder what other community members have been thinking about that's awesome i love it who else i'll go next this is from last year i had started working on ethereum full time um and my mom talked to me and she said so you're doing blockchain stuff and that burns all this energy have you lost all your youthful idealism because as a young man i kept talking about how important is this etcetera etcetera and i said to her well ethereum is changing to use 99.5 less energy and she's like oh okay okay that's okay [Music] who's next all right i'll call on someone then um joseph are you with us this is my connection brother yes it's a bit better do you have a personal story you want to share it all if not that's okay sure you know well i spent a lot of time talking with press folks and i came from the political space and i'm on the left and or at least uh uh where the left was in in the states and um you know it's funny because a lot of the blockchain space is associated with um the bitcoin world a while back and you have this you have to explain to people that it has its own political divide you know the anarchic libertarianism versus this like what can we do with the technology crowd that was liberal by definition and um you know also yeah i would say it confused a lot of folks because you know here you are pushing for uh uh all kinds of um you know improvements to policies while yeah uh uh using a technology that people didn't understand can also be used for societal improvement they see it instead of something that's maybe closer to being used for societal escapism and this is kind of a moment where it's really been uh inspiring to see that people aren't just covering it they get it so it's kind of it's beginning to break into the the kind of everybody's lexicon as we like crosses threshold into legitimacy in uh ethereum land but it's not all that it's not all speculation it's not all you know uh uh you know kind of these more conservative ideals and they get people are trying to do something here it feels like a payoff of uh um you know everything that's been worked on for the last eight years like it's culminating in this thing where people get that uh yeah it will matter and it will change things and that kind of hits so it feels like a personal thing also i have this nice sticker meme i don't know if you can see it not yet um yeah i was just thinking about a story of when i started really working in ethereum full-time about two years ago right around right before the launch of the beacon chain i went to go visit my grandmother and she was asking me what i was doing i'd recently quit my job and i told her i was working you know generally in this community called ethereum and and she asked me she's like what's that and i was like okay and i sat down with her for 45 minutes and i sort of walked her through like what ethereum is and what it could be used for and things and use analogy like her local savings bank and things and she really got it and it was really cool and ever since then she'll always ask me she'll she sees ethereum in the news all the time she's like she'll send me articles and be like hey cool facts like i saw ethereum in the news like do you know about this like i just wanted to let you know and i'm like you're just this is amazing i don't know it's always heartwarming when i hear from her she always asks me like hey like is this does this impact like what you're doing like and she's just like really cares so much and so cool to see her engage with it she's 93 now so yeah wow okay watching now yeah she is not watching now she's asleep it's a little late for her on the east coast unfortunately well uh patricio you're unmuted what's your story my story is that i am dealing with some performance issues on the canvas and i am here for getting my work done so i rather pass my opportunity into let me pick someone fun i would like to have shake up from this global shared history you're married jacob could you please not embarrass me i can't even find them who he seems to be swapping headphones audio issues absolutely putting patricio to shame your one pick [Laughter] at least it's not vitalik's microphone definitely going to be vitalik's microphone no microphone is better than vitalik's microphone i get so much crap over whatever that merge call was girly i guess when like it i was hosting and it was my role or it wasn't girly because i didn't host early but it was would have been my role to like redirect and say hey your mic is bad but i like it was worth it i don't know all right jacob's rejoined like classic uh unmute and zoom crotches like sorry patricia um that would make me proud yeah well i knew you would call on me too so i really should have predicted that um yeah i was thinking about on my on personally about a year and a half ago or so um i'd been you know working in the ethereum community for um since around 2017 to 2018 but also in the web 2 community and had a really tough choice between kind of continuing on my work in web 2 and devoting full-time to web three um ultimately this year ended up uh committing full-time uh to this community and i guess a lot of people on this call actually were kind of part of that decision for me uh so it was really awesome to uh i feel this is a little bit of like a closure situation where i'm like on the merge call so it's been an amazing year and uh it's awesome to be part of this um funny thing i've been shaking out of the people in this collection one that has the most you have my patricia follow-ups i probably do i think i have almost one every month this year yeah i i am slightly disappointed that you are not getting the september one but you know i have some trickle of hope that somehow on the 15 days left like you find out that you forgot something in buenos aires or whatever and we get to meet and you get it i have that that embarrassing experience where i i don't know jacob but um i was vetting him for an invitation and i'm like so what i don't tell me about your like how are you involved and he's like uh well you know i work with heath global and i've met patricio we're friends and i was like oh oh oh i'm sorry yeah i'm sorry here uh there's your invitation have a nice day because i have to realize like i know one percent of the people and patricio knows everyone in the ecosystem so yeah that's a good a good vouch i have to sign you know the east global sign that's how you know i'm legit and now you need to pick who's first uh for sharing their story maybe another person from eat global i can see kartik kalwar here yeah why not card to pick you want to go oh it's a it's time to give a personal anecdote if you have those kartik everybody i just joined in uh pardon uh pardon my uh noisy background i'm at the ef office in berlin and uh this is like it's like 6 30 a.m and super people are just super excited so um it's it's getting really fun um but i mean uh i don't really so i missed the first half in general i just tuned in because it's getting set up but i'll personally do it i assume about the communities if not correct me but uh it's been kind of an amazing past five years like especially with global um we kind of got to see so much of the space involvement and change and just grow uh it's to me a wonderful thing that not only are there people that uh have kind of come to the weather ecosystem and specifically their ecosystem from a bunch of the events but also that they kind of stick around help and contribute and make this ecosystem even better so to me it's more about like the meta observation as uh we never realized or predicted the impact that any of these things would have and just kind of seeing that perturb and just realized to me like the most mind-blowing and getting to see that every day whether it's a person sitting sharing excitement about what they've done to uh somebody kind of send me an email to somebody saying hey i want to do this or i want to see more of this that is the best part about physical space thank you sorry for putting you on the spot just wanted to have everyone uh like sharing some story if they have any um i can see some more devs join in anyone if they would like to share anything from their work or maybe personal anecdotes i i want to say how excited i am uh for personal reasons to get past the merge because i've been pouring so much energy into promoting decentralization on the chain that i've i've really taken time away from my family and so i was talking to my son today he's three and um i'm like today's a really big work day for daddy i'm going to be online all day and i said but we're going to merge and after the merge is over i'm going to have a lot of time to play and so all day long he's been saying have you merged yet is it is the merge done and i'm like well it's going to be a little bit later and so are you it's going to be late tonight and so this evening after his bath he's like is the merge done and i'm like he like he's so excited about it and i'm really looking forward to like getting past this big hump so that i i can refocus my attention for a while um on my family and it's fun to be passionate about ethereum and i love this opportunity to express my passion but i'm also looking forward to an opportunity to like realign my time toward my family for a while so it's kind of neat that's really wholesome we heard earlier uh potential for social good in ethereum i'm curious what everybody's kind of like pet project is that they'd like to see if and when ethereum can technically handle things that don't need you know dollars per tx like what's the what's the non-functional thing you're excited about to see in the coming um i'm working with a company who is uh gonna do potentially some kind of whistleblowing platform um and uh completely built on ethereum including the reputation system and incentives that's really exciting for me like um whistleblowing about corporate wrongdoing that kind of stuff um pretty much any kind of sub like you can make sub communities within it hopefully depending on how how it's built so it's kind of like a wikileaks but for anything cool and minus the the hanging out in the ecuadorian embassy for three years yes yes i have good news we are about to be shown by one of my favorite syrian people bennett chington hooray that's awesome it takes a lot to get out and we got another of my friends um from the guest team say hi hi how is everyone doing today i'm nothing fancy just a regular day nothing uh nothing to expect got regular coffee woke up at a regular time right that's it it's just just another day man why are you in a cave or is it just not any time where you are i don't know where you are right now yeah i'm at my place in berlin uh yeah i'm gonna go i'm gonna go to the ef office but i wanted to drop by and say hi um just uh thank the community for for their support because yeah if it wasn't for you know stakers and especially individual stickers we would not be uh we would not be the cryptocurrency so yeah very glad to to have everybody uh participate it's really it's really about people so uh see now i'm talking like like a marketing guy so that's that's how excited about the merge i am and so and i froze did i did i not no no you were good uh so in just a moment um let me zoom out again to the big picture one more time uh this is the uh ethereum mainnet merge um viewing call but it's before the call this is the painting party before the call um we do plan to start the call the formal call in about 20 minutes before we do that so if you're painting you can continue painting all the way through the formal call and until we finalize so this is going to be a joke just to prepare you so that means you'll have about nine hours left in the painting party uh joke sorry um but seriously so you'll be able to continue the painting party throughout uh the call and in this room we're gonna we're gonna break off for a while and we're going to have an internal just kind of orientation planning prep meeting and then when we come back it will be one hour before maynet merge and we'll begin that comeback with an announcement of the call uh uh is there gonna be like a placeholder to let people who tune in know that we're coming soon and that is that set up okay um before we do that i think it would be great to um let's find someone here to to generate a tweet um that says hey we're starting this mainnet merge call in whatever number of minutes and post that here in the chat and then give everyone an opportunity to retweet it so we kind of amplify it and i will does anyone want to volunteer to be that person it's a big responsibility i can retweet from the foundation account but somebody else should tweet it i can tweet it perfect hudson you're a great representative and then we'll retweet from everywhere uh if you will tweet that and and then uh we'll put it in the chat we'll all retweet it and then like i said this this group of 30 people we're gonna just um disappear from the merge view i'm sorry from the painting party view as we kind of talk and organize to get ready for the merge call awesome okay i'm gonna do the eth global i'm going to quote or like link the eth global link to this because there's like a chat room and other cool stuff in there is that okay yeah yeah i don't any yeah this that's anything is great and that is good i really i think the quality of the eth global chat is likely to be superior to that of yeah youtube so i just say merge calls the lo-fi beats i got i got to tell you kartik i uh when i get stressed i go find those lo-fi beats and i'm like well it's it's that or taylor swift um if i get really stressed i pull out my pixel buds stick them in my ear put on some taylor swift and chill that was over self-disclosure uh we got some angry messages when that channel got taken down like a while ago so uh you're not the only one there's hundreds of people that just watch the live streams just to play that radio so yeah uh it's gonna be fun uh yeah no uh hudson whenever you're done with the tweet uh let me know we'll also announce that on on the live streams everybody on the chat can see this and uh we'll make sure that we message it will be another minute and or less than that i'll have it done let's see oh this is east staker bankless ethereum cat herders and uh daily great right that's right yeah you you can you can take it from the bio on the youtube video ah okay i think i already just typed it all out anyway so merge call starts and i'm gonna here this is what i type someone just proofread it that's just a sentence where is a boom is this one good uh you can take off the eight minutes i think um you just make it like the official invitation to join because when the tweet gets older people so merge call starts now got it peter says hi and peter will be on the merge call and uh you know maybe starting in the moments starting in a few moments yep originally we had that's do we really want to do two hours before merch now oh that's right um there's some discrepancy about when ttd is actually going to hit 640 utc is the current prediction by bordeaux with current hashrate which is probably going to shift a little further back still as hashrate drops all right tweet posted posted the link and and so just just for the record we still have time that there's some discrepancy about when ttd is actually going to happen um whether it's going to be one hour from now or two hours from now uh let me retweet that and then we can discuss because kind of what i'm feeling like is when we go dark for a while to organize we're not going to come back until we start the mainnet merge call um and if that's like an hour then it's probably longer than we wanted to be offline yeah we don't have enough content for feeling so much time which we could definitely stall but yeah it needs it needs to be a kind of a compact not totally compact but a concise call jonathan man can you just leave him with a song yeah i i i i stand at the ready if needed i i don't know that we need you to sing for an hour and a half that's brutal i mean [Laughter] we should all take turns obviously i honestly think that even if it you know if it is two hours once you're through the agenda that uh the view count is going to be a lot of fun and um that you know just in general uh uh running through a lot of these explainers again that time will be eaten up pretty quick it should be fun i think we're all gonna have a blast just keep singing until we finalize we could be you uh yeah that didn't work i don't think we're live next or if we're if the stream is live i think we're muted on vedica right oh i can't hear you on vatica you're a muted okay cool and that's that's intentional we want it to be a warming for everyone um sam we so we have this discrepancy about when we're actually going to hit ttd um thorsten sees it two hours out sam sees it one hour out i'm not sure where that one hour out is coming from if you look at um at current hash rate right don't look at the the smooth prediction over the past few days that's useless if you look at current hashrate we're looking at 640 utc yeah that makes fair sense that we're so close that we're not really interested in we're not really interested in the average because we're so close right we're like hours away from it so we want to look at it at current hash rate how long would it take and at current hashrate we're hitting it at 6 40. okay now currently hash rate is 766. i need that to kind of go down to 667 just for the meme um before we go live i have a question for ben um ben the british um i think i heard your wife is an avid node runner and validator which clients is he using this is question for me patricia sorry i mean i was changing my speakers well um yes as far as the tax authorities are concerned she's a very keen uh staker [Laughter] and uh you can probably infer which uh which clients uh she favors yes for consensus sure execution i wonder uh yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hello everyone welcome i'm superfist from the eath staker community and i have been waiting for a couple years uh to see you all on this call so it's it's so great to be here with everyone um this is the ethereum mainnet merge viewing call we're looking forward to the ethereum mainnet merge that is the the transition from proof of work to proof of stake to occur in about an hour and in that hour we kind of want to celebrate uh educate and just share this experience with you tonight's call is going to be hosted by bankless the daily guay ethereum cat herders uh and each staker the organization i work with we're also joined by client implementation teams researchers uh and a lot of other community contributors and i'm so glad to see such a wide range of folks here tonight um it's it's important to let you know before we start this call is being hosted on the ethereum foundation channel and the ethereum foundation is is kind of an official organization that um supports ethereum development but in fact this call is being run by the community um the four organizations that i mentioned bankless daily guay uh ethereum cat herders and e-stickers we're all community organized but we wanted to find kind of a common middle ground where we could come together and not not like split up into our own calls we wanted to come together bring everyone in the community together into one place uh and and really merge together and so uh we borrowed the ethereum foundation channel there are lots of folks here from the ethereum foundation joining us uh but i i wanna to point out this is first and foremost a community call a celebration um and and to that extent what what you hear tonight should not necessarily be regarded as official um this this is primarily a celebration of the merge not necessarily a technical overview of the merge the most important thing to remember we don't know what's going to happen in an hour after we see pandas and after uh we we wait for finalization if you're a journalist if you're someone who's going to be reporting on twitter about what's happening tonight i urge you to um to to not regard this as canon because what's very likely to happen are sources that we're looking at uh websites that we're looking at information that we're looking at could very easily go down or be wrong and the best practice is to wait until you hear official notice um even official notice from well-regarded tweeters like uh vitalik buterin or danny ryan or tim baiko those sources of information are are great final sources of information and this call really should be regarded as a celebration and information not a source of canon about how the merge went and i'm just saying that in advance because i don't know any more than than you do what's going to happen in an hour uh and i i the last thing i want is uh to have a misunderstanding uh based on our celebration so i again i'm joined by superfist from east acre i'm joined by david hoffman from bankless david how are you absolutely fantastic fizz how are you doing i'm good uh anthony cesano from the daily grade hey hey happy to be here very excited uh i am the happiest i've been in a very long time so i hope everyone else shares my excitement today uh and pooja ranjan from uh ethereum cat herders hey everyone i'm very excited and very happy to be here with and co-hosting this countdown with the absolutely wonderful host and amazing people from the community yeah this is gonna be great um david what are you looking forward to tonight the pandas of course uh this has been a long time coming as a long and winding road uh the the fact that we are actually here today is a little bit surreal i think for everyone here on this call um it's both uh it's both long awaited and actually kind of unreal that it's actually happening um but of course i think we're all here to see some pandas show up on the screen a little bit a little bit of chaos after that and then some clarity after that so uh that's what i'm looking forward to yeah and anthony you you kind of lucked out with uh with the timing on this how are you feeling about that ah it's amazing it means i have all the energy in the world to celebrate the merge when it happens it's what 3 52 p.m right now it's perfect just perfect this is like peak time for for me to be excited about the merge so i mean you could probably tell in my voice i am just uh raring to go yeah the uh the americans tend to uh uh get favor over australians very often so uh i'm i i guess i'm supposed to say i'm happy for you i don't know what i'm supposed to say it's you you don't have to be happy for me if you don't want to be i understand what it's like to have things happen in a really bad times or in a weird time zone so 1 52 a.m oh wow yeah you've you've got me whooped so uh how are you excited how long have you been up what's what's your your uh your status right now right i mean i made sure that all my kids and my family are deep asleep and then i tried to wake up for this call it is really exciting we have been waiting for this day for a very long time and when the time comes it's all by i don't know it's it's occurs uh or what it is like most of the calls of ethereum are generally at the very best time but when the most important call is there it is in the middle of the night but yeah i'm hanging around yeah i i loved uh you know a week ago it looked like this was going to be 7 p.m for me and i was i was kind of on cloud nine and uh well you know things didn't turn out that way but i'm i'm really excited that everyone showed up tonight and i'm i'm glad that everyone watching on youtube on ethglobal or wherever you're consuming this i'm really glad to see everyone with us tonight uh before we go too much further we have we have a two-minute video we'd like to share with everyone um and so the idea is uh we'll share this video and then after that we'll talk about uh the the agenda for the show uh but so it's a two-minute video that that kind of gives a futuristic a wildly futuristic and exceptionally wild futuristic um concept of what the the future of ethereum holds and it it's it's kind of fun uh kind of futuristic but uh on vetica if you can go ahead and fire that off we will hang out and watch yep okay i'm gonna go ahead and transition over that video just real quick um those of you on the zoom i can't guarantee that you'll see and or hear it so if you do want to consume it just watch on the live stream with everyone else the era of mining ethereum by brute force trial and error is coming to a close the difficult proof of work mining process is well known to be unsustainable proof of stake mechanisms have taken years of research and development mining could cause centralization security risks and further environmental harm onboarding eth preparing blocks for transfer destination targeted the beacon chain launch sequence initiated [Music] proof of stake mechanisms promise a brighter future a greener sustainable paradise which provides the essential foundation for scalability meeting humanity's needs in a network built on stability [Music] [Music] hi um i i saw that video and i just i felt like that had to go out like it was just an incredible futuristic perspective um i don't know i'm kind of blown away by it um next i i'd like to introduce uh an e-staker nick zurich um she began by providing community support in the east staker reddit and uh she's a perfect example of someone who just wanted to commit to the community and because of that we on board her to e-staker full-time she's just an exceptional example of someone who um made their way in by committing time to the success of ethereum and so i'm really glad to introduce nick sorikish to share the agenda for tonight hi everyone um so first thing we're going to do is we're going to have a few accessible talks and the point of these talks are to be geared towards people who don't necessarily um spend all of their time in the ethereum ecosystem so you're going to hear from tim baco uh vitalik uh puja of ethereum cat herders uh fizz and in the middle of that you will hear a song from jonathan mann um and then we will go to danny ryan who will show us what we're looking for to see that the merge is successful and hope he'll walk you through um remy will um remy roy staker will walk us through sort of a technical overview of what's happening um and after that we'll watch pandas we'll watch pandas when remy is talking um and then we'll wrap up the painting party we'll see the canvas close we will give you co-app details so don't ask one poe until the end and then there will be a community q a um and you can find that that slido link in some uh of the more technical discord so if you're looking to answer a request or ask a question go find that slider link and then we will close the call awesome thanks for the agenda overview um so we recognize that many people who are watching um know more about ethereum than people in this room and that's that's so exciting but we also want to welcome people who have no idea what's going on they've never heard of ethereum they found this video um and we want to spend this call kind of educating you about what ethereum is and where it's headed and so um we've kind of tapped david hoffman from bankless um david can you tell us um what is the merge and how does it fit into the greater context yeah what is the merge what are we all doing here watching this stream uh the merge is a long time coming of the arrival of proof of stake to ethereum that's really what it is it's ethereum transitioning into proof of stake and this has been a goal of ethereum for years now since genesis it has always been the goal for ethereum to migrate eventually from proof of work to proof of stake and the merge has been the mechanism of which we actually get that done why is it called the merge that's because there's currently two blockchains running in parallel right now the main proof of work ethereum chain the chain that we know is called ethereum the one that we know and there's also this other chain called the beacon chain now the beacon train really just does one thing it does one thing and one thing alone which is b proof of stake it's all it does there's no transactions there's no tokens it just validates itself in a proof of stake fashion and it's using ether that's been deposited on the main ethereum chain and then this new beacon chain listens to that main ethereum chain for ether deposits and that is how ether becomes uh heard and acknowledged and then answered and exists on the beacon chain uh the beacon chain launched in december of 2020 and it's been a blockchain that's just been validating as a proof of sake blockchain ever since then and now that it is stable and now that the developers feel secure we are merging with that beacon chain and so as we approach uh what we are all talking about as seeing the pandas what that's really meaning is that the current ethereum chain is intersecting with the beacon chain uh and the proof of stake component of the beacon chain is like bumping out the proof of work miners for the ethereum the main ethereum consensus and so this merge what we are all here for today on this stream is to watch the event where the beacon chain the proof-of-stake consensus of the beacon chain becomes the actual consensus of the main ethereum chain and all of the various clients there are many clients of ethereum there's different um instead of one canonical ethereum there's a five six many different clients of ethereum and each one of these are syncing with each other and the beacon chain to all uh listen to the beacon chain all at the same time all at the same uh what is the ttd number total terminal difficulty a very large number once we hit that number all of a sudden the main ethereum chain will start to listen to the beacon chain instead of the miners and in that moment we will have merged with a beacon chain and become proof of stake so fizz that is what the merge is and that is why we are all here today on this live stream thanks david i'm so excited um can't wait uh anthony i i think you're up are we are we ready for our next segment i'm ready to go if the speaker that i'm introducing is ready they are cool awesome all right so uh that was actually a really great overview david i want to commend you on that uh that was that was great so thanks for that but yeah so we are moving to proof of stake as david just explained but why are we doing this right it has been a long time coming we have been talking about it for many many different years there are a bunch of different reasons why people are excited about it but i think that a lot of people in the audience and just generally would love to know why we're doing this you know how how we kind of like view this as a community and who better to explain why ethereum is switching to proof-of-stake than vitalik himself so vitalik feel free to take the stage mic problems i bet been there before haven't we it's not a lunch merge call without this yeah this is just proving it's the real vitalik this is proof of ethereum wait wait for the uh the rick roll then we'll know yeah i believe there is technical difficulties i'm working on it with him okay so we'll go to the next question yes so pooja you're up right so the next segment that we are going to cover today is what is the merge and what effect it will have on end users um to provide an overview let me invite our next guest who doesn't need an introduction definitely not for those people who have been following ethereum since eip1559 please welcome the vibrant facilitator of ethereum all core dev calls tim baker hi everyone uh can you hear me okay sweet um well yeah thanks everyone for for tuning in and watching um so yeah i'll talk quickly about um what the merge does for end users and and generally for ethereum um and maybe a good way to start this is to focus on um you know the average user of ethereum who just wants to transact on chain um and we actually worked quite hard so that for all those users the merge does basically nothing in terms of their experience so if they send a transaction like if you're sending a transaction in an hour whether it lands on the last proof of work block or the first proof of stake block it doesn't affect your transaction you don't need to do anything it'll just keep working and that was like a really important design goal so that all the users of ethereum all the infrastructure all the smart contracts just keep working as expected um so i see in a chat that i've stolen someone's mic hopefully it's good thanks like clients um yeah shout out to my client um yeah so for for users of ethereum ready the goal was like an extremely smooth transition um but then you know why dude emerge at all um what do we get at the network level um and danny who's here likes to say there's like three things sustainability scalability and security um and sustainability is the one that gets talked about the most these days um and it's it's quite obvious you know proof of work uses physical resources to secure the network these have a very high energy cost this is what uh kind of goes in as a security for for ethereum um moving to proof of stake allows us to kind of get rid of that entire um energy expenditure that we use to secure the chain um and you know there's different there's different estimates for this some people say like uh 99.9 99.95 um but i think that the way to to look about it is it's almost a bit more like qualitative like on proof of work we have to keep growing the amount of hardware of electricity that we use at the secure ethereum if we want the chain to kind of grow and scale in in in size um our proof of stake we don't need to do that like there's no not only do we like stop the the use we have today but there's no more growth rate um and we benefit from any optimization in in computing um so that's the first big one the second one around security um we could go on for a long time for this but i think an easy way to think about it um for people who might not be super familiar with like all the details is proof of work basically gives you like a carrot to motivate people right like you give them coins if they do the right thing on the network and if they don't do the right thing they don't get coins and you hope that this is a strong enough motivation for people to to do the right thing on proof of stake we can we can keep doing that we can also introduce some conditions um where if validators do something wrong we can add some small penalties or some larger ones in case of of of graver things um so from a security perspective it kind of helps us bound the the actions of the the actors who like create the consensus on the network um and and that just helps us like fine-tune kind of the security of the network and some more last bit around kind of scalability the merge itself doesn't scale ethereum just like a big misconception um but it does kind of lay the infrastructure that we can use to then scale the theorem in the future um so like the way we we think about scaling ethereum is using all these layer two solutions that exist today um they need to publish a lot of data to the network um and that's relatively expensive to do today so we hope in the future to add kind of different layers to ethereum kind of a data layer where people can post can post uh data there for for their tools and um having these validators already kind of validating information about blocks allows us to eventually kind of add their add to their duties not only in this data um so yeah that's pretty much it at a high level for users smart contracts everything should be smooth for the network itself we get much better sustainability better security and it kind of lays the groundwork for all of the scalability work yeah thanks thank you thank you tim that was quite nice overview so i guess the microphone issue has been resolved yeah vitalik are you good to go yeah yeah i uh finally have uh unviewed permissions and uh i use them so amazing um awesome yeah great great so why proof of stake right i think so proof of steak has obviously been a dream for the ethereum ecosystem since uh pretty much the beginning uh right so we started the proof of stake research with uh that blog post on slasher back in january 2014 and then kept going through a proof of stake um algorithms of different kinds uh eventually figured out you know the nuances around weak subjectivity and then started researching this like bft style of consensus and uh over the next couple of years eventually we came to having things like casper ffg and all of the you know various ideas around cbc and to the current plan that started to solidify sometime around 2018 and you know finally here we are but so the motivations that we had for proof of stake i think there is a few of them i mean one is uh and the big one obviously is just proof of work is very expensive right like proof-of-work basically involves the people maintaining the consensus of the network proving that they have more resources than an attacker can have by like basically those resources being uh these big uh specialized computing boxes that they then keep running 24 7 and doing verifiable calculations with them 24 7 just to keep proving to the network that those computers exist and like you can see how that architecture is sort of credibly neutral and permissionless and all of those things but at the same time it's like basically the most expensive possible way to do the thing that it's trying to do and proof of stake uh sometimes i use the bet use the metaphor of a virtual mining where basically yeah it's like instead of uh having a miner in the real world consuming real electricity it's almost like when you deposit the ethereum network simulates a virtual miner and it's uh it's the same sort of process you put in capital and that capital turns into some share of the network and you get a right to participate in the network as a validator or get to produce some percentage of the blocks but it all happens in a simulated way without requiring any actual resource expenditure so it's uh both better for the environment as well as i guess like other non-environmental externalities like how proof of work just massively increased uh prices for gpus and made a bunch of uh gamers angry and approved stakeholder do pretty much the exact opposite and that will probably even have a flood of cheap gpus for some time but uh also it is cheaper for the ethereum ecosystem itself and uh that comes through in the form of not having to have five million coins every year of uh issuance right uh so proof of uh work it requires about five billion coins every year of issuance with proof of stake the issuance says somewhere between like i guess real technically zero and two million coins but in practice it's i think at about 700 000 coins every year today yeah so it's much less than 5 million and even that that is issuance that is accessible to you as an ether holder if you decide to stake your ears right so it all i gotta say so within the ecosystem uh so those are the efficiency benefits right so you know good for the environment it's going to keep the resources inside of the ecosystem uh it's uh also has a bunch of different side benefits right so censorship resistance is an important one right like uh proof-of-work mining is something that takes up a huge amount of electricity it's uh relatively easy to detect if people are observant on detecting it but uh proof of stake you know just need to be on a laptop somewhere and that's as easy to hide as anything um it is more secure in a bunch of ways right so there's this concept of economic finality where reverting even a single block uh takes a bunch of uh like it requires eighth third of uh validators to get slashed once that block gets uh finalized and even attacks that are not uh kind of 100 provable so we don't think it's like censorship attacks there are these a lot of those can uh be responded to by by the community with a community organized softwork where you know what one of the things that you can do with proof of stake is like you can basically have this a soft fork where only the people who participated in the attack would get kicked out of the validator set and uh you know lose part of their deposits but but everyone who did not participate in the attack would not whereas in proof of work you you can sort of your only option is to change the proof of work algorithm which just like punishes everyone and it requires a hard fork and it's much more interesting and abusable in a bunch of ways so and then finally a proof of stake also lays the groundwork for scalability because it gives us these validators with validator slots and makes it easy for us to add other tasks to them which would include validating uh sharded data eventually uh so i think look to summarize that one of the ways that i think about this in a more philosophical way is like proof of work is um based on the laws of physics and so you sort of have to work with the world as it is right you have to work with you know electricity as it is hardware as it is what computers are as it is whereas because proof of stake is virtualized in this way it's basically letting us create a simulated universe that has its own laws of physics and that just gives the us as protocol developers a lot more freedom to optimize the system around actually having all of the different security properties that we want right and you know if we want it the system to have a particular security guarantee and then like often there is a way to modify the emperor's stake mechanism to also achieve it so it's just uh you know much more flexible and it shows through in the efficiency and the the security of the network awesome thank you very much for that overview as everyone can see there are plenty of reasons to be excited about proof of stake and uh how excited are you vitalik i mean you've got to be ecstatic at this point in time right yeah no i am uh absolutely excited to be uh exited from the uh proof of work era so yeah yeah awesome awesome well thank you for that all right uh passing it on to david now to introduce our next uh next topic yeah coming up next uh jonathan mann has sung sang a song every single day for over 5 000 days now he's just recently passed 5 000. uh and of course today is yet another day uh so there's yet another song john can you uh explain the song that's coming up next for us yeah thanks david thanks so much uh i'm super honored to be here thank you all so much for having me um so as david mentioned i write a song a day and in that capacity because i'm a total nerd starting uh like last may in may of 2021 i just started like writing songs documenting the transition that we are now that is now upon us so the first one i did was about eip 1559 and i've written songs about every single stage and the song that we're about to hear now is the final song in this series because we're here now um and i got on a call with tim baco and he sort of took me through that he told me this so there's the the sort of story the ebbs and flows of how we got here today and that's what i tried to put into this song i want to make like a little narrative about how how it felt to be a dev working on this thing and the highs and the lows and uh you know tuning out the noise and all that kind of stuff so i'm super excited to share with you it's called pandas are not known for running and again for the folks on zoom if you want to watch you got to watch on the youtube let's roll it i'm super excited let's hear it with you it's called uh pandas are not known for running and uh again for the folks on zoom if you want to watch you gotta watch on the youtube let's roll it let's hear [Music] big it we're building some reviews [Music] where all of this was born of canada rustic cottages were our home and all we took of the chain and we turned it we took all the fees and we burned it [Music] is [Music] of choices [Music] [Music] that said that the panda had no leg to stand on we [Music] though the road was long we carried on you know those voices never stopped and or they said it would never be coming but they didn't see the debugging and pandas are not known [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] all right great all right i'm just checking to see if justin drake is here justin are you with us is it isn't he in boulder no oh someone mentioned that i was a joke okay uh no sweat we can pass over that for now and get back to justin um and so anthony i'm gonna pass it to you my friend yep so uh next thing that we want to discuss is client diversity now this is something that many people may have heard of already uh it basically describes the uh the aspect that we have within ethereum we have multiple clients that can be run on the network uh there is a bunch of them on both execution layer and consensus layer side it is very important to network health decentralization and security so we're going to have puja run us through you know why a client diversity can be a problem in you know when it's when it's in its bad state uh and you know how do we overcome that and uh what a good state uh looks like uh to you puja thank you thank you anthony yes client diversity is another important topic of consideration along with the upgrade of the existing client notes um i know we cannot just solve the issue in next five minute but i would like to take a few minutes and maybe share my thoughts on the topic i would quickly like to share a presentation and walk us through uh like how do we can overcome the problem of client diversity as on the screen you are seeing currently two charts one for the execution clients and one for the consensus client uh red yellow green charts are generally self explanatory but here we see that red is mostly on the execution side let's see why is it uh for proof of work we were considering that the client adoption should not be over 50 to avoid the 51 attack and everything else so get it certainly not in a very good position and there's another major reason for that is like if there's anything goes wrong with kept a bigger section of the climb may go down but on the other side if you can look into the consensus client chart you see the prism it's not over 50 but still it isn't yellow not in green that's because when we come up to the beacon chain or the consensus layer the consensus is made over 30 over two thirds of uh participation and two thirds of uh voting here it is over 33 and that's the reason why we have marked it as yellow not in the green uh now that we are switching to proof of stake today uh the requirement has changed and we will be seeing like why do we need client diversity that is one of the biggest questions that may come to everyone's mind when we are looking into this chart probably we partially answered the most common question because we know there are major points of having a diversified distribution of client for obvious reason network security is one of the biggest reason and there are other advantages of having this diversity when we are testing any upgrade or testing any protocol to be launched on the main net it helps an identifying consensus bug with the proof of the stake there are other incentives associated with the staking and also helps with finality definitely having multiple client options for node running is a strength of community while uh el clients diversity looks worse on chart we just saw and most of us may know that this has not been the case forever uh but a time when parity and open ethereum uh stopped there like they were not uh continued anymore there were only fewer client options available for mining i i consider that as one of the major reason for having more client toward this side however uh there were more clients coming up and the less availability of proper documentation of clients can be one of the reasons which may not be true as of now and we are hoping that things are not going to be the same we will see a lot of changes coming up so be ready for the changes with the merge upgrade did you know we have multiple options for you to run a client node for execution layer we are having eight client nodes which will be available post merge for you to pick up to run an ethereum node and also on the consensus side the number is no less it is six clients available for you to pick up a node running option or maybe become a validator for ethereum blockchain if you were not aware of any of the clients shared in the earlier slides or you want to know more about that or maybe about your favorite clients feature what's coming up check out the know your clients series uh that's on ethereum cat holders youtube you probably have this question in the mind by now like how as an individual or an institution you can make a difference well if you are a solo staker or solo note runner you would want to pick up a client that suits your hardware requirement having an elcl combination that you think will be easier for load running with minimal setup however we do have support from the client team available and if you are a staking pool or representing us taking pool you must consider running more than one client if running only one client node then it is highly recommended to have it not the major major point like the client which is having the largest network share i have added a couple of charts here for people's reference like we can see when it comes to um staking and when it comes to rewarding and punishment as well slashing can be painful and rewarding at the same time depending upon which side of the note running you are when you are running a majority client and if slashing happens the pain meter shows that's very high pin which is very high but if you are running a minority client definitely you are getting more rewards similarly the chart on the right side it shows offer some of the bigger pools and what combinations client distribution they are having well uh this is uh amazing that we are moving towards merge and client diversity is definitely crucial join us in building a resilient ethereum network thank you awesome thank you peter that was great i hope everyone got a lot out of that client diversity is definitely critical uh and important to ethereum uh fizz do we have justin drake we do um awesome welcome justin hi everyone yes i'm here so so glad to have you oh i'm just gonna interest to introduce you uh so go ahead justin drake is uh absolutely he has become one of my favorite ethereum researchers um if you've ever listened to him he's on bank list frequently uh and he he speaks so much truth um and so tonight uh we're gonna have justin talk to us about the energy efficiency or energy use reduction uh in the new ethereum proof of stake network so uh take it away justin yeah for sure so you know at a high level we're going to be reducing the energy consumption of the whole world by roughly 0.2 percent so ethereum right now is consuming 0.2 percent of all the electricity that is is produced bitcoin is on the order of 0.5 and i can't think of a single technological innovation that reduces worldwide you know and electricity consumption as much as the move to proof-of-stake does and one of the really cool things about this electricity reduction is that the mainstream understands it's something that's so obviously good um you know there's so many advantages to the merge but things like the security improvements things like the monetary improvements are much much much harder to to understand so i think as a community we we shouldn't be shy and we should really should be proud um of this achievement that that we've unlocked um and as tim baker said you know it's not just about the 0.2 percent of all the electricity of the world that we're consuming it's also the fact that we can't scale as a network we want to become the settlement layer for the entitled value we need to grow to trillions of dollars to have very high economic security and economic bandwidth and we can't go consuming two percent twenty percent fifty percent of all the world's uh electricity produced now the other thing that i wanna highlight in this discussion of electricity consumption is that it's only one side of the coin the other side of the coin is the hardware and this is always very much overlooked you know especially from bitcoiners who try and and talk about you know the the energy consumption being largely stranded energy green energy which may or may not be true but we know for sure that the a6 the hardware is not green it's it's usually hardware that depreciates fairly fast that that is you know single use in the case of bitcoin and that just ends up in in in a dump and building asics is is very resource intensive especially the leading um node a6 like three nanometer or five nanometer that i use to build these uh these pieces of hardware it consumes lots of of water etc um now in the case of ethereum there's millions of gpus specifically they're used to mine somewhere between 2 and 20 million basically it depends on what type of gpus is being used to mine but what we should expect to happen is these minimal gpus to enter the market and that to to to to lead to to a relief in in the the price of gpus for gamers so i guess it's good news all around um maybe except for for for the miners wow that is is so great yeah there are so many benefits that come from this shift of proof of stake to so many stakeholders um i would like to say you know no one's losing out but you know people who are gpu mining um this is hard for them and i i hope they choose to join us with proof of stake but it's so beneficial to everyone else thanks justin for sharing thank you awesome well the next topic i think is probably the most important one the reason we're all in ethereum uh decentralization it is critical to ethereum it is what we're all about and who better to talk about it than someone that i really respect in the ecosystem and that is all about decentralization superfiz himself so go ahead please take the floor yeah so i'm really excited to talk about centralization and i'm going to talk really fast because i think we have about 10 minutes before uh the merge itself and hopefully everybody's getting really excited we're looking forward to hearing from danny as we go into the merge but i want to talk about something that is so incredibly important to our entire network and that is that we become and maintain our decentralization as a network um people have this idea that you need to that we need to stake more coins on uh the ethereum proof of stake network we don't actually need to stake more coins that is not something uh that that will inherently contribute to our success but what will contribute to our success are people who stake in decentralized ways and that is solo staking from home that is identifying trustless open source decentralized staking pools and staking with those there's this this concept of minimal decentralization being enough for ethereum to succeed but it's not we have to have credible decentralization that means that we are so decentralized that nation states that corporations trust our network enough to act on them and if we rely on a few service providers to stake our coins for us then we don't have a decentralized network we we have um we we have a tool that that maybe people are trying to extract value from but we don't have a valuable decentralized network and that's what we need to build for if you want to stake with ethereum i encourage you not to look for the cheapest way to stake and the reason is the cheapest way that you stake may erode the value of the ethereum network so that your coins are worth less in 10 years but if you're staking in ways that bring value to the network like staking from home you're actually bringing more value to your own coins and so i really believe that's a better investment for the long term uh i would love for everyone to check out eathsunshine.com it is a reflection of our current decentralization and you're going to find there that uh it's not sunny it's not perfect we do have weaknesses but as a community ethereum identifies embraces and improves our weaknesses and that's why i'm here because we know that we can improve and we can do better and i really hope you'll join me in that uh that pursuit so yeah that is the centralization uh it's it's something that i'm never going to stop talking about and i hope you'll join me in that struggle yeah it can be a struggle sometimes right to kind of i guess like explain the benefits of decentralization why it's so important but thank you fizz for that i know we're uh we don't have much time here but we're gonna pass it to david now to introduce uh the next topic yeah the next topic it's actually getting down to the next topic is being the merge itself we are about eight minutes away there are 34 33 blocks and counting and so we're gonna have to actually pass it to some of the experts in the room here because we're getting down to it it's almost merge time and for a lot of the people that like don't know what's going on under the scene once we emerge it's going to be kind of confusing as to what we need to look at how we're how are we going to vet this uh what are we going to look at on the other side so i'm going to pass it off to danny ryan to uh tell us what he is looking at and what other core devs are looking at to be informed as to what the murder what's the state of the merge is after we actually hit that block number uh that ttd number danny are you with us yo what's up danny do we have a screen share of some logs and stuff and some uh dashboards yeah somebody able to share a screen we thought you were going to uh express those to us verbally i am i i can i can do it all verbally i know i know right okay so um i think we kind of got the gist the proof-of-work chain exists the beacon chain is watching and waiting for this terminal number at which point the the first block on the proof-of-work chain that it meets or exceeds this number the validators say okay i'm ready and they take over and so at this point you know we're they're all watching they're all waiting that is the point at which the first uh proof-of-stake merged block will be built so that's that's kind of i'm gonna go through kind of the sequence of stuff that we we we hope to see uh the sequence of stuff that might be some some some red flags we might start digging and that kind of stuff so we want to see that first block that the terminal total difficulty hit that first proof of stake block then that proof of stake mechanism not only builds blocks but validators send attestations so these these little messages that they say this is what i see this is what i see this is the head of the chain you know this is my view of reality and so right after we get that first block we also start getting out to stations and so in each block attestations from prior blocks and prior slots are included so we hope to see over the course of the first epoch which is 32 slots which is about six minutes we hope to see many blocks optimally we'll see 32. you know if we see 30 or more then we're like we're golden if we see a bit of a precipitous drop something like 25 in that range we're going to say okay something's looking a little bit weird we're going to be digging in but that's going to be one of our first indicators is that first epoch do we have many blocks and do we have similar percentage of attestation so you know if we're 90 plus percent on the blocks and the at the stations in that range we're going to be very happy there's also this thing each each block the sync committee this is also an indicator that similarly we want to see in that 90 plus percent range so after the the the merge block can happen anywhere inside of an epoch so we want to see the finishing of that epoch and then the finishing of the next epoch if we have over two-thirds of participation we're going to call that justified right and so if we look at one of these panels it says epoch and we see how finalized happens and justified it happens that we see pretty much you see an epoch is f is justified then you see an epoch is finalized so after that like six to nine minutes we're going to see if we have two thirds participation we're going to see it justified and then after the next epoch we're going to see it finalize so this process is going to take anywhere from 12 to 18 minutes depending on where that terminal block lands so let's see some of the other stuff in these panels that we might be looking for so on on some of the dashboards we're going to see participation uh we're going to see kind of these slots continue to increase we really want to see these these epochs increase that consensus mechanism is going to switch from preferred proof of stake ideally and then we also watch logs so nodes the implementation of the software they spit out what what they're seeing you know they pretty much say like hey i got a new block hey i this that you know and it's it's not it's not like it looks complicated it looks a bit scary at first but you know a lot of this is just human language it says ready for the merge and then says terminal total difficulty that kind of stuff so we're watching logs and one of the exciting things is when you see that first block pretty much i think all the all the clients uh have a nice ascii panda artwork displayed so that'll be kind of our first exciting indication we also watch block explorers this is um kind of a a visual representation of the state of the logs of what's going on here so this you know this beacon chain block explorer this is an open source explorer this is really cool we get to see live as blocks come in um through this sequence we also get a little bit of indication when we're watching um we're watching the the epochs justify so you get this nice visual representation as well um so that's pretty much what i'm going to be watching for you know really uh we want to see some of these really positive indicators and then we want to see that finality once we see finalization we can take deep breath breathe easy then we'll be monitoring you know obviously for the next couple hours for the next couple weeks and honestly we're monitoring all the time so i think we're about two minutes till so i will turn it back over to y'all wow two minutes till that is i have finally started to get the butterflies that that is pretty crazy uh okay uh what do we need to be looking at uh on screen here since we're about to like watch the moment we just is what happens next here are we waiting for we definitely want some panda logs i'm a stock individual all right so this is it huh we're just waiting for the pandas to show up this is the moment of truth come on now let's go let's go let's go hey we're planning the merge call make sure we have something to say when we're waiting in these times all right i'm going to give a shout out to you finance i love you all big hugs from kansas city that's all i got to say right now i'm going to go on mute love y'all glad to have you jeremiah you're a good man hey danny when merge [Laughter] it's never gonna now it's now it's literally right now seven quadrillion difficulty away the amount of times i've been asked this question but it is finally now the new question is going to be did it ever happen hey i got pandas pos activated pandas come on come on now let's go thank you let's go panda [Applause] [Music] and built so everyone we knew this would happen we knew that we would get this far there's nothing contentious yet the next 13 minutes are um the nail biting times so now it gets fun come on now all right i'm eating black licorice for eat finance and i'm going to drink some laphroaig scotch and a little bit of beet juice the merge is here i've been waiting to say that for so long after saying the merch is coming for years it's here oh my god come on i don't know we're still building a single chain we are not going to merge we have merged now let's finalize okay so i'm watching i'm watching logs and i've seen a block in every slot since the pandas which is a very good sign so we're you know we're like six slots in and i think we're at 100 block rate so that's that's implying that we have a very high percentage of validators online connected and running software that works we can also see transactions being included into the beacon chain right now kind of want to go make a transaction just to make money transactions on the uh on the mainnet i'm gonna send gas is a hundred a hundred way right now let me get an e s here wait what's the what's the gas what's the uh 100 100 so you're saying there is life on mars we got life on mars that's been validated come on benjamin you're the first ens i recognize so because i'm so eager to be a part of this i'm going to send you a transaction a hundred percent of blocks so far we have a blocker every single other really good news and the other good news is we've included enough out of stations to justify this epoch already that's about on par with what we're doing so this is looking like participation is is actually holding up to about where it was it's the next epoch really counts but this one's good someone click on a block and look at the um sync committee participation and we're all excited this is really a surprise we had every expectation that this would unfold this way but it's still very exciting to see it unfold in reality let's go let's go that's what i'm saying right now i was told we can't do sound effects so i'm not so i'm going to just say let's go let's go everybody should unmute and at least start to clap slow clap a little bit you know you know we don't have to go all in we don't have to you know we can just like enjoy the moment hey so for anybody who who isn't aware of this yet um gpu miners on ethereum are no longer active if if you're mining a gpu miner on the ethereum proof of work network nothing is happening you cannot well you can mine blocks but they will not be on the ethereum network attention gpu miners you have a huge future in a.i renderings your watch has ended no but thank you i mean i i never want to let's let's appreciate all the gpu miners did for us they they yes absolutely 100 absolutely a lot of us all did that thing i mean we all did it and i mean i eagerly welcome gpu miners to come to proof of stake um the network has done a lot for you you're a part of us join us in proof of stake so we've seen we've seen all blocks so far every slot has had a block so we want to see you know we want to see seven six justified what yeah but it happened par way through the epoch no no i'm just um i'm just impressed that we have zero misses like you know we we all kind of expected to have a few missed slots uh we just kind of assumed it and to have zero missed slots is impressive is my microphone working this time yes come on man preach another interesting note is that the supply has peaked at the merge and if you go to ultrasound up money you'll see that since the merge we've gone down by 31 if so far the website isn't an inflationary block yet um we may have had i can have a look no it looks like everything with 100 grey yeah 100 great grass price the website is a little unstable because we have 10 000 current visitors roughly and i'm one of them holy [ __ ] i'm one of them too so if you're missing on the fun there's 41 so the slot the slot visual on beacon chain is lagging i'm still watching logs and i think we're at a hundred percent uh block rate for all of these slots so again some of our some of the visualizers sometimes get out of whack um but the the nodes are true that's one of the things that i mentioned in the beginning we don't want you to take away what you see here and say um well you know i see three missed blocks um that's that's not the interpretation the as danny says uh they have better um better logs than than this visualizer which is being hugged by a lot of people so yeah how many minutes are left in this epoch halfway through this epoch okay how many minutes are in an epoch again it was something easy there's 32 slots in an epoch and we'll even know because the high percentage uh we'll probably know that justification is going to happen and you know two-thirds of the way into the epoch gotcha i want to shout out 22-23 yeah i really appreciate bitfly for developing beacon chain uh it's an awesome product don't refresh that because um i did hit cloudflare when i refreshed so it's getting hugged but we're there like this is happening yeah there were like 4 000 people on the front page and congratulations danny yeah congratulations danny tim every oh this is so awesome this is incredible congratulations well over a hundred people yes everyone who has put so much time in it um all of the people in this call have poured their heart and soul in it regardless of what your role is um you know it's not just developers it's not just researchers it's community it's home users it's people who have a commitment to make this network real so thank you guys so much for sticking with it like it's paying off right now i'm gonna just be a dead horse as they say i think we're a hundred percent of the slots have blocked so far that's like this is going as well as it could that's amazing so far tim wanted me to make sure i said so far well so far let me say thank you to all the client teams for all their excellent work i mean um i'm just looking at my my logs here and everything is just it's just amazing it's perfect um so really well done to all the guys who put all the all the guys and girls who put software together for this stuff it's fantastic is that some air it is samir hello danny shout out to those those guides holy [ __ ] like you've those guides have carried the uh the solo staking community i use those guides religiously thank you just interrupt slot 23 we have enough votes to justify this epoch so we we've technically justified the the the merge transition block um so we're we're 6.4 minutes away assuming continual optimal conditions of finalizing this thing so i'd like to say thank you to everyone on discord that helps each other out on discord it's a big help to us client developers so if you're one of those people on discord that helps each other out then thank you you made it happen thanks danny can you really just double down on what it means for this to get finalized why why is that significant so in yeah for sake we have this this notion of economic finality um in in proof of work technically you can theoretically have reorgs to any depth um economic finality and proof of stake um to have a conflicting chain that looks just as good you have to actually burn at least one third of all the state capital which is quite a bit of money these days um and so really what it does is it locks in these chain segments so at that block that becomes finalized and anything that came before it uh you know you won't have that reversion and so um finalizing the merge transition is really kind of that symbol of like you cannot revert uh you know it's it's it's the stamp it's the the economic uh certification that we're firmly in proof of stake so once we are finalized we are are locking in economically with the full weight of ethereum proof of stake ethereum proof of stake absolutely yes sick sick that's an understatement sick i think sick should be like uh like the underlying word of this whole event yeah oh hey i was gonna say vitalik are you still here maybe he will he left i'll have to look so we've missed one slot we've missed so far which is normal given you know there's like a 98 99 participation rate you do miss slots every once in a while um so we've missed one out of the last few epochs which i think is very normal so as we reach the final few minutes i just had a question so vitalik everyone's like super super excited right now and like really motivated and really loving ethereum in the community like do you have like a message for what people should do with that energy um i mean i feel like i have lots of messages that's the thing right like i think you know this is uh the the first step in ethereum's um big journey toward being a very a very mature system and there's still steps left to go we still have to scale we still have to fix privacy we still have to make the make the thing actually yes secure for regular users and all of this stuff and uh i think we all just we all needs to work hard and uh do our part to make all of those some other things happen as well so i mean i i'm you know like to me the merge just like symbolizes from the difference between um sort of early stage ethereum and you know the ethereum we've always wanted um early stage ethereum to to become so let's go and build out all of the other parts of that ecosystem and midnight certain theories into being what we wanted to be awesome just keep building it's worth noting just keep chugging we've lost about four percent of validators which uh my honest estimate was that we could lose 10 to 20 percent of validators um going down to 95 participation is incredible uh we have so much headroom there uh and it's likely that in the next hours uh those those four percent of offline validators will um correct their systems superfast why do you think we lose people because of the execution client missing you know i it has been misconfig in in the past uh i i you know i wouldn't be surprised have we required we've acquired jwt secret uh since bellatrix right so that that wouldn't explain it um i i'm not sure it's it's hard to know i mean it could be it could be some sort of intermittent failure with some sort of client pair that we just don't have good visibility on at this point um or it could be misconfiguration or all sorts of stuff um again this is the kind of thing where minus four percent is pretty damn good you know pretty pretty near optimal as i was saying if anything above 90 i think everyone's floored here um so but that's you know it's an indication that uh there's a little bit of digging to do over the next couple days but with with client diversity especially with like kind of the the node pairings across consensus layer and execution layer um you can have intermittent failures uh here and there and still have a resilient network um so that's what we're observing am i correct that we're about 12 slots before potential finalization three because because we know if if we're getting a high inclusion rate we know before we get to the epoch boundary that we're going to finalize which is it's called an unrealized finalization but it will in fact be realized thus we can celebrate at that point do we have to do we have to wait another epoch or was that or is that the previous oh so we've done that we've done that okay we went through the partial epoch then justified and then we're about to finalize how we doing it ditcha one more slot what so in a matter of seconds we will know that uh we've finalized ethereum proof of stake we we have it we have it we have it confirmed come on mr f was here again mr f joined us he's the first um block proposer on the beacon chain from december 1st uh 2020 so that was quite an exciting time but i get that date right what's our what's our transition block uh graffiti anything interesting coming there mr f was here has to be right oh that's the camera from the ethereum foundation that y'all are hearing there's a ton of people at the ethereum foundation office yelling right now and uh there's a camera being shown around yeah just imagine hundreds of people working on this for the past four years and researching for three years before that this is just an incredible feat we we did a hot swap of the ethereum network from proof of work to proof of stake didn't lose the transaction didn't pause the network um home users people using the network will have no idea that anything has changed but everything has changed we did it live we did it live we should soon um know the participation rate for 8.76 96.03 participation rate on um 8.76 happy birthday guys uh bye bye i have to go pick up my kid violet milo terrace welcome glad you come you came this is amazing like absolutely sensational as dany said that we made it live like ethereum has made history today uh with becoming billion dollar blockchain performing a successful network upgrade at this scale that you were live congratulations to client team definitely i would like to congratulate all the miners who helped us achieve the date of 15 september i remember when it was first announced by tim in the meeting that okay we are gonna have the merge in mid of september most of the news uh published it like 15 september we are going to get merged and see today is 15 september nice timing so awesome and it's worth noting um you know sometimes there's a need to explain away or describe something that that wasn't optimal but as far as i'm aware as far as i can tell from the stream everything was absolutely optimal so um that's just great like i i actually joked you know it happened in the middle of the night so we can fix it before morning if we have to but it's it's perfect uh everything's great um so this this is it's time to wrap up our call uh and so uh just to summarize in two seconds what has happened we began this night a couple hours ago as a proof-of-stake network with um thousands of people around the world mining ethereum with their gpus um about five minutes ago well i'm sorry actually about 13 minutes ago the entire network shifted to proof of stake now relying on validators with 32 ether deposits to guarantee the network and one of the biggest benefits of that is the 99.98 power reduction so that is our win that's why we're so excited and so proud of everyone involved so that does wrap up our call we're going to move into some closing stuff now and i'd like to introduce patricio worthalter i hope on your screen right now you're seeing the poep art canvas uh for the past couple of hours pixel droppers people in the community who hold these proof of attendance protocol pixels have been participating um and that project is uh is led by patricio worthalter and he has been a tremendously positive influence in our community uh supporting what we do supporting staking supporting decentralization and uh welcome patricio tell us what's on your mind today uh there's plenty of stuff on my mind um this has been so long in the making but let's make it this quick so we wrap up nicely we've done this pretty beautiful canvas um i don't think we ever had so many people um not only systems didn't crash we created a pretty unique piece of art in pov we are creating an ecosystem for the preservation of memories and for many of us this may be the most precious memory we will create in a long time um i don't think anyone here know we have developed a way for anyone who has participated in canvas to create a time lapse of the region they were painting so then you can have an nft of whatever you were doing while on the call i was talking to my very good friend and maybe calling him a friend is gonna get me in trouble roman storm and i was helping roman uh showing the canvas he's not much of a pop-up fan and create his safe tornado cache that you will get to see and whenever we are able to mean an nft of the process of roman placing pixels that's going to be an awesome piece of art and last thing that nobody has mentioned this has been so long in the making we have worked so hard that it kind of feels the end of the cycle but that not only that's not true it is completely the opposite this is the beginning of the cycle only now ethereum has completed what was promised on the first iteration and now we have a strong grounds to get to where we are to where we always wanted to be coming up next we are going to have nix explain how to get the most important pop of these days which is having been here at this time um nix are you around i'm here so i know about the 30 the 30 000 people on the youtube channel are all waiting for wenpoa we're here with the poet um so the idea behind the co-app is that we are uh doing a spam resistance mechanism with the co-op which is basically uh you're going to send 10 do you have those i can't see it um you're going to send 10 dollars to stateful.eve and this is stateful.eth is the protocol guild and the hosts here eastaker bankless daily white uh ethereum cat herders chose this because it's a really appropriate recipient of these funds so um the protocol guild did not request this we are forcing these funds on them um and the protocol guild is a collective of 119 core ethereum contributors and they maintain an on-chain registry of members and this allows the community to help fund and incentivize long-term core uh protocol contributions they also have a new nft home of the heart out that you can go um and those proceeds also go to core contributors so um donate ten dollars to stateful.e um and that can be on any network and it's going to be in die usd c rye uh is that it yeah um wait we can't sit do not send you need it has to be a stable coin okay i'm going back it has to be a stable coin we're doing die rai usdc um and then eastaker will comb through those and decide who's eligible um from those from everybody who donated the ten dollars and uh will drop a co-op dot delivery link where you'll be able to claim your co-op in the next week or two um just another note um we're we i think i think ten dollars is really fair for um this pope only because it is going it is a really important pull-up it is the probably the most important pull-up that we've had in a couple of years um it's very it's akin to like the beacon chain launch co-app um and um we will see some farming and so we want to make this a thing that isn't heavily farmed yeah that's we have no desire to extract from the community in fact it is something that we struggle with every day we want poep to be civil resistant um but also spam resistant and we don't have true civil resistance yet we cannot guarantee you are one person claiming a co-app and so our intermediate step is to be spam resistant and that way one person has difficulty claiming thousands of poeps rather uh we require a what i would say a fair donation to a an ecosystem aligned um project in order to receive that poem and um i'm i'm very happy with this system thank you patricio for the i i found that poep is an emotionally engaging project for ethereum one of the first emotionally engaging projects so um i love it um the slide is okay hold on we can we can or cannot use ease for this statefulnet youth donation i'm seeing both go by the slide okay okay that's fine sorry um i will get stable cleans um nix thank you so much for describing the po acquisition process uh and how long do people have to make that claim 24 hours 24 hours perfect all right um sounds like we're moving to the q a section and so i i want to for everyone who has come thank you so much we we dearly appreciate your attendance today we're going to move to a q a section for um essentially for journalists or for people who want to better interpret the merge because the most important thing is that we get the story right we're very proud of what's going on with ethereum and it's so important to us that the story is correct and we hope that's important to everyone here as well so we have a slido and i think that pooja hudson and nix are going to uh review questions and we know that developers can and contributors have a lot going on but we hope that you'll stay and provide uh some answers for those i know i see a couple people who i trust so well with these answers um so i'll let you guys take it over um and the slido is in the um e-staker discord if you want to go put in questions um so question let's go to the first the most uploaded question first which which do you see having a higher impact on stake distribution after the merge liquid staking with distributed validators like rocket pool or home staking i'm going to give that one to this okay i tuned out just for a minute and i tuned in when i began when i began to hear that that question was something i'm very interested in um will you repeat it for me one more time please yes um which do you see having a higher impact on state distribution after the merge liquid staking with distributed validators like rocket pool or home staking okay so um homestaking is the gold standard of staking uh the more decentralized the more stakers we can get in in homes the more decentralized and robust we are as a network um the second part of that question was about distributed pools like rocket pool rocket pool actually acts as a decentralized pool because they have over 1400 node operators and so it's a permissionless system and anyone who wants to run a rocket pool node can run the same as if they were uh running a solo node now the flip side of that are distributed uh liquid staking derivative products those are far less desirable for the protocol because they tend to centralize a lot of eth uh in a in a very um narrowly controlled environment and so i i think the best thing for the protocol is to avoid uh distributed or concentrated liquid staking derivatives and rather focus on uh liquid staking derivative derivatives that continue decentralizing the network rather than putting coins in one place we don't need a network where all of the coins are in one place or in the hands of a few people that is um that's false decentralization and that's that would essentially be us um being dishonest with ourselves about the health of our network sorry i get that that is my passionate topic so uh thanks for let me answer that hey go over the poep uh address again just for the listeners the poap address is stateful.e s-t-a-t-e-f-u-l-dot-e if you have a wallet that supports ens you can just go in and type stateful.eth if it doesn't recognize that you can go to etherscan.io and type in stateful.e and it'll give you the address i'm going to tell you right now it ends in 935f so that's what you that's where you should send the ten dollars so um yeah nicks i can take the next question on here um and direct it towards someone um so once the merge is live this is from slido again uh once the merges live should we expect consensus clients like tekku and prism to sort of be solidified and no longer needing updates um and i'll probably repeat the question one more time because it's a longer one uh let's go ahead ben could you answer this one potentially uh future updates sure we're always evolving um there's a lot to do the chain is always growing so we have to optimize um for one thing always keeping on top of performance and making things better uh and of course the ethereum roadmap never never stops we have um proto-dank sharding coming we have withdrawals coming we have a huge slew of things we want to develop and deliver over the next few years so we might take a little break for a few weeks but um but for sure the clients will keep evolving oh is proto-date sharding something that a cl client is going to have a lot of changes to it to implement i wasn't aware of that yeah for sure i mean all of the traffic now happens on the consensus layer so all of the um uh data is shared and gossiped on that layer now so yeah we absolutely have to include that awesome yeah i think um just maybe more generally in terms of future ethereum updates uh prototank sharding is definitely consensus layer heavy full dank sharding is uh like it is also in a consensus layer but it's also like very separate from the rest of the work then the verge is uh entirely execution layer um any like account abstraction evm object format blah blah stuff is all execution layer pps is probably somewhat weird mix of the two single slot finality is uh entirely consensus layer so i think realistically it is going to be some 50 50 between the two awesome thank you ben and thank you vitalik uh pooja do you have a question up and uh someone that you'd like them to answer i see a question here in the slidell uh it's like what is a reasonable expectation for success around liquid staking pools and decentralization what practical goals should we aim for heading into 2023 i don't know maybe someone from eat sticker or any kinda yeah this is another one that's kind of going over liquid staking and what we should be looking for in kind of an evolution of that is that right right let's see who's good anyone from eatstaker want to jump on for that or otherwise i'll throw it to superfiz i so i mean it is my obsession um liquid staking tokens are fantastic uh they are a way for more people to get involved with the network but what we need to focus on is that these liquid staking tokens are being good stewards of the network that they're not just putting all of the coins in one pot and and further centralizing so what we need are more uh staking protocols that uh operate in a permissionless way to allow node operators to come online and further decentralize the stake right now there is is one provider that meets the standard i really look forward to seeing five or six of these providers because we need several different versions of this liquidity token to continue decentralization what a lot of people will say is if you have one powerful liquidity token then you can do so much more in d5 with it but in fact what you can do with that is centralize the network and bring um tail risk to the network and and risk uh risk all of our success so in order for us to be really successful we need multiple um liquid staking protocols that are trustless to centralize and open source um we need to steer away from liquid staking derivatives who are focused on um becoming as large as they can be because of the the concept that that's more powerful in d5 the goal of staking is not to promote d5 the goal of staking is to promote the security and the health of the ethereum network you got to keep those two goals separate in your mind uh so one one question that we did see that i can quickly answer is um if we have some eth one in hardware wallets like ledger do we need to do any type of updates will there's to be eth1 and eth2 wallets you don't need to do anything to update eth ethers eth you don't have to do anything the next question that we have like four different versions of is what else is on the horizon for ethereum that is as big as the merge what are we looking forward to next yeah who wants to answer that one i mean the talk if you're still on here you did that talk recently that was really good on it yeah sure so i think just to go through the rest of the items on the so on the protocol side the buckets that have uh spl for the split things between are the surge diverge the purge and the splurge right so the surge basically is uh sharding right to the massive increase in the de facto scalability of the network that will come with the combination of the ethereum network being able to process much more transa data uh because of prototype charting and then full date charting and rollups being able to take advantage of that data space to provide a very high level of scalability for layer two roll up transactions uh so that's the search but by the way remember the surge diverge and the the poor the purge of the splurge they're not stages right these are all things that are happening in parallel uh so then the verge is the switch to vertical trees which will enable stateless clients so it'll be possible to be a validating node with uh zero um or close to zero hard drive uh usage uh well realistically i think it'll be a bit more zero but it's but significantly less than uh today and uh it will enable things like validating individual blocks and whatever order you want in whatever order you get them and real and uh really nice things like that so that's uh a lot of benefits from the from the verge um it will also just make it my much easier to be about to be a validator client especially if you combine it with proposer builder separation stuff then the purge is basically making the network more efficient by removing the need for the entire ethereum network to store like all of the different parts of the history and instead like history that's older than a certain amount of time will be uh shifted off to kind of specialized either sub-protocols or sister protocols so this will include like transaction history older than a year receipts older than a year even just responsibility for being able to interpret ethereum blocks that have older uh protocol versions right so that are like more than one or two hard forks old uh so that new ethereum clients don't have to support everything from genesis and they could be simpler and then the splurge is like the big jumble of everything else so like to me the big items in there are evm improvements um you know there's the evm object format stuff there's evm 384 stuff uh there is uh account abstraction and the whole roadmap from there there is a proposer builder separation and then there's uh a big long kind of laundry list of smaller things and then i guess you can put this into the merge bucket even though it's technically not part of the merge but it's like a longer term proof of stake and that's a single swot finality that's something that we've really increased our priority of uh recently just uh because we've been realizing the necessity for like further ongoing improvements to the proof stake mechanism so that will make blocks finalized more quickly it'll make a bunch of things hopefully simpler in the protocol and easier to verify that everything is secure so yeah just a whole bunch of different protocol layer improvements happening and then at the same time i think the uh on the application layer you know with uh roll ups we're going to solve scalability i think we're also going to see a whole bunch of privacy applications start coming over the next couple of years and you know hopefully at the same time we're going to see usability improve so just uh all of the different parts of the ecosystem are going to become more mature in a lot of ways and i think it's going to be great so awesome um i think it's time for us to appreciate everyone for sharing their time with us tonight um could you were you going to say something yeah i just wanted to have this wrap up with one last interesting story about how it all began like if i may invite mikhail to uh share the story of hybrid casper ffg project and how this all merge started i think it would be a good point to wrap up the interest rate much for today's car yeah hey thanks butcher can you hear me by the way yes great um yeah my name is mikhail i'm with consensus r d and like two years and a half ago i have started to work on the merge project it was like in the beginning of 2020 when i joined consensus but at that time i like deliberately choose this project to work on like likely yeah it's just great to you know to look retrospectively to all these events um a but uh one fun fact is that two years before uh i have started to work on the merge i have been involved almost accidentally in the hybrid casper ffg project we did a prototype of this approach to have a uh finale of the gadgets on top of the proof of work network this is like the first time where like i became familiar with the casper ffg which is now like main uh the actually the bft consensus mechanism that is used by a beacon chain and this time it was like in early 2018 and by that time it was like the first the first time i met daniel ryan so um and made this in yeah i just wanted to share this uh excitement and uh yeah and just had even taken a moment to um to say thanks to everyone to the community um to the community of developers users um and to the ethereum to entire theory mega system were given me a chance to um to to make the history of a blockchain technology and congratulations on on the hair um i almost ideal i would say it's just it was just ideal transition i didn't expect it would be so ideal yeah congrats everyone for this great job it was uh it went better than expected i was prepared i was honestly prepared for an hour before finality so that we got it right off the bat uh what a great success right absolutely and that i think is a wonderful story where we can probably wrap up congratulations to all the client development team infrastructure provider and network users and also the community member welcome to the merged world of ethereum blockchain and yeah that's all from our end thanks everyone thanks all bye thanks everybody thanks guys great match bye everybody thank you everyone congratulations
