okay and we're live um so hi everyone and welcome to the ephedium.org 2021 community call most people here have probably read the rough agenda but for the people here in attendance just because you heard there might be a pull-up um i'll do a quick explanation of what we're going to go over we plan to run the community calls on a a more regular basis than we have in the past hopefully monthly and we'll see how that goes our aims with these are to firstly update the community on what we're working on um as well as just as importantly why we're working on it allow community members and contributors to voice what they think is important work and be involved in shaping the roadmap going forward and also just helping on board contributors so for today's call we'll primarily be discussing the roadmap on the call but we're also trying to allocate a good amount of time to questions and discussions as well so if you've got any questions please write them down save them for length and we'll try and cover as much as possible um so before we get started on the road map i guess we can do some very quick introductions to the team i'm already speaking so i guess i'll start um i'm joshua from glasgow and scotland i work as a community leader in the ethereum dork i'm saying fairly early in my crypto journey i joined the team back in july um before starting i just persistently annoyed them on discord and github until they eventually gave me a job um prior to that i worked as a front-end developer as well spending some times in sales and trading towards becoming an architect hey everyone i'm luca i'm working on the ethereum.org translation program before this i worked as a professional translator and language lead for some of the largest translation agencies and i'm happy to be able to share that experience in this space help make ethereum more accessible help grow the global ethereum community yeah looking forward to talking more about the translation program a bit later on okay hello my name is pablo i joined the ethereum foundation in june this year i i'm from buenos aires argentina um and well basically i'm a front-end developer i like to build things for the for the web my entire career i developed things for the web 2 and since the end of last year i i started to get more involved in developing for web3 using web3 technologies so i'm interested in that i'm interested in in ethereum and i would say the crypto space in general hey guys uh i'm corwin i started in june as well at the ethereum foundation i also work as a web developer on ethereum.org and before this i was working as a mobile and full stack developer at an agriculture tech company um yeah that's me hey everyone i'll go next uh paul wacker um i joined the ef with ethern.org website team back in january this year my former life was actually in healthcare i've been transitioning over the past couple years into the computer science realm i've been down the ethereum rabbit hole really ever since heavily since the covert crash but been involved loosely in the crypto space for the past few years and likewise love building stuff for web3 i think this place is super exciting hey guys my name is sam um from boston in the us currently living in california i've worked with the ethereum foundation for a little over two years now um worked on a handful of projects as a software developer primarily focused on on this right here though ethereum.org um and i guess just like quick point to say is that you know this is what the ethereum.org core team technically is um but i think worth mentioning you know like ethereum.org is largely community driven and you know we have hundreds of content and code contributors thousands of translator contributors many of you here on the call are probably already contributors or interested in contributing so thank you for being here and i guess to just give a quick recap of you know like what is ethereum.org we really see ourselves as you know the portal for for ethereum we serve ourselves as the front door to ethereum so we think about just like what are the best ways that we can onboard people into the space whether that's acquiring their first east finding a wallet figuring out how to run a node how to stake how to actually build a dap how to just like get introduced to all the various communities in the ecosystem so yeah really excited to have you guys here and be a part of this this open source community thank you sam um with that i guess we can get stuck into a few of the items on our roadmap obviously we don't really have enough time to cover everything but we've selected a few things we'd like to share and get some feedback on maybe um one of the the first things that we're working on is a revamp for our learn section so on ethereum.org we have two very distinct ways of learning about ethereum we have our developer docs and we also have what we've dubbed like our learn pages which is everything just included in this section here um obviously the early adopters of ethereum were primarily developers or very technical people but as that dynamic is starting to shift where we've got a lot of non-technical non-technical people who are interested in ethereum ideally we don't want these people who have very technical documentation to get started um so if you were to navigate to feeding.org and have a look through this originally it just started as a very simple list but quickly it's grown like quite unwieldy and quite difficult to navigate our plan is to redesign the current learn page which is just this page here as you can see just a collection of random links somewhat organized one thing that we've been inspired by as our developers hub so similar to this page where we try to teach people about the fundamentals of actually developing on ethereum itself and we want to create a structured page that will teach people the basics with as little technical jargon as possible and then arrange that in a way that's very easy to navigate for them to go through and the hope with that being that we can try to enable as many people as possible to learn about and get involved and with the feeding yeah i guess next i'll talk about um our wallets page uh right now we're looking at kind of revamping especially the find wallets page uh one of the main reasons is because it's really unwieldy for new users coming into the space one of the first things that you do i'm sure as most of you know is getting an ethereum wallet that's how you interact with the network and applications on it right now when you land on that page there's just i can't remember what we're at like 37 wallets or something like that it's very confusing for our kind of like new users that are on boarding to pick a wallet because they're just flooded with information so one of the things we're going to try and do not try and do one of the things we're going to do is take away some of this decision fatigue when it comes to selecting a wallet we're trying to kind of figure out some ways to do this without explicitly picking kings in the space so definitely open to input from the community on things that we could maybe be doing to make wallet decisions easier without you know king picking um but we may go down the route of having a bit of an editor's choice for the time being just to make it easy for someone new to come to the page and see some wallets that we have like decided to be kind of like easy to onboard into the space with and then in addition to that we're going to take a look at some of our filters that are used for filtering products this space has definitely changed a lot since this page was created um there's nfts now nft support and wallets aren't great at the moment and we definitely want to highlight some of the ones where that's um supported in them as well as kind of looking at some other filters to make it easier for users to filter down to the wallets moving forward after they've kind of like onboarded in the ecosystem yeah another goal we have uh for this quarter is accessibility um we we consider this an important thing to have in our website as we are spreading uh knowledge about ethereum and and well basically for those for those who doesn't know accessibility for a website is basically adding to the to the site the ability to be accessible for everyone and that that everyone without the regardless of of the disabilities they may have that they can use the the website and that they have a a good user experience so we will be focusing on improving accessibility uh in in the short term uh we what we are going to do is basically start analyzing the site and detecting things that we can improve um then we will give a priority to those those tasks and and after that we may create github issues and we can start working on them and probably you you will be able to to help us and contribute to those tasks um uh a second thing that we have like the idea to work on this accessibility epic uh is like adding up an automated process uh that runs periodically [Music] and which will run benchmarks that will throw us uh like a report or a score uh on on accessibility terms uh so that we can start comparing these scores and and we can take conclusions if we can improve on top of what we already have or if we are better or worse than than before basically um so yeah that's the the goal for accessibility uh i would like to take the opportunity to basically request or actually ask you guys if you have a uh if you already have detected some issues on accessibility terms please let us know in the channels or send me a message so that we can add those things in in this list and then we can start working on them nothing can happen from there um paul again uh one of the other initiatives that we're going to be focusing on coming up is education around running a node we've got some instructions on this right now that are relatively buried inside the developer docs and we are looking to make this more of a high-level page something that's a little bit more user-friendly i'd like to provide with that education around why running a node is actually important the benefits of that beyond just staking kind of clearing up maybe some misconceptions about oh i need to be a miner to run a node um and presenting it in a more user-friendly way that kind of guides users through are you somebody who's comfortably with command line or would you prefer some you know pictures of you like a gui and helping to guide people through those steps to easily start spinning up the node and contributing to the decentralization of this glorious network um with that is also going to be kind of advancing some of the education material around staking itself they're not exactly the same obviously you can run a node without necessarily staking but if you're a staker you're going to have to run a node somehow but stickers well that is if you're sticking over 32 with so we're working through the whole path here to try to to guide people to to what works best for them to try to include as many people in this journey as possible like i said along the way providing education as to some of the pros and cons of different options so that is all in the works the other important thing with this is going to be emphasizing the importance of client diversity this has been a big topic on the with all the network upgrades lately we are right now kind of it sounds like things are slowed down for the merge because we want to make sure that the network is safe before we actually go through with that that's more on the core dev side that's not you know some official thing it's just a matter of we need to work on client diversity on the on the consensus layer side with things like prism having a majority of clients right now so we want to provide some education about that why it's really important to aim to run a minority client if you're going to be staking and running your own home network so that type of content is coming as well hey guys sam again and one initiative i'd like to call out that we're trying to get done this quarter is hiring so our team is looking to hire a product designer this quarter um and just i guess quick reminder like so we are funded by the ethereum foundation but we are for the most part a small independent team there's the six of us here that have been talking that make up this core team as of now um so we're looking to yeah bring in a product designer if you are enthusiastic about open source and designing in public if you love ethereum and want to help improve the experience for a diverse range of people coming into the ethereum space we'd be really excited to to potentially work with you so this would be full-time contract position um you'd really be coming in as our lead sole designer so helping from initial storyboarding creating wireframes all the way from lo-fi sketches to prototypes and high-fidelity visual designs if you love prototyping in tools such as figma or sketch you want to work on a collaborative remote team and you're excited about the idea of just working on a small scrappy team and potentially wearing many hats i would love to chat with you we would love to chat with you so we will be working to post a an official job description hopefully by the end of this week but in the meantime yeah feel free to hop into our discord uh we do have a jobs channel in there that's for just like broad ethereum jobs in the space i guess call it to that if you're just looking to hire or are looking for a role in the ethereum community more broadly that can be a good spot to look in our discord channel but if you are specifically interested in this role um definitely feel free to reach out and yeah looking forward to uh chatting with a bunch of you on that cool um so luca again um i'm gonna be talking a bit about the translation program let me just start off by sharing my screen there we go so i would like to give you a quick overview of what the translation program is how it works some of our plans moving forward basically the translation program is an initiative to translate the website into as many languages as possible to make the content available to everyone ethereum.org is an open source website the translation program is managed in the same spirit as in it allows everyone to contribute it allows bilingual community members to contribute by helping to translate the website to their language um obviously a big thank you to all of our translators who are the biggest part of this program dedicating their time and skills to helping us reach more people make ethereum content more accessible i can see some of you on the call today recognizing some of the names that's awesome to see as well um yeah first off let's start off with a brief overview the translation program has been live since 2019 the scope of the program and variety of contributors has been growing ever since the website is currently available in 37 languages um planning on adding more very soon since the program started we've had over 2200 people contributing 2200 community members getting involved helping us translate the website which is amazing um you can see our vision what we are aiming for essentially translates important contents for the global ethereum community support knowledge sharing across languages increased ethereum's inclusivity and accessibility stuff like that um yeah this is a metric showing the unique page views on the website by languages excluding english this shows how much demand there is for translated content for example in december you can see this increase in december this corresponds with a lot of new translated content being added to the website and this increase shows that the demand is there and as much translated content as we can make available the more people are going to be interacting with it basically next up a quick overview of the translation process so how it actually works um the first step is exporting the contents for translation from github where our website lives and adam gets the crowd in crowding is the localization tool that we use to handle all of our translation and review needs it contains a lot of great crowdsourcing functionality and a number of professional translation and review tools that help increase the productivity of our translators and the quality of the translations once this content is uploaded to crowdin community members start translating it we provide them with some of the functionality so translation memory glossary screenshots for context we're also there to help answer any questions and issues that they might have and try and resolve yeah try and resolve any issues that might they might run into while working on the project the content for translation is divided into what we call content buckets which are divided by priority that allows us to add the translations for the high impact pages and the most popular pages on the website quicker um all contents yeah after uh after a given content bucket is fully translated it gets reviewed by professional reviewers so basically all the content after translation and gets reviewed before being added to the website and the final step to this process is adding the translated content back to the website and making it live for our global ethereum community next up some of the things that we've recently been up to this is this these are just the most recent our most recent initiatives um for example earlier this year we started translating the ethereum staking launchpad that is currently available in 17 languages with a number of others also in the works helping us making helping us to make staking more decentralized of this content available to more people another exciting initiative that we started this summer are translation groups this started with the chinese translation group which is set up on wechat managed by the chinese translators themselves um we also have translation groups for some of the most popular and active languages that are set up on our discord um these the translators can use these translation groups to get in touch with the team ask questions coordinate between each other or simply to get connected we have also recently changed the way how we approach content management and crowding this new approach allows us to order reviews faster gets translated content added to the website faster and finally in october we also expanded the co-apps we offer our contributors including translators um now we have unique apps for translators that have translated over a thousand and ten thousand words respectively that's pretty much it for our recent developments and finally some of the things that we're looking to add moving forward um these are basically our goals for the next quarter um first of all we want to further acknowledge our translators and ways of showing them how much we appreciate their contributions and try to support them as much as possible so in q4 we're going to be creating translation leaderboards um we're going to be creating a credits page where we're going to be listing all of our translators on the website also planning on creating a certification plan for professional translators or upcoming translators who are looking to further their careers next up we are planning on expanding the scope of content we translate since there is other high impact content in the ethereum ecosystem that could be localized we would love to hear your ideas about what content would be highest impact to translate and make more accessible something else we want to focus on is automating and optimizing as much of the translation workflow as possible as well as continuing to build out our translator resources um better resources lead to better productivity and translation quality and finally we're always trying to help other projects within the ethereum ecosystem set up or upgrade their own translation efforts sharing some of our experience and best practices that's pretty much it this you can use this qr link to visit the translation program page on the website that contains all the relevant information and links um there's also gonna be a link in the chat um yeah you can find more information about the program on this page if you're already on crowding you can search for ethereum.org join the program directly for questions feedback or ideas you can reach out to us on discord or in crowded that would be pretty much it thank you awesome thank you very much luca thanks for everyone for sharing so this is the exciting part that everyone's probably waiting on um the passcode for the po app is ethereum slash dot slash org if you go into our community pro-apps channel and message the poet bot with that code should get a link sent to you and if you just click on that link and add your ethereum address or email you'll get sent your plot for the call i'm just going to leave it a minute or two just to let people do that before we carry on to the next part or if someone could confirm if that link is working i was having a little issue with that myself wait so you go to the you have to message the poet bot yeah so there's a community up channel if you click on that you'll see the poet bot if you just message the bot and uh should get the pop-up sent to you you messaged the pull-up with the password which was ethereum.org right yes ethereum slash dot slash org so i've got it here just to be clear for people is anyone able to confirm that that's worked for them i think it works now it wasn't working but just started yes i was not having success but it seems to be working now yeah sometimes the po-apps if there's a message saying can't find the code or something like that you can refresh the page or try and open it in a different browser and that should work [Music] great um well everyone's doing that i guess we can move on to the next section which is where we just like to select you know some questions some feedback just an open discussion with anyone here that's on the call who wants to share something about ephedium.org maybe something that we've spoke about and the the epics we've highlighted from a roadmap or just maybe some just that you've noticed a question that you've got anything like that um there's quite a lot of people here so i don't know if people have questions if they want to just maybe raise their hand and we could call on them might be a good way to do it or if someone has a question and they just want to jump in feel free there was a question i think in the chat for for luka i think about what service are we using for the translations what professional reviewers are we using lionbridge i don't know um we've just basically started cooperating with acolyte or amplexer for the review service yeah don't be shy does anyone else have any questions is everyone so busy trying to get their pull up i have a question for folks on the call um yeah i'd just be curious everyone here um i mean feel free to just write in the chat if that's the easiest way but like what are the the communities within ethereum whether that's you know discord servers subreddits twitter lists what have you like just curious to hear what you what you find to be the most like welcoming and and useful communities uh within within the ethereum ecosystem i'd be really curious to just see like how people have learned how to get into this space uh i am i am happy to go first i uh i just recently discovered crypto and ethereum probably this past summer um i would say i think what you guys do at eth you know east.org is awesome um so i'd kind of put that at the top of my list and then i think after that i'm primarily a discord user and so the other one i've found helpful is i think there's an eth staking server and that was a great resource for me when i was figuring out like what is pooling do i have to run my own node like can i have someone else hosted what if my computer sucks because i have or my wi-fi sucks because i have comcast because i'm in boston and why i find the east coast is never good um so that that's been super hell i think generally there's i haven't seen kind of pockets of ethereum that have been you know quote unquote toxic or unwelcoming i'm a non-dev and so i think i value that a lot just because you guys are all much smarter much more capable than i am i'm just kind of here watching um yeah i can pick it back on that i actually also kind of entered into this space quite heavily through the east taker community actually the e-sticker discord um i think i saw in vatican the call at some point you might have bounced at this point but i remember the ethos over there when i when i was starting to get involved was welcoming first and knowledgeable second i've tried to carry that with me at least through to ethereum.org as well in our community we want to make this a place where anybody can come in potentially ask questions speak up voice their opinion and not just be shut down or you know people just disregard their opinion i want everybody to feel welcome in this space and have a place where they can ask questions and we can you know bounce feedback between each other in a comfortable way but yeah the e-sticker community definitely a plus one on that one um and i've been in touch with those folks as well as far as some of the endeavors i talked about expanding the staking solutions and i will be in touch with them more about getting a good page about running a note i did see one question in the chat from maybe z-u-y-w-q-q-2221 yeah i mean suggestion for people with no coding background to get involved with the community i think it's a great question and i think it's honestly an honest misconception that like you need to be a developer or some cryptography researcher software engineer in order to contribute to ethereum and i think like more and more i think it's getting easier for really anyone to be able to come in whether that's you know just like writing content to help educate whether that's participating you know in discord communities coming on community calls such as this you know taking call notes joining some of the the developer roadmap discussions elsewhere um translating like luca just talked about if you're if you're bilingual at all um i think there's yeah a lot of ways to come in and make an impact and i would say if you are you know potentially interested in getting a job full-time within the ethereum ecosystem there's plenty of job boards out there we list a few on ethereum.org but companies are hiring or projects are hiring for the entire spectrum you know operations marketing support communications um not just the technical fields i think it really is getting to a point where yeah companies and projects are recognizing that you know we need more than just developers to make the vision of you know the ethereum um a reality so yeah definitely feel free to to ask follow-up questions again in our discord if you're just not sure the best way to get involved um but i think it's easier now more than ever to to hop in and join a community and make an impact yeah i mean so for me um i have no coding experience and uh i guess i'm fairly new to the community as well but i found that the discord server has been phenomenal with just you know answering questions and being pretty helpful like i don't know it seems like maybe in other areas that's not always the case i'm not sure sure how people normally act or react but i've never really seen any bad bad actors um at all on the server so i think that's quite quite phenomenal um with what you guys have have kind of instilled with the community awesome to hear yeah i would say really if you ever find yourself like interested in a particular project for one they usually have an open public discord so you can get involved i would recommend just starting by saying like hey here's what i know how to do you know i can write i can design i can do operations and i think that's a great way of just kind of letting yourself um be open to those opportunities like for instance many projects need help with just documentation given how fast the space is moving and that can be a great way to just get your foot in the door prove that you're a competent person that you're reliable there's so many dows out there for instance that need help they just need people who can prove that they'll actually follow through and do stuff when asked so i think that can be a great way to actually lead to whether it's a part-time full-time paid position definitely a lot of opportunities and i've definitely seen a lot of opportunities in like community management and like content specifically largely just due to the fact that like developers kind of suck at writing for your average person and there's like definitely a high demand for people who can take the technical jargon and distill it down into something that's like more palatable for your average reader i guess at the end of the day because like right now lots of people are intimidated by the space just due to like the complexity of it which is like very valid i was as well even as a developer and then yeah reading some like more distilled down books like into the ether and stuff like the and the infinity machine like content like that that really boils it down is very invaluable in this space i think great um we've got a question in the chat for luca i would like to ask you when and how you'll manage the rules for people updating as a reviewer yeah um i mean the reviews are done by our language service provider right so we have uh there's a translation agency that we're cooperating with and basically they review all the content which is much easier than having to someone having to find someone to review the translated content for like 25 languages or something um and the there have been a lot of issues reported where the already the content that was already reviewed and approved is incorrect and yeah we'll be ordering a review for those as well at some point to sort of clean up all the translated content even the one that has already been reviewed and approved hope that answers your question another question in the chat is there a space for product managed to contribute i found it challenging to find how to contribute and work with engineers and designers like i do in my full time web 2 job i would say that one thing that i've definitely seen and largely in the dow space is that there's definitely a need for like people in non-technical non-developed roles like product managers and we actually have a section on our i believe it's on our contributing page let me pull up that goes into some of the ways that product manage maybe it's not on this page um but we i'll try and find it in a second but yeah we do have a section on our site that goes into ways like as a product manager you can't get involved but just to go back to what sam said earlier one of the best things is just to get involved and approach these communities and say this is what i'm good at and this is what i can offer and do you have space for that and at least from observing the space inside being in that in the last six or so months i've found that for a lot of people that's really successful and it's how they get their start it's quite a different mental model than the whole web to space or if you apply for a job if you have an interview process and you get a job or not a lot of people working in this space is quite scrappy to begin with you know they start doing little bits here and there and then that's noticed and then that transforms into full-time rules a question for joshua in the chat um where can you find time to help me finish and commit my pr um i'll try and get back to you and we can work through that maybe later on and just or if not tomorrow um josh i'm just gonna go back to that question before about project management as well um there's definitely companies out there that are hiring product managers as well um like chain link kind of these bigger i think if you can like find a bigger project they're probably looking for product managers of some sort um like i've seen them on ave chain link kind of like big big companies in the space that way if you're looking to do it more like small scale then like raid guild definitely has um a role for product managers so there's definitely avenues to do work like that in the space i had a question um you guys earlier you mentioned like the the core team i don't know if that just like chorus in like the main people at the ef or core from like a developer perspective but i know that josh stark is also i'm not sure if he's on here but can you like talk about his role at the ef at all or yeah i can give some quick perspective on that and thanks for the question probably worth clarifying um when i mentioned i guess core ethereum.org team yeah i mean specifically to ethereum.org um so the ethereum foundation more broadly is about 150 175 total people a mix of full-time and part-time um how the the foundation is organized might be best to think about of just like autonomous individual startups each working on their own sector or product or area of research so the theorem.org team the six core members of the ethereum.org team that have introduced themselves and done most the talking here again yeah that's just specific to ethereum.org josh stark we do work with occasionally he's kind of somewhat an advisor to our team and helps out from like an editorial perspective from time to time um but he largely deals with just like general operations throughout the foundation so hopefully that answers your question definitely yeah sure thank you um oliver you have your hand raised yeah i'm just curious uh sam just mentioned like the whole organization and all that and i was just wondering how do you how do you manage to like follow a coherent direction if this is off topic you don't have to answer but it's just a very interesting topic that i've been thinking about do you mean for ethereum.org specifically or the ethereum foundation in general or like the ethereum community at large i guess what i'm still wrapping my head around right now is the dow like decentralized organization so how does how do you keep both legs moving in the right direction if you're brain you don't have a brain you know it's just like everything's working on its own that's a great question i'm just wondering what you think about it or like your your experience with this i mean for one to be clear like ethereum.org or the ethereum foundation more broadly we are not a dow like we are a non-profit foundation we have a legal entity based in switzerland but within the ethereum ecosystem there are you know hundreds if not thousands of dows and i think in short there's no silver bullet answer in terms of how they accomplish what they're looking to do i think it varies largely depending on the dow from from my personal experience and what i've seen is just like you know a dow can range from just like a discord community with a multi-sig to like a much more specific and well thought out like organizational structure for how people get involved and the road map they're working towards whether it's you know a product or a group of people just trying to purchase an nft together um or you know something more vague or more ambitious so again i think it really depends on the project but i think in large like having a community having a a membership and having like a clear vision statement set forward can really help with that i think often it's somewhat similar to just like an open source software project in terms of you know anyone can contribute to linux sure there are you know specific members who really do set the direction more than others but it is a true community open source effort in terms of like who can get involved who can contribute and who can make an impact yeah i'd say for like the dows the i've had a like really hard time wrapping my head around it too so i don't it's a very confusing topic i found but i was doing some like reading lately and the handbook that raid guild has i think was probably one of the best like reading materials to understand how i guess that specific dao operates but it's very clear on like this is how you enter these are the roles we have um this is how you would like become a member move up the ranks get compensated stuff like that and it's of all the dows i think it's one of the best ones i've seen in terms of like actually laying out how it operates so i would definitely go check that one out if you want to like kind of get an idea of a well-functioning dao i suppose yeah i dropped some links in the chat as well for those interested both to raid guild and to dao house those are two decent starting points for anybody looking to to get more involved in the stuff learn a bit there's some documentation on the raid guild page i would encourage you to start hopping in the discords introducing yourselves reading through the ducks a lot of stuff out there for sure thanks for the question um is there anyone else who wants to post in the chat or maybe speak up and ask a question i think i saw one scrolled up a little bit that we might have missed paul mcsoon what are you as a core team looking forward to in the next year or so it's a loaded one and for myself it's not confirmed yet but i definitely want to start bringing some web3 functionality to ethereum.org for users to experiment with in kind of like a honestly like a closed environment but like a trusted environment i guess yeah i agree i think there's a lot of opportunity to you know given that we are somewhat the front door to ethereum you know millions of people visit ethereum.org every month like we have a unique opportunity to give people tangible exposure to the world of web three right like it can be very intimidating and daunting for someone to buy their first eve transact with that on mainnet you know waiting for the transaction to finish pending are you sure you sent it to the right address if this is your first time doing it it can be like really overwhelming and i think even for like people who are super experienced in the space there always is that like gut-wrenching moment after you send a transaction of like oh did i do it right so i think one simple like onboarding flow that we could we could build and i'd be really excited to bring that to ethereum.org you guys just like helping people you know download a wallet can we give some gamification to it like issue them a po-app if they can come back and prove it can we send them some test net eth can we have them send it around interact with dapps experiment with their first ethereum transactions in a completely like risk-free environment just to get a sense of how things work how to approve transactions what's the right way to go about this learning a bit about you know private key management i think there's a lot of cool stuff we could do with ethereum native features directly on the website so that's definitely an area i'm looking forward to exploring and like yeah if you guys have ideas on stuff you'd like to see of like hey i wish when i first learned about this like i wish i could have done xyz um that's the kind of stuff we'd definitely be keen to know about yeah and i've also posted a link in the chat to our product roadmap obviously it doesn't cover into next year but a lot of the things on this could also be things that we work on in a larger scope next year like these are really the things that we've identified right now as things are important and i'm sure there'll be a couple of things that will be carried on over in the start of next year as well yeah just to go back to the question of what we're excited about i would say i'm excited about expanding the translation program building out the functionality there onboarding new translators helping to support our current translators and making ethereum content accessible to more people and just pushing out more translated content to help grow the global ethereum community uh yeah i i had one i don't know if this is the right forum for it but just giving you guys kind of have been building this and working hard on the merge just curious um [Music] just curious what you where kind of we stand today so question one and then question two is just um maybe not i know you won't or we should probably not comment on specific projects out there um that are in ethereum but just you know the state of scalability solutions today and there's a ton of different approaches and there's a lot of really smart people tackling it different ways but it is uh it's still really hard for me to buy a piece of art on openc so um there's not much on polygon that's listed there so i'm just kind of curious giving you guys our builders what you're seeing on that side thank you as far as here go ahead paul oh no you you uh i was gonna say listen so just to kind of clear it up too like the team you're seeing here we're the core ethereum dot org website team so we are not directly working on protocol level stuff uh as far as what's classically been known as eth2 all these upgrades that are going on the merge the beacon chain there's a whole other team essentially teams working on that the different uh client teams essentially so we're not directly involved in that but we do communicate with those folks um and yeah ultimately the way i see it is the scaling sharding is going to be one of the biggest solutions um in the meantime though you may have noticed the road map for quote unquote eth2 has evolved over time where we've the phases have kind of been phased out in favor of more of a roll-up centric roadmap where we've you know there's been focus on arbitrarium and optimism and also zk roll ups trying to get those to kind of bridge the gap right now to help with scalability while we can transition to proof of stake shut down mining essentially and eventually that'll pave the way for sharding which is going to be one of the biggest layer one main net scaling solutions there is essentially i for one i'm also patiently waiting and excited about it yep we all are yeah i just dropped a couple links that i recommend following um both danny ryan who works at the ethereum foundation and ben edgington who's the product manager of one of the the e2 clients they both post like regular updates about just like the latest on eth2 developments as we approach the merge right now looking like potentially q2 of next year but overall progressing steadily along i know there's test net in like an active test net that has executed the merge i know they'll be like releasing small test nets basically every week up until we reach it so i think a lot of progress to be excited about on just like the general eth2 merge updates as far as like layer two stuff goes um i mean it's exciting it's happening i think a great resource to check out is uh l2beat.com i just shared in the chat that provides an overview of a lot of the projects that are live and active um you know what kind of volume is happening on those and just an overview of like what is this layered to you know what are the trade-offs they approached just so you can do some education for yourself of just like you know what are the risks involved with bridging my assets over to this layer two um what are what are some of the considerations um involved with that so definitely an exciting space i think a lot of projects that you know have come online over the past couple months past few months and will continue to come online and scale so the nft minting is becoming more and more accessible over time hopefully yeah i think like keeping a tab on the bridging protocols for this when you want to move around your nfts and other tokens will be good as well i know like hot protocol is a big one but i mean they are very necessary but also they've been some of the biggest hacked protocols so far so definitely an interesting thing so i think with that we're pretty much at time just wanted to thank everyone for joining and hopefully we'll see quite a few of you again next month uh if you have any other questions anything you don't feel like asking here or anything you want to just ask privately feel free to hop in our discord and just ping the team directly or dm if you want but thanks again for everyone for joining thank you everyone
