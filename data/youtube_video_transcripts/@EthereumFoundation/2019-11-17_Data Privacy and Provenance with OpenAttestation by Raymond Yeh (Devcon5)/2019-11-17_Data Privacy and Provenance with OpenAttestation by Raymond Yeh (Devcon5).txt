[Applause] you all yeah so I noticed that the population really uses when it comes down to you know identity systems data and problems and this mystery date you know people who like Tristan existing right so my goodness here today is also to talk about our journey Isis nation great Singapore going through there's this whole idea of data privacy importance from a government perspective and from there basically just what you want what we walk away with is the lesson that make a friend and launch a nationwide a solution or I have the distance right and how you preserve data privacy okay you can get this across to the general politics without that that is really a huge gap right between what the developer have my and West Rihanna right palm the kind of thing that we speak about in conference because just bring out the public and expect people understand right we thought that as that you share there's a lot of Lassiter's on from doing such solution right and basically we are also aware that right now I don't think there's a decentralized way of representing our visual images right on this centrally on rendering things right and we have a solution for that and they still acacia tax photos of you are the more technically inclined so it would be a story and a story started as the first talk was about a hundred watt halogen right and then it helps driving the political the Destiny to provide you with it and all the questions starters like hey can we watch in this right so horse man did you I make out if I show you right what exactly this open attack station of instance these will be talking to you so that you get understanding of where the perspective comes from rights instead is internet will go right to end this is basically autocratic say it's really simple so you have her JSON document as today call itself right people side in the hot dry email whatever right and it's yeah and all that it's random in a way that's familiar to people right you don't have to use a special until you don't want you could have one and basically when document is structured in a way that is it looks good and looks familiar to you if you get it from your university it's going to look like Young University certificate because we do support things like right watching you get a set and they're just really cool when you show people that you can have to use insert and really just upon that how we do annual data privacy and this is something really cool that we want to talk about later where I can obfuscate something oh I couldn't change any data often so I do this I can actually remove data element but it doesn't affect the half of the document so that I can needle and verify this document game without an issue reassuring this the screen all right so I'm trying to keep the tank expect of this moles of that if you're interested in the tank I swear I wish feel free to ask me about it at the end right so so that's pretty much what we have right want it to be really simple for citizens and even people in general to use so Jeannie beginning like that the shoe fits you know your site looks like we've got changes and really you just want to be validated just to make sure that it that it's really alignment on the business as well as the technical that's our version one and then that's where you realize that's a big time right so you know about that and yes when we launch version due to actually pick up certain things right on scaling it on low so the first one is really just the proof concept and it's not an offering our Polytechnic who just came to us and say hey can we have our chains on case I hostage get on the blockchain right the other we know so the issues here is that what is certificate what is a certificate right when you want the data to install definitely not a good option and how do you issue them so that these the sim ability of the budget does not affect you you know you have track seven you have a few transactions it's not gonna help you scare with 50,000 suits in a batch right so our solution is really simple we put data we hash it we can hash we take the following put it into a weapon that does the rendering as well as the checking of the profits it does so by just retouching through the document and then checking against the spa contract on the interior and basically that's duties right one for issues days and one for revoke status anyone can do that right so in the data it looks like that okay so there were we prescribe a first few seamen because you think even what certificate data looks like right so we say hey goes oh well there must fit into this schema and it goes there and then basically we use a couple three - actually - on the issuance of you know top tens of thousands of certificates at one go yeah we managed to do like tens of thousand and a couple minutes no problem there right and the only information stuff is actually just a maca root 64 character hash okay so there's no information linked to oxides right and basically the point claim this is how our product look like and we may be told off something you are ready for market let's watch this decision so there were a few key assumptions right share that point line right we assume that we do what goes into a certificate that's I true right later we found that certificates are not access education credentials right and different people think of different dates when you talk about education credentials right and schools are definitely not finding the default you get one can go go they wanted to look like the way they do and then they want it structured to tables in very real quick my semester said that wasn't quite what our data structure supports right so there comes open solution one where they fall they fall a consulting so this is really good like a lot of schools got together informally and then say hey we are gonna form a consortium and you are going to give us a product and say okay sure why not right and that point in time um the challenge is this how do we go about analyzing data but again allow customization among a different school how much how much data goes into the documents are do I add just the name do I have the ice packs in there do I have a whole year in there I there are all sort of things how do you customize the looks of it this is the first time the visual thing came about and how can we ensure both issuances based upon the identity of the issuer to a real island right it is we work with students right to this point basically we had the same where we have that like this is just and we paste it allows schools to do like a complement to our repository to change this they stop and then they still use it to the toggle the different stops right and then from that we introduce the user control data privacy which is so long I show you we can be much of a signal line all these values without affecting the integrity of the sense right and also we allow for additional data such as like signatures such as like images and also updates to go within the data file so that people can customize it right and we don't prescribe we have a more flexible their schema in general right and basically how we do with identity it's really supported at point time right basically we have ha all right it's called registry not Jason and it's big results to this the pseudonym in this mechanism the student in this step ISM and this student at the Louisa issue a warning man down here that I could not be awkward that no figure out myself and that is their sixth you know they to correct the address figure right and it wasn't a negate all right and display them that were few assumptions resume right that's you know what this school is pretty good has one of two templates and you can put that all in one place yeah and it's really easy to say who can issue such a document and who couldn't write Oh later we figure even at a table that you couldn't do that because um how private training providers those are really tricky tricky spaces right so that comes up I should do what we look into decentralization in general all right at this point in time the media is not the schools are all higher optimistic like hey watch this and then they put to the newspaper all right just like all the object projects all right and this is really scary so in love with Holly let me see oh my god like this the school what this is small Scoob and me so what school decided to put you know ten different times of salad this is just from what school so how do parents I don't even know how to do this we spend a lot of time reading this and basically a lot of this or we can't questions like a pile it seriously enough some of you yeah sure the White House and people says I needed stochastic one right so if you install custom from hand signals going to get customs ones yeah sure and then when we recommendations this reaches different standards around technical abilities and then this is like oh this is distracting additional could I approve stupidest Rufus and this is the best right can you improve my career is because my users doing your energy tomorrow yes sure all right so as my that skinny between a big issue for us so the next question that what the tackle was how can we scale it all just sing about to experience a few school how can we not manage those who request I don't want to see any one of those requests right and basically which is what the temper changes with our church right how do you just specify how you like to do your stylingg blog coming to the although I'd say hey you review all good right we don't want to do that and also automatically verify identities of issuers who are in the registry because this onei as much people rejected to 1x distributed up without work like hey everyone get it right because you really need to be really need to verify each of them and it's a lot of work in there right so the country central blog extract green which is one of the two key components on our version 2 which is to use tracing effects right to then render a document from another site that is not from all sides right basically within the certificate in there once for the song it specified the render me the view of it from a specific URL conforming to a certain rendering specifications and it basically outside this to just go over to that site whoahhh a blank page in the iframe and they still passed it up through post message into that room and had a framerate lot of visuals right basically this is how it look like in the data we have a template remember additional uses a template key right now he has the URL is a admitted mcdermott I basically it disrupts the browser to go to the year I'll throw in the 10 throwing the entire check so I should be able to result right if it's following the standard so this is how it looks like right so this is example the document that you saw Justin and Missy in religious I trade minute because the specific sauce that was or a demo record ovens in style and passing the entices became object data and that part is then responsible for rendering out of you so this way we will not have any more progressed on your visuals because that is the basic concept arcs right and the next question said now we have developed a vetoes how then do we do identity so far as we were taking like hey we are already using such mechanism is called DNS right can we then use DNS to then prove the identity of the issue so there was pretty simple is just like the title to you you have a protocol and and say that I'm monitoring maintenance that one and your spots on track address that I'm issuing from instead address and basically you just have to match the one within the document and your side you see and they speak with that you can really just forget about the list the wrong place of like people that you know and then basically just have this thing like we should buy a psycho domain right all bridges anything ends up so the moment we roll out this we realized that there were schools around the globe what kind of watching us in fact there was one school that after we launched it it kind of made it and they posted news up today then it was and then we laid upon the it was that hey they are and it was really nice for us at a playing time million that hit people I views again without telling us who disappeared right so it's fine I will just show you what six so the technology underpinning offensive sexual and the taxation which is the document format and hydrology high rendering the identity document structuring and all those things so we are open sourcing that food skills right now working on the document Asians the sauce is all open it's just conditions a little all women plates attract tiny things out there open sensitive is fully open software documentation race and the Arkham project at the Singapore government is also working on Star Trek trust and we are basically bringing this technology into the tree ecosystems and basically is just working on three documents and I thought that we are also looking into how we can't organize deeds in general so in the tree in the tree sector there's this thing called the Bill of Lading basically represents my ownership of cards right and basically I became to how to organize that thing and make it recognize her international level so for that projects but we are also working we are working with our international bodies like the US Secret in fact we were the one who host on us in fact of weeks ago in China right so if you're interested in any of this kind of project in terms of documents notarized or documents or either disease system for you to talk to us right and basically that's all for us and it's this is this documentation can have a go at the demo on the slide toggle ahead is URL article quick so we are we are free to explore use cases and if you have suggestions or feedback please go ahead and contact me alright thank you for questions so if anyone has questions please go ahead and pen solution - shut up - five six right now yeah but then again be kids so help -  it anything good over tax just use whatever this missile force [Music] right is this the case then of your right around zone I had no money or sold anything right thank you [Applause] you
