[Applause] thank you very much hi so there's a little formality first as a member a good standing of the order of after-dinner and conference speakers of England and Wales I am required as the last speaker before lunch to make a joke about being the last speaker before lunch this is that joke thank you so I work for Electronic Frontier Foundation and I've met some of you in the halls here and when I mentioned I work with the FF they say oh you guys have been around for a long time and it's true like not just internet time not like this is Z Cash's second birthday so we're the doddering old men of cryptocurrency a long time like we've been around for a quarter century a legitimate long time and I want to talk about our origin story about the the key victories that we scored really early on a quarter century ago that really are the reason you guys and you folks are in this room today I want to talk about the crypto Wars not those crypto Wars these crypto Wars so back in the late 90s the NSA classed cryptography as ammunition and imposed strict limits on civilian access to strong crypto and there were people as you heard Primavera speak about who called themselves cypher punks crypto anarchists who said that this was bad policy it was a governmental overreach and it needed to be changed and they tried a whole bunch of different tactics to try and convince the government that this policy was not good policy so they talked about how it was ineffective right they said you can ban civilian access to strong cryptography and only allow access to to weak crypto the the 50 bit version of DES and that will not be sufficient to protect people they they made this as a technical argument they said like look we believe that you could brute force des with consumer equipment and the court said well who are gonna believe you or the NSA because the NSA they hire all the PhD mathematicians that graduate from the Big Ten schools and they tell us that Dez 50 is good enough for anyone so why should we believe you and so we did this we built this thing called the DES cracker it's a quarter million dollar specialized piece of equipment that could crack the entire key space of des in two hours right so we said like look here's your technical proof we can blow through the security that you're proposing to lock down the entire US financial political legal and personal systems with for a quarter million dollars and they said well maybe that's true but we can't afford to have the criminals go dark right they're gonna hide behind crypto and they won't be able to we won't be able to spy on them so in the face of all those of all that resistance we finally came up with a winning argument we went to court on behalf of a guy named Daniel J Bernstein you probably heard a DJ bee he's a cryptographer he's cryptographer his name is all over all the ciphers you use now but back then DJ bee was a grad student at the University of California Berkeley and he had written cipher that was stronger than des 50 and he was posting it to use Matt and we went to the ninth circuit and we said we believe that the First Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees the right to free speech protects DJ B's right to publish source code that code is a form of expressive speech as we understand under expressive speech in the u.s. constitutional framework and this worked right making technical arguments didn't work making economic arguments didn't work making law-enforcement arguments didn't work recourse of the Constitution worked we won in the Ninth Circuit we wanted the Appellate Division and the reason you folks can do ciphers that are stronger than DES 50 which these days you can break with a Raspberry Pi the reason you can do that is because we won this case thank so I'm not saying that to suck up to you right I'm saying that because it's an important note in terms of tactical diversity and trying to achieve strategic goals right it turns out that making recourse to the Constitution is a really important tactical arrow to have in your quiver and it's not that the Constitution is perfect and it's certainly not true that the u.s. always up holds the Constitution right all countries fall short of their goals the goals that the US fall short of are better than the goals that many other countries fall short of the u.s. still fall short of those goals and the Constitution is not perfect and and you folks you might be more comfortable thinking about deploying math and code as your tactic but I want to talk to you about the full suite of tactics that we use to affect change in the world and this is a framework that we owe to this guy Lawrence Lessig Larry is the founder of Creative Commons and has done a lot of other important stuff with cyber law and now works on corruption that's a connection I'm going to come back to and and Larry says that there are four forces that regulate our world for tactical avenues we can pursue there's a code that's what's technically possible right making things like deep crack there's markets what's profitable right founding businesses that create stakeholders for strong security turned out to be a really important piece to continuing to advance the crypto agenda because there were people who would show up and argue for more access to crypto not because they believed in the US Constitution but because their shareholders demanded that they do that as part of their ongoing funding right there's norms what's socially acceptable moving from the discussion of crypto as a thing that exists in the realm of math and policy and to a thing that is part of what makes people good people in the world to convince them that for example allowing sensitive communications to go in the clear is is a risk that you put not just on yourself but on the counterparties to your communication I mean I think we will eventually arrive at a place we're sending sensitive data and the clear will be the kind of technical equivalent of inviting people to a party where you close the door and chains right it's your selfish laziness putting them at risk and then there's law what's legal now the rule of law is absolutely essential to the creation and maintenance of good cipher systems because there is no key length there is no cipher system that puts you beyond the reach of law right you can't audit every motherboard and every server in the cloud that you rely on for a little backdoor chip the size of a grain of rice that's tapped right into the motherboard control system you can't make all your friends adopt good operational security this is a bit of the rules used by the deep packet inspection system deployed by the NSA this was published in German newspaper by after it was leaked to them the deep packet inspection rules that the NSA was using to decide who would get long term retention of their communications and who wouldn't they involved looking for people who had ever searched for how to install tor or tails or cubes so if you would ever figured out how to keep a secret the NSA then started storing everything you ever sent in case you ever communicated with someone who wasn't using crypto and through that conveyed some of the things that was happening inside your black box conversations right you can't make everybody you will ever communicate with use good crypto and so if the state is willing to exercise illegitimate Authority you will eventually be found out by them you can't audit the ciphers that that every piece of your tool chain uses including pieces that you don't control that are out of your hands and in the hands of third parties one of the things we learned from the Snowden leaks was that the NSA had sabotage the random number generator in a nist standard in order to weaken it so that they could backdoor it and read it and so long as the rule of law is not being obeyed so long as you have spy agencies that are unaccountable running around sabotaging crypto standards that we have every reason to believe otherwise are solid and sound you can never achieve real security this turns out to be part of a much larger thing called Bullrun in the US and edgehill in the UK that the NSA and mi5 were jointly doing to sabotage the entire crypto tool chain from hardware to software to standards to random number generators OPSEC is not going to save you because security favors attackers if you want to be secure from a state you have to be perfect you don't just have to be perfect when you're writing code and checking it in you have to be perfect all the time you have to never make a single mistake not when you're at a conference that you've traveled across the ocean to and you're horribly jet-lagged not when your baby is woken you up at 3:00 in the morning not when you're a little bit drunk you have to make zero mistakes in order for the state to penetrate your operational security they have to find one mistake that you've made and they get to cycle a new shift in every eight hours to watch you they get to have someone spell off the person who's starting to get screen burnin on their eyes and has to invert the screen because they can no longer focus on the letters they just send someone else to sit down at that console and watch you so your operational security is not going to save you over time the probability that you will make a mistake approaches one so crypto is not a tool that you can use to build a parallel world of code that immunizes you from an illegitimate powerful state superior technology does not make inferior laws irrelevant but technology and in particular privacy and cryptographic technology they're not useless just because you're off SEC won't protect you forever doesn't mean that it won't protect you for just long enough crypto and privacy tools they can open a space in which for a limited time before you make that first mistake you can be sheltered from that all-seeing eye and in that space you can have discussions that you're not ready to have in public yet not just discussions where you reveal that your employer has been spying on everyone in the world but all of the discussions that have brought us to where we are today you know it's remarkable to think that within our lifetimes within living memory it was illegal in much of the world to be gay and now most of those territories gay people can get me it was illegal to smoke marijuana and now in the country I'm from Canada marijuana is legal right in every province of the country right it was illegal to practice so-called interracial marriage right there are people who are the products of those marriages who were illegal so how in our lifetimes did we go from these regimes where these activities were prohibited to ones in which they are embraced and considered normal well it was because people who had a secret that they weren't ready to talk about in public yet could have a space that was semi public where they could choose their allies they could find people who they thought they could trust with a secret and they could whisper the true nature of their hearts to them and they could recruit them into an ever-growing alliance of people who would stand up for them and their principles they could whisper the love that dare not speak its name until they were ready to shout it from the hills and that's how we got here if we eliminate privacy and cryptography if we eliminate the ability to have these semi public conversations we won't arrive at a place in which social progress continues anyway we'll arrive at a place that we much like the hundreds of years that preceded the legalization of these activities that are now considered normal where people that you loved went to their graves with secrets in their hearts that they never confess to you great aches that you had unknowingly committed had contributed to because you never knew their true selves so we need good tech policy and we're not getting it in fact we're getting bad technic technology policy that's getting worse by the day so you may remember that in over the last two years we discovered that hospitals are computers that we put sick people into and when we take the computers out of the hospitals they cease to be places where you can treat sick people and that's because of an epidemic of ransomware there's been a lot of focus on the bad IT policies of the hospitals and the hospitals had some bad IT policies you shouldn't be running Windows XP there's no excuse for it and so on but ransomware had been around for a long time and it hadn't taken down hospitals all over the world right the way that ransomware ended up taking down hospitals all over the world if somebody took some off-the-shelf ransomware and married it to a thing called deep blue that or eternal blue rather an eternal blue was an NSA exploit they had discovered a vulnerability in Windows XP and rather than taking it to Microsoft and saying you guys had better patch this because it's a really bad zero-day they had just kept it secret in their back pocket against the day that they had an adversary they wanted to use it against except before that could happen someone leaked their cyber weapon and then Dum Dums took the cyber weapon and married it to this old piece of ransomware and started to steal hospitals now why do I call these people dum-dums because the ransom they were asking for was $300 right they didn't even know that they had stolen hospitals they were just opportunistically stealing anything that was connected to an XP box and then asking for $300 in crypto currency in order to unlock it right so this is not good technology policy the NSA believes in a doctrine called no bus no one but us is smart enough to discover this exploit now first of all we know that's not true we know that the NSA from the crypto Wars we know that the NSA does not have a monopoly on smart mathematicians right these were the people who said does 50 were strong enough for anyone they were wrong about that they're wrong about this but even if you believe that the NSA would never that the exploits they discover would never be independently rediscovered it's pretty obvious that that doesn't mean that they won't be leaked and once they're leaked you can never get that toothpaste back in the tube now since the the Enlightenment for 500 years now we've understood what good knowledge creation and technology policy looks like so let me give you a little history lesson before the Enlightenment we had a thing that looked a lot like science through which we did knowledge creation it was called alchemy and what alchemists did is a lot like scientists you observe two phenomenon in the universe you hypothesize a causal relationship this is making that happen you design an experiment to test your causal relationship you write down what you think you've learned and here's where science and alchemy part ways because alchemists don't tell people what they think they've learned and so they are able to kid themselves that the reason that there is results seem a little off is because maybe they made a little mistake when they were writing them down and not because their hypothesis was wrong which is how every Alchemist discovers for himself the hardest way possible that you should not drink mercury right so for five hundred years alchemy produces no dividends and then alchemists do something that is legitimately miraculous they convert the base metal of superstition into the precious metal of knowledge by publishing by telling other people what they think they've known what they know not just their friends will go easy on them but their enemies right who if they can't find a single mistake in their work they know that their work is good and so as a first principle whenever you're doing something important everyone should be able to criticize it otherwise you never know that it works so you would hope that that's how we would operate in the information security realm but that's not how we're operating in 1998 Congress passed this law of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act they then went to the European Union in 2001 and arm twisted them into passing the European Union copyright directive and both of these laws have a rule in them that says that you're not allowed to break digital rights management you're not allowed to bypass a system that restricts access to a copyrighted work and in the early days this was primarily used to stop people from making region-free DVD players right but now everything's got a copyrighted work in it because everything's got a system in a chip in it that cost 22 cents and has 50,000 lines of code including the entire Linux Linux kernel and usually an instance of busy box running with the default root password of admin and bin right and because that's a copyrighted work anyone who manufactures a device where they could make more money if they could prescribe how you use that device can just add a one molecule thick layer of DRM in front of that copyrighted work and then because in order to reconfigure the device you have to remove the DRM they can make removing DRM and thus using your own property in ways that benefit you into a felony punishable by a five year prison sentence and a five hundred thousand dollar fine and so there's this enormous temptation to add DRM to everything we're seeing it everything pacemakers voting machines car engine parts tractors implanted defibrillators hearing aids there's a new continuous loop or closed loop artificial pancreas from Johnson & Johnson it's a continuous glucose monitor married to an insulin pump with some machine learning intelligence to figure out what dose you need from moment to moment and it uses proprietary insulin cartridges that have a layer of drm in them to make sure that to stay alive your you only feed your internal organ the material that the manufacturers approved so that they can charge you an extreme markup so that's bad that's the reason we're seeing DRM everywhere but the effect of that is on sick is what it does to security research because under this rule merely disclosing defects in security that might help people bypass DRM also exposes you to legal jeopardy right so this is where it starts to get scary because as microcontrollers are permeating everything we use as hospitals are turning into computers we put sick people into we are making it harder for critics of those devices to explain the dumb mistakes of the people who made them have made we're all drinking mercury and this is going everywhere particularly it's going into your browser so several years ago the w3c was approached by Netflix and a few the other big entertainment companies to add DRM to html5 because it was no longer technically simple to put DRM in browsers because the way they were changing the api's and the w3c said that they would do it and there's it's a long complicated story why they went into it but I personally an EF F we had a lot of very spirited discussions with the w3c leadership over this and we warned them that we thought that the companies that wanted to add DRM to their browsers didn't want to just protect their copyright we thought that they would use this to stop people from disclosing defects in browsers because they wanted to be able to not just control their copyright but ensure that there wasn't a way to get around this copyright control system and they said oh no never these companies are good actors we know them they pay their membership dues they would never abuse this process come after security researchers who are making good-faith honest responsible disclosures whatever you add your adjective for a disclosure that's made in a way that doesn't make you sad right there are all these different ways of talking about security disclosures and we said all right let's find out let's make membership in the w3c and participation in this DRM community committee contingent on promising only to use the DMCA to attack people who infringe copyright and never to attack people who make security disclosures and the entire cryptocurrency community who were an blockchain community who are in the w3c working groups they backed us on this in fact it was the most controversial standards vote in w3c history's the only one that ever went to a votes the only one that was ever appealed it was the only one that was ever published without unanimous support was published with 58% support and not one of the major browser vendors not one of the big entertainment companies signed on to a promise not to sue security researchers who revealed defects and browsers so let's talk a little about security economics and browsers so security obviously it's not a binary it's a continuum we want to be secure from some attack you heard someone talk about threat modeling earlier so like you got a bank vault you know that given enough time and a plasma torch your adversary can cut through that bank vault but you don't worry about that because your bank vault is not meant to secure your money forever it's meant to secure your money until a security guard walks by on their patrol and calls the police right your bank vault is integrated with the rule of law it is a technical countermeasure that is backstopped by the rule of law and without the rule of law your bank vault will eventually be cut open by someone with a plasma cutter so security economics means factoring in the expected return on a breach into the design of the system right if you have a system that's protecting 500 dollars in assets you want to make sure that it will cost at least five hundred and one dollars to defeat it and you assume that you have a rational actor on the other side who's not going to come out of your breach one dollar in the hole right you assume that they're not going to be dumb dumbs so the this there's a that this frequently goes wrong a way that you get contact shifts that change these security economics calculus and that's when the value of the thing that you're protecting suddenly goes up a lot and the security measures that you're using to protect it don't and all of a sudden your $500 security measure or five and $1 security measure isn't protecting five hundred dollars worth of stuff it turns out that it's protecting five million dollars worth of stuff and the next thing you know there's some dude with a plasma cutter hanging around your vault so this challenge is especially keen in the realm of information security because information security is tied to computers and computers are everywhere and because computers are becoming whoops because computers are becoming integrated into every facet of our life faster than we can even keep track of it every day there's a new value that can be realized by an attacker who finds a defect in computers that can be widely exploited and so every day the cost that you should be spending to secure your computers is going up and we're not keeping up in fact computers on average are becoming less secure because the value that you get when you attack computers is becoming higher and so the the expected adversary behavior is getting better resourced and more dedicated so this is where cryptocurrency does in fact start to come into the story it used to be that if you found a defect in widely used consumer computing hardware you could expect to realize a few hundred or a best a few thousand dollars but in a world where intrinsically hard to secure computers are being asked to protect exponentially growing cryptocurrency pools well you know how that works right you've seen crypto jacking attacks you've seen all the exchanges go down you understand what happens when the value of the asset being protected shoots up very suddenly it becomes extremely hard to protect so you would expect that in that world where everything we do is being protected by computers that are intrinsically hard to protect and where we need to keep adding more resource to protect them that states would take as their watchword making crypto as easy to implement as possible making security as easy as possible to achieve but the reverse is happening instead what's happening is states are starting to insist that we're gonna have to sacrifice some of our security to achieve other policy goals so this guy used to be Prime Minister of Australia he's not anymore wait six months the current Prime Minister of Australia will also not be Prime Minister of Australia anymore this guy Malcolm Malcolm Turnbull yeah sorry did I just get his name wrong I just blew up his name what is his name God he went so quickly Malcolm Turnbull it is Malcolm turbos right there on the slide I almost called him Malcolm Gladwell so he he gave this speech where he was explaining why he was going to make it the law that everybody had to backdoor their crypto for him and you know all these cryptographers had shown up and they said well though the the laws of math say that we can't do that we can't make you a thing that's secure enough to protect the government and its secrets but insecure enough that the government can break into it and he said and I'm not going to do the accent he said the laws of Australia prevail in Australia I can assure you of that the laws of mathematics are very commendable but the only law that applies in Australia is read it with me the law of Australia I mean this may be the stupidest technology thing ever said in the history of really dumb technology utterances but he almost got there and he's not alone right the FBI has joined him in this call you know Canada's joined us join them in this call like if you ever needed proof that that merely having good pecks and good hair doesn't qualify you to have good technology policy the government of Justin Trudeau and its technology policy has demonstrated this forever right this is an equal opportunity madness that every developed state in the world is at least dabbling in and we have ended up not just in a world where fighting crime means eliminating good security I mean it's dumber than that right we've ended up in a world where making sure people watch TV the right way means sacrificing on security now the European Union they just actually had a chance to fix this because that copyright directive that the u.s. forced them to pass in 2001 that has this stupid rule in it that they borrowed from the DMCA it just came up for its first major revision in 17 years the new copyright directive is currently nearly finalized it's in its very last stage and rather than fixing this glaring problem with security in the 21st century what they did was they added this thing called article 13 so article 13 is a rule that says if you operate a platform where people can convey a copyrighted work to the public so like if you have a code repository or if you have Twitter or if you have YouTube or if you have SoundCloud or if you have any other way that people can make a copyrighted work available if you host minecraft skins you are required to operate a crowd sourced database of all the copyrighted works that people care to add to it and claim so anyone can upload anything to it and say this copyright belongs to me and if a user tries to post something that appears in the database you are obliged by law to censor it and there are no penalties for adding things to the database that don't belong to you you don't even have to affirmatively identify yourself and the companies are not allowed to strike you off from that database of allegedly copyrighted works even if they repeatedly catch you chopping the database with garbage that doesn't belong to you the works of William Shakespeare all of Wikipedia the source code for some key piece of blockchain infrastructure which now can't be posted to a wordpress blog and discussed until someone at automatic takes their tweezers and goes through the database and pulls out these garbage entries whereupon a bot can re insert them into the database one nanosecond later so this is what they did instead of fixing anti-circumvention rules to make the internet safe for security so I mentioned this is in its very last phase of discussion and it looked like it was a fix and then the Italian government changed over and they flipped positions and were actually maybe going to get to kill this but only if you help if you're a European please go to save your internet dot EU and send a letter to your MEP s this is really important because this won't be fixed for another 17 years if this passes save your internet dot EU so when we ask ourselves why are government's so incapable making good technology policy the standard account says it's just too complicated for them to understand right how could we expect these old decrepit irrelevant white dudes to ever figure out how the internet works right if it's to technological you're too old right but sorting out complicated technical questions that's what governments do I mean I work on the internet and so I think it's more complicated than other people's stuff but you know when I'm being really rigorously honest I have to admit that it's not more complicated than public health or sanitation or building roads and you know we don't build roads in a way that is as stupid as we have built the Internet and that's because the Internet is much more hotly contested because every realm of Endeavour intersects with the Internet and so there are lots of powerful interests engaged in trying to tilt Internet policy to their advantage right the TV executives and media executives who push for article 13 you know they're not doing it because they're mustache twirling villains they're just doing it because they want to line their pockets and they don't care what cost that imposes on the rest of us bad policy bad tech policy it's not bad because making good policy is hard it's bad because making bad policy has a business model now tech did not cause the corruption that distorts our policy outcomes but it is being supercharged by the same phenomenon that is distorting our policy outcomes and that's what happened with Ronald Reagan Margret Thatcher and their cohort who came to power the same year the Apple 2 plus shipped and among the first things they did in office was dismantle our antitrust protections and allowed companies to do all kinds of things that would have been radioactively illegal in the decades previous like buying all their competitors like engaging in illegal tying like using long term contracts and their supply chain to force their competitors out like doing any one of a host of things that might have landed them in front of an antitrust regulator and broken up into smaller pieces the way AT&T had been and as that happened we ended up in a period in which inequality mounted and mounted and mounted and 40 years later we've never lived in a more unequal world we have surpassed the state of inequality of 18th century France which for many years was the gold standard for just how unequal a society can get before people start chopping off other people's heads and unequal states are not well regulated ones unequal states are states in which the peccadilloes cherish delusions and personal priorities of a small number of rich people who are no smarter than us start to take on out size policy dimensions where the preferences and whims of a few plutocrats become law so in a plutocracy policy only gets to be evidence-based when it doesn't piss off a rich person and we cannot afford distorted technology policy we are at a breaking point our security and our privacy and our centralization debt is approaching rupture we are about to default on all of those debts and we won't look like we won't like what the bankruptcy looks like when that arrives which brings me back to cryptocurrency and the bubble that's going on around us the the bubbles they're not fueled by people who have an ethical interest in decentralization or who worry about overreaching state power those bubbles right all the frothy money that's in there not the coders who are writing it or the or the principal people who think about it but all the money that's just sloshing through it and and making your tokens so volatile that the security economics are impossible that money is being driven by looters who are firmly entrenched in authoritarian States the same authoritarian States that people are interested in decentralization say we want to get rid of they're the ones who are buying cyberweapons to help them spy on their own populations to figure out who is fomenting revolution so they can round them up and torture them and arrest them so that they can be left to loot their national Treasuries in peace and spin the money out through financial secrecy havens like the ones that we learned about in the Panama papers and the Paradise Papers and abetting the oligarchic accumulation of wealth that is not going to create the kinds of states that produce the sound policy that we need to make our browsers secure it will produce states whose policy is a funhouse mirror reflection of the worst ideas of the sociopaths who have looted their national wealth and install themselves as modern feudal lords your cryptography will not save you from those states they will have the power of coercive force and the unblinking eye of 24/7 surveillance contractors the internet the universal network where universal computing endpoints can send and receive cryptographically secure messages is not a tool that will save us from coercive States but it is a tool that will give us a temporary shelter within them a space that even the most totalitarian of regimes will not be able to immediately penetrate where reformers and revolutionaries can organize mobilize and fight back where we can demand free fair and open societies with broadly shared prosperity across enough hands that we can arrive at consensus that reflect best evidence and not the whims of a few where power is decentralized and incidentally having good responsive States will not just produce good policy when it comes to crypto all of our policy failures can be attributed to a small moneyed group of people who wield outsize power to make their bottom line more important than our shared prosperity whether that's the people who've spent years expensively sowing doubt about whether or not cigarettes would give us cancer or the people who today are assuring us that the existential threat that the human species is facing is a conspiracy among climate scientists who are only in it for the money so you're here because you code and you may not be interested in politics but politics is interested in you the rule of law needs to be your Alpha and Omega because after all all the Constitution is is a form of consensus right it's it's it's the original consensus seeking mechanism using the rule of law to defend your technology it's the most internet thing in the world let's go back to Bernstein when we went to Bernstein and argued this case we essentially went on an internet message board and made better arguments than the other people and we convinced the people who were listening that our arguments were right this is how you folks resolve all of your problems right proof of concept running code good arguments and you win the rule you win the battle of the day so making change with words that's what everybody does whether we're writing code or writing law and I'm not saying you guys need to stop writing code but you really need to apply yourself to the legal dimension - thank you [Applause] thank you so we're gonna ask some questions now I like to call alternately on people identify as women or non-binary and people identify as male or non-binary and we can wait a moment if if there's a woman or non-binary person who wants to come forward first there's some there's a mic down there and then there's a rover with a mic just stick up your hand there any hands up there's someone have their hand up is that what that person was shouting inaudibly from the back No all right are there any people identify as men or non-binary you'd like to ask the first question there's someone there if there's a runner with a mic maybe or if you want to come down to this microphone someone's coming now as someone who spent a lot of time involved the Internet I'm sure you've read the book the sovereign individual and I recently read this book and it talked a lot about how the Internet will increase the sovereignty of individuals and also how cryptocurrencies will and it predicted a massive increase in inequality as a direct resolve the internet could you comment on that yeah I've read the book so I'm not gonna comment directly on the book but I think it's true that if you view yourself as separate from the destinies of the people around you that it will produce inequality I I think that that's like empirically wrong right like if there's one thing we've learned about the limits of individual sovereignty it's that you know you have a shared microbial destiny you know I speak as a person who left London in the midst of a measles epidemic and landed in California right after they stamped it out by telling people that you had to vaccinate your kids or they couldn't come to school anymore we do have shared destinies we don't have individual sovereignty and even if you are the greatest and you know anyone who's ever run a business knows this right you could have a coder who's a hundred X coder produces a hundred times more lines of code than everybody else in the business but if that coder can't maintain the product on their own and if they're a colossal  that no one else can work with then that coder is on as a liability not an asset right because you need to be able to work with more than one person in order to attain superhuman objectives which is to say more than one person can do and everything interesting is super human right the limits on what an individual can do are pretty strong and so yeah I'm I think that that's true I think that that the kind of policy bent towards selfishness kind of self-evidently produces more selfish outcomes but not better ones right not not ones that are not ones that reflect kind of a shared shared prosperity and growth thank you hi hi I have had the pleasure of seeing you keynote both decentralized web summits and the ideas you bring to these talks always really stay with me longer than anything else with with what you've talked about here this is honestly one of the most intimidating and terrifying topics and I'm wondering what what are some ways besides staying informed and trying not to get burned out by it all what are some ways that people can make a difference so I recently moved back from London to California as I mentioned and one of the things that that means is I have to drive now and I'm a really shitty driver and in particular I'm a really shitty Parker and so when I have to park I do a lot of this and then a lot of this and then a lot of this and then a lot of this and what I'm doing is I'm like moving as far as I can to gain one inch of available space and then or centimeter and then moving into that centimeter available space because that opens up a new space that I can move into and then I'd open and then I move as far as I can and I open up a new space we do this in computing all the time right we call it hill climbing we don't know how to get from A to Z but we do know how to get from A to B right we can we know where the higher point of whatever it is we're seeking is stability or or you know density or interestingness or whatever and so we move one step towards the objective and from there we get a new vantage point and it exposes new avenues of freedom that we can take I don't know how we get from A to Z I don't know how we get to a better world and I actually believe that because the first casualty of every battle is the plan of attack that by the time we figured out the terrain that it would have been obliterated by the adversaries who don't want us to go there and so instead I I think we need heuristics and that heuristic is to see where your freedom of motion is at any moment and take it now Larry Lessig he's got this framework the four forces code law norms and markets my guess is that most the people in this room are doing a lot with norms and Mar and markets right that's kind of where this this conference sits in that little 2x2 and as a result you may be blind to some of the code and some of the law and norm issues that are available to you right that that it might be that jumping on EF FS mailing list or your European getting on the ED remodeling list or if the mailing list for the individual digital rights groups in your own countries like that's politique in Germany or the quadrature du net in France or open rights group in the UK or bits of freedom in the Netherlands and so on getting on those lists and at the right moment calling your MEP calling your MP or even better yet like actually going down when they're when they're holding surgeries when they're holding constituency meetings they don't hear from a lot of people who are technologically clued in right like they only get the other side of this and you know I've been in a lot of these policy forums and often times the way that the other side prevails is just by making it up right like one of the things we saw in this filter debate like we had computer scientists who were telling MEP s you know the 70 most eminent computer scientists in the world right that a bunch of Turing Prize winners Vint Cerf and Tim berners-lee who said like these filters don't exist and we don't know how to make them and they were like oh we've got these other experts who say we know how to do it and they they had been told for years that the only reason nerds hadn't built those filters as they weren't nerding hard enough right and if they actually hear from their own constituents people who run small businesses that are part of this big frothy industry that everybody wants their national economies to participate in who show up at their lawmakers offices and say this really is catastrophic it's catastrophic to my business it's catastrophic to the internet they listen to that right it makes it moves the needle and and you know you heard earlier someone say are we at peak pit are we at pitch now well I should pitch right I work for Electronic Frontier Foundation we're a non-profit the majority of our money comes from individual donors it's why we can pursue issues that are not necessarily on the radar of the big foundations or big corporate donors we're not beholden to anyone and it's people like you right who keep us in business and you know I don't draw money from e FF I'm an MIT Media Lab research affiliate and they give EF f a grant that pays for my work so the money you give t FF doesn't land in my pocket but I've been involved with them now for 15 years I've never seen an organization squeeze $1 more so I really think it's worth your while EFS org thank you Oh someone over here yes hi that mic is off oh there you go thank you very much really appreciate this speech it was very inspiring thank you um I think maybe not sure how many other people feel this way but one thing that's been hard to me about politics in general especially in the age of social media is you know there's a lot of it it spreads messages of fear and anger and hatred and sometimes it feels like when you want to say something and you want to spread a certain voice or just sprayed a certain message that there's this fear of getting swept up in all these messages and and ideas and things that aren't necessarily you're not necessarily aware of your own biases and things like that how does one stay and say stay sane and fight for you know the right fight I you know I wish I knew I like I I'll freely admit to you I've had more sleepless nights in the last two years than in all the years before it I mean even during the the movement and nuclear proliferation that it was a big part of in the 80s when I thought we were all gonna die in a mushroom cloud I wasn't as worried as I am now it's tough I mean for me like just in terms of like personal psychological OPSEC I've turned off everything that non-consensual shoves Donald Trump headlines into my eyeballs you know that we talk a lot about how like engagement metrics distort the way applications are designed but you know I really came to understand that that was happening about a year and a half ago so for example they changed the default Android search bar so that when you tapped in it showed you trending searches well like nobody has ever gone to a search engine to find out what other people are searching for right and the trending searches were inevitably trump threatens nuclear Armageddon so the last thing I would do before walking my daughter to school every morning is I would go to the weather app and I would tap in it to see the weather and it's news and it's weather and headlines and the only headlines you can't turn off our top headlines and they're trending you know they're all from threatens nuclear Armageddon right so I realized after a month of this that what had been really the most calming grounding ten minutes of 15 minutes of my day where I would walk with my daughter to school we talked about stuff and it was really quite we live in a leafy Street I just spend that whole time worrying about dying right and so I had to figure out how to like go through and turn all that stuff off now what I do is I block out times to think about headlines so I go and I look at the news for a couple hours every day and I write about it I write Boing Boing right I write a blog about it not necessarily because my opinions are such great opinions but because being synthetic and thoughtful about it means that it's not just buffeting me right it's it's it's it's becomes a reflective rather than a reflexive exercise but I don't know right I mean I think that and I don't think it's just the tech I think we are living in a moment of great psychic trauma we are living in and you know the the reason the IPCC report was terrifying was not because of the shrill headlines the IPCC report was terrifying because it is objectively terrifying right and and so how do you make things that are I don't know how you make things that are objectively terrifying not terrifying I think the best we can hope for is to operate while we are terrified with as much calm and aplomb and thoughtfulness as is possible how are we for time do you want me off I know my clocks run out org can I take one more question stage manager one more what one more all right and then well then we'll ring us off yeah hi better be good though okay I'm ready I work for the Media Lab - so my question Cori thank you for your talk I think a lot of people in the cryptocurrency world think about the current systems that we exist in and we're trying to exit those systems to some extent and create parallel financial you know political institutions what-have-you versus expressing voice within the current system how do you balance exit versus voice in the current system well you know in a Technol in a and I said before that like a constitutional argument is just an internet flame war by another means right so when you're arguing about a commit and a pull request one of the things you do is you do proof of concept right you show that the thing that you're patching is real and can be exploited or you show that you're you run unit tests to show that your patch performs well those parallel exercises are useful as proof of concepts and as unit tests right they're prototypes that we can fold back into a wider world and I think that it the the thing I worry about is not that technologists will build technology I want technologists to build technology it's that they will think that the the job stops when you've built the proof-of-concept that's where the job starts right when you can prove that you've written a better algorithm you then have to convince the other stakeholders in the project that it's worth the actual like nonzero cost of patching to make that to make that work right of going through the whole source tree and finding all the dependencies on the things that you're pulling out and gracefully replacing them because you know when you run a big data center you can't just start patching stuff you've got a you've got a tool chain that you have to preserve right and so that's that's where the job starts right build your proof-of-concept build us a parallel financial system build us or whatever so that we can figure out how to integrate it into a much wider more pluralistic world not so that we can separate and cease dead on our little you know world over there as you know like it doesn't matter how great your ear thank you it doesn't matter how great your your your bunker is right like you can't shoot germs right like if your solution allows the rest of the world to fall into chaos and no one's taking care of the sanitation system you will still  to yourself to death of cholera in your bunker because like you can't shoot germs right so we need pluralistic solutions that work for all of us thank you thank you all right you you
