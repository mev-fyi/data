hello everybody so great that so many of you are joining already for the boring opening ceremony I hope I can make it less boring by telling you a bit about how this is all going to work in this online setup which we certainly didn't expect when we were planning for this conference and I will also introduce what do we hope to get out of the solidity summit as well as who's on the team and everything you need to know to survive the next two days with us so I think we are good to go that means I will share my screen with you now and we can get started so the first life hack for everybody who will present after me is that you click share your screen and then you click on your camera again so that you can see both the speaker as well as their sites all right hello everybody I'm super happy that you are all here my name is Francesca and I will be your host and moderator for the next two days except for the open discussion sessions where we will have expert moderators leading you through the sessions we're super happy to have you all here this is our very first solidity summit it was expected to be an in-person event in Berlin but due to the corona crisis which is happening right now obviously we are not hosting our in-person conference but we switched everything to be an online conference and yeah we hope that this will work out fine this is certainly neutral for us to be hosting an online conference but we are super happy to do this together with the interspace team and we hope that all of you will have a smooth experience in order to have such a smooth experience I already sent you some instructions but I will also walk you through how everything will work again so that everybody knows how to get the best out of this conference firstly welcome to everybody and why are we even hosting this event so obviously we want to get people involved and interested in the solidity language together and want them to be able to exchange about the topics that they are interested in we certainly want to exchange experiences and discuss language design including together because the developers of the solidity language certainly have some questions for you who are using this ability language on how the language design should be moving forward we hope that those discussions will actually then result in improvement proposals which will definitely impact the actual implementation of the solidity language and viewer and we don't only want to foster the communication between the solidity team so us and you guys but we also want to foster the communication between teams that are working on maybe the same or similar topics so that you are aware of each other and maybe you can collaborate moving forward and yeah ultimately also we want to obviously identify needs for the smart contract ecosystem for a theorem and derive steps forward together so yeah first of all meet the solidity team those are all the people who were officially working on the solidity language at the moment but obviously this is an unexhausted list we have so many open source contributors that are either contributing by reporting bags or by requesting features or by just joining the conversations with us so this is just the official team that I'm listing here and if there are some people from the official team in the in the jitsi room right now feel free to turn on your camera really briefly so that people can see you also there's the yeah hey guys also there's all of the github handles from the team there so in case you have questions you can just add them in the guitar channel and then you can discuss with them over there so now how to solidity summit this conference is as I already mentioned powered by interspace which is a new open source initiative to basically bring online conferencing to the blockchain space and maybe even beyond let's see they already produced some great events in the past for example the non con which was I think the first conference where interface was used and then also a virtual hackathon Easter inand I believe there will be much more events coming up in the future so what does this mean this conference is facilitated by a couple of Tours which I hope will make the collaboration and interaction between all of us during the conference smooth and easy and we'll almost feel as if we are all in the same room together it's powered by jitsi mostly jitsi is this open source conferencing too and video conferencing to which we are using right now so there's one main conference room this is a singer track event so everything will happen in this main room there's the lobby room which you can use to hangout for example in breaks if you want to try out let's see if you want to just chat casually with people who are hanging around you can also create your own breakout rooms so basically if you want to take a discussion further and it's not part of the agenda anymore you can create your own breakout room and then you can distribute the link of this breakout room to the people who are interested for example using the guitar Chet we are using YouTube for the live stream so if you are watching via the last room right now already you might know that we're using the theorem Foundation YouTube account and you can find the livestream link also on the interspace border we will be using the github chet solidity guitar chet for the Q&A sessions and for coordination so in case you have any question for speaker curing an open discussion session or whatever feel free to just put your question there and the moderators will relay the questions we have agendas in a Google sheet as well as also am a Googler Kalama so if you want to create your own groups if you want to create your own individual attend area you can do that by going to the Google Calendar entry and just copying the agenda points that you would like to see in the open discussion sessions we will you secondes to take collaborative notes and those hammies are also always listed in the agenda points if you're participating today or tomorrow or even both days of the event you are also able to claim a proof of attendance protocol token which will verify that you attended this event and for very ad hoc coordination in case all other technologies that I've just listed above failed us we also have a telegram group for emergency coordination in case this room breaks down or whatever needs to be coordinated I will be sure to put it in the telegram group as well as in the katana so that's basically that and you might ask yourself but where do I find all of those links crazy right so don't you worry just go to interface that's identity there summit it's room dark if you aren't there already and there you will really find everything you need in one place and as I was outlining before you for example find the collaborative notes in the description of the open discussion session if you click on agenda so how does this Duty thing work I've made a screenshot when I was doing a conference all on my own so if in case you open the jitsi room in another browser tip which I think it's the recommended option to do so if you are for example a speaker then this might look similar to you and this dress is very easy to use actually super straightforward there's a few features you can share your screen sharing your screen is on the left in the corner in on the bottom you can raise your hand which might be yeah excite surface resonance and for example you can do that in case you want to speak so that in an open discussion session or whatever moderator can see you want to say something you have the microphone settings in the middle where you can also choose which mic you would want to be using you can quit the meeting in the middle and you can also change your camera settings there and then on the right hand side on the bottom you have other settings you can change the view and you can click on the I to know which is the room you are else but you can also know that just by seeing your browser tab yeah and you can also set yourself a name and as I see almost everybody who's in the room already did so so basically by clicking on your video or by clicking on the settings settings you can give yourself a user name but the sounds are like everybody already did so yeah I wanted to mention that you can click on the Help button in the sidebar at the inner space and there's a description of the jitsi interface if you didn't catch everything that that Francey said absolutely exactly and then what's the recommended setup so jitsi has this maximum participants of 75 participants per room limit i don't think that we will reach this limit that to ensure a smooth experience for everybody in case you don't plan on actively being involved AKA speaking or discussing activity in a session i would always recommend you to go for the live stream because it also saves your cpu obviously you can switch between live stream and participating in the jutsu room directly depending on the session if you just want to listen in you go watch the live stream if you want to really actively participate you join the room so feel free to you know jump around and switch around between those two talk to us and get her for Q&A and yeah just the FYI the live stream by nature has a little delay so if you really actively want to discuss in such an open discussion session i would recommend you to join the dista meeting because otherwise you will be one minute late more or less to the discussion yes then how do you survive knowing nine hours online per day obviously you you don't need to participate in everything else like session but i would love you to do so because i think it's all really relevant and interesting content so yeah just a few quick reminders which you might already be aware of but i just wanted to let you know again please don't forget over all of the school conferencing to drink something depending on your time of the day coffee tea Clamato beer water whatever you prefer don't forget to eat also yeah don't forget to get up and stretch your legs sometimes and also have a screen break for your eyes so just watch out of the window or go watch your kids if they are playing around at home at the moment during corona and yeah you can also open the YouTube livestream on your phone so in case you need to go somewhere or just want to wander around a little bit that's also an option okay last but not least let's have a quick look at what is going to happen today together at the agenda so this Tuesday Jenna you might be familiar already with it we are currently here I'm doing the opening right after that Chris will present us the solidity 2020 roadmap after this we have a nice tour coming up from Beckett and Shang way about the K framework and K solidity after this we will look at a source level from a verification tool together with Akash then we will have a presentation on Satara then we will learn something about d-type and chainless which are two tools developed by Lord Anna then we will hear about some thoughts on language design and fragmentation from EDX and then in the afternoon we start with the open discussion sessions they always start in the afternoon because we want to give also the Americas a chance to participate in those so we will start with the first discussion on safe math by default moderated by Chris then we will have a break then we will have a discussion on libraries 2.0 moderated by Chris again then we will receive a nice introduction on your class from Nick Dotson and after that we will also have a discussion on new food features for you moderated by Alex then we will learn something about the soy compiler then there will be another open discussion on upgradeable contracts another short break another discussion on fixed point types then tracking mapping keys with the truffle debug by Harry and consecutively also traffic debugger demo and followed by a debugging data discussion you might notice that one talk is missing today unfortunately one of our speakers fell sick so we will not hear about curiosities and solidity development from NYX and that's why the fixed point types discussion has been moved up a little bit yeah and that's almost it from my site so long I hope you will have fun and enjoy the upcoming talks and discussions and please feel free to ping me with any feedback you might have i'm underscore Francie hi on Twitter and fancy high everywhere else so have fun and enjoy and with that without further ado I hand the mic over to Chris
