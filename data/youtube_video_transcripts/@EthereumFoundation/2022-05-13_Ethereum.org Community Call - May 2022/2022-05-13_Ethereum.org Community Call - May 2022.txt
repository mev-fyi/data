welcome everyone thanks for joining the me epidium.org community hall and quick summary of our agenda that we've got um we do have two community members who have never been on the call before so this is my warning to them that i'm going to be calling on them in a minute or so just to say hi um so jacob is going to run through the work he's been doing on his feedback ledger we've got joseph who's going to be speaking about migrating the ethereum wiki content onto vdm.org we have unveica from eaststaker here to chat about quadratic funding and the round that they'll be running uh luca will be chatting about some developments we've had in translations and sam's going to talk a little bit about our queue to roadmap as well as some other announcements and call-ups we'd like to meet um before that we have both niko and joseph who haven't been formally introduced on this call and so it'd be nice for you both just to say a quick hello uh because you want to start i think nico's having internet issues i don't see his name in the list ah no luck there okay um joseph i think i've seen him about uh yeah i'm here um hi uh so i'm joseph and uh i've been kind of hanging around the ethereum world since about 2018. my background is in environmental science and um sometime last year i kind of decided that i would be happier making ethereum my full-time full-time occupation and and now here i am so um thanks for having me awesome thank you joseph and i still don't see nico we're getting one of these days um on this call so i'll um stop sharing my screen for now so first up we've got jacob who's going to be sharing the work he's been doing on the feedback which yakub i'll pass it to you hello everybody my name is jacob i'm a product designer on ethereum.org [Music] i actually cannot share my screen could you give me permission sure i'm doing it just now wow you might have to leave and rejoin what after i do that but let's just quickly get that set up okay can share perfect so um [Music] ethereum.org is obviously a very big website with a large audience and [Music] this is a reason why we wanted to make sure that we capture ideas of everybody to sort of see whether the website actually helps and i'm trying to click on share it doesn't really work okay let me quickly rejoin if that helps then apologies everybody it's all right sorry but that looks like i've maybe made a little bit of a mess on the settings setting this up so apologies in advance nope still doesn't work oh good i see nico showed up nico are you there do you want to say hi and uh yucca maybe in the meantime try uh try giving that a reset yeah hello can you can you hear me in here yeah hello everyone nice to meet you i think this is the first time i can talk in the community because last time i was having issues with the audio so i will introduce myself quickly [Music] i'm nicholas i'm a web developer from argentina and i have joined the team in december so i'm still very new in the team nice to meet you thanks nico um jakub any luck on your end still not sorry folks about it um alternatively i can speak if you can share this does sharing work for you joshua i can send the link and if you give me a minute i'm going to dig around with the permissions um maybe someone else in the team could see if it's working for them quickly seems to be working for me okay in that case you can [Music] can just share this link that i will be posting in the chat right now this one i'm sharing right now free jakub okay perfect thank you karen so uh i apologize for that everybody so um as i was saying ethereum.org is a page that gets a lot of traction and that we have certain responsibility to make sure that the content and design we put out there is actually helping most people achieve their goals and we are always open to hearing any sort of feedback here on discord or in github or sometimes even through mail but the problem with that is that it requires a lot of motivation to actually go to discord and give us feedback so most of the people end up not telling us if the content we are presenting on the website actually gives them the relevant information they need in a manner that would suit them this quarter we decided to make sure that we can also ask these people directly on the website whether basically the website is helpful or not and the way we decided to do that is basically to introduce a small feedback widget which will be visible on every single page of ethereum.org i'm carving just showing you how it looks so it's like a little bubble at the bottom right corner and um with this you can basically tell us on each specific page whether that page was helping you understand some topics or getting some relevant information or not and we will monitor this to see if you know we are actually what we're putting out there makes sense to broader audience or whether we need to revisit the content or design and make some changes so that it's actually helpful so i welcome everybody to please give us that feedback because it's really important not only for each individual person but for the broader audience too so that we make sure that people are getting from the websites as much as possible and there is actually a second step to it you can see right now that um you can give us a quick quick feedback whether the page is helpful or not but then also you can click on uh give open share survey which will give us some additional insights into why for example the page wasn't helpful because knowing if the page is helpful or not is obviously the first step to understand if we are giving users what they want but then if we see that there is a room for improvement we also need to know like what can we do better so this would be very important for us to get as much as possible of this survey feedback also so that we can make exactly those changes that you would like to see in the website i hope that this will be much easier and straightforward more straightforward than like giving a github issue or commenting here on this skirt so this was our idea and we also have actually a figma prototype for this issue where we are discussing how the feedback widget should look because obviously our goal is to collect a lot of feedback to make sure that it's statistically significant and make sense but we also recognize that it could be for example a mobile phone a little bit intrusive if it's always visible etc so there is a balance between giving the option of giving feedback and for us to work with that and also making sure that this doesn't hinder the user experience of reading and browsing our website so there is also a specific channel dedicated to this small feature on discord it's called uh user feedback it's under the pix section so you can also provide comments as you will test this there and if i'm not mistaken this should be almost done as you can already see it on our test environment so hopefully this will be released in two days from now maybe a week thank you very much back to you thank you very much jacob really exciting stuff um yeah hopefully leaving feedback is a little bit easier than sharing screens in discord again apologies to everyone for the slight delay and getting started next up we've got joseph chang through his work on the ephedian wiki migration okay uh thank you josh so i've been yeah so i've been working on the wiki migration uh which is actually the the wiki and the etherdocs migration now these are two websites that currently exist as kind of informational resources about ethereum but both um quite significantly out of date i eat docs is dated all the way back to the homestead release which was when ethereum mainnet first launched and the wiki uh hasn't really been updated since sometime in 2020 so a lot of the information there although is still attracting a lot of a lot of views is actually kind of out of date and no longer relevant and some of it's even maybe a little bit contradictory to the current truth um so the idea is that we will have one kind of trusted source of of information and that'll be ethereum.org and those other websites will be will be deprecated but there's also a lot of really really nice and useful information on those sites that we don't want to just just kind of lose to to obscurity so the idea was to go through and audit both of those websites page by page and find the information that was useful or interesting or in some other way valuable migrate it over to ethereum.org and then deprecate the other the other sites and um you know it's been it's it's been super interesting um and kind of challenging definitely because working out what information was actually out of date um wasn't always obvious and required quite a lot of searching through kind of you know the source code for different clients and bugging people on discords and all that kind of thing to work out what the actual current status of some of these really esoteric bits of information actually is also finding places on ethereum.org where some of this information would live appropriately it was also kind of challenging the wiki in particular is is just kind of a really strange mix of basic kind of fundamental uh introductory information but then also some really kind of hardcore nuanced instructions for you know like spinning up local private networks or philosophy pages about byzantine fault tolerance and all this kind of stuff and um ethereum.org has kind of got a more overall kind of approachable structure and and vibe so sometimes it's a little bit a little bit difficult to find good homes for the information and um you know the thing about the wiki especially is in its own way it's it's it's like it's kind of kind of beautiful but certainly it's definitely uh a snapshot of a really lively moment in in ethereum's history and it became just a bit of a quest to try and preserve that vibe and the fun and also the uh the rich information that's that's in the wiki and not let it just get lost to obscurity just because the site's become deprecated so um yeah so it's been a bit of a it's been a bit of a quest and i guess in practice what that actually looked like was firstly a page by page audit of both those sites the wiki and eth docs and then a series of relatively chunky pull requests to ethereum.org just trying to remember what they were but reworking the proof of stake pages and the proof of work pages adding some more um some new sections on proof-of-work mining algorithms adding new pages about data structures and encoding schemes that are used across the ethereum protocol reworking the history pages adding pages and subpages about their networking layer you know adding entries to the glossary reworking the json rpc api pages and a bunch of other just kind of more minor additions to lots of lots of other pages across ethereum.org using the information from from the wiki and etherdocs and the status of that project now is that the migration is basically finished there's a couple of prs awaiting review but you know in the next week or so i'm hoping to have youth docs and the wiki um sunsetted with redirects back to ethereum.org and those pull requests merged and then kind of draw a line under it so if you're interested then reach out or have a look at the prs thanks i yeah definitely really appreciate the work you put into this um for context it's something that's been hanging around as a task to be done for like two years at this point so yeah it's really great to see it finally get over the finish line um i think we've gotten vertica here yes great um so invertica i was going to talk a little bit about the east acre cr end which is something we're all really really excited about uh i'm ethica i'll give you the floor hey thanks good morning can everyone hear me okay yeah good and clear perfect uh yep i am vetica i'm one of the core members here over at the east acre community just a real quick plug for e-staker if those of you on this call that aren't already familiar we are a group of community members that support and advocate for the solo staking or staking in general and supporting that within the ethereum ecosystem so whether you're a home solo staker whether you're soliciting a staking service or staking pool we like to make sure that your journey no matter what path you take is as seamless and as stress as stress-free as possible so if you're looking to stake on the ethereum network if you have questions on staking services the east acre community is a great community to join to get some answers to those questions our motto in fact is welcoming first and knowledgeable second um so you'll find a very um welcoming environment and um no question is too small for us so what i'd like to bring to your attention today specifically is we have the east acre community teamed up in conjunction with clr fund and the ethereum foundation in sponsoring a 350 000 die quadratic funding matching round via the clr fund and what that means specifically and all the applicable details i'll put it in the chat here and anyone that's interested can check that out you can go over to qf.eatstaker.cc and what's going to happen here is if you are a in any way supporting the staking ecosystem within ethereum you're eligible to be compensated via a grant and what that means it could be anywhere from documentation tutorials if you have step-by-step instructions on how to set something up as it relates to staking if you are a community that's looking to support the staking ecosystem if you are a developer or engineer that has a tool whether that be a dashboard or some sort of gui interface or any tool that somehow saves us clicks if setting up and spinning up a validator is a 10 click process and your tool gets us down to 8 clicks that's what we want we want any step to make it easier and ultimately lowering the technical barrier in which to get into the staking ecosystem is what we're looking for so any of those uh spanning that that broad spectrum um as long as it relates to staking is eligible for the grant and you'll need two things so you've got 12 days yet to submit your project idea does not have to be functioning at the moment the idea here is to give your project exposure and ultimately get yourself funded in order to get yourself the applicable resources in order to build this thing so you've got 12 days to enter again this is on qf.estaker.cc and you're going to need two things and this is uh for both if you are planning on submitting a project idea or if you're looking to contribute to a project that you're interested in and those two things are you're going to need to be bright id verified the link to that is also on qf.estaycare.cc and then you're also going to need funds on arbitrum so this is all happening on the layer two so the the fees are going to be you know basically next to nothing um and what you'll do is once you've become bright id verified that is how um clr fund mitigates uh or helps with civil resistance and then uh the the funds that you add to arbitram are going to be the funds that you would use to contribute to any of the available grants that are submitted and just a real quick tl dr on on what how how this works in terms of the quadratic funding aspect of it is it's it's a way to sort of level the playing field for smaller players in order to contribute to a project and also signal to an ecosystem that it's something that's important or of value that it's not just one person what that means specifically is if we look at three arbitrary grants uh three separate projects and one project um maybe has ten thousand dollars uh die in funding but it was only by one person it was by a whale it was it's a project they're excited about they want to see it funded so they they put in 10 grand but then you've got maybe another grant that a hundred people donated to but they only donated uh one die so they've only got 100 die the way quadratic funding works is it's the amount of votes so a single die you can imagine equates to a vote and the more votes or signals that an individual grant has the more proportion in funding that specific grant gets so in this instance looking between the the grant that has ten thousand dollars in funding with a single uh contributor and the grant that has a hundred die in funding over a hundred different people that second grant would actually get more in percentage of the matching pool than that initial one so all that being said you don't need to be contributing a ton of money in order to make a very large impact onto these these grants and again that's 350 000 die that these ethereum foundation has put up for us in support for this quadratic funding round it's a really big deal again 12 days left to enter and submit projects all of the applicable details again whether you are a project looking to get funding or a contributor looking to support projects can be found at qf.eathstaker.cc if you have any questions in any part of the process if something is confusing if you're having trouble getting verified or bridging over funds please reach out to us over at the east acre discord uh we're more than happy to help you out and uh support your journey on this uh this qf round that's all for me i appreciate the time and uh sharing some of the stuff awesome thank you so much for coming on and for shooting um so yeah everyone definitely join the eaststaker community and definitely trying to get involved in the clr rent um so next up we've got some co-apps um you'll need a phone or a qr scanner for this i'm gonna share my screen okay yeah so here is the qr code for you to scan um i'll leave this up for like a minute or two i also i'm going to share the direct link for this for people in the community called chats because i know that sometimes the video quality on this isn't great so people can struggle a little bit maybe if i just zoom in that tiny bit no i can't never mind yeah and i've also just shared the link and the community called chat too so i'll just give it a minute and then we can move on to our next part okay i think that's been long enough and we can probably move on again i've posted the link in the chat so you can claim your point um next up we've got luca who chat a little bit about the translations initiatives are running just now sure hey everyone um just a couple of quick mentions regarding the translation program today um first of all we wanted to highlight the translator certificate again we have received a good number of claims for the certificate so far but also some messages indicating that not everyone is aware that this exists so again we have introduced the ethereum.org translator certificate at the start of this year as a way of acknowledging our community of translators and supporting them in their career development or entry into the web3 space if something that is something they are interested in since the certificate can be used as a reference there are some requirements to being eligible to receive it um specifically having at least five thousand approved words in the ethereum.org project in crowdin as we want to make sure we are issuing this to active translators who are suggesting high quality translations but if you have been contributing to ethereum.org as a translator and aren't sure how to check if you are eligible uh feel free to reach out in the translate channel on our discord send us an email at translations ethereum.org or send me a dm and we will check your eligibility and potentially send you the certificate um just wanted to raise this and mention it again in case we have newer people joining um or someone who missed this in the past um thanks to scott 1up for designing this awesome certificate if i do say so myself and obviously thanks to all of our translators who are instrumental in translating the website into different languages helping us reach more people all over the world and making educational content about ethereum available to everyone which leads me to my next and final point just sharing this link to the certificate in the chat so my next point um a lot of the content on ethereum.org is there thanks to the amazing ethereum community whether that is the actual content on the website uh translations or designs or the community aspect on our discord all of you make the website what it is and to further empower our contributors and get everyone more involved with the translation process we will be creating a new language lead role in the translation program these language leads will be awarded special roles and permissions both on crowding and on discord and will be able to play a more active role in the translation program if they want right now this is mostly still in the planning phase and we will be sharing more details soon but we are excited to be able to offer our translators the opportunity to level up and help us shape the future of translations on ethereum.org so stay tuned um that is it for now and with that i'm gonna pass it back to joshua great thanks luca great to see this getting pushed forward and following that we've got sam the etherium.org team lead who's going to be chatting a little bit about our plans for we're going to work on in q2 uh sam the floor is yours you guys can hear me all right yeah load and clear sweet thank you all for being here um awesome yeah short but sweet update on my end um the roadmap for q2 is is live i just shared a link to the github issue um i guess quick recap on this is yeah like you know we have a whole bunch of contributors on ethereum.org right like everyone on this call helps helps make all this stuff possible um but we are fortunate enough to have like a core team of now 10 of us who are you know lucky enough to to work on this and work on ethereum full-time or at least part-time um so what we do our best to do is just you know try to gather input from the community try to use a mix of you know quantitative and qualitative insights in terms of like what we should focus on what we should improve how can we make onboarding onto ethereum easier what education can we build out that makes ethereum more approachable and understandable and empowers all the people in the community who discover ethereum and want to get involved a place a place to do that so what we try to do is just share on a quarterly basis what our team's product roadmap is and i'd say the goal is at least twofold one just to you know make things more transparent make ourselves more accountable but i think mainly just get folks like you all involved for the people who do want to participate and contribute we want to just give you the ability to either give input get involved directly whether that's you know writing code designing images or web pages actually writing copy or translating content so i won't give an overview of each of our initiatives um but everything that was just print presented on on this call up till now is is something that's either on or was on our on our product roadmap so i think a good sampling of the various stuff we're working on um and if you are interested yeah i encourage you check out that issue if something excites you um you know comment on github hop in our discord let us know and what we really want to do is yeah get more folks involved um and get that done so like was said before yeah just a big thank you to everyone who's contributed so far you know we as the core team often get to take a lot of the credit but it's really the hundreds of you know code and content and design contributors and thousands of translators that make all this stuff possible so glad to be here and uh yeah thanks again thank you sam and i'll just take what you said thanks to everyone involved including contributors people on this call people giving feedback it's it's great to have you all a part of the process um last up we've got some like miscellaneous items announcements call outs i think paul very briefly wanted to speak about the topical office hours that he's just started running uh paul do you want to chat on that sure paul here um thanks for joining everyone and real quick i will echo some of the previous comments as well thanks to everyone who's showing up thanks to everyone who's contributed um yeah it makes our job easy when the community rises up like they've done so thank you to everyone who's contributed um what i've tried to do recently or last friday i kicked off a test round of an office hours related to a specific topic i chose staking at the time given it was somewhat timely with some of the other things going on we had just released the sticking pages and the quadratic funding round just kicked off uh so i focused on that thank you to anyone who did show up hopefully you had a nice time hopefully you learned something i'm looking forward to doing something like this again i'm happy to accept feedback from people on anyone who was there on the last one but the goal with this is to try to create a more just a friendly environment where people can hop in and not feel like they're under any pressure and have a chance to ask questions either on voice or in a chat and have it answered and be able to give some follow-up questions so i look forward to doing some more of these in the future a couple other topics in mind for sure but i would love to hear some feedback from people if there's any topics you'd like us to cover we can take a look at it and try to spin up a little office hour session we may not know all the answers all the time but similar to the east acre community trying to be kind of welcoming first in knowledgeable second so please come and get your questions answered and we'll be putting out announcements as those roll out thank you paul um and on a similar note i think nuno had something around the sort of design office hours slash design crowd he wanted to talk about too hey everyone hello this is you all uh nono here in the design team so at the same note that paul did office hours i think we want to start the same kind of office hours for design we're calling design critique on the same note is that we have we're having uh we are trying to build a design focused uh community as well so to help out on every other details of the website uh and for that i think we can start uh chatting a little bit about design and what we're doing on the design team as well so i will invite you all next week to join on um on a call to talk a little bit what we have in mind uh to contribute and to work with so i hope uh everyone can follow designer known designers uh enthusiasts uh so uh we are inviting you for next week at the same notes i will be sharing a figma file uh to be pinned on the channel i will link to to the same file on the comments as well uh just to be sure that we are on the same page on everything we are working on on design on the design front it's easier like this to follow uh the work we've been doing and we are doing right now uh but uh feel free to comment or to give ideas to improve the process so see you all next week thank you so much jeff okay thank you no yeah i'm really excited about getting this started um i just wanted to touch very briefly also on devconnect um obviously it was great i had a wonderful time it was really good to see so many contributors there and i think i speak for everyone on the team who was at devconnect when saying that i'm just getting to meet yous in person getting to chat to use outside of this you know discord metaverse that we all co-exist within um and i also wanted to shell our community events page so just um for the future if there are any events that you see on this list that i've posted in the channel i would definitely encourage you to attend if you can i spoke to a lot of people who was their first event and um just how great they thought it was how much more they felt as part of the community so if it's something that you're able to definitely show up to the next one if you can i don't know if anyone in the team wants to add anything at all to that before we go to questions i mean just to echo uh joshua um it was amazing meeting up with so many of our contributors um some of that we set up and planned for some of them we ran into randomly just on at different events um always nice to put a name uh to put a face to uh the name and a discord profile picture or whatever and actually interact with people in real life so yeah big plus one on that i hope this plus one that as well for anyone that's out there who's looking to try to get more involved i mean these conferences different events in real life can really be a good way to do that if you haven't gone out there and done that yet yes a lot of what we do is online a lot of people work remote but there's still a fundamental human component components all this and i would encourage anyone looking to get more involved to try to pursue one of these even if you can't get tickets to the event even if it's just showing up and attending side events or looking for ways to potentially volunteer to get the cost covered there's different ways you can end up getting into the mix and meeting a lot of people and learning a lot in the space by going to these events i just encourage everyone to consider it awesome um yeah so next up we've got a slido if someone on the team could do me a favor and share in the chat that'd be great i'm going to share my screen so we've already had quite a few questions in advance but if you've got a question feel free to ask and we'll try and get as many as we can i'm just echoing my earlier point obviously this is the ephedium.org community call and not to do with the protocol itself so top question when merge not really something that we can answer um well i guess the answer is probably soon when ready we're ready exactly um anonymous has asked the question hey guys nice work on the site what is your top priority as we approach the merge um paul do you want to talk to us at all not been um certainly related to the merge uh we recently put up uh we've got kind of two parallel epics in place where we're going to try to make some updates to the page regarding the merge and how on both ethereum.org as well as the staking launchpad both with slightly different objectives but overall the goal with before the merge is going to be to get the information out that that relates to any potential changes that are coming trying to squat some myths trying to provide some clarity around the merge and also make sure that stakers and node operators are properly informed as well as dapp developers and that regular users are informed and reassured this is something that given the loose time horizon at the moment is not the utmost priority like this sprint but it is certainly on our plan for this quarter it's going to be something coming up where we'll get those updates out yeah and we've also got this github issue that i've just posted again in the chat um around the merge prep epic just like everything that we're thinking about as we approach the marriage different things that we need to change whether that's content adding things creating new pages or just making updates um so yeah if you want to get involved in this at all if you can think of any way to help then feel free to check this out and comment on that yeah just posted the other one as well like i said there's two kind of going in parallel both the ethereum.org side as well as the staking launch pad feel free to take a look at both i just wanted to touch on that first question of merge when not that we can provide an answer but if you're looking for more information i would suggest going to the all core devs calls they um and that's where you're going to find information on updates on the merge so if you're looking for some of those answers or at least some like information on it would definitely recommend checking those out they're also hosted on the ethereum foundation youtube channel if you can't make them live yeah and note that anything outside of that channel essentially is mostly speculation so be careful out there um next up we've got louie i think that's how you pronounce that with a bit of a hardball philosophical question um what is the hardest problem you face as a team i think we've got our team leads who can maybe speak for all of us on this a little bit and anyone else if they want to chime in i'm going to sidestep that one personally thanks josh um interesting question yeah i think uh a few different things come to mind i mean i think one obvious challenge is like you know with ethereum.org at the end of the day it's just a website whereas ethereum itself is so many different things you know it's a protocol it's a network it's also just a community of people it's an open source movement it's in itself philosophical and cultural and political it's many different things and it's something that it's extremely hard to define and capture and it's try it's it's a hard attempt to try to capture everything about ethereum so for me and i know for the rest of the team that's definitely one big challenge i think what helps is right like we're not topical experts in every area of ethereum you know ranging from staking to layer twos to some of the softer questions and just various projects in the space all the use cases all the dows all the different communities and infrastructure and tooling but what does help is just you know open source for the win right and that like you know the philosophy that paul mentioned and unvetica mentioned of like welcoming first knowledgeable second i think is just a great guiding principle because we want to help answer questions that people have in the ethereum space and like oftentimes we won't have the answer but we're able to find the answer and like one of the things i love most about the ethereum community is just how open and accessible all these different projects and teams are like you guys are here in our ethereum.org discord but there's hundreds if not thousands of discords all across the ethereum ecosystem ranging from some of those areas i mentioned and often it's pretty easy to get in touch with the developers or builders or like inventors of these projects and ask questions that you can't find in the documentation or online or on twitter so the content is a challenge you know things are moving fast it's hard to keep everything up to date keep things translated but it really is just a community effort which makes that a lot easier to manage thank you sam um i'm guessing no one else in the team wants to speak to that and i think you've done a great job answering it next up we've got johnny has a question um as touched on to luca the other day i think we should create a section slash channel and our discord where the main scams are highlighted um we've been chatting about this today and yesterday actually um for context i'm sure many of you are aware but there are a bunch of scammers in this space and as we try and get rid of them it's a bit like playing whack-a-mole i don't want to talk um too openly about what we're doing because that might tip certain people off and ways to sidestep security progressions that we're trying to put in place but happy to chat offline with you more on that specific aspect and but yes we've got plans to action something similar to this um since sadly many still fall for it too often yeah um and i'd say that like the best thing we can try and do is education um someone from the team could maybe share our security page that we have on the site uh where we basically just go for like general internet security hygiene and wallet security and it's a good thing for anyone getting into the space to read because no matter how experienced you are you'll probably be a target for scammers at some point so just making sure you know all the different tips and tricks that they use and also just like general good security hygiene practices and so if you know anyone who's new to the space please share this with them before scammers get a chance to actually act on that um we've got a question for each staker i'd say because we're pretty sure in time maybe direct that to the um the eavestaker folks on discord there's a few links in the channel earlier um where is the new wallet page carwin you know where is it i can't talk a bit to it so um if you look at the road map for this quarter um we're currently committed to working on revamping the find wallets page so i guess some context around that we get about 5.5 percent of our website traffic to the find wallet page um and we're aware that the experience could be improved when it comes to searching for wallets and finding like wallets for your use case so we're working this month um on updating the find wallets page specifically this won't include an update to like the wallets page in the sense of like the information side of what wallets are this is just going to be about finding a wallet for ethereum um i know we have plans to kind of expand information for the wallet section in general to go into depth on like the different kinds of wallets but as it stands right now we're just working on the find wallets page um and we're gonna hopefully have an update for you guys come next uh yeah community call just to add really quickly uh in the terms of open the the process uh we are open the design process as well so i'll give you the link to the figma file that is work in progress just to see where we are at the design of the of the page feel free to comment on whatever it is it's sometimes it's a messy page because it's where i work directly so uh feel free to jump in whenever you want and comment on every on on the things that we are working on but if you want to follow along the processes feel free to see the figure file and followed at the issue on github okay thanks guys and i guess that can ask answers this question what what do you recommend for aetherium as a mask um depends entirely what you're doing but that page will hopefully answer those questions for you um we've got a question from claire who says hi guys feedback from was circulated by email for people who attended devconnect when will this feedback be shared um it's not something that we're dealing with directly but i can follow up on that for you and maybe get you an answer after the call um how can how can you earn a feeding related perhaps other than translating the page um so at the moment we've got translation collapse for anyone translating ethereum org we also have collapse for anyone who contributes in any way through whether that's design whether that's content or whether that as codes um probably easiest way just now is by getting some sort of pull request merged on the ethereum or grip on gap and but we also are planning on giving out pops or a couple of other things related to like the user feedback widget that jakob spoke about and just a whole other bunch that hopefully will be releasing um probably not last quarter but into next core um and yes sam shared a link in the chat for a little bit more context yeah loosely speaking though i know within our community we've got a couple different ways you can get poe apps but the best way to get po apps in the whole ethereum space is to just do a bunch of stuff go to different community calls join in you know if you're a coder get some some code prs up and potentially get stuff merged if you can translate any way that you can help out and provide value that's what i would focus on and the poeps will come yeah um and while you're talking paul there's a question on staking can someone briefly summarize this steps in order to stick um maybe just share a link to the staking page i would guess yeah briefly describing all the steps to stake is gonna be a little tricky in the next three minutes to be honest you can drop a link to speaking um if you are brand new loosely speaking if you have less than 32 week you are going to be reliant on pooling options so that's where i would head first and they there's a variety of them that come with different risk profiles if you have over 32 week i would definitely stop over to the eat sticker discord and say hello plenty of folks over there as well who can help get you started but overall test net first is going to be the answer for solo staking if you have less than 32 with though take a look at the pools yeah um we're just about time just quickly um well there'll be some events in spain this year for ethereum um i think there are maybe already a one or two arranged yep barcelona's the 6th to the 8th of july i think there's another one um yeah again if someone could drop a link to the events page that we've got you can have a look on that and hopefully find something that suits um and there was one more that i've seen i wanted to answer yeah i'm new to ethereum how do i get involved um again we've got a community section on the website the community hub and within that's the get involved page and it basically tries to break users into different archetypes and personas so that anyone can get involved whether you're a developer designer technical or non-technical and so again we'll share that in the chat and you can maybe have a look for that and see if you can find a way that best suits your particular skill set and with that i think that's probably all we have time for um again just want to say a big thank you to everyone involved uh and a massive thank you to andreika from east taker for jumping on to talk about the east acre of steelheart once again be sure to check that out and that's pretty much us until next time thanks very much everyone
