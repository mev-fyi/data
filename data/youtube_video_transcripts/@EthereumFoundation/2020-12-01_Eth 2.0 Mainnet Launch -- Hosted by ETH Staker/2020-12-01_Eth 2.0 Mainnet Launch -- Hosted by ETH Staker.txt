[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] today is december 1st uh 2020 it is probably 11 30 a.m uh universal time and i'm super fizz i am here with a bunch of uh a bunch of fantastic people a bunch of friends that i've gotten to know over the past few years we are here to view and celebrate the genesis of the ethereum 2 beacon chain main net so this call will last about an hour and 15 minutes it will be broken into two segments for the first 30 minutes we'll get comfortable we'll get to know everyone and we'll learn why we're here and then for the following 45 minutes beginning at the top of the hour we'll watch the genesis of the beacon chain uh we'll look at uh the metrics that tell us how successful the chain is uh and we'll just sort of talk about where we're going from here before i get to introducing everyone i have just a couple of things to mention uh if you're watching at genesis and it seems like something isn't working out you're probably going to see some people drop offline to go and fix that um it's okay we sort of expect um that there will be minor corrections and client updates the first 24 hours so if you're running a client at home we need you to be very vigilant to install those updates as quickly as you can i represent the east staker community along with my east acre friends i'd like to introduce nolan as you know as lamboshi nakagini hello um also patricio werthalter good morning who represents the poep community we'll be talking about poep a lot during this call maybe not a lot enough um buddha hi guys who works with uh bitfly or what you know as beacon chain uh and michael geeson who you know as on vedica so we are delighted to have you all here we're so excited to have our guests today um i know a lot of people will be interested in claiming a participation co-app and we'll get to that in just a few minutes but i'd like to introduce a few of our guests we have the client teams represented here [Music] we have nimbus and from nimbus we have mammy would you like to uh tell us a little bit about uh nimbus and kind of what improvements nimbus has made over the past few weeks that make it a launch ready client hi uh so i'm amy from the nimbus client which is a client written in a very little known language called nim the past improvements that we did is mostly um as many nodes we have been focusing on our resource restricted devices and we improved a lot of memory management and uh we also improved sync speed we still have work to do there but we hope to be a go-to client for a raspberry pi that's awesome and that is exciting to hear because that really feels fills a niche in the community there are a lot of stakers who want to stake on low power hardware um and they've tried some of the heavier clients on raspberry pi's and we've just felt like they haven't really made a good match but we're looking forward to increasing the support of nimbus the market share of nimbus so that we have great client diversity uh and so if you're interested in staking on a raspberry pi uh definitely check out nimbus we also have the awesome tecu team here uh ben and adrian would you guys like to say hello hey everybody good to be here hi everyone yeah thanks for having us and so these are our super humble guys who who aren't going to say a whole lot about themselves but they are such powerful leaders in the community um really helpful good fellas um i appreciate so much that you all joined us and even more than that i appreciate what you do to support everyone in the community uh so thank you both for being here um we also have the sigma prime team uh good to see you guys uh and they developed the lighthouse client so uh paul paul how are you do you want to say hello yeah hello everyone let's uh see what two and a half years of research engineering and testing look like awesome we're about to see some some rubber hitting the road in a minute uh and finally um i'd like to introduce terence from the prism uh prismatic team terence would you like to say anything yeah hey everyone thanks for having me it's great to be here i also have nishang and rahul here with wii with me here as well so yeah super super super duper excited to be here great awesome and so what what we just went over were the four launch clients for the beacon chain these are four pieces of software that have been in development for um in heavy development for the last year but in research and development for the past couple of years and if you're not terribly familiar with those clients they are nimbus lighthouse teku in prison and one of the things that that we're encouraging is the east staker community is that we don't become tribalistic and choose one client and always stick with that client what we're looking for the user base to do is to realize that we are all ethereum stakers and we can support all of the clients and thrive as a community when all of the clients are thriving so thank you all for coming today we have a couple other people who i'd like to to say hello to um alfre how are you this morning good um it's already noon so yeah i'm i'm really uh stoked great how are you um i'm very well i'm this is just it's a really exciting opportunity um i i see peter from uh from bitfly good morning peter hello good morning uh i see xiaowei um xiaowei is is one of our researchers hello everyone and carl hello how are you hey everyone doing very well very excited uh i i see oh so uh i also i'm looking for okay uh i see [Music] joseph ciao and joseph is is great because he wrote one of the most interesting introductions to the beacon chain um and why don't we why don't we happen to that joseph can you tell us a little bit about the beacon chain introduction that you wrote sure yeah i was um looking for for something on the beacon chain that you know we didn't get too deep but you know explained a little bit more than just the terminology so i i see it as a way to help people um especially if you've if you're running a validator now and maybe all you know is i'm just running this piece of software and i don't really know what what you know what else it's doing then maybe uh the article can help thanks great and what's the easiest way to find that article i was able to get a short domain ethos.dev slash beacon dash chain great um and so i really if you're kind of new to ethereum uh if you're new to to the beacon chain um i would definitely suggest that you begin by reading uh joseph's article um i'd like to suggest some resources that you might be interested in to learn more about ethereum the first one of those resources is reddit.com r eatstaker if you look at the sticky on the top of that page you're going to find a whole lot of resources including joseph's article and as we get into talking about these things we're going to talk about poap more hoap is a proof of attendance protocol so you see patricio our friend is wearing a pin that represents poep um poeps are sort of participation badges that you earn for doing something and they've become a bit of an obsession of mine and so essentially by being a validator on the genesis network you'll earn a poep but that that sort of leads into referencing uh joseph's article uh the the first thing what is it say the title for me please i think yeah the theorem two beacon chain explorer you should read first yes uh you should the one you should read first the reason i bring that up is it is a part of our study master program the ethereum studymaster program is an academic study that that is targeted at kind of the high school college level so that you can learn more about ethereum and be a more prepared validator that program has recently gone gone live uh and vetica michael can you tell us a little bit more about um not just studymaster but also poep and then kind of lead into how poep plays into this call today absolutely uh so the studymaster program was initiated or was an initiative rather that was started through the east acre community it was initially a 10-week course where we would go through using articles like we just described before each week and picking through the services and and breaking down exactly what is ethereum 2.0 serenity so it would it would break down um you know the consensus mechanism uh what what is a validator uh how does how does a validator get into a committee all those things on the technical side we would break down and uh after each week you'd have a quiz and if you had a 70 or higher uh after those two 10 weeks you would then earn your ethereum study master co-op um basically claiming that one you know what you uh know uh through this course and then uh two that you actually did complete it you can prove it for a matter of fact that uh you you went from week one to week ten and uh you know like you were saying before pull-ups are uh incredibly valuable that way because we can prove for a matter of fact that uh these things happened um and we have a co-op today and if we want to go into that anyone that is watching the youtube live stream uh you can join us at the e-staker discord server at invite dot gg slash east staker and there you'll find a room called co-op and in that room there is a pinned message with specific instructions on how to interact with our po-op bot and you'll receive uh for viewing today the ethereum serenity uh official co-op so it's uh incredibly exciting thank you so much michael and we will make sure that everyone who's viewing on youtube or is participating the zoom call gets gets that poem um vitalik i know that you're used to coming into calls cold uh and and kind of answering on the fly so welcome today congratulations thank you i i assume have have you been up long are you excited about this um i mean i've been i i'm in asia so this is actually the close to the end of a pretty normal day so that's been fairly lucky but uh definitely very excited the whole way through sure sure uh so i know that the spec for phase zero has has iterated uh so many times i know that danny has has iterated ever since you know the idea of the 1500 east deposit contract are you happy with with where we've evolved to for this launch today i think so and it's definitely gone through a lot of iterations and i was actually just checking out the contracts that we had written in viper back in 2017 a few days ago it was i think the changes we've made have generally been for the better and in some ways it's definitely more challenging because there's more to change but also like this current uh the roadmap that we ended up settling on like it both lets us innovate quicker because we can launch eth2 before we have to uh kind of entrust all of uh the entire eth1 system to it um which i think is a really valuable benefit um and um also in the long run and i think this approach allows us to make some kind of more radical changes to the uh the protocol that i think are necessary like changing the tree changing serialization algorithms um introducing enough starting we're going to have to introduce data availability sampling at some point so and like i think there's a lot of benefits um i'm very happy with the ls and how we've managed to reduce the deposit size down from 1500 to around 32 if that's been definitely a huge boon for a decentralization uh speaking of decentralization actually if you uh go on twitter and you see my the most recent tweet that i published like literally right before joining this i published some stats that i just ran with my python script after i've updated it to a pull directly from either scan api so i can run it at any time now and so it's uh you know improving and improving a lot there so it seems like it's definitely satisfying on all of the goals that we've had for a man for an initial staking system um i mean it would definitely be nice if uh running uh if staking was technically simpler but i think like it's you know it's always been kind of inevitable that on a day one people are going to be afraid uh and i think it'll take you know a month or two and people figure i got to figure out you know this is what you need to do it'll feel like a known quantity and so people will be uh much less scared about uh about joining in and uh will you know feel comfortable just doing it on a on a regular computer without worrying too much about hardware or whatever uh so that's uh just ongoing improvements in kind of ease of use is definitely something that i really care about um and then from here and it's just a matter of making sure phase zero runs well and just continuing to improve and continue to work toward um you know white client support sharding and kind of the merge as the three big milestones that we've identified awesome i i'm really glad that you you kind of mentioned this difficulty with getting um the validator client running right now and the thing that i've i've been talking to people about for months is we have just gotten to a point where the implementations work and we're still solving bugs in those but if you're an end user at home and you think oh this is too hard what i really want you to look forward to is the next few months where these products will become polished and packaged and so much easier to use if if you're a home staker and you spent hours trying to slog through this and get your validator up um i'm i'm delighted i'm proud of you i'm happy you joined us i'm so proud that the east acre community um kind of worked together to increase that diversity uh and as vitalik said things are going to get easier and i think uh no you guys have definitely done an amazing job of you know doing the community side of the work to make sneaking as accessible as possible so keep it up thank you so much i appreciate those comments and i think i'm going to turn it over to nolan for just for a moment yeah so we're about uh 10 minutes out from launch now um i was wondering if we could flip over to the awesome beacon chain dashboard just briefly and have uh peter take us through what that is what we're looking for what we hope to see and just explain what we're looking at on that dashboard yeah sure so um the dashboard shows the progress or let's say the first four epochs of the beam chain and so what we're looking at is once we reach genesis we'll see the first block in the first row should turn green which means it has been proposed by the penetrator design validator and once that happens it will move to slot 2 slot 3 slot 5 till the epoch is complete and once ebook 1 starts the process will repeat in the second row and so on and so on up to ebooks three and what we want to see is a high participation rate which means that all or most of all validators are online and are submitting at the stations and we'll see a participation rate should be above two thirds which means if the participation rate is lower than sixty six point six percent um will it won't be an optimal solution we saw that on several of the test nets where some validators said issues but we we don't expect such such issues on on the mainnet what you see in the checklist is the progress as the chain progresses um what we want here is first of all to have a tick that the first block is proposed and in epoch zero that two thirds of all um validators submit an attestation for this epoch the same is um should be the case for epoch 1 and epoch 2 and if everything is all right with epoch 3 we should see um epoch want to finalize and ebook 2 to justify and ebook 3 to justify them later on and once this is complete and the launch is successful um the interface will switch back to the regular view where you can follow the blocks that have been proposed the ebooks how many validators voted for each epoch and so on so it should be pretty exciting to see everything updates automatically so you don't need to to press f5 to update the page it will update every every 15 seconds and it should allow you to give you a good impression during the genesis launch thank you awesome and if anybody is looking at that dashboard and they see average balances 32.01 eath and they're wondering why that is it's because i mean last i checked four people out of i think 26 000 deposits ended up making a double deposit so they sent 64 each to their validator instead of 32 and i think that really speaks to the quality of work that the launch pad people did and you know making the deposit process very safe so i just want to compliment them that out of 26 000 people there was only you know two individual four or sorry four four accidents um really great job by the launch pad team okay so uh i see that our friend danny ryan is on and i i don't do this often but um i'd like to give danny a hand because um really really really are you you get it because you brought this together um i it's not to embarrass you but the the organization and the sensibility that you've brought to this entire project are the things that have made it possible uh and i will speak for myself because i can't speak for anybody else but i appreciate your attention to detail uh and and everything you've brought to this project well thank you i will say though at this point this thing's a machine there's so many incredible people working on it that like it's they got it yeah and that's one of my favorite things about this morning is it is a machine so no matter what we do it's it's gonna happen that's um right i hopped on a call with somebody like 30 minutes ago and they're like what are you doing shouldn't you be doing stuff i said there's nothing i can do it's out of my hands it's out of our hands so we are just a few minutes before lunch and i think before you hopped in we talked about the beacon chain dashboard um do you want to give us an idea what kind of things we're looking for on that dashboard as far as participation [Music] blocks being prepared and what would be watching for after the genesis so i mean i think we ran through some of the key metrics there i i don't know exactly what was said uh but really we're watching for an early block you know we want to see a block at slot one we don't there's no block at slot zero except for the genesis blog it's not proposed by anybody but we start seeing out the stations come in immediately at that zeroth slot um and then we really want to see a block at slot one ideally but really in the first two three slots from there um if we don't then that's a signal that something's maybe not going well um then we want to see like a good solid number of blocks for the through the first epoch that zeroth epoch uh 32 slots at which point during near the end of it we'll start to have a good handle on whether we have that two-thirds majority um or not really each epoch um like the core kind of health metric is are two-thirds of the validators online and agreeing on things um so at the at the end of the zeroth epoch uh we should see firmly over that two-thirds number um and then similarly at epoch one we want to see the same thing plenty of blocks and lots of good participation the zeroth and the first epoch are kind of like warm-up epochs we can't really get into the uh the core proof-of-stake like finality machinery but once we get to epoch 2 this is the first epoch that can become justified so at the end of epoch 2 and each epoch is 6.4 minutes uh but at the end of epoch 2 we can have justified epoch 2. we can also justify epoch 1 so sometimes there's a weird scenario where like we just saw epoch 1 we didn't just value part 2 but if we see a justification there uh you know we're starting to be in in pretty good shape um which again relies on that two-thirds really agreeing on things and then at the epoc the end of epoch three uh which we're now 25.6 minutes in or so uh we would see ideally uh we can see um actually this and i i should have corrected this we can we can see epoch 2 in the ideal finalized um and this is a little bit of a mistake on on the beacon explorer um we can see ideally epoch 2 sometimes epoch 1 in a strange scenario finalized and epoch 3 justified so really by the end of epoch 3 by the end of about a half hour into this thing we should know kind of is our core machinery working or the various clients uh or the validators online or the various clients uh in agreement um and hopefully yes and if not uh we will be scrambling to better understand the network which we've gotten much better at doing um and figure out what's going on and make it work so awesome thank you for that that great explanation uh obviously we'll be looking for your insights uh for through genesis uh and we had kind of an interesting development this morning uh on the east acre discord uh the first block proposer uh will be index 19026. and we identify we believe that we identified that person we're pretty confident about it um as a user named mr fahrenheit and so we've been in kind of a tizzy this morning so mr fahrenheit i hope you get your wi-fi stable um i hope you are calm and relaxed and um best wishes to you uh in about what's what's our time in just a few seconds uh we'll be looking for uh this first proposal well again at the zeroth slot we have the genesis block and we'll see some attestation start coming out the first slot so 12 seconds after genesis we should see that first user proposed block one minute anybody else feeling tingly been waiting years and years for this my loins are a flame for genesis block let's go e2 this is terrifying there's a lot of people on this call saying oh you know it all just happens you know there's nothing we can do it's if it all goes wrong i'm going to panic and i'm going to be very busy i remember in july 2018 when uh if two phase zero was uh 70 complete uh yes of course it's like that windows loading icon we're at slot zero right yeah so we also added the lights all speaking out on the stream so if the dashboard doesn't work for some reason we have some kind of backup man 3 500 people almost on the live stream welcome everybody to we got to block everyone we got them yay the network and so we've transitioned from the place where we've been waiting to genesis to where genesis is initiated and now we watch carefully uh for about 32 slots that is 32 times 6 seconds 32 times 12 seconds to see what kind of progress we're making uh on participation congratulations to peter and bitfly that the uh the dashboard looks like it's working really well nice fahrenheit also left the graffiti [Laughter] mr f was here a lot of fun okay we haven't missed a block yet right no that's nice well there's 16 000 on the line right a little bit different than you know 32 gore leaves so for anyone who doesn't know we've been through 10 test nets and because uh people didn't have money at stake it was difficult to get good participation but now that we're live on the main net at least so far uh we just it looks like maybe had one missed uh missed proposal things are looking really good thus far so everyone's really excited i should also mention that if the blocks don't appear on the dashboard it's because we're exporting the data first so there is a little bit of delay so we're 13.58 of the way through the epoch according to beacon chain and i'm seeing 13.58 percent of attestations that's what we want to see wow my uh validator has attested so go me i think we took down alex stokes's fork monitor yeah yeah what's that is that running on like a potato let me see yeah oh what one missed block one miss plug slot five i think we're also in the slot seven one of the things that we kind of know is um we made a really big push to invite home stakers um and many of us are not professionals many of us did this because we want to participate in the network but that also increases the likelihood that we're going to be offline or our wi-fi isn't working or maybe we didn't import keys correctly so what i want to tell you is if you're one of these people who feels like you're having trouble please reach out to each staker in the next few hours and let us help you get online we have a help desk full of staff who are ready to support you um don't panic you're not you're not messing anything up you're not losing anything but we would like to support you and get you online uh today so yeah yeah even if you're offline for a few hours or even a day like it's not you're not gonna lose a ton of money um but we can help get you there whatever you do don't start the second client with the same validators thank you yes uh one of the there are not many ways to go wrong in staking um there are two basic things that a home user can can get wrong or that any user can get wrong and the first one is just to be offline if you turn your validator off you're going to leak um but you can actually perform a network exit and in a few days you'll be exited from the network and you won't leak anymore i'll be glad to talk to you about that if you want to come over to reddit.com r eatstaker the other way it's kind of a severe thing if you run your validator keys in two locations so let's say you run your validator keys at your home and then you wanted a backup in the cloud if you have your validator keys running in two places even if you're just trying to be redundant it will lead to a slashable condition you will lose a little bit of ether and you will also be forcefully ejected from the network so if you have any questions about that please feel free to ask us but the simple thing is just don't run your validator keys on two different uh machines at the same time participation is looking really good right now yeah we're going to make it great work higher ethereum community i'm proud to be five percent uh and so if you're watching the thing we're looking for here um i i'm not saying youtube stream but can i assume that we're seeing the the beacon chain status monitor there yeah likely yeah okay so what we're looking for is this red bar to climb beyond 66 percent we really want to see it in this at least in the 70 or 75 range 64. 63 right we're there now yeah yeah we're getting there uh and so um who wants to tell me what happens uh when we complete a block over 66 percent ben will you will you tell me what happens when we complete a block over 66 yeah sure so uh we've got that means enough votes have come in that um the network will decide that this checkpoint this block at this point will never be reverted it's set in stone for the life of the beacon chain and the history all the history before that point is agreed between all the nodes uh so we call that finalization so there are two stages first it's justified and then um ideally one epoch six minutes later uh it is finalized and then it's set in stone and one of the properties of the network is that you cannot finalize two blocks at the same height without slashing at least a third of the validators so it's a very powerful economic signal that the the chain is uh working as intended and is reliable and i think it's good enough i'm going to open the champers sorry we are we are wrapping up epoch zero uh with what looks like an 82 participation rate this is the first of several signs that we're looking for um we'll be watching several epochs but based on this we can say that the genesis of the beacon chain is successful um finalized 82.27 percent so i oh i hesitate to clap but damn it's a good day um yeah i have 85 correct data stations awesome paid my uh my mom just texted me and said she's very proud of all of you boys and lady so congratulations mom's stamp of approval well done i also want to say uh we were discussing amongst ourselves before about what the participation rate would be for epoch zero and superfiz correctly guessed 82 i said 85 uh what did buddha say buddha said 87 yeah i say it's 87 um how the hell did i guess 82 and that was you nailed it bud yeah it's scripted you know it you knew it we'll be spending some time you know ideally we want to see up in the upper 90s so we'll spend some time today trying to figure out if this is just people that are offline or if there's any um kind of client tuning and optimizations we can do to get that into a better number and again thank you danny that is really the reason that the east acre uh community exists um i i call myself the beacon chain community health consultant so i'm looking for people who are having trouble getting their proposals out or people who are having trouble getting their validators running and while i don't support everyone myself i do have a fantastic team that i work with and lots of volunteers lots and lots of volunteers who pitch in to help everyone get the network healthy so um the two best places to find us are our discord that's invite.gg slash eaststaker or on our reddit reddit.com slash r eatstaker if you you can also hit us on twitter at twitter.com really all you have to do is say i need help or please help me my favorite ones are the ones that say urgent need help because then i drop everything and find people to help you so please don't be afraid to do that we have a lot of resources and what we want to do is help to get that network participation up above 90 today yeah super fizz when you did your video talking about being the uh the health consultant that was so aptly put good that was the right approach you were talking about kind of the hierarchy of a hospital and you were you're describing uh vitalik danny's role and so on and so forth but then when you said the uh the community health uh uh correspondent or whatever that was the consultant thing was exactly right because you've done a bang-up job delegating and finding people in your toolbox to help help others figure this whole thing out so well done thank you it's funny because i compared myself to a nurse in that video and when you think about it a nurse or nurses are some of the most valuable people in the hospital uh they are the people who make sure things get done and and that is really what the east acre community is trying to do with users uh and so we just want to welcome you in and take care of you um things are looking great in epoch one even better than um epoch zero so uh we're doing well i'm so proud that everyone's hard work is paying off yeah if i'm not mistaken you need an if one not to be to be a blog proposal so maybe those people haven't synced their if one note yet so it doesn't necessarily have to be the if two clients it's not for most clients it's not actually required yet to be connected to each one to propose blocks at some point in the next eight hours or maybe a little longer the chain will agree on a new e1 block uh at that point after that you need to propose you need to be connected to any one node to propose a block but until that point as long as you know the genesis data you don't need to be connected to a node so there is time yet for people who want to get synced up you've got eight hours or so uh if you're having trouble syncing up your e4 nodes um and uh don't panic just yet so just to put it in in layman's terms this is now the time to start your notes thank you yes please turn it on there's a question on youtube what is an epoch i'm sure there's a lot of people that don't know you know what these terms are so what's the basic explanation of what an epoch is hey thank great i'm glad you're here um and i i've loved your tweets i i wondered if if you wouldn't mind explaining to everyone what day uh an epoch is sure um yeah so um yeah thanks um the um epoch is basically 32 blocks in eastern and and the reason that we have epochs is that to make certain decisions you want you want like to make them based on a number of epochs and in one epoch everyone gets a chance to attest um and the idea is that this is a long enough time time span that uh you can be pretty sure that there will be at least one honest proposal and um uh and at least hopefully one block as well um and so you can you can be certain that um everyone can get a chance to get the attestations in and then after each epoch you basically make a decision have enough um validators attached to this to justify an epoch or to finalize the previous e-book as well thank you so much there are two time well there are actually more but there are two time measurements that really matter uh in ethereum too and they are slots and epochs a slot is every 12 seconds uh and as dump grid said 32 slots go together to make one epoch which is 6.4 minutes and as we're watching this progress we're waiting for uh epochs to pass so that we have um good certainty that the network is healthy and we just finished the second i'm sorry the first epoch the second epoch which is epoch 1 with 85 participation does someone want to explain uh i know we've talked about it but we've moved from 82 percent to 85 if everything is the same why do we have that variation hey adrian um i i know that you get these things and you explain very well why why that fluctuation if nothing has changed uh i don't know exactly um so i think a part of it is that um if you miss an attestation in the first epoch you can actually pick it up you're at a station the second one is kind of um inherits backwards through the chain because you're pointing to the head of a chain um so when you vote on on epoch 2 you're effectively also voting on the the prior epoch so it picks up some extra votes along the way and the other aspect of it that will be happening is that some attestations might not get included as quickly as they could be and so some attestations from epoch 1 actually wind up included in blocks later in epoch two and so they still count and still valid you get slightly lower rewards in fact you get much lower rewards they're hard but after one block and it kind of drops off logarithmically you still get paid they're still really useful for the network though and that's part of why you'll see the the participation rate kind of tick up a little bit um in the e-book two after after it kind of first ends you don't have a finalized number yet thank you so much so something that i've been so excited about the call that i have not um talked about how to claim our co-app um and so i think now is an absolutely perfect time because we have great network health um and uh we have just a few moments uh well really we intend to leave the call running probably another 15 or 20 minutes but i do want to make sure everyone can claim uh they're viewing poep because that is in the future that will be one of the most important things ever i'm going to just kind of set it up a little bit and then i'm going to let michael who you know is in vedica take over with the specifics but poep is the proof of attendance protocol you you can receive an erc 721 uh badge for participating in ethereum or actually for participating in any event we use it primarily for the beacon chain as each staker and we're so glad to have the founder of patricio worthholder on our team and i'd like for you to claim your poep if if you're not sure what it is if you're still a little hazy about it we'd like to to give you some more information you can find us at our reddit um and we can help you get up to speed but right now michael will you talk to us about how we can claim that yeah so for those of you that are already familiar with uh poep and are watching on the youtube channel what you can do to claim is go over to the eav staker discord at invite dot gg slash eath staker there is a po-op channel you'll go under that and then under the po-op channel is a um sticky where you can have uh there are step-by-step instructions on how to interact with the po-op bot you'll need the call code claim word and today's uh code word is serenity now serenity now is uh serenity now uh with an exclamation point so you'll uh you'll interrupt you'll interact with uh the bot with that phrase and you'll be automatically uh distributed a serenity launch co-op and so i'm there now one of the difficulties i'm having is is finding that serenity font and i see a lot of people um sending a message publicly what how can i find that serenity bot to send it a private message i'm sorry how can i find the box right so uh in that sticky on the po-op channel is the direct name that you'll have to add or directly message the pull-up bot um use that um that at po-op bot um directly message that that person that bought and uh with the serenity now exclamation point and you'll receive a claim claim code but it is important uh superfoods did make a good point uh you won't get anything it won't trigger an event if you put that code in the channel you have to directly message the po-op bot for that to work and what i'm seeing now are people using the at and posting that publicly rather than in a private message and i generally use a right click link to get a private message ah if you right click on any of those you can hit message and then you're in a private so a lot of people are doing at sorry now but if you right click on that it gives you the opportunity to message privately and that's how you can claim it okay i i along with many people are sending that publicly um and i i actually just finally got it correct so don't worry if it takes a moment you do need to claim it during this call in order to receive it i can promise you it's worth the couple of minutes it takes to figure out how to get it but let me go over that again if you go to invite.gg eatstaker if you look on the left in our channels you're going to see the channel called uh hashtag ho app i just saw let me get to the right hashtag you'll go in there and you'll see a lot of people are messaging the poet about publicly um just hover over that and right click and hit message and then in that message you're just gonna write serenity space now exclamation mark and enter the bot will respond with that link and then you can follow that link announcement we justified epoch 2. beacon chain and our uh we we are justified uh finally we just tried epoxy tell us what that means um so in epoch zero and epoch one we don't we don't actually run the finality calculations due to kind of an idiosyncrasy at the beginning so the first time that the state transition is actually running justification calculations is at the end of epoch 2 and so epoch 2 has been justified and at the end of now if we justify at the end of epoch 3 we're going to finalize epoch 2 and that's our key launch success metric uh and so we're you know we're five and a half minutes from knowing if this was a successful launch what are your indications do you think that it might be a successful launch um it looks extremely likely at this point so exciting don't jinx us i know right well someone popped champagne uh or was i think it was ben the pop champagne and i i had this oh no what if what if he jinxes us now the people under discord are so trolls i just put their poep channel into read only and they're not messaging me so uh what's what's next let's um and i i want to put this to any any researcher that wants to to open up and tell us um us it looks like the beacon chain launch is successful and we know that this this does not provide actual scaling it's just the foundation what can we look forward to next in the next in the next few months from uh from the ethereum to solution yeah i can take that i mean yeah so what what what phase zero is what the beacon chain is is it comes to consensus uh it comes to consensus on itself uh but it now has the ability to come to consensus on other things uh and that's the plan is to upgrade the system to come to consensus on some more stuff uh over the next couple of years primarily the two things that we're looking to come to consensus on are ethereum what we know and love today essentially that is kind of consensus on today by a proof of work algorithm and that is to be hot swapped for this beacon chain proof of stake algorithm um and so we're actively working on uh prototyping that i actually hope to see something of a test net actually relatively soon on that merge and the other thing that we want to come to consensus on is a ton of layer one data and that's what we call through sharding and data availability sampling and that's also what we're very actively working on on prototyping and what engineering teams likely at the start of the year will begin to shift some of their focus into working on um there are some like other other probably minor upgrades that we'll see next year for example a minor upgrade that adds like client support uh maybe a little bit of like validator accounting reform that makes things a little bit more efficient in the state um and and stuff so a lot of work to do uh but this is this like sophisticated stake mechanism lays the foundation uh for the rest of those upgrades hey so uh i know that this launch is going to uh pique a lot of interest from the community and so let's say that i'm a software developer or an engineer and i'm watching this and i kind of like am ready to contribute to the future of ethereum how do i how do i get my foot in the door where do i go to to contribute at a technical level so it's all open source um i know that goes without saying but um there are there's research there's specifications there's client teams there's engineering uh there's tools and libraries and things that you can do to enhance the validator experience there's like every layer of the stack is is open um and very welcoming to new contributors so pick something that you're interested in and dig in uh we congregate a lot in this like eath r d discord to talk about like everything layer one uh we also chat a bunch on uh the ether research forum and most of the work happens in various github repos uh so i recommend just digging in uh scratching an itch and and contributing early and often you know even if it's just fixing some typos and docs uh you'll find that contributing to open source is uh fun and addictive uh and and it often kind of spirals from uh small contributions to large thanks danny if you're not a developer uh if you're just someone who wants to help uh the east acre community is always looking for people who are welcoming first and knowledgeable second uh the way that we've grown our community is that emphasis on being welcoming and kind to everyone so if if you're interested stop by and just begin learning and answering questions and welcoming new people that is really the way that that we build a strong community and i look forward to having you so we're a couple slots away from the end of epoch 3 where we can see that kind of key finality metric and i think that i think it inevitably will happen at this point uh based on the activity through this epoch uh so we're two slots away i like that inevitably because i suppose something could go wrong but we're one slot away and it all looks good the thing that anyone viewing should know is that we we could not have dreamed of a more successful launch than what we have right now we have finalized epoch zero we have participation above 80 percent um and at this moment the beacon chain is well the beacon chain is successful now because we just completed epoch 3 with participation of 87 percent so um yeah it is absolutely time to celebrate good work everyone fantastic work everyone holy i know right great job oh wow i know there are a lot of sighs of relief of people who have been uh stressed and anxious for months and years over this so um congratulations to everyone i'm watching the sigma prime guys high five on their office man those guys are about ready to start wrestling yeah toast to everybody who has contributed there have been hundreds literally of people who've contributed to this over many years um and just huge shout out to the ef team shall we danny proto uh dan crad vitalik and justin and yeah just incredible work everybody when is the next protocol upgrade the question would rather be when is the next when is the phase one test net no no no we're going on vacation now champagne um so the the beacon chain is successful and if you were a genesis validator that is fantastic i'm glad that you made it into uh the genesis of the beacon chain but if you if you're watching at home and you're like i should have gotten in on that it's not too late you can still submit a deposit of 32 ether um you can wait in an activation queue and you can join this process now you haven't lost anything you're not behind even if you watch this five years from now assuming the chain is still running fine you can still submit 32 ether and be it become a validator at any point in the future so this is just the beginning so really interesting but i didn't catch it yeah what was that paul i was just saying it's good we made it past the second end of the second epoch that's where we've had historically the most bugs so i was pretty yeah this is definitely an indication that all four of the launch clients it's an indication that all for the launch clients are running smoothly and that our issues are most likely to be validators who aren't online yet um and so that is fantastic um i i bet i bet we'll see improved participation as those validators kind of get a grip on things and figure out what's going on to get online so we're getting close to wrapping up after this uh i think us on the staker team at least will be moving to the east acre discord and doing more of like an open mic type thing there where everybody's free to speak and i also will note that youtube has a very lovely feature in which when one live stream ends it puts you into another and oftentimes it's a scam it's not always but oftentimes it is you should be cautious of that the scammers are now feverishly trying to get their scan posted um so with that um i'd like to thank absolutely everyone for uh your years of commitment and hard work um and dedication to getting this done um this has taken blood sweat and tears from so many people um i'm happy to be a part of this i'm happy that everyone was able to join us today uh and i look forward to joining you in um in the future when we have a network upgrade um but this is it this is the big milestone this is the promise to launch the the ethereum beacon chain in 2020 and this promise was upheld and it's a successful promise it could not have gone any better so um with that i look forward to seeing all of you again and thank you so much for participating yeah great work everyone this is awesome bye everyone so before you cut out the stream i i prepared a speech guys you always you always uh host these streams you have like the subreddit and and the discord and you always thank the easter researchers and you always thank the client teams and all the contributors but i would like to take the chance to thank you guys building uh an incredible community you know i've been around in this room for a couple of years i've been been there building the issue community might have been building the eastern community in the early years and uh i've been a moderator on the ethereum subreddit i had building this film stack exchange so there was uh so much happening back in the day and at some point ethereum is so big that you cannot follow all all kinds of development in the community but i want to say thank your easter team you because you're putting up really great efforts to help this very specific sub community and with your discord and your subreddit and or everything you host around it all the resources you build it's an incredible work and uh before we start all this stream i want to say thank you because it's really incredible work your support has been greatly appreciated since the very first time you visited us and and you're always welcome also you are welcome to join our after party call on the voice chat on discord um we are we are doing this open mic and we plan it to be the most inclusive it can be so so everyone listening please join our voice chat on discord hey do uh pony on the uh the shout out to eatstaker i was just looking on subreddit stats and east stakers comments per subscriber is ranked 392 across all subreddits so it's the very very very high signal to noise ratio there so hats off to you guys e-finance is a top top 1000 subreddit as well and so uh it's just incredible the the caliber of people that exist on ethereum reddit and then of course the east staker discord is is just busy as can be with uh activity so pop on over there good job guys thank you thank you all very much so glad to have the support all right we can shut it down michael thank you all for your time bye everyone later thanks everyone very much good night bye bye thanks are we clear
