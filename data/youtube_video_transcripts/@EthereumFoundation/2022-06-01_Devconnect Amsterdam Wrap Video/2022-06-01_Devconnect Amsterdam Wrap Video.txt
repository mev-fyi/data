the magic of getting together is very important for us so the goal is very simple let important conversations and the magic and unexpected happen having these in-person events is so so important because that energy that we all create together when we share ideas when we debate things when we go a little bit deeper into some of the conversations around decentralization privacy and a whole host of different topics it's what makes this move forward and it's what makes us evolve when people get together and talk and get to understand stuff deeper then it just helps generate new ideas as well and it helps ethereum keep innovating i think it's like a really special energy that you don't see in a lot of places you can go to an event and find people from all over the world with different skill sets different interests and i think most importantly different ways of contributing to the protocol a lot of relevant governors with a lot of dow experience have gotten together here for many of them for the first time and they get to spend time together and this hopefully will catalyze processes that need like social bonds social viscosity to come through and that's important to us just because we never see these people in real life so our community we're the biggest community of web3 developers in the world just being able to see 165 projects come in a short amount of time in so many different categories from l2s to nfts to dows to core infrastructure and developer tooling bringing those people together now and making sure that they feel like they have the support or the feel like getting the feeling that they belong is what these events are designed for we have the opportunity to really rethink and reimagine how we interact financially socially and from a digitally native perspective community feeling the aspect of how we work together all around the world not even seeing each other you know being in the same office so that is very unique the whole decentralized aspect applies uh fundamentally to the layer zero to the community layer [Music] i really don't want to forget the fundamentals that are powering this industry privacy ownership uh self-sovereignty and i want to make sure that whatever we're building with ethereum with crypto with web3 that those fundamentals are upheld and that users are truly empowered and own their keys their data and and that they're at the center of the future that we're building for financial freedom we need to continue to figure out ways to make the protocol better make it more scalable make it more sustainable more secure all these things are important for not just the protocol itself abstractly but for the people that use it this event specifically is getting all these layer one researchers and contributors to clients together and getting them on the same page in terms of what do we want to work on what is important where are we going next so really staking is at soon to be at the core functionality of the entire ethereum network and there are various things that we need to pay attention to with respect to keeping ethereum decentralized ethereum can continue to grow and blossom as a platform that's more democratized i think than ever with l2s but only if the core principles are met more people now understand the different trade-offs facing l2s and then more people can use this knowledge for the betterment of the l2s and the ethereum ecosystem as a whole technology should just be developed in a way that's as open as possible and that people should have equal access to things there's a lot of opportunity for for the general public for the cultural workforce for the cultural community in general to actually maybe create alternatives to the systems that we currently have it brings so much freedom to our lives and it's like incredible for me to like see the opportunities that ethereum brings us [Music] ethereum is a shelling point for the hopeful it's a place where activists and entrepreneurs and thoughtful people can come together and build new systems we want to create new institutions that represent our values upgrade democracy for web scale build a financial system that's more oriented around our values and ethereum is a place where we have the tools and we have the ethos to make that happen take the green pill and on i don't think there is another community out there in which people are shipping innovating and thinking at this pace and that's really exciting to be part of if i have found someone who is into ethereum usually we can become friends and get along it feels like home a distributed home the energy is like huge and you can feel how passionate these people are it will change the world i'm very happy that the eth community is more open i mean it's one of the biggest communities it's it does so many amazing events around the world the ethereum community is full of very like optimistic and forward-looking people and it's like very refreshing it is the most fun research community and it's the most intellectually rewarding and it's the most open and i and i just love working in this community and contributing every time i contribute i receive 10x what i put in and i think it's a wonderful feeling this is an open community that's accepting of all people and that's really important to me because if you can accept all people and that they feel safe then they can build and create things that are open for other people to also feel safe and create what they want the ethereum community has been really really important to my growth and it will be important to the future growth of herdal this is above and beyond what we thought an event would be for us it's a part of giving back and it's a part of really seeing ethereum grow and blockchain grow and really spread the idea of blockchain and ethereum to the world all the hard work we've put in over the past four years just really come to fruition in an event like this see how happy students coming out of it are and how thankful they are meeting up with alumni of our boot camps and you know them thanking us of us helping them get jobs i really enjoy the decentralized values it's a growing ecosystem worldwide it's a growing community and i would love to be a part of it and i'm not a developer myself but this is a way for me to give back it's really important to the ethereum community to have these gatherings where we just come together with sort of the open mind to to see what comes out of it i think a lot of the biggest sort of innovations that have happened in the ethereum space have happened by accident because people are just in the right place at the right time with the right energy we need to talk to each other we need to work together as long as people can learn from each other and connect in real life we haven't had that for so long [Music]
