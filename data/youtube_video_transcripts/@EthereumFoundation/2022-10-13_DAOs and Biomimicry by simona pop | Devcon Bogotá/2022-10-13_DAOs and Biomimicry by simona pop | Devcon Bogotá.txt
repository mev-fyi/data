foreign [Music] obviously we're all here we all love technology we all love doing things very kind of well not always removed from nature but I think we tend to forget just how much experience Nature has in fact 3.8 billion years of kind of research and development when it comes to um being sustainable when it comes to being resilient when it comes to actually withstanding a hell of a lot of stuff and then sometimes we kind of you know we are humans we have a little bit of a touch of arrogance that we go actually we know better than that right or maybe we don't so biomimicry um for everybody who is just getting uh familiar with the concept or is hearing about it for the first time I'm sure there's a lot of people who are already really really into it like myself is the simulation of the model's systems and elements of nature and how we may apply them to solving complex human problems because let's remember we are also part of Nature and part of the ecosystem that is the broader broader ecosystem not the ethereum one which is also part of the ecosystem so you know um so then by proxy just to kind of land this uh parallel with biomeocrine Downs is what are our dowels there are these networks of humans organizing I mean you kind of know but this is you know it drives it home that actually complex flow networks in nature and Dows are really not that dissimilar and there's a big big correlation between them because this is a network and it does interact with each other with the different nodes that are part of it and it functions because of that so complex flow networks they exist everywhere right from the small to the broad in biology and we know this because we keep looking at things like mycelial networks and all of that but really they're everywhere right in every kind of ecosystem big and small and so from in these networks these connections between those nodes between the components and the interactions in the activities and states is what makes them function or not and thank you um and so similar to Dao's these interactions between cells organisms emerge from a predefined set of rules right and we saw earlier dows they are kind of connected because uh created upon a set of rules and then the decentralized process of self-organization because really there is no one unique cell that overrules them all right so that is in itself decentralization it's that interaction and those activities between those nodes and between those components that actually makes the system work and so here what we're really looking at in this kind of conversation of where by biomimicry endows might intersect might benefit um douse from biomimicry is what complex flow networks feature that we can mimic and then how can we be great nodes in that Network right so you have the individual and you have the collective always they cannot be without each other because nature as we've seen 3.8 billion years kind of makes that clear um so the bio Network mimicry we have these clusters so nodes existing clusters and it's all about that inter cluster and cross cluster communication and as we know again from daos we definitely have to get that right because you know we're definitely in the process and yesterday we were talking about this shelling point in panels there's definitely work a lot of work to be done there right and we it's fine we're in the process of of hopefully getting it right plasticity this is very very important parts of the network react faster than others and that is okay you do not have to have the same speed of reaction the same speed of interaction between all of them and wanting to do that is just going to set you up for not failure but just like it's gonna be hard let's make things less hard for ourselves and then feedback loops so any deviation in balance in an ecosystem will be corrected by this feedback loop because it will always create this balance of the opposite response to get it back on track so that's the bio Network then the node mimicry uniqueness diversity breeds strength and resilience always remember that let's stop homogenizing everything and this is something that drives me crazy is that we keep wanting at the level that we're in now where we have done a lot of work and we've kind of made a lot of successful strides in our mission to make this a reality we get to this point where we want to get the uh corporate model and let's make it all fit in a tiny little box let's stop doing that that's not good coordination is everything connecting and collaborating with other nodes is key again in my mind authentic self-interest is increasing connection not competition coordination everything and then balance the strong and weak connections again it is okay that some nodes aren't as strongly connected to others and that's fine and making sure that we essentially enable the environment for that to be true is very very important for us to have a healthy a healthy Network a healthy ecosystem because balance is not a static condition so getting to this point where as we've seen keeping everything in let's say not in line but keeping everything within a good rapport with the other means this it is a constant Dynamic state made of adjustments we again in the Dao space it's okay to change things as we notice that things are not necessarily working or are not necessarily getting us to where we need to be we need to be in that motion we need to be in that engaged equilibrium to be very aware of what we're doing and what we're kind of balancing out and again speaking of balance and bringing it back to Nature this is what nature does naturally it has this window of optimum viability that exists in the middle of diversity AKA resilience interconnectivity and deficiency it's in the middle that the sweet spot is that's where it lies excess resilience of course gives us stagnation think of a forest which is too much nothing more can grow but efficiency extreme efficiency leads to collapse you're making things brittle when you make it too efficient think of a man play like we reforestation and then we plant things in neat little rows and then you light a match and it'll go all goes like versus a jungle you set a match it'll probably not Advance as far right why because there's diversity because they're tall and short and this and that and a variety of species what we do when we get to the diversity and all of that we go straight to efficiency completely bypassing the middle completely bypassing the balance think austerity that's what that is we have a crash we have like some sort of uh unstable situation we go check we need to streamline this immediately because you know that's what we've always done well that is unnatural this is The Sweet Spot the window of optimum viability is in the middle so then what can we do with this Dynamic of okay nature is like that we're trying to build these things that are essentially hopefully going to replace a lot of what we have now and hopefully get us into a better place we have to emulate get that ethos of balance and of um diversity and efficiency sweet spot in the middle and then reconnect and the emphasis again is on learning and emulating these regenerative Solutions and hopefully translating them into this new economic system that we're trying to build because without it and without first unlearning actually learning yes but we first need to unlearn everything that we've kind of had drummed into us for so long that it has to be that way and there has to be this way and it has to be efficient and it has to cut out this and cut out that and cut out diversity and everything is homogenized we have to unlearn that and look into again what is always around us and what is always out there which is the balance which is the fact that diversity and uniqueness and collaboration and coordination are the things that make it run and we talk about sustainability so much yet again it's never going to work it's never going to work unless we understand that the way things are built is unnatural right now and we can do like gonna have all sorts of targets and whatever it's not going to happen and it starts with the monetary system but you know we're talking about does um and then what I suggest that we take and learn and bring into the Dow ecosystem into our crypto complex flow Networks are patterns behaviors and habits this is one of the things and it's it's my view it doesn't mean that it's right but I think creating patterns behaviors and habits will help us have a baseline almost like a skeleton almost like a the flow of veins that we have in our bodies right have that Baseline that that we can build upon that and we can add flesh to it and we can like move at movement and add different environments or behave and adapt to different environments but I believe that this we should maybe have this Baseline skeleton because then what happens is we can start looking at things not from a perspective of let's try how can we make this as efficient as possible but rather how can we make this move and exist in the healthiest way for the organism and what role does each node part play in its well-being because and this is Janine by Nancy uh you know she's the mother of biomimicry when we look at truly sustainable models the only one that has worked for so long is the natural world and I think again it's so easy to get carried away because we're constantly in this flow of more what we can do what can we do with more tooling yes let's put more Tooling in let's do this let's do this but why don't we just look and understand how maybe the information should flow who should it touch how should people interact with each other how should different clusters work streams whatever we want to call them how should they interact with each other should they have weak or strong connections is it okay that that one doesn't interact with the other and stop and move away from this pattern that has gotten us so used to and it is the corporate model that everything has to run exactly the same everybody has to behave exactly the same it is not a reality and it's not a natural state and that's the thing that maybe we can take pause and I always say this and I said it yesterday at trailing point that intention and setting that intention and figuring out how we approach this not from a streamline efficiency let's replicate the old stuff not falling to Too Much diversity because we saw that that causes stagnation Where is the Optimum window viability when we talk about Dallas and what we're building and this doesn't just apply to Dallas it applies to the monetary system it applies to everything or the what we're proposing with uh replacing the current monetary model and you can just pause and looking at what has worked and looking at what we can do is important in my view you may not agree that may be good um and that's it so I spoke really fast I've got like 10 minutes to go so if there are questions let me know yes how does it feel to be a good noun so I think I mean it's it's great um so I think I think that mindfulness and being mindful I think that's where it all starts and I think again one of the well I already started telling you guys what annoys me so let's continue so one of the things that essentially irks me about a lot of people coming into this ecosystem now and we've seen this before during bull markets this what happens is that people come in without a sense of humility approaching something new and I remember when I got and when I got started what is it now five years whatever long ago I was so in awe of what the potential of this was that I wanted to be very mindful in doing anything putting anything out there or using this technology to do something meaningful and impactful and moving things towards something that is a better health for the ego ecosystem and for the world my intention was always how can this make things better and I think that intention is really really important because that will Define what you're aiming for what your uh what your project is aiming for how you influence it because again the agency with great response whatever with great power comes great responsibility and that is true the agency that we all have and the power that we all have that is very very powerful and having the right intention make sure that the communication is better make sure that you understand that that should not necessarily move like this or should not necessarily be based on patterns that existed before but rather on patterns that will make it better and keeping yourself in check on that all the time and I get it's so tiring to do that which is why so many people don't do that and why I'm so tired but it's a big thing to try to do that and that's an exercise and it's important and it's good to do that again in my view any other questions so I have a yoga doll and I have the vision of creating a wellness metaverse so we can have a global yoga studio for yoga and meditation teachers onboarding the yoga Community is not easy Under the Umbrella of pushing them into a web 3 space because they are reasonably Tech resistant any suggestions thank you so this is comfortable actually so um we can sit in meditations so it's tough and and I understand it and I get it but then again I think It's So based on what we've been used to and the patterns of behaviors that we've almost been accustomed to because of the way it's been right and we also have okay let me let me start with a much more philosophical tidbit um any change involves loss people aren't afraid of change they're afraid of loss and going from what you're used to to something new involves you letting go of what was and that in itself and that will vary wild wildly and widely between people right and different people looking at things from different ways um you saying that reminds me of um one of my favorite projects and I remember it so well and I miss it we did a cleanup in the Philippines at the end of 2018 and we onboarded a group of fishermen's fishermen in Manila Bay onto your mobile wallets at the end of 2018. and it was weird and it was hard and it was an interesting feat in educating from a baseline of we earn money this way but we could earn it like this and tap into a whole new pool of resource but we're a community that has done this for generations and now you're suggesting that we do this from a completely in a completely different way from a completely different angle but guess what some of those guys ended up doing other tasks and earning more crypto once they were onboarded it all just takes a little nudge and actually the super simple um solution for you is learning by doing is the best way give them something give them something to do and show them how much more it could do easiest thing proof of concept show and tell the wisdom is so simple anyway but yeah give them something to do and show them figure out something very easy that they can do and then you know maybe they'll hate it but you'll know yeah anybody else yes uh so you've been talking about about information and communication um and a lot of the information for sustainability in nature is like sunlight and environmental like are there Predators around so what does that type of information look like for Dao's and how do we communicate it are you asking me who the sunshine endows is yeah you're looking at it um so I think but that's again something that you just map out right and it's okay that we don't know yet um I think to figure out how things flow and again how how things interact with each other is the mapping process right now we're at a stage where it's almost like we're defining and we're finding out what those things are and we're understanding what the relationships are because actually identifying what the elements are is always and most importantly followed by what the flow what the interactions are between them because like if you think of a lab and you do a culture of something right you want to grow some sort of bacteria or whatever it is that you want to grow you have to create an environment for it you have to create a soup of things for it to grow now if it doesn't grow it means that you messed up the soup the ingredients aren't in the right uh quantities they do not interact well with each other and they affect the organism and they make it grow misshapen or kill it identifying what the balance is of that soup is what we need and this is what we all need to figure out what that is what's the quantity of this what's the quantity of that how does that interact with that will they have like an explosive reaction or will they complement each other and that honestly that analogy of the lab is your the easiest thing to kind of wrap around and analogies are the best way to navigate all of this because otherwise you're like wait why how the hell are we gonna do this but it's that it's what are the ingredients and how they interact with each other is it going to be explosive and destructive or is it going to be nurturing and productive again in my opinion yes um so you gave the example of like my serial networks and um I think the closest parallel that we've created to that I think is like the internet um and if you look at mycelium and what kind of things it does in nature um the three main things like one is like uh information Communications like sending signals like stress signals between organisms and stuff like they get sent along these muscular networks uh and we kind of got that with the internet you know being this like Global Information Network um the second purpose is like Distributing like resources or like you know Carbon so trees a lot of the energy they get from photosynthesis actually goes back through the mycl networks to other organisms in exchange for something else so there's like a value exchange Network um through this mycl network and then we got that with ethereum um you know now we can have a Global Network of value exchange the third thing that my CL networks do that we haven't really like figured out or it hasn't like manifested in any way is like decomposition mycl networks are the way in which like things that die get decomposed in the nutrients of those things get like redeployed back into the system and that process is how nature is kind of like iterated and evolved and improved and how you know there's no concept of waste in nature waste is like a human invention um you know everything in nature kind of decomposes and gets recycled and reused so I'm wondering do you have any like ideas or thoughts on like what that could look like in Dallas and you know which bit the decompasses yeah like decomposition like if we did information distribution with internet and value distribution with ethereum what's the next thing that gets such a composition I'll try to keep this for you because I have like 30 seconds 30 29 no um so I'll just count it down and not say anything but I think the easiest thing there is things don't make it they just don't not everything like it's in such a natural flow that some things will die and most things will die but what do you get the nutrient the learning that can be the nutrient that you take out of it and then in a new organism you apply that and you make it better and you make it more resilient and that's the evolution of it right because it learns what it's adapted to and what it does and how it then uses it to thrive and what killed that other organism may make this one Thrive because you're applying it in a different way and maybe you were just changing one small thing and it makes it like that soup in the lab you change one tiny thing and maybe then the organism thrives and the other thing that I was going to say about the internet and I know that I'm over time um is right now what we have with it with the Internet is that it is not intentional people have to participate in it right they have to in the beginning people wanted to now you have to and what that does is it removes responsibility from the equation and I was just at watching the Snowden keynote at the ZK house he said this if you're in a mall you don't really care about cleaning up after yourself you don't have that instinct of responsibility because you're there because you have to like shop for something or whatever in the new go away the agency and bringing back the agency to the people who make up the network who are the nodes maybe that's what helps also in the organism thriving so yeah that's thanks everyone thank you so much Simona for sure there's a lot of stuff to figure out about human coordination but thank you I really like your point of view thank you so much so in a couple of minutes we're going to talk about the future of web 3 ux so see you in after four minutes thank you
