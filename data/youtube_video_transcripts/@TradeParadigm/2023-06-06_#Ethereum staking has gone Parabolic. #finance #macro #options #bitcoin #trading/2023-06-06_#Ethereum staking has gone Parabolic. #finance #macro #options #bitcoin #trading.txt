since the Shanghai Fork you know you now have this increased withdrawal flexibility and Eve has seen a significant increase in the percentage of State deep which is now 18.75 of total Supply to capture this roughly six percent apy from staking with a validator so just looking at these charts you know each staking has seen significant net inflows since the Shanghai Fort I remember remember all the fud that we were hearing you know once that withdrawal flexibility was allowed if we were going to see a lot of people rush into the exit and you know we really haven't seen that and on a cumulative basis you know the amount of ethereum state and the amount of validators has just gone parabolic right so my opinion as well is like the inability to you know warehouse this stuff is eat is increasingly becoming this yield asset which I think is increasing the marginal propensity to sell Vol against one state to eat
