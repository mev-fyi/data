hello welcome to the big picture the Paradigm show where we talk about macro markets as well as micro Market structure today David Joe and I are joined by Greg the co-founder of our action co-founder and CEO of g-ball which was recently acquired by Amber data uh where he now sits as the Director of derivatives so welcome to the show thanks so much happy to be here thanks Greg actually uh for those that don't know uh what amber data is or what you guys offer can you provide us with like a little bit of background yeah definitely so it's basically like a holistic crypto data platform so the Amber data company before we got acquired offered um Market data like spot data from a bunch of different exchanges gdax Gemini so on so forth as well as blockchain data that's all tagged and parsed so you can see like ethereum blockchain data as well as some other chains um and then you could check out like contract events and stuff like that and then they did offer some derivatives but now now that they acquired us they essentially sort of triple down on that Division and now we offer some pretty extensive uh Futures and in option State as well that's awesome actually I remember when you guys first launched I might have been one of your first customers at g-ball nice that's awesome no yeah I mean it's a it's a truly fantastic product not like trying to toot your horde or anything but like you know I'm looking at it every day and we hear a ton of feedback from our customers you know we hear that like your API uh your API feeds are like top top notch so yeah congratulations there and we look forward to keep using the product and you know see you guys continue to build it out oh thanks so much Joe yeah sort of uh part of the thinking behind it was my backgrounds as a Trader as a proprietary Trader so a lot of thinking are tools that I would use myself um that was kind of the inspiration for for starting it but I really appreciate that guys yeah actually could you um go over your background really quickly for for people who don't know you yeah totally so I started trading in 2008 just kind of as a retail with uh will Warren who actually co-founded zero X me and them were best friends growing up and so I started trading like the stock market and started learning about options and then a couple years into it I got hired by a family office to do some prop trading on their book so while I was in college I was doing that and then I read uh Mike belafire's book one good trade he's the co-founder of SMB capital super super good book highly recommend it ended up doing an internship at SMB capital and going through the program and making friends with a lot of Traders on that desk and after graduating college I came out to Chicago to trade uh treasury future so Australian treasury basis trading Cash treasuries versus Futures treasuries did that a chopper and then did that at drw as well and then joined the options brain desk at drw and then in late 2015 I decided to go crypto full-time so I actually quit drw to trade my own book in crypto and then have been doing that ever since and I still do that now and then January 2020 me and my co-founder Pat Doyle decided to build Genesis volatility which was pretty much uh crypto options analytics that I had built in Excel VBA um Pat has got a really good data science background and we have a sort of a team that was ready to go who are really good sort of Engineers to kind of migrate from Excel VBA to an actual application so so actually that kind of segues nicely talking about option data into what Joe has for us today so Joe if you want to go over uh some some options data for us yeah yeah absolutely let me let me just share my screen quickly since we since we officially launched um the big picture and it was certainly quite a timely launch right after FTX one of the main things we've been focusing on is how does the crypto option market look different like not not just from like the aspect of like oh this is what Volcan term structures are doing but like more so like the microstructure right like yes volumes are one part of it but like what has happened with you know by side taker Demand versus maker Supply I have some people step back uh has some people stepped up so today I want to continue this and we ran some really interesting analysis uh over this past week to basically look at the composition of Paradigm flows over the year and then how they've changed more more recently on FTI uh after FDX happens so the main takeaway as you guys see on the screen so inner dealer option flow as a percentage of Paradigm volume is easily at 2022 highs which is driven certainly by FTX so like on last week's big picture we discussed the lower bias I take your interest since FTX and how do option Market was feeling a little bit more inner dealer than before but I think it's helpful for viewers to explain what is what is it exactly does that mean when I say like the market is is more inner dealer effectively what it is is you know more buy side takers so like hedge funds family offices High net worth individuals those guys sitting on a Sidelines and then a higher proportion of Paradigm volumes occurring directly between market makers so I discussed last week this is how it felt right but what the data actually tells us could be very different from how we feel you know given confirmation bias and things like this so we wanted to quantify Paradigm interdealer flow before and then after FTX so moving to the next slide so what is an inner dealer trade an interdealer trade is where both the maker and the taker on that trade on Paradigm operate Market making deaths as their Core Business you know going back to like you know Greg being at drw let's say Genesis trades against drw their core businesses are Market making businesses but in order to hence you know result in risk of OTC or you know maybe taking views around their Market making book you know drw could as act as a taker on an options trade against Genesis a non-inter dealer trade would be your traditional hedge fund or family office you know trading against that market maker so what we did is we looked at the population um of paradigms Trades over the course of 2022. so there were 74 around 74 000 option crosses in the year 2022. and when we classified these as interdealer or non-interdailer per the definitions that you see that you see on the screen and then from there we calculate the inner dealer USD notional as a percentage of the total Paradigm volume so we do this in every every month of the year so you can see here you know and then December is month to date so you'll see you know the media it's kind of around you know high 20s low 30s is kind of where it rests but then you see what has happened in December and that number has spectacularly shot up almost a 45 so in your dealer flow as a percentage of Paradigm volume is 43 and a half percent which is the highest of 2022. which is a massive jump right so like even if we can show this on a chart right here so typically it's around 28 to 30 December boom it's really really shot up and sure there's some caveats here like this percentage is certainly going to partially chalk up to you know it's the end of the year right by side clients you know close their book for the year it's been a tiring year right like people you know going on vacation and just going away stepping away closing down the books and getting back started and in q1 next year and sure we're only halfway through the month so you know we'll we'll see how this how this changes as we as we approach the holidays as well but a jump this High you know potentially suggests that there is a structural change that is going on you know in the crypto option markets at least for the shorts of the medium term so it's interesting because in November I'll just go back here quickly right you you can make the argument like well FTX happened on November 8th right at the beginning of the month why was the November data holistically still a low percent you know compared to December in terms of inner dealer flow well a big part of this is in the aftermath of FTX you know taking those are going to be forced to to unwind the risk from you know from exchanges or manage their Physicians why which is why that November 2022 number is at 30 half 30 and a half percent which is roughly in line with the 2022 meet median but now you fast forward to December right and we see it we see all the flows that like the biggest institutional guys are trading in crypto option and there is very little interest right now to add risk and then there's also very minimal need to reposition because realize all like on Tuesday the seven day realized ball was less than s p like I mean Greg's been around the block that's crazy you know is that the fact that it's this low and we talked about um last week you know why why this might be and like sure you know the balls are very low but like that's just due to like largely an apathy in the market you know people just aren't trading right um so the question is from here like what's what's going to happen right like our buy side taker is going to come back or like or are people still very concerned around you know custody and until until Solutions like that can be figured out like we uh we mentioned like copper as a potential solution um on last week's podcast we're like are we going to be basically kind of sitting on our hands we're like crypto really doesn't do anything until like the macro continues to improve like with what David will will certainly talk about and then we actually get that bull market run the next bull market run and then the interest comes back um but until then you know are we in a new normal uh maybe I hope not it's certainly not good for the market you know it's never really good when you know you don't really have a lot of buy side takers adding risk and then you just have market makers trading you know term structure and skew of one another at like close them is like that's not a recipe for people you know to make money and want to stay engaged um but yeah we'll we'll see where it goes we'll continue to continue to monitor this data you know through q1 and you know hopefully that this percentage goes back down to uh you know that median of 28 30 yeah Greg actually I want to uh jump in really quick and get your take on that as someone like Joe said who's been around the block a little bit like what what are you seeing right now when you're looking at the data and when you're looking at crypto option markets so kind of just commenting on the ball and something that Joe just touched on so after the FTX kind of blow it happened I was very like I don't want to sell Ball even though it's high a lot of my thinking is like this Ball is mean reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one to carry and when ball is high it's almost better to buy it because something might actually happen and when the ball is low it's actually one of the times that's the most expensive and we see that right now like you can see if you look on the chart on the right hand side you can see the variance risk premium being really wide in most of December and that's a low ball environment and people are willing to bet that something's going to happen and it's going to mean revert but they're prepaying for that right and so it ends up being one of like the best trades and so I kind of think nothing happens until year end to me that's the most logical thing to happen there's a lot of seasonality holidays the big numbers are behind us it's kind of coast is clear until the year end I think 2023 who knows I one of the big themes in my mind is that we're going from a environment where it's easy money to an environment that's not easy money and this is the first time crypto has traded in that transition and so we'll see how that goes but that's kind of how I'm thinking about it and what I'm seeing involved right now yeah yeah it certainly seems to be the view from you know the Paradigm uh community that for the rest of the year that yeah it's just ball is just going to be in the dull drops like we saw some guys you know you know certainly you know people won't like you know buying up a ton of gamma into you know the very highly anticipated you know CPI or uh fomc uh well but there was some right like people weren't going to be leaning you know too too short into this uh but since that like like yesterday afternoon this morning people have just been absolutely dumping you know like to December 23rd and December 30th buckets right I mean you look on this picture on this left right December 23rd is now trading at 35. it's trading around 35 right I mean I've never seen it out loud I mean I've only been like really involved in crypto crypto ball for around a year but like you know pretty pretty insane to me uh but then again you Marcus not realizing right like it's it's very it's very easy to just look at a chart own applied balls at all time lows but then you kind of realize why that is and like you know realize sucks and you know there's a reason why real life sucks because there's a lot of apathy in the market and you know people just really aren't trading so I I tend to agree with correct that it's going to be quiet for the remainder of the year which is why I got my holiday sweater on them Joe is there a trade there that that makes sense to kind of um take advantage of like the short-term um sort of low Vol but still be positioned obviously there's so many risks around still um that things could blow up like you know calendar spreads or anything like that are there trades that you look at that you think that that that could work pretty well that kind of covers you in this this sort of the front end vowels but but also if things do blow up yeah yeah so so one thing that we've seen a lot of our customers doing and I think that makes three that makes sense like it's very easy to say like oh Boulder at the world's just straight out right pots but like real life sucks and like Carrie is just pretty nasty I mean you I mean you've seen even just after the event how much like the implied realized ball spread has really really come in but what's interesting actually when you look at skew uh whoops sorry guys but you look at skew right like of course like skew has has come in quite a bit but like when you look at the level of skew so when I say to you like the the difference between the implied balls in this case you know of the 15 Delta put versus the 15 Delta call when we look at what that value is relative to the absolute level of implied balls where we're at which is based basically all-time lows it still is like fairly steep so when I think about like put spreads like you know ideally you know I would I would have the ability to basically look at the you know the 90 put versus you know maybe the 85 put because what I care about is more so the downsides to you but I'm just kind of using the you know the 15 Delta put call as as a proxy that SKU is still fairly steep in which case you know when balls are low and uh you know the SKU is still relatively steep for that environment and you know Carrie is certainly an issue you definitely want to reduce some of that so I think I think post spreads are likely the way to go um I wouldn't be I mean we've seen some of it but I mean I'm not a big fan of you know the one by two selling uh you know two of the downside you know at this at this point you know those those short Vega trades when implied balls are at what 35 40 I don't know that doesn't really make sense to me um but I think threats probably make the most sense right here so something like a um um you know a January a January a January like 95 90 put spread I would need to really look at the payouts to kind of see what would what would make sense but you know something like that probably screens pretty good yeah one one by two is used to be like bread and butter but actually I would like to um you get thrown up do you get blown out yeah my man I've been blown out other ways nfts yeah I got I got blown out some nfts but but not uh not one by twos not yet anyway um but actually I would like to pose the same question to Greg like Greg what are you doing right now um hey what like in this environment yeah so I got a couple things on Beto which is like the Bitcoin Futures ETF and so what I have there is I do actually have a diagonal uh January March long to March puts short of January puts I put that on a few weeks back or maybe about four weeks back and my thinking there was we still had pretty high volt in the short dated stuff and I kind of think 2023 is going to be nuts so my thinking is fall dies down in the front months and then something happens in March and then I actually own some outright this is just a Delta bias but just some big Beto June puts at 11 which are pretty much you know a couple cents in the money that's just that's just pure Delta I I basically think like Bitcoin has to test lower levels it wouldn't make sense to me that it doesn't oh that hurts um sorry Greg what's what's your main what's your main rationale for that just basically the fact that we're going from like a an easy money environment to uh sort of a restrictive money environment and sort of the risk premium that you used to have from like you know basically lending out stable coins and in the crypto space like earning nine percent and the 10-year treasury was earning one percent and now the 10-year treasury is earning four percent or a little shy of that but you know give or take and so and then a lot of the stable coin lending trades have blown up so I just think there's there's so much unknown that I wouldn't want to be at this pivotal moment uh long crypto right now I think easy money has found its way into like speculative assets and I really like crypto and I totally believe in like the fundamentals but I think short-term speaking like there's probably just more downside yes it's interesting um right and look I'm not I'm not running a I'm running a hedge fund where I need to re report like a nav to my investors you know we're evaluation my investors you know once a month right like if I have the view of that like crypto is going to be higher you know two years from now like sure there might be more downside down to 12 but you know if we two years from now for backup of even 30 or 40 like I don't care you know being able to being able to pick the bottoms is you know certainly easier said than done for sure uh Joe do you I'll cut this part out but do you have any more on any more slides you want to go through well I'm uh I'm all good um I'll let David take it away sir there's certainly a lot to talk about there but by the way I've got I can hear you guys all right um I've got this complete Distortion in terms of like you're delayed in terms of when I'm seeing you speak um oh shoot it'll be okay we'll fix it in in post so hopefully yeah we'll be able to fix it your opinion it sounds like a great second yeah it's a little bit different it is a little bit different um I mean I I guess that's a good segue into sort of speaking a little bit about what I'm thinking on the macro um I I mean it's curious Greg because you said about um you know your downside bias being about we sort of moving into this regime of tired of money right um I I've kind of been off the view and I'm of the view that that's what we've been trading this year right we've seen probably the sharpest tightening cycle in all recorded history uh from the FED um and and particularly when you look at in terms of percentages from where we've come from um definitely the tightening tightest um cycle we've seen um I I kind of think we're and a theme that I've been talking about for the last few weeks is this kind of I'm kind of sensing this underlying uh shift in the macrodynamic where we're actually moving away from pricing that tightening to now now kind of pricing what comes next and there's a lot of talk about you know pivot pause and I'm kind of like I think that misses the point for me and the point is we've spent all of this year pricing this tightening cycle it's been super aggressive and we're now coming towards the end of that right so I mean we had the FED last night um I mean markets have kind of sold off in the back of it I I kind of felt the bar would be pretty high for him to be hawkish I actually think it's a bit of a knee-jerk around it but but my kind of takeaway was like they're going to run the hiking cycle in June right in in March right they pretty much said that um they they it looks like they're gonna go go the terminal rate's going to be I think they've got like 5.1 so a bit higher than what they said and then they're going to keep it there longer but then like they're curiously in 2024 they see 100 bips being sort of slashed off of that that cycle but that's all kind of okay semantics the FED are typically wrong with their four cars so they're kind of not really worth too much to pay too much attention to uh but the takeaway for me is like look we are now pricing the end of this hike cycle which comes in March pretty much um how long they keep it there whatever I I think basically markets now start pricing this transition to the end of the hike cycle and then to when they start cutting and what I'm looking at which I think is interesting and I've been talking about is the daughter's starting to sell off rates look like they've topped out um even after yesterday and I know when this little risk off today um 10 year yields have come lower two year yields are coming lower so the Dynamics changed where it was kind of the rates Market was kind of leading the sell-off assets as as yields were going higher and we're trading the inflation trade we're now pricing the kind of recession trade we kind of peak inflation we had that soft CPI number the other day that's kind of kind of fed the idea that we're past the peak inflation hump and we're now that we're now worried about growth and recession but that's a vastly different um sort of the impact cross-asset is vastly different when we're pricing growth risks to inflation risks so what that means for me is essentially duration starts to perform and we're seeing that right 10-year yields are coming lower they've kind of stalled a little bit and they've been a little bit volatile around this level but I feel they're going to break lower so long durations to start to perform 10-year 30-year yields come lower and I kind of think that's that's really important for for crypto because ultimately crypto is the longest duration asset so I think the rate Dynamics change quite a lot um I I also think if you look at um from a liquidity perspective I kind of think we're at the sort of lows in liquidity provision to these markets or what's been drained out of them um the reasoning for that I mean M2 growth has collapsed uh this year um and and that that that tends to start to sort of bottom as economies start to hit recession because we start to see easier easier policy uh China credit impulse is ramping up and that tends to be a bit of a lead on M2 growth as well um so I just think you're starting to see that even within um so the FED for all their Q QT you're starting to see um some of the money that's parked in the reverse repo right we've got over two trillion parked every night at the FED because the high money market rates that's now starting to be teased out and come back into the market so you've got the reserve repo sort of starting to come down only slowly at the moment but it's coming down um you've got ahead of the um a headless the debt ceiling you've got the treasury are kind of running down their balance at the fed the TGA the treasury general account at the Fed so to keep it really easy for our listeners if RRP is going up if the TGA is going up that's kind of a draining of liquidity as those things are coming down you kind of adding liquidity and we've seen those things coming down so I kind of think liquidity is improving I think um we're gonna see sort of the dollar selling off it is again is kind of easier Financial conditions so I kind of think we're going to be in a better liquidity environment into 2023 than what we've we've had to suffer throughout 2022 so I've been intensively saying look I think we could be at the lows here I think what drives us lower in crypto is going to be um another blow up you know more their bodies floating out um from the post FTX and you know there's a lot of fudge going around at the moment still uh which is again natural once you've had um an event like we have so I think if anything drives drives another push lower I think it's going to come from um something like specific to crypto and and someone else blowing up and just that kind of um false selling Dynamic um that that's kind of been weighing on things I I actually think the macro is has changed as we start to price the end of this cycle uh this hike cycle and there's signs that the liquidity um Cycles turning higher as well so I I think we'll be in a lower rate environment as in years across the curve come lower I think duration rallies and I think that ultimately supports us here in crypto um and maybe sets us up for the next move higher yeah that's super interesting and I actually don't disagree on the duration part of it I just think that it may be duration is a good buy from the different angles so my thinking is like raising rates especially really fast like we did there's a lag between when you raise rates and when it impacts interest rate sensitive Industries so there's a little bit of a lag there and we can see actually duration outperformed because of recessionary forces so I just kind of Wonder like for example the I just bought this house uh in July of 2021 and my rate's 275 and right now the 30-year rates over seven and I just think you know what happens when like the housing market starts starts to slow down uh obviously construction is a very uh interest rate sensitive uh factor of the economy and I also think as long as the unemployment rate is low like that definitely gives leverage to the FED to do whatever it wants like once the unemployment rate starts to tick up now you sort of got to make a decision I don't think we're there yet and I think that can actually like who knows I I don't know much about inflation or calculating CPI at all like that that is not my strength so you know I'm talking a little bit beyond my pay grade on on this but you know why couldn't um just the low unemployment rate keep wages high and keep them competitive and at and at that point like the FED is still even if they don't raise rates but just hold them longer you're still discounting future cash flows and that still has an impact and I think at some point there has to be some sort of like tick up in unemployment that does make duration a good buy and I also think just from a technical perspective the way that Bitcoins like performing right now doesn't provide a lot of confidence in me like we traded down to 20 . 20 was a big level for a long time it was like the 2017 High everyone's looking at that level we broke through it and then we get back to it and just the flat lines and then we break 20 and we're at 15 and now we're kind of flatlining give or take a few grand here as well no one's like jumping in hence first to buy this Market I don't know it just it doesn't have a lot of confidence in me it does like provide a lot of confidence yeah I I I I and I I see that and I think one of the things we're battling at the moment is this negative flow Dynamic right because you're still getting a lot of full selling um and as as we kind of unpick the bones from from FTX you know we still wait and see what's going to happen with Genesis so so you know you and there's been a lot of people hurt right though I've had to unwind businesses unwind positions so I think the flow Dynamic is still negative right that's kind of weighing but if you look across like NASDAQ you know s p like other kind of risk assets over the last sort of months or so um right and then back low but but we you know we had a decent rally um it's kind of stalled out a little bit now but but that looks a lot more sort of positive I mean what what from these CPI number back last month we had a really sort of decent rally and then we've kind of held uh it looked like we were going to push on uh the other day and then the FED have kind of killed that a little bit so I think other asset classes started to pull and I say the dollar for me is always key to everything and the old FX guy I always think the dollar sniffs out regime change and and also like it's the dollar wrecking ball right it it causes problems it sucks liquidity out of all markets um and weighs on everything and the daughter's selling off uh quite a bit so I mean put another way in and I'd ask you Greg maybe like if we didn't have FTX and given where like NASDAQ and other stuff trade given where dollars trading I mean where do you think ethereum or Bitcoin would be right now if it wasn't for the Ft expert because it it looked it looked early November that we were about to really start breaking out uh to to better levels right yeah that's a good point I I don't know I still think consolidation and I totally agree with you on the dollar I think the dollar is a big stress point globally speaking like if I just look at a dollar Yen that's Japanese macro is my favorite thing in the world most indebted country in the world interest rates go to a couple percent can't even cover interest costs alone with all the tax revenue that is like the ticking Time Bomb of the world of the western world so you need to you need a dollar to come down so that situation gets better you can't have the Yen trade at 250 dollar Yen but we're seeing the dollar come off because like also the ECB is raising rates and so you know maybe that's part of the interplay um it might it might be like sort of sort of uh deflationary interest rate hikes in abroad that are affecting that dollar trade totally agree with you if the dollar comes off that's really good for the more bullish perspective under risk assets side just technically speaking um or like on the technical analysis perspective I don't like this s p chart I it's to me is still clearly in the downtrend I mean we're at a top of a range of a downtrend but it's not chart I would be wanting to buy yeah and it's um and it's always I mean we've spoken on here it's always difficult as well when you're trying to call a bottom on stuff um it's it's you know so it can be a thankless task and and again it's for me it's you know I I still kind of feel like we've seen a low certainly in crypto I kind of felt that way um I'm surprised actually post FTX we didn't make new lows and in in certainly in ethereum Bitcoin um so I think that's kind of encouraging but to say I I do think I do think like it's just stepping back that we're looking at quite a different macro environment where we're going into a world where we're going to start looking at the end of hike cycles and then starting to think about about the cuts that come you've already got the euro dollar curve his pricing in uh you know Cuts I think 125 basis points of cuts through the end of next year and when we start pricing that I just think things look a little bit different um and then look we're going to be a little bit data dependent I mean looking at inflation again without going too much into depth around that but the three things are fair are kind of looking at they're looking at sort of goods inflation looking at housing data and and the housing parts and then core Services X housing the core the core Services X housing is a bit they're really focused on because they've kind of acknowledged that we're in a good disinflation environment and now Supply chains have eased um housing they've kind of acknowledged that that's a massive lagging uh input the way they calculate it and I own an equivalent rent um and so it's quite clear that that's going to drop out numbers um so so in fact um you know if you actually took out the housing sort of part we're actually we've actually been looking at sort of a deflation in the US so there's lots of signs that inflation's actually going to fall pretty sharply and once they start taking out those things yeah to your point I I point taken labor market still looks pretty strong although again that's probably the most lagging indicator and I always say that the housing market is the like up the elevator down down the uh up upstairs down the Elevator Shaft um in terms of you know when when companies make Cuts they do it in big sways and then they hire more slowly uh so I think the cuts are coming a lot of um you know activity data and that would suggest that's that's in the pipeline as well so I I think um I mean and then what does that mean for risk and then crypto is a high beta risk gasket so yeah there's lots of things at play I I just think the macrodynamic has changed I think the daughter's telling us that and I think the fact that duration looks like it's going to really start to rally and rates and yields are going to come lower I I think that's a more supportive environment that potentially allows us to call a bottom on this stuff yeah well that that's awesome I mean you definitely know your yeah like you say the rate Cuts happening but like is this because like yeah I think it matters like are we gonna be engineering a soft Landing or is like is this just going to be like every other recession right like I mean I look at I mean just look at the revisions on the summary of economic projections right like the core pce the September projection has gone from 3.1 to 3.5 the unemployment has gone up as well like there's been a very downbeat four gas on the labor force participation rate so like I look at I look at these projections and like so Jeffries has a forecast out they said that you know given like the labor force situation rate I mean they're forecasting 1.6 million job losses next year right like that's very significant with like no rate Cuts or you know no no rate movement that's what they're saying so like I don't know I just think it's going to be difficult and like if we're cutting rates because like we're going into recession like there's I don't think that the boss is in just yet um but you know once we do sort of establish that then then yes we can start going up again like I I it's very hard for me to wrap around like okay we're gonna go into a rate cut environment and then like set a table we get everything under control right sure like inflation is moderating but like if it moderates around like four and a half five percent where it is or whatever right like I don't think that's gonna be enough for them so like they done and then rate Cuts can come from the recession that that's the point that I'm stuck on yes I'm with you yeah I I guess and this is maybe a controversial I guess but as a macro guy it took me a long time to go over this post 2008 the idea that we're now more function of rates and liquidity and I think people obsess over like recessions or not I I I I I got bullish risk like mid-2020 when the FED come out and said we're doing unlimited QE and I've kind of been waiting for that moment for a lot of years um because like the next time the next time we have a crisis and the FED come out doing unlimited QE I'm just getting along everything right and and I did it and I remember when I did it and talking to other hedge fund guys and they thought I was nuts they were like but we we're going to be facing the deepest recession post-war time recession right you know we're looking at depression territory the world is sharp um how the hell can you be bullish here because because we're a function of race and liquidity and and it's as simple as that we got we got the recession all right it was short-lived and we got the v-shape or whatever um but markets markets ramp to write record highs pretty quickly as well because they just turn the liquidity hose on it and rates went to zero pretty quick so I'm kind of of that view and um I I think the FED have created that unfortunately um where they've artificially inflated assets the bank of England you know only a few weeks ago were back in intervening in the guilt market so um yeah I I just I just feel like recession's not the big risk-off but I think the big risk off if you want to think markets price ahead of themselves I kind of feel like we've priced it a little bit and uh and once we're in a mode where we're pricing easier policy and more liquidity um then I I kind of think you're going to see a lot of these assets recover and 2023 looks a lot better than than we've we've looked in 2022 yeah yeah the me too but talking my own book here big time maybe we need it we're exhausted man uh anecdotally talking about Labor markets and stuff if we do happen to lose a million jobs um next year or whatever whatever the projection was uh I know of five McDonald's around me that are paying 18 an hour right now 18 to 25 an hour so if you want to work at McDonald's you can uh we'll have jobs somewhere um so let me get your final thoughts on what's going on if you could sum up what you what you just went over in a couple sentences David um go for it yeah so I I think my my final takeaway um even after the FED is that we're moving into a macro environment where we're going to be pricing the end of the FED hike cycle um possibly uh pricing Cuts since of Thailand next year so I think the rate Outlook looks different it looks like duration's starting to perform so yields are coming lower the Dollar's selling off um and it looks like because of all of that the liquidity cycle is changing as well and turning higher so I kind of think we're at at or near the bottom of the liquidity cycle which I think turns higher and then I therefore think risk assets generally and particularly High beta crypto is going to perform better throughout 2023 cool Greg final thoughts go well I like uh David's 2020 call about the unlimited QE I think that definitely makes a lot of sense I think we're in this environment that we've just done that a couple years ago and so the the FED balance sheet is like eight trillion dollars or whatever it is David is that the right number yeah yes it's around that right so I I think we're in that position where we already have like just liquidity out there and and until we have a real receptionary move or like a spike in unemployment or anything like that we can allow them to like roll off their balance sheet and contract a little bit I think that's part of the picture I think The Faculty race rates so fast has a lagging effect we'll see how that plays and then lastly I do think there's a a turning point as well in the globalization like we're going from a globalized world to a declobalization world who knows how to affects everything so I just think there's a lot of moving parts and I don't like this Bitcoin chart at all I just I don't want to buy it um Greg just turn it the other way turn upside down yeah Joe go for it yeah in my in my view as I mentioned uh on the beginning chart right inter dealer option flows are certainly dominating most of the crypto options market right now and to kind of segue onto what Greg and David said you know maybe that doesn't change until you know the macro environment does get a bit easier um whether that's due to a soft Landing or you know our landing and then where we get into the new to the next fall cycle so you have that as a as a potential overhang and you know people not wanting to really step into the asset class you know especially if it's your first time doing it um but also um certainly a lot of like the custody sort of issues um that we've previously discussed until we can figure out that problem with centralized exchanges or until enough time has passed where people feel comfortable enough to get their toe back into the pool uh this could potentially be the new normal for a while uh I don't have a crystal ball uh we'll see we'll monitor the data we'll let you know so you can't Joe you can't not be bullish when you're wearing that jumper man we might be the only crypto company in New York that is hosting a holiday party I would imagine most of most have canceled so I guess we'll at least have that going marketing budget is so bad that's that's good that's awesome well guys this is a lot of fun thank you so much Greg for coming on taking the time to hang out with us and um I guess that's the show
