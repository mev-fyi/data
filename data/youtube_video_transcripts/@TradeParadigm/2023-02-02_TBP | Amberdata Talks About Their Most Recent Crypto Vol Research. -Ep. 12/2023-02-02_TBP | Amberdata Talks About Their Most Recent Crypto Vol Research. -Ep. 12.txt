welcome to the big picture where we talk about micro markets as well as macro markets today I have with me of course my co-host David Brickell David how's it going yeah and Joe Crue and I said that right didn't I yeah I've been it's like it's like we're actually co-workers now right yeah like we actually know each it's only it's it's only been what two months yeah exactly Joe when I first just saw you just now I thought you were in a robe it's like you're wearing a wife you've been on so many holidays [Laughter] Joe's at the spa exactly must be nice um and we also have with us and two amazing guests um from Amber data so actually Greg you've already been on the show but could you give us you know your brief background again for people who might not have seen the first one yeah totally so uh my name is Greg magadini my background is as a proprietary Trader I've been training for about 13 years I got into crypto around 2013 uh and then bought the top and a thousand dollar Bitcoin and wrote it all the way down about experience um and then traded crypto kind of full-time and started in 2015 2016 and then uh co-founded g-ball in January 2020 with my co-founder uh Pat Doyle cool perfect and Fabio yeah I'm I'm Fabio basani in Twitter gravity sucks an account that maybe you you know and uh I have background in economics and statistics and uh I would always be being passionate about finance and trading even if it may start in Korea I was in another sector uh in 2013 with a friend we we both our first Bitcoin and uh my friend was libertarian I was libertarian we study a lot of the Australian school of Economics so we approached Bitcoin from that point of view and later on with the passionate about uh trading options and together we started to invading at the uh at the University he was working at the University at that at that time and then uh in 2019 I be I did the a leap I I quit my corporate job I've become a full full-time Trader in 2020 21 in 2000 2021 yeah I know 2020 I met Anan Gomez that introduced me also also Greg and we started our collaboration since then so I'm really happy and satisfied to be here after my life not straight we arrived here but uh happy to to be here that that's amazing that's amazing so Joe I didn't realize you were gravity sucks um I replied to you earlier uh you posted up the um massive uh Bitcoin structure um that went through on Paradigm earlier and and I I yeah I replied to you I didn't realize that was you there you go wow I just I just learned that now too like we we had we had we had this gravity sucks guy was just some you know some random dude that was active in the market I didn't know it was I was talking to the to this person out I've had extensive conversations with all right I was I was very private with my account but now with uh with Greg with uh with the Amber data stuff I I disclosure my my account and here we go yeah I I so I think I've been talking to you since or I mean we've kind of somewhat interacted since you started gravity sex because I'm I'm variant Research on Twitter so we've we've had interactions for a while but so it's kind of uh it's nice to meet you in person yeah it's it's kind of cool that way like crypto is cool that way I've been at different like crypto events and you meet people that you've talked to for years but you just don't know uh because exactly everyone's kind of anonymous you know for the most part um but yeah I guess why we're here is because you guys wrote this report and um everyone's been really fascinated by it uh not actually texted me right away and was like we gotta have we gotta have Greg back on to talk about this report that they just put out um so Greg I mean I guess you could start us off probably and share your screen walk us through this port and kind of what you guys found out through this research yeah absolutely I just want to give a shout out to these other co-authors so uh Tony Stewart obviously who does the darebit insights for darebit Tony's been an advisor for I think like 18 months now he's been a total G he's been great Fabio and Tony are always like analyzing flow we have this internal Direction and they're always auditing their flow together to make sure that our directions are properly attacked so that's very cool Sammy chapal from Ledger Prime he's been a an OG contact since the early days of of g-ball and so it's been great to work with him he did all the back tests for the back tested strategies here and obviously the man who needs no introduction which is Ewan Sinclair who actually is my neighbor in Chicago I had no idea until he became an advisor and he signed a paperwork and I saw his address I was like five minutes away from each other so that's pretty cool and he's been super great completely engaged and huge help as an advisor so this is the report that we did so basically kind of brought overview we have four years of data we started collecting data in April 2019 so we have April 2019 all the way to the end of the year 2022 and we analyzed specifically just Bitcoin um and the idea there is that customers can everything's pre-built and notebooks can analyze uh ethereum pretty easy but essentially what we wanted to see are volatility regimes and and ways to categorize all that stuff so a lot of these uh methods actually Fabio did a really good job kind of figuring stuff out but I'm happy to just kind of jump any direction uh that you guys want or I'm happy to just kind of lead it yeah I mean maybe I I mean I guess we could do it where you know I I've read the report uh extensively and I thought there was a few charts that were interesting and um maybe we can talk about those ones specifically and then we can kind of have a discussion about them yeah totally yeah which one so do you want me to share my screen over you yeah don't worry we'll we'll cut all this out you know Greg why don't you can you give us like um kind of like a high level of the report before we like dig in just give us like the the main ideas like give us the tldr basically yeah totally cool okay so uh too long didn't read version of this report please read it no I'm just kidding okay so one of the things that we want to touch on so I'm just looking at table contests here so we wanted to really categorize volatility regimes so one of the things that we want to look at and this is very interesting for crypto ball so crypto Mall in my opinion hasn't been figured out yet sometimes it looks like Equity ball sometimes it looks like commodity ball so one of the things uh that we looked at in terms of regimes were a contango uh term structure versus a backward dated term structure as sort of the spine of the volatility surface you could say then we wanted to look at the skew profile so we look at the risk reversal skew so pretty much the the call 25 Delta call minus 25 to put so something that's really interesting there is that you know if you think of natural gas natural gas just like explodes higher or no one cares about it and so that's kind of like a call call risk reversal SKU is positive um and then Equity Equity index especially is the opposite you know markets crash quickly they arise slowly there's a little bit of you know correlation impacts there in the index as well and so what we wanted to do there is we wanted to just kind of categorize you know how does Bitcoin trade is it trade like a commodity does it trade like uh like an equity so we did a little bit of that and so those are going to be the term structure spot file Dynamics the risk reversal SKU another thing we want to look at is the variance risk premium so what we did there is we could see okay our options overall cheap or are they overpriced and then does it matter if we overlay different filters so like is risk reversal or excuse me the variance risk premium is it expensive if we're in contango versus fabricated or if we're in a positive risk reversal environment versus a negative risk reversal environment or maybe if we layer the two and see see what kind of differences there are there so one of the charts that you'll see come up a lot let me just give you an example it's going to be these box plot charts so the idea here is we can see the middle line is going to be the median within the box and then you have the interquartile and then you sort of have the extremes and so the idea there is you can just get like a probability distribution of the observations or distribution of the observations so that's kind of like the high level we did touch on a few things like the Futures basis which was you know very quiet in 2022 I know that paradigms like doing huge like Leaps and Bounds of to facilitate this type of trading which has been like such an interesting vehicle to trade that the future spreads so that's going to be really interesting and then uh we just touched on some volume and some open interest metrics as well where we saw 2022 with a lot of block volume on ethereum so you know Paradigm obviously all the block volume goes through you guys so that that's like another interesting point that we wanted to kind of touch on cool okay yeah Joe all right awesome yeah I'll just I'll share my screen and a lot of the things that you just mentioned where we're going to be talking about so let me just do that quickly yeah I guess just uh just to start out really really like the piece you know I'd classify this I you know I worked at Deutsche on their Equity derivatives desk and you know JP Morgan on their Equity derivative desk and like this is probably like the most comprehensive crypto volatility research that's currently on the market you know and certainly on par with you know the top derivative research pieces that I saw from that I've seen from the investment Banks so like kudos to you for for really starting to build this out um but I guess two of the the Vol parameter charts that really resonated with me was the new term structure written richness chart that you guys recently released the Amber data I think it was you know you released it like a couple couple weeks ago or maybe this was the debut of it so that chart and then as well as you know the box plots that you were talking about you know 25 Delta skew and how how has that evolved since the crypto option Market has really caught steam in 2019 you know due to different regimes in spot Vol correlation right so you know starting with the term structure richness chart like why should investors be looking at term structure richness when examining crypto Vol markets like what was the thought process about like adding this adding this new cool and sleep chart into um you know the Amber data yeah absolutely so Fabio I'll Loop you in on on this because uh this was a this is something that Bobby and I devised and uh we kind of went back on some of the stuff we wanted to include so maybe if you want to talk about sort of briefly the methodology yeah maybe I can introduce the methodology of the richness of the term structure and then we can uh with Greg take another view about the result basically what uh uh Greg and me thought at the start of the report about the the uh quantitative measure of the of the term structure because usually we know as a Trader that attempts to actually is a backward de coordinated or in contango because the front is upward or down downward according to the to the the end part of the of the of the term structure but we wanted to to measure quantitative uh um the the slope of the term structure so we basically developed uh an easy method to calculate every different every difference across the term structure between maturities and then we calculate the the average ratio and the average ratio is the result of this chart basically when we have values above one meaning that the the term structure the overall overall term structure is in the back coordinated and the values are under below one the overall overall term structure is in contango so it's important to define a methodology just to measure and because from data specific methodology and afterwards we calculate everything from the box plot according to the term structure of the coordination of contango so it was an a Very very interesting part with the Greg to develop this uh this approach because I think it's quite unique I think in a in a triple space but I don't know maybe in traffic is something that is uh usual I don't know and um yeah the result is pretty constant through the time series so it's a right so so just to summarize you're effectively looking at the term structure and calculating the first derivative of the term structure at multiple points across the curve are you using a weighted average to do it just because you know at the front of the term structure you're gonna it's gonna exhibit more more steepness compared to the back where there is not going to be as much or you guys just taking a mean average no I mean average but we calculated every combination across the maturities so for example for example the seven days constant we compare it to the 30 days the 60 day the 90 days and 180. we did the same with the 30 and so on and so we averaged everything and so basically it's quite weighted even if the methodology is uh uh yeah that makes sense to effectively just have a matrix of the of these averages for exactly for each point that makes sense cool well on first glance I mean you look at this chart right like what the heck's Happening Here Right like it seems like when I first when you kind of first look at these charts like you know dislocations are a pretty pretty funny thing in in the ball world and when you look at it's like oh damn like this is a significant dislocation and it has to mean revert because every time it's gone down to this level it has in the past but like I don't know I guess like given the Vol regime that we're in like this is kind of the behavior you would sort of expect right you know we're in a what we've been in a lower volatility regime as of late especially in Q4 when this data was was compiled as you can see in the chart it doesn't it doesn't capture any of um the q1 data but you know absolute level of implies are relatively low realize was even lower right you have the significant roll down effect you know similar to you know an equity ball that you'd have but you know on the back end there is still some of this expectation you know that you know you could have this potential large spot move just because of what happened throughout 2022 like we had you know three Black Swan events and you know perhaps that's the reason like even when the front end was trading in the what the 30s right you still had that back end still trading like in the 60s right so like you know given that low ball regime of Q4 I expect I would expect the term structure to be to be steep but that being said we we have been seeing a lot of guys on Paradigm kind of been taking advantage of the steepness by selling a lot of these front-end calendars and and collecting this roll down so like would you would you agree like this is kind of like the behavior you would sort of expect in a ball regime like this and um and I also think it would be interesting to kind of look at this I think you do this at other other points in the report kind of looking at the steepness across different ball regimes right like because you know when fall is really low you expect term structure to be steep when that when the absolute when at the money implies are high you would expect them to be backwardated so like would you guys like look at like kind of normalizing it as well similarly to how you guys have like normalized SKU charts on Amber data yeah that's a great point so one of the things that we did is we we worked with ratios in order to account for that so that was that was a actually an advice tip from you in when he double checked our methods but yeah we couldn't just do absolute values because different Volvo regimes are gonna are gonna be way different and so you don't want to have you know uh a steepness that's affected by the overall level of the Vol so that's definitely something we kept in mind um as far as kind of your broader point question and Fabio feel free if you want to jump in at any point but if we're talking about sort of you know where we are and or where we were at the end of 2023 so one of the things that I always try to keep in mind or one of my assumptions is that structurally I think crypto ball has to go down in the long term the asset becomes more efficient the market caps grow uh a lot of the surprises that you know oh the government says it's not allowed now it says it says it's allowed those have less and less impact the 10th time to do that or the 11th time uh there's more option across the globe and stuff like that so my base assumption is that we structurally will have less Vol and so that's one point of it the other point of it is when we're looking at steepness I always think about this for anyone who's traded equityball VXX trading in 2017. like that the thing that decay from the roll down on the vix cash versus the front month future and the second month future is so steep that that made that was like the best trade ever now we want I wanted to quantify something similar in crypto mall where we could see okay like where's the cost of carry in terms of vol roll down the most expensive and if you're wrong like where does it Peak at and so those those were sort of the more interesting points in my opinion um and obviously we saw this in Q4 a lot like this was decades low ballized terms and really steep Decay down the structure so that was something that was pretty interesting um and obviously q1 2023 is a is a is a big kind of diff difference from from Q4 2022 [Music] cool yeah that makes sense and I guess we can leave we can leave the term structure and kind of just just moving on to the SKU as you know someone that I wasn't active in this market you know back in 2019 or 2020 so it was super interesting to see how this SKU has evolved over time where like you said it's like okay it's kind of trading like you know SKU is much more flat kind of like a commodity or like you know not gas but then you have a year like 2022 when you know the SKU looks a lot more like equities like anecdotally I think you guys will will enjoy this I used to always wonder why g-val decided to calculate skew as calls minus puts because when I entered this Market I'm like I'm in 2022 I'm constantly looking at this negative number and it's like not intuitive like why why did they try to decide to do Cosmetics puts no no offense but then I will get this data right and it becomes clear that in like 2021 all the most significant outliers in the SKU have been in favor of the calls versus the puts right so now I see why you can guys decide to decide to make that decision and it's really only was until this past year that the 25 Delta puts traded at a premium you know compared to the calls and I think you mentioned in the report there was like a time when the 25 Delta puts were trading the same volt as the at the money ball like that's insane right exactly it's insane to think about when you have years like 2022 when you have all these sort of events and we've we've definitely seen some SKU selling you know via BTC riskies to play for this reversion back to the you know 2022 regime of of puts over calls but you know in BTC the SKU has kind of it's kind of been rather sticky as of late to start 2023 you know it's I think the calls are still trading a couple balls over over the puts I mean of course it was you know at extremes a couple a couple weeks ago uh you know I think it was the one month 25 Delta was trading like eight Falls over or something like this and now it's only two balls over but you could argue that it's kind of a bullish sign for the mark market right you know it's very clear you know as we mentioned you know from our previous episodes that you know our client base is significantly positioning for the rally and we've really seen the significant upside realized ball as of late so like what what sort of like skew regime I know it's a loaded question like are we kind of entering in in 2020 um 2023 like in 2022 we traded like equities but now you're seeing all this sort of like upside realized explosion like like you guys mentioned you know in that gas like what do you guys think is going to happen yeah that that's a great point so first off I want to say kudos to David because he totally called decompression of yields the macro picture easing like a massive rally and here I am owning putts like an idiot but that being said so a couple things I I think are really really interesting so as far as like uh as far as the SKU goes coal minus put that's been a hot button issue within the G Vault world to say every day when I when I go on it I just always flip it it's just that oh let's change that even I don't know why I just find it easier to read the other way but yeah I think everyone from the traffic Equity space like loves the put minus call but I don't know Commodities this looks this just makes more sense to me but anyways um so one of the things that's really interesting right now is that okay why is it trading positive now especially in elongated short dated SKU can do whatever it wants because short data can move any like short-term stuff can happen in any direction if we're looking at six months SKU we're still trading a couple of balls to the call side like a couple balls positive so to me that's really interesting and I think this is where there's a potential opportunity because I think there's a a potential dislocation between implied and realized so on the implied side let's just say that you know miners have gone bankrupt or reduced their business a lot of people who are just you know by holding crypto and selling calls as passive income you know or maybe out of the market dovs have reduced volume stuff like that so there's an argument to be made that like the supply of call selling has come off the table and therefore the price of calls has gone up because there's less less downward pressure from Supply so there's that argument and then there's the argument of like well what's really going to happen with a realized spot spot of all regime has spot ball changed because the first month of 2023 has been bullish like that to me that's kind of a hard leap to make so one of the things that I think is really interesting is that if Bitcoin inequities are highly correlated and equities has a kind of a negative risk reversal skew and Bitcoin has a positive risk reversal skew well then you can just like mirror those those assets and trade risk reversals kind of against each other and that gets like a that's becomes really interesting so to me I don't know if this is sustainable like I don't know if we've we've completely switched from a negative spot ball regimes a positive spot model regime six months out like I'm skeptical of that one month in like that that's cool like short dated stuff no opinion long dated stuff I I kind of think like this is a fade but I don't know Fabio how do you feel yeah I was thinking about the early months of uh of 2021 when we had that explosive upside uh um positive spot wall correlation because the Bitcoin um break the the previous ultimate from uh 16 to 30 in around 20 days and uh in that occasion we had a short squeeze and on ID with the idea reached on the course side uh extreme level so we have to look at the general picture of the of the last three four years and separating that uh that the first months of 2021 in my opinion because it was a something anomalous unusual in um of course in in crypto always have the positive cos Q because we have that parabolic move on the upsiders so Traders position itself for uh with the course so usually calls tends to be overpriced against foods but I agree with Greg that uh structurally we we would have we will see uh a different approach to the cola to the protocol skew and I think the puta overpriced over call will be the the normal uh the normal state of the of the of the option space and um it is difficult it's difficult for trading that I entered that space in that years because during the 2021 it was a very fun in trading options even if the volatility was explosive but it was funny through the traded option on that period and now we enter a new regime maybe where a big funds are training differently are trading more than once the trading with um with blocks with we saw a lot of Vlogs With The Futures like so meaning that it's a pure volatility trade and this type of approach tends to be uh more sophisticated and it will be more difficult for uh for retail traders to to take advantage of the uh such uh extreme values in the in the EV structure and um that's it but opportunities are there and uh we'll see if maybe if the another parabolic move will occur in the next two three months we will see again uh Course prices 20 30 points above above uh puts yeah yeah I mean we're something we're very curious about too because it's really interesting whenever you see start to see and we touched on this on a previous podcast of like you know crypto like spot Vol reflexivity and you know as soon as soon as you know the market starts to take off a little bit we see guys just trying to pile into the calls and and engineer this sort of rally right so it's happening this you know the past couple of weeks where like you know we'd have a big into big spike up intraday then every then somebody comes in and tries to quote like and try to decide to lift like 500 of like one week like call options to kind of like continue uh that move and that positive feedback loop so we'll see I mean I would love to see it I mean it'd be great for the industry to you know to to get spot back up to where it is and you know certainly make the crypto ball markets more exciting so yeah it'd be interesting as well to look at it in terms of um to kind of look at where people's like the distribution of people's uh price targets are on crypto um so like to think about where we are location wise within that because I'd imagine like if you spoke to people now you know people tend to go oh you know if we get another sell-off code changes what have you I don't know 15 14 15K uh whereas if if you know feds start cutting rates and things materially changed and and they just just stick your numbers on it 35 40K by year end and it's kind of about how that the distribution of those sort of uh views on where Bitcoin trades this year like if you're obviously at the lower end of that then then the I guess the um the chances that you start to see calls trade over puts within that location will be greater than obviously you start to move to the middle of that distribution you start to get to like 30k and then you I'd imagine you'd see that flip back towards um back to the puts being over calls but um yeah I think that could be quite interesting to look at as well yeah I I'm not sure if Kathy Wood is still uh you know I think her price Target's still holding at 500k like remember back like Q4 2021 when we were just ripping like you know Bitcoin went through like 65k then just like everywhere you would just see like these crypto price targets like 200 000 500 000 like I hear you but like I mean this stuff's just so hard to predict right like the fundamental like analyzing the actual fundamentals of this like it kind of seems it's much more around you know Supply demand imbalance and liquidity that you know drives the moves rather than okay like I'm actually gonna you know do a fundamental Equity analysis like like DCF or you know comparable so it it's just so it's just so difficult to like look at these price targets and like be like what do you basically basing myself with really but anyhow that's my rant there um okay so I want to talk about this the eth open interest flipping so you so you guys mentioned this right so in the lead up to the merge right it we saw all this taker interest right you know people were trading all these call flies you know ahead of the merge really trying to position for this rally right they were like hundreds of thousands of contracts that were like attributed to just this like big December call fly position right it was like the December like I think it was 2500 30 500. there was like a hundred don't call me but like 100 over 100 000 of these you know in the open interest and then the March thirty five hundred four thousand forty five hundred we're also we're also there right so like we did have this flipping but a lot of it was kind of just attributed to these really wingy option plays that were ahead of the merge and then lo and behold what happened at the beginning of the year well or at the end of the year sorry the December call fly rolled off the open interest and then the March structure is going to do the same in a couple months and what we've seen you know per that per that arrow is now the open interest has flipped again but now it's actually in favor of Bitcoin right like all the interests that that we've seen from takers in in upside plays has mostly been you know in Bitcoin like there's been some in the theory I'm not discounting that but like very much more in favor of Bitcoin compared to you know ethereum where it was just due largely to the presence of a significant um Catalyst right so you know do you think this is going to come back like my view is like this whole e-flipping thing given it was just like all these like really wingy call call flies that really didn't even really represent much risk that was that drove the you know the ethereum open interest higher than Bitcoin well those expired and then now Bitcoin is leading again so like I'm curious what your guys's view on how that open interest might might play out in the future so so I think this is this is Fabio and I's favorite topic so Fabio and I are similar in so many ways we almost have the same birthday as well but I'm an eth maxi and he's a Bitcoin Maxi and we love to just argue about that stuff so I I think we'll both have opinions here I'm of the opinion well okay kind of some historical perspective when I discovered ethereum back in 2015 I literally sold all my Bitcoin for ethereum to hold ethereum and I couldn't believe not everyone else in the world wasn't doing the same thing so I'm like hardcore with maxi and so my thinking is like the crypto Financial infrastructure the crypto ecosystem at the end of the day is still being built on ethereum like think about all this the stable coin growth and how important stable coins are to the market and like I know Tron has some stable coins but forget Tron for a second most of it is built on ethereum and so like that's that's an infrastructure layer then if we look at the total market cap of ethereum plus all the erc20 is built on top of it like ethereum ethereum's got a lot of you know a lot of presence in the total market cap of the crypto space and then if we look at all the D5 Innovation like the fact that Solana just I mean it's not disappeared but like that was a pretty big hit with the FTX stuff and like you know the Sam bakeman freed is not a good look for Solana and so to me like you know eats number one killer basically died and so like we're back we're back to eat so I I don't know I think in the long term from a structural perspective I still think the flipping is happening is going to happen in terms of options open interest in terms of market caps in terms of like the base layer of crypto um but obviously that is just my opinion this is great this is this is Great Click great thank you so Greg you're saying you think that each um market cap is going to flip Bitcoins market cap at some point in the future yeah I think so I'd be interested to hear your your take and like why are you a Bitcoin Maxi I imagine it has something to do with your libertarian views but yeah exactly go ahead the story starts uh then yeah I agree with Greg but only when uh he called me a Bitcoin Maxi I don't think I don't think ethereum also in that period premiered in the since May uh June 2022 uh also the the structure that uh created that massive open interest in ethereum was not so um let me say directionally it was a very uh light structures in terms of options because most of them was if you remember well it was a butterfly so you have those massive contracts to to gain a small exposure in the Greeks and small Delta small Vega and so on that so basically we have also to compare uh that kind of structure we have some Matrix to compare that uh type of structure we we see on ethereum and Bitcoin one for example is the net Delta of the open interest we have it on the on the platform and and this is one one of the reason we saw that massive uh upside in the open interest in ethereum of course there was a lot of interest of the pre-made it was a nothing burger at the end and so a little bit the the open interest deflate but it was a a specific event that changed the trend because I remember well I looking at the the volume weekly volume between ethereum and Bitcoin every weekly every week and uh it's uh from the FTX collapse that the the the the open the shift so uh it seems that in that occasion a lot of Attraction for for the Bitcoin uh value proposition so uh no counterparty risk and not your key is not your coin so all the Thematic of the max is uh bitcoiners gain some traction over that uh collapse and the ethereum in my opinion um when it influenced negatively from an Audi ecosystem is a is a Gregor as right because everything in crypto has built mainly above ethereum and uh that event caused some shift in my opinion in the in the in the state about the the general the centralized um Vision about uh what's its uh under the ethereum ecosystem and vision so maybe these two aspects influence that the recent events we constantly seen since then that Weekly volumes on bitcoin are around 50 percent more than ethereum volumes and nothing is changing at the moment so it's quite difficult in my opinion that open interest in the short future in the short term I think in the next six months we flip uh the the open interest of Bitcoin because a lot of uh structure will have to to to expire in the next march and June as well a lot of structure was built and during the last June for the next June so yeah exactly exactly and these are structures that are not going to be rolled given given yeah exactly so yeah yeah so like I definitely agree with aspects of what both you are saying like that's be a middleman but uh you know on in terms of in terms of the short term I think you know the open interest is going to be more in favor of Bitcoin and you know that's certainly what we've seen already but then over the long term yes I agree with Greg we're going to kind of have this fundamental shift you know this crypto lives on ethereum right so then I think we're eventually going to you know take off in favor of ethereum but I mean what fought you know probably what you were saying in terms of like the open interest right like there's not there wasn't much like actual risk out there right like when you were looking back like August in September you look at like the open interest like bell curve if you will and then all the open interest was concentrated like a hundred percent higher current spot levels right exactly did you guys say that on Amber data correct me if I'm wrong you have like a risk adjusted open interest because like in my opinion open interest wise you kind of have to weight it by risk right like a ethereum March four thousand forty five hundred call doesn't mean like anything to me sure like a contracts a contract but is there anything on Amber data where you guys are waiting the open interest by you know Delta or some other risk measure we we do have a view that shows like outstanding net Delta across strikes and stuff like that but yeah that's an interesting perspective I get what you're saying like a package structure is like four times to contracts and like a tenth of the risk so there's there's definitely something there that could be sort of uh misleading from Pure outright open interest right just something um just to sort of weigh in I guess from the macro on some of this um well one of the things with list flipping with um Bitcoin open interest I'll flip in eighth again I I think that's kind of reflective of what's been driving this move um to start the year and and I think that's again this kind of macro regime shift that I've been talking about and bitcoin's like the pure play on that right the pure player monetary policy and you see and even with with Boomer gold right even that's performing pretty well to start the year and I kind of feel that right now that's the trade that's being played it's this um you know we're changing we're changing into this environment of fed hikes to now the pause and and this kind of uh changing monetary environment um I kind of think that's that's why maybe bitcoin's kind of uh taking the sort of focus and where investors are looking to place risk I think I think as as time goes again time frames is difficult and like you say we've got this stuff rolling off in March and and then June but but I think once we get a little bit more settled in that Trend then then we start to look at more like idiosyncratic factors within the crypto space um obviously we've got the Shanghai upgrade coming in March um be interesting to see if people want to play that but I kind of think even I mean one of the charts I keep looking at is um obviously the burn rate with ethereum and getting deflationary now you know where we start to then then start to play those stories and then the interest comes back in in ethereum and start and and open interest starts to pick up again um as it becomes less of a mandatory store and now back to network effects and all these idiosyncratic stories Focus around the crypto space yeah it definitely seems to me that ethoi is driven by crypto-specific events um but but uh the other thing I was going to say was I you know kind of off topic I think we should have another podcast just between Fabio and Greg and we have a debate on who like Bitcoin maximalism versus ethereum maximalism and we will fight it out to the death to see who's right um but uh Joe do you want to move on to the next the next slide I think we're yeah yeah sure time here yeah this will this will be the last one I'll skip over the BTC stuff uh which is kind of more of the same story I want to talk about this I want to talk about systematic ball selling in crypto right it's certainly quite it's something that we still see quite a bit of on Paradigm despite some major players in the systematic vol-selling Community kind of losing their shirts in in 2022 with you know everything that happened you know that being said I mean David you you can speak to this but a lot of the prospecting conversations that I've been hearing from my seat it's like oh okay new systematic strangle seller or overwriter looking to sell you know a slug of Bitcoin options like every Friday like despite all these events that happened last year it seems like a lot of like the prospecting conversations I'm hearing from David's team has been you know systematic wall sellers are still here um yeah right and like while these strategies they certainly do back test well but like at the same time like you know I'm kind of uh wary to trust you know the the sort of involved selling back tests uh you gotta be able to you know stomach quite a bit of Mark to Market swings and additionally most of these strategies tend to be levered so like things can go bad very very very quickly and like we used to have guys that would come in and sell like one to three day BTC strangles like in clips of like 500 right and they were doing this you know in the run-up the Luna and safe to say those guys that were doing stuff like this are not hearing right but that being said when you do look at the Vol risk premium like in that report I don't have it I don't have it here you know kind of hovering in that 10 to 20 ball range and you know granted Bitcoin it certainly exhibits more you know volleyball and it's a higher of all asset um but like I can kind of see why people are interested you know that being said it certainly is a pretty dangerous if you're if it's not managed properly like we had we had Gordon on our podcast uh from last week's Gordon Graham from Genesis and there was a quote that really resonated with me he's like wall Street's an expensive place to find out who you are while crypto Vol has potentially fatal place to find out right and like what what's your guys's like opinion on you know systematic fall selling is it can continue to happen like so this this uh chart on the right actually from from qvr uh Ben eifert if you follow him on on Twitter and it really shows that you know since 1990s that Vol risk premium has significantly compressed but in crypto it really hasn't happened too too much yet kind of just looking looking at your chart like you think we're going to continue to see the systematic fall selling you think that vrp is going to compress over time get that that's a great question happy you just kind of take a stab at it I think structurally it has to compress so I I talked to when I talked to un about this during our interview I asked him you know is there an argument to be made that as Market making gets automated as the infrastructure around Market making eases a lot there's there's kind of like a justification for like the the cost of Labor of Delta hedging and like the ease of of sort of uh hedging your risk makes it cheaper or you could sell ball at a lower variance risk premium to essentially like still make money if if the if you can Market make on 100 stocks versus two uh it takes a lot less people therefore you can undercut and so on and so forth just like an insurance business essentially I mean State Farm versus Allstate all that stuff so I think the nascents of crypto ball probably plays into that so because it just there isn't the same infrastructure in crypto wall as there is in in equity Vault I think the various risk premium will be bigger until more and more players come in and start squeezing it I think that's by definition a structural assumption that's safe to make as far as as far as this chart goes like I don't know selling straddles systematically is not a trade I would do it feels a little bit like the day in the life of a turkey chart it's like everything's great until Thanksgiving and he's in front of the steamroller yeah so so I actually have a question kind of piggyback enough for that um like for for the people who don't like selling Vault or will you guys eventually put together a report showing um you know returns of dynamically hedged long ball positions yeah that's that's interesting I'm not opposed to doing some of those back tests and I'm not against selling ball either but just not not wouldn't just be discharged as kind of like flipped over the x-axis and it'd just be a a long a long painful drip down lower yeah exactly exactly I could just say you got you guys have spent hours doing that that report and then Joe this guy let's just split the chart man yeah it's just the y-axis [Laughter] and heuristically like Joe said I saw um like I watched fall sellers close close with a bunch of all sellers over these last like couple years and it was it was pretty painful for him I mean they had like massive swings up and down eventually most of them blew up but but yeah um interesting stuff for sure Joe do you have anything else you want to say as we're coming yeah coming from you know my Trad five all uh ball seat I think I'm constantly thinking about is like what what is the evolution of the crypto Vol Market going to look like and is it is it going to you know mirror what has happened uh you know in equity options and and try to fight generally and one thing I wonder about and Fabi you come from a tradify background right like as the crypto ball market like gets more developed and you know and hey maybe like hedging risk view like you know qis strategies uh you know becomes more prevalent right so what I mean by that is like you know qis being like systematic and quantitative strategies that are packaged in like a node or like total return swap format as like either yield enhancement risk premium or hedging overlays right so like for example I used to do like qis some qis business in my previous life and we used to facilitate you know tail hedging strategies for you know systematic fall selling asset managers like oh let's like overlay your systematic Vault selling portfolio with Delta hedge one by two cell 30 Delta by 10 deltas and you know the hope is that you know if we get a sell-off that the money that you're gonna make from your Vega exposure as you approach the 10 Delta strike offsets the amount that you lose on your your 30 deltro and then the fixed Strike balls on the downside move up right so we were doing like trades like that and you know intraday Trend strategies basically just as overlays for asset managers for for these like sort of all selling programs like I still think the Market's a little bit too nascent but you know that OTC market is developing and I would imagine that this is like you know these pre-packaged sort of strategies that you're seeing coming out of like you know sock gens really big in these for example or a BNP is eventually going to work its way into crypto for people that are systematically selling fall that are having difficulty managing some of that tail risk Greg sorry uh so like what's the question like if you think we're gonna see like eventually more of kind of like the qis stuff you know appear in cryptoball like I mean if we don't have if we don't have any like a good response for this we'll just cut out this part yeah I mean to me I I kind of stick to the to the earlier statement like to me it's all part of like expanding infrastructure and like once there's more infrastructure there's more ball plays kind of touching earlier on the on the SKU as well it's like once we have the return of people who are just doing the systematic selling even just a covered calls like that affected to me that affects the skew um I could see that have it have a big impact for sure and I think people will do those plays but like here's here's a kind of another interesting point is that everyone in equity world has infrastructure built around stocks and stuff like that there isn't good like fall venues in traditional Finance for Bitcoin except veto or CME but even that so it's like we don't even have a way to translate like we don't have a highway from people who do this traditionally into crypto fall yet we don't have a real Highway yeah yeah and and you kind of think like everything in crypto right is you know we kind of you know reflect in some evolutionary Cycles we saw in Trad fire um but just that like Molly speed in in the crypto world so I guess to your question Jay like yeah you kind of think as as more as more kind of experienced guys you know from the Trad fire world come into the space that that those products will will naturally start to evolve and probably a lot more quickly than than they did like in the Trad fire space and and one of the other comments I guess I want to make is like like what I love about this report is you know there's still so much education going on I I talk to to funds that you know um are interested in the space don't quite understand it we we laughed last week about you know you still get questions you know are these things trading 10 volts wide and it's like no you know you can get stuff done in these markets and I think the more we have reports like this that start to to kind of help educate and and bring that understanding about what you know how these markets trade then you're just gonna it's just gonna add to the adoption and and the interest and people coming into the space which then adds to the the drive to get the infrastructure and and then the products and that will follow as well so like like Kudos guys for for doing stuff like this is great yeah exactly thanks cool yeah okay so um either Fabio or Greg do you have any final thoughts you want to say about the report uh as far as the report goes our plan is to release a few of these a year so we'll have one every quarter essentially um and and then kind of just a brief thought for customers of ours like Fabio has taken the time to to build all these in Python notebooks that will be available to to customers and they can do their own tweaks or pass a different symbol either in this case or um you know instead of writing something from scratch they can take existing analysis and tweaks and parameters so that we've tried to make it so it's easy for for practitioners to use this data right away cool cool um well I want to Echo um David's sentiment and say thank you for you know building this stuff out like offering This research to people for free I mean I think it's very valuable to a lot of people so um really cool work you guys are doing and again thank you for coming on the show I think we'll just cut it off here yeah thank you very much thank you
