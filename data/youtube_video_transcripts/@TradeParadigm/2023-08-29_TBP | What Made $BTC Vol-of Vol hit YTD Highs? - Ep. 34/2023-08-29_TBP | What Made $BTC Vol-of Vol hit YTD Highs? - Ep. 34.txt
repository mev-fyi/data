[Music] hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of life hi everyone welcome back to the big picture so we've been on a brief Hiatus you know during August summer break definitely thrilled to be back in the action and definitely think it's quite timely you know given given the events over the past week but before we dive into today's content with Gordon from Genesis just have a few housekeeping items before we start so first up David our macro expert and you know co-host of the big picture he's taking a little bit of a step back uh in the meantime and while he's not going to be hosting as regularly we're police announce he's still going to be making some occasional guest appearances with us and but in in his stead very excited that Greg from Amber data is going to be our new permanent co-host on the big picture so Greg is the architect behind one of the top data providers in crypto Vol and brings this sort of unparalleled you know expertise and level of data analysis that I felt we were missing a little bit from the show and we've we've done a couple episodes with him in the past where he showcased his skills and you know really really excited to be having him so I mean Greg just to you know kick us off here giving you're going to be you know the new sort of permanent co-host if you can kind of just you know give a quick intro um for our viewers yeah sure thank you so much y'all I appreciate the introduction you gave me so my background is as a proprietary Trader also pop Trader in Chicago I traded uh chocolate trading and drw and then in 2015 I went into crypto full-time and then January 2021 being my co-founder Pat Doyle Bill Jason's volatility and then October of last year that's October 2022 we sold to Amber data so now I'm the director of derivatives like Amber data and I basically run the derivatives Data Business and so basically when we look at is script of options crypto Futures crypto curves okay awesome and additionally so we're also in the process of adding another host to join Greg and myself and we're very confident that this this new edition is going to bring you know another interesting element to the show I mean we can't say who it is as of now we're still kind of working out some final some final things here but very very strong presence in the crypto Vol Community uh it's going to be really exciting if we can get this over the line so more more to come on that uh but big thank you uh so far in terms of the loyalty and support you know to this Channel and help us maintain that momentum please just hit that like hit that subscribe button really helps us with the YouTube algo and you know really get this show out there to the masses so without further Ado let's I guess let's just Dive Right In so Gordon really really great having you back on the show and certainly you know quite a roller coaster week uh in terms of you know what we witness right I mean prices take a sharp 10 nosedive within just a few minutes would really kind of just felt like some whale really just offloading only to kind of really immediately level off into this very very tight price range you know later in the week and it's some of the the most extreme Vol of all that I've certainly seen I mean I think the overnight at the monies kind of hit you know 100 120 level and compared to the front end that was trading you know sub 40 Vol just less than 12 hours later and you know we've kind of been discussing on Paradigm how over the course of 2023 there's been this aggregate sort of taker interest of you know short puts and and long calls exactly across you know the one month the three month buckets and this sudden sort of Market move movement kind of made people you know really reposition some of that risk and saw some pretty decent put buying on that move and specifically there's a pretty opportunity to opportunistic print that you also mentioned in in your um derabet insights piece where we saw that you know 1 000 of those 10 Delta puts you know trading you know basically right before we really really took that leg lower so I'm kind of just curious to hear your take on on the recent Market behavior and yeah what you've been seeing yeah sure thanks very much for the context and uh congrats and well deserved to Bringing Great Wall onto the show I'm looking forward to hearing his regular commentary now we can get it live video on tbp and not only the Amber data podcast so great stuff and we'll see what Alpha he drips there for the benefit of the the rest of the unwashed masses but um yeah about recent Market Behavior look take your Trends over the course of of you know the last several years in crypto ball compression and we've talked a lot about that and notwithstanding some of the spikes which are um you know kind of evident when you look at the charts the charts that you you would see on Amber data and you know kind of virtually any others they tend to be short-lived and they're you know the the time process of um of volatility has this embedded negative drift to it um you know which suggests on the one hand kind of a um a long-term institutionalization of the market as well as greater liquidity and and sort of variance risk premium harvesting which um you know again I think Greg Lauren was was the lead architect or author of that that great paper analyzing long-term trends in crypto volatility um but what we saw this year I think it would be fair to say would be you know kind of a a cyclical uptick in the amount of Capital being put behind the short wall trade and that sort of built itself to uh to something of a head right and and it came to a point where we almost had a I would say kind of a capitulative moment for guys dumping ball and that was the Saturday before uh this blew up right we saw a two-day Vault trading at 13 um it was it was pretty funny to watch because their mids are not calibrated to go below 20. they're just bounded there right so really I didn't know that funny yeah well I didn't know that either of course until I saw that and then you looked and what all the two-day ball was being offered at 15 or less it was showing both through mids and the mids were all fixed at 20 um you know which which tells you that you know in the world of crypto of all people have to have you know kind of non-zero bounds to this and in order to be able to um parameterize it within you know some reasonable quantitative framework so you know we went from that to just Days Later having two day involved basically trading at 100 as you said our overnight ball it hit almost 120 I think two-day ball was pushing 80s 90s I'm not sure if the Hyde print actually traded it to Triple digits um but but that cascading effect of perps in BTC trading at 28 27.5 27 and then they're just being a pure whole right true um I would say liquidity hole and that kind of nascent Dynamic hedging sense where there was nothing in between and it hit 26th and then it hit 25 you know three almost and at that point um you know per funding was basically triple digits negative I think if you you look at you know kind of where the date was uh and and volatility markets essentially dried up right it wasn't just prices gapped it was there was no price um and the liquidations began to happen the liquidations were obviously happening um in small tickets as um you know kind of risk management engines that the exchange went into effect and they were sort of paying Vol until they could get liquidity which was in many cases triple digit for for overnight stuff and indeed for longer dated options that's what the real pain was I mean we saw longer dated balls go from you know mid to upper 40s to Mid to Upper 70s um and liquidations at midi at the money or you know quarter Delta strike risk for calls were getting blown out at 75 almost 80 percent implied Vol which is really quite extraordinary I I think some of the biggest prints in size were not in the longest dates we saw a September 32k calls paid in the better part of a thousand units on screens and almost 60 percent implied Vol right which is roughly double from where that stuff was maybe 80 percent higher from where it was just days prior you know this was pure pain um you know some was actually exchange effective liquidations or at least it appeared to be on the tape and others seemed to be uh desk initiated liquidations either discretionary or programmatic um but you you know watching the tape right and kind of seeing the prints go up on Paradigm um you know seeing how things were flowing through screens it was obvious that there was no real sense of the price of variance at that moment and certainly you know kind of convexity that is heading against all of all could not be obtained you know in wings versus ATS to the extent that that was measurable was you know essentially infinite because ball was moving 10 points at a minute uh and I I think you know just having traded through it Dynamic we had some of our own first order Vega risk you know it was quite clear that you you would try to be offered within the first or or you know couple uh levels of the book and you know stuff would just sweep up and down um you know it was almost like seasick to kind of watch uh of course good to be on the right side of it and hopefully being offered in ball uh into that move because in the next phase of it from my perspective was how shockingly quick it normalized right and and how we saw those balls uh in June get paid as high as almost 80 for you know stuff like 40 or 45k calls um you know march with similar strikes and similar evolves September as I said up to 60 and then the stuff was offered down 20 points lower within 24 hours um it's absolutely nuts it's absolutely nuts I mean so we have the implied Vols on the screen right now so the the June at the monies as of this morning is Trading 47.6 right over the course of like a week right and then it's dropped in 25 walls with most of that certainly coming you know right right at first I mean that's the thing I just don't really kind of you know understand about this Market while it definitely seemed like last year you definitely have a bit more of accordion sort of price action where you know look you you have like a big sell-off and then sure you have some dead cap bounce going on compared to here where you just have this this stepwise price action I mean we sell off ten percent in the course of five minutes and then you know over the next week we're trading in like a 300 sort of price that's right it's absolutely yeah Greg I think now is probably a pretty good opportunity um I mean as we were just discussing how wonky you know the basis was was going as the derabit liquidation engine really kicked in on you know some of these short Vol positions that needed needed to be covered um do you want to share your screen over me and you can kind of like go through some of the some of the new tools that you've been looking at uh with Amber data it's a really analyze this stuff yeah absolutely awesome cool Lim so Gordon pointed out a couple really interesting things I just want to share as well so when we're talking about sort of the the price of convexity so this bottom chart butterfly index for people who don't know it it's basically the d-ball index or the Dare bit fix uh the Bitcoin fix divided by at the money 30. so we'll really look at the relationship like wings versus uh the belly and so we can see here during sort of that huge liquidation Wings just got freezy expensive and if I'm looking over sort of back to January 1st 2022 we can compare that to you know three arrows slash Terra Luna FTX so those are the other sort of events that we saw and it's pretty interesting that we had sort of this craziness happen but there's not that same Catalyst that we had with FTX or 383 AC or Terra Luna this is more about a liquidity Catalyst it looks like to me and then on a term structure we can see how expensive the front end got I mean we went from extreme contango basically trading in the in the semi basis point level or sorry to 70 level I'll wait above the completely flat term structure to about 1.1 so that's that's something that's kind of interesting and if we're looking at darabits funding the perp funding so yeah we can see how extremely how extreme these levels got so this is funding paid out realized funding paid out every hour so for example we could see 14 basis points negative in one hour or 25 basis points in one hour for E which in annualized terms is crazy I mean times 24 times 365 is sort of the annualized terms and so that's something that's really interesting now kind of looking forward one of the things that we're seeing that we also find interesting this is something that gravity sucks pointed out to me let me just look at the realized funding cumulative realized funding over time growing back year to date so in Orange we have eat in blue we have Bitcoin so we can see during sort of the sdd making crisis uh when we had that sort of rally back in Bitcoin um Bitcoin funding was more expensive uh than each funding and it's just as of recent where people are paying more to be long each they're paying more funding into purp starting essentially the beginning of this event and we're having a little bit of a flipping there in each versus uh Bitcoin cumulative fundings that's that's just something that's interesting I don't know what to make of that yet it's just an interesting data point that somewhere someone out there in the market is willing to pay up over Bitcoin as far as funding goes and eat yeah interesting I don't really know what what to make of that either uh however with the big sell-off that we saw there were it certainly seems like the big sort of catalyst of this sort of NoDa nosedive was you know some sort of player you know selling out of you know their CME sort of BTC Futures where I'm not sure if that you know that was something that you know led to the funding in BTC to really come down relative to youth but that certainly is you know interesting to see because certainly the narratives at play in terms of whether that's the macro or or the ETF stuff or even the flows that we're seeing on on Paradigm just you know BTC upside versus ethereum upside really would suggest that you know you would expect BTC funding rates higher than Heath um just in terms of um you know interest uh in the market but yeah that's that's really really interesting thoughts on this but here's one quick perception that might be the case you know maybe someone's managing a lot of short calls on E by hedging with the perps on an under collateralized basis and so therefore they're paying up on on the perps in order to headshot short call exposure I guess the only thing I can really think of I don't know if anyone else also has thoughts well honestly I mean I think that might be even just a great great point to end it right I mean they kind of you know Loops back to literally the first point of what we said so I I like to keep these a little bit more short and sweet now you know rather than you know the 60 70 minute sort of episode thank you very much for coming on Greg looking forward to really getting into the weeds with you on this stuff going forward and we'll see you next week [Music]
