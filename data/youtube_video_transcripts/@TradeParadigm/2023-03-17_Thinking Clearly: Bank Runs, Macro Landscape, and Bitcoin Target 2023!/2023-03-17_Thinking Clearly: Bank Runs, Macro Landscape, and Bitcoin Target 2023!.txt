hi I'm Dave Brickell director of institutional sales at Paradigm and paradigm's Resident macro man I'm not joined today by my regular co-host of the big picture given everything that's gone on over the past week we decided to postpone but I thought it might be worthwhile jumping on to to quickly share some thoughts about exactly what's been going on um what I think it means for markets and what I think it means from a big picture framework for for crypto um the first first thing I want to say is events over the past week ultimately are my long-term bullish thesis for crypto playing out real time and that is a Fiat system swimming in debt simply unable to sustain higher rates for any period of time I think in a post-2008 world markets are addicted to low rates and liquidity and as soon as you start to remove that quite quickly things break and I think it's fair to say over the past week we started to see things break now somewhat perversely I was hoping that something would be the economy and particularly inflation but it looks to be the U.S banking system that's coming under pressure and effectively what we've seen is is a classic Bank Run and with deposits fleeing banks in search of higher yields that they can earn in money markets now the reason banks have been unable to Simply hike deposit rates to to keep those deposits um is the fact that we have this inverted yield curve so to do so effectively would be um to at the cost of profitability so banks have been able to hike deposit rates money's leaving money's leaving those banks in search of higher yields elsewhere and it's starting to cause a few problems now to me those liquidity needs eventually banks that need to start selling their Assets Now the problem certainly in the case of svb um was they saw massive deposit in flows as many banks did during covid um as fiscal policy effectively put cash in people's pockets and found its way into the banking system now they took a lot of those deposits and invested them sort of longer term in longer duration assets and and predominantly treasuries now those treasuries are clearly underwater given um the sharp hike cycle we've seen out the FED now that's typically not a problem uh given that Banks don't have to write to Mark to Market those um so long as they're deemed as hell to maturity but obviously if they're needing to sell them to to provide liquidity um then quite quickly they're realizing a loss and a liquidity issue quite quickly becomes a solvency issue and we kind of saw similar things play out in 2008 I had a front row seats of that Lehman's um and you know things don't really change and in fact I'd say the system now is more uploaded central bank balance sheets more bloated so potentially the problems are even even larger now the reaction of the the US regulators and the FED um the the sort of big thing that they've done has been to announce this Bank term funding program uh btfp um as someone else will say um buy the pivot um now what what that does this allows Banks to raise liquidity by essentially um using their their treasuries and and mortgage-backed securities and other edible collateral um as collateral to then receive liquidity and they're going to give them that liquidity at par so rather than having to realize the loss the FED would essentially give them give them that cash um at par and lend it for a year so that's going to help for short term at least address some liquidity issues and maybe stop a little bit of this contagion and certainly from a solvency point of view um however what it doesn't do is it doesn't address the issue that effectively front-end rates are simply too high so banks are still going to struggle with deposit outflows and again increasingly gonna need to start tapping these facilities to raise liquidity now this runs kind of somewhat counter to what the FED are trying to do in terms of tightening liquidity and tightening rates to fight inflation but I always say that Banks aren't simply about fighting inflation um they're fundamental to Market function liquidity and once again we're starting to see the FED have to step up and provide that liquidity now in the past week um due to what's been going on we've seen the FED balance sheet explode by 300 billion so just to give a kind of sense of how much liquidity now they happen to inject back into the markets they're completely unwinding the the quantitative tightening that they were trying to trying to do and it offsets pretty much all what they've done since since the fall of last year um now where do we go from here um ultimately look this doesn't stop until the FED certainly pours um and cut rates the idea that I'm seeing some people out there say that the FED can on the one hand provide liquidity um and then also hike rates to address inflation it just it just can't work out that way because central bank balance sheet the FED balance sheet is going to explode higher so ultimately the FED are going to have to pause and they've got a pretty much impossible choice to make between inflation or the financial system but as we know historically they'll always choose the financial system as the Lesser evil and I think we're starting to see that play out um so I think from here I expect we'll see see more banks in trouble um I don't think this ends here um I think we're going to see more and more Banks starting to tap um both the the btfp um and and actually most of the borrowing actually came from the FED discount window um which is another facility that the FED have have to provide liquidity so banks are clearly struggling for liquidity the FED are having to provide it so the FED balance sheet is once again an expansion mode now I've talked about before how markets and particularly crypto uh function of rates and liquidity predominantly so what we're seeing we've seen obviously a sharp reversal in rates coming lower which we were looking for and that she spoke about on the last uh the big picture um and now we're starting to see this explosion of liquidity being injected back into markets um now I mean there's a potential um for the I mean the amount of treasuries and MBS that Banks Hold Us Banks hold is in excess of 4 trillion JPMorgan route earlier in the week estimating that this could inject up to say 2 trillion of liquidity into markets so we're going to see this huge liquidity injection into markets I don't think the FED can do that and keep hiking rates at the same time as I say it's going to continue to precipitate this need to to for banks to kind of go and and take more liquidity from from the FED as deposits will continue to flood out in search of higher rates so we're in a really tricky situation for central banks and ultimately they will they will look to preserve the banking system and they will need to to to pause so my expectation into next week is that we'll see a Fed pause um and eventually we'll see we'll see the cuts come further down the line now I think they can justify that a on financial stability concerns but also the other thing I think we're going to see now is the sharp slaying of the economy um particularly as Banks effectively are going to stop lending into the economy so we're going to see a bit of a credit crunch I guess um we'll quickly see growth starts to come down and inflation will follow and that will be reason enough um for the FED to to take a pause and eventually start to cut rates um so ultimately what what I think this means for crypto I came into the year bullish in a way thinking that we'd see the data soften um fed will pause maybe cut towards the end of year and we were looking at a very different macro regime to the one that we had in 2022 um obviously things have changed quite dramatically over the past week as the financial system looks to be in trouble so I kind of think that bullish view that I had on crypto on an easier fed cycle into 2023 and also easing liquidity um I think we're now seeing that on steroids so yeah it makes me super bullish crypto um over the rest of this year um I mean I Direction at least I I think we got a lot a lot further to go um we all know what the convexity looks like in crypto um our flow certainly this past week you know we're seeing record volumes um almost daily at Paradigm um as as institutions scramble to put on the top side um so I don't I don't see that ending anytime soon I mean you know people to ask me about targets for crypto I came into this year saying Bitcoin could go to 40K uh just on a pause um and and this sort of peak inflation narrative if we now got a fed that's gonna have to pause and even cut rates despite inflation although I do think inflation will come quite quickly lower um then you know we we need to ratchet up those those targets sort of pretty quickly um and you know who knows maybe those 100K targets that people spoke about for Bitcoin um start to play out this year um I think the other thing to be cautious of here is um particularly the move we've seen in rates is a huge VAR shock uh to the system and when you have a big bar shock the first thing that everyone has to do that Risk Managers have to do is gross down risk so I think what we're seeing um for now is uh some grossing down of risk I I think I've spoken before about the lack of positioning in markets and I think that's why we've not had a bigger sell-off in risk and actually why we're trading quite well you can certainly see where positioning was short and which is why I think the NASDAQ has actually sort of outperformed um as well as obviously benefiting from a lower rate higher liquidity environment so I think first point of call is we're going to see continue sort of degrossing and risk which might weigh on on equities a little bit and and to a lesser extent on crypto but once that Deliverance played out um I think we're selling up for one Almighty rally for crypto um as we completely reverse the rate hike cycle that we saw over the past uh past 12 months and as liquidity starts to get injected back into these markets and the FED balance sheet starts to explode once again um Bitcoin and crypto is liquidity junkie and they're starting to get their fix once more [Music] foreign
