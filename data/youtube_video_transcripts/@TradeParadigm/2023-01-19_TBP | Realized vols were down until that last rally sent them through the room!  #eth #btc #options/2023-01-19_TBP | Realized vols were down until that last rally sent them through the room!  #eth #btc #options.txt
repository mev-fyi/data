realize I'm all right like you can kind of see in the bulk of this chart is super super depressed um I mean it was basically a floor down here uh trading below 20 which you know record lows again super low volumes just nothing nothing happening there um and then as we kind of rallied you know things started to get really interesting and and people started chasing top side and um it is brought ball back to the market and Justin as you were saying earlier you know like this morning you know we were rallying and now we're absolutely puking it back I'm sure that ball will kind of you know continue to to inch higher and um yeah anticipate you know thing things to stay interesting here
