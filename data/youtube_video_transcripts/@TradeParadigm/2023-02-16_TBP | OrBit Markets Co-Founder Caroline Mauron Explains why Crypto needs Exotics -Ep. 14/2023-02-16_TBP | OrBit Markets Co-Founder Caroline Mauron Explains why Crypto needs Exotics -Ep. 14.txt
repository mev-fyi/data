there's less market makers in crypto who are ready to Warehouse risk and so you see those wild swings in in those second order parameters and so that that makes those uh those reversal colors actually even more attractive when when that skew is for the top side when to be honest it shouldn't be hi I'm Dave Brickell director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about so it's an expensive place to find out a crypto ball a potentially fatal place for the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of life hey guys so welcome to the big picture my name is Joe Crue I'm at Paradigm in the weeds around everything crypto ball markets and today I'm joined here by a new paradigm guest of the show Sohan on our sales team in Asia so on if you just quickly introduce yourself I think that'd be helpful yeah sure hey hey guys uh so my name is Sohan um I'm a director of institutional sales out in Asia and my background is uh on the treadvice side I come from a structural products background so structuring sales always in FX and rates and I moved over to Paradigm about um about a year and a bit ago um and uh yeah looking forward to chatting all right awesome and today very very excited to say that our featured guest is Caroline Marone co-founder of orbit markets in Singapore thanks for joining us today thank you thanks for having me yeah of course so just to start if you could just tell us about your background and how you transition from Trading FX derivatives at Deutsche to now basically pioneering the crypto EXO markets at orbit it definitely definitely seems like quite the jump there yeah thanks Sean um yeah so like like Georgia said uh I spent um 13 years at Deutsche Bank trading mainly trading FX options quite a bit of Exotics and uh I was I was co-head of the FX trading business for way back in my last three years I quit uh middle of 2021 I just kind of wanted to change and do something else and I started looking into crypto after that a few months after that and yeah I was I thought it was really interesting actually that uh the the crypto World Market was was pretty liquid I think Joe you mentioned in one of the earlier podcasts that people at JPMorgan don't even know there's a World Market and I was I was kind of one of these people like I didn't really realize how how liquid the one market was or that it even existed so as I took some time off and I realized all these things and I got really interested and at the same time I also realized that despite the liquid fairly liquid vanilla options Market no one yet was doing Exotics which are you know in obviously you you guys worked in IB you know like in the typical options desk whether that's iniquity or in FX or in commodities Exotics and bespoke structural products tend to be quite a large part of the of the business and and so we were surprised that no one really was was doing this in crypto so we found here that uh as an opportunity yeah I think part of it is it's like as you said right nobody really knows in traffic or not that not too many people know in traffic that this there's actually a somewhat liquid you know vanilla Market here and because of that liquidly you can actually you know replicate some of these payouts yeah no absolutely but it's quite uh quite interesting that you know some of these products are being done in trotifying very emerging currencies or in single stocks that really even options barely trade right and uh so in that sense like crypto options are easily more liquid than some of these things so yeah crypto Exotics can can very legitimately be hedged um at least to some extent and essentially run the same kind of business model as you do in a in an investment bank so this is what we set out to do awesome yeah that makes total sense so just so typically when we record you know the big picture you know we discussed the crypto vanilla option flows in the market macro environment but giving your crypto exotic lean I feel like that would be kind of like a wasted opportunity and the fact you can do that too if you want no no it won't be as exciting yeah and the reality is Paradigm doesn't yet see exotic flows on our platform because all of Paradigm trades are exchange settled right so I do think that today's format should be a little a little different and we kind of dive into that world of cryptoxo and so just to set the stage for you know people that might not have too much of a background in exotic derivatives so exotic derivatives are types of financial derivatives that have features that are more complex or bespoke than you know a traditional vanilla option you know such as you know bespoke payout structures you know multiple underlying assets such as baskets or unusual expiration dates so yeah I come from an equity Exotics background where a lot of the structures that we were trading you know were ones introducing discontinuity risks such as you know barriers or binaries or you know trading realized volatility or variance in swap formats or you know forward starting options you know an option that begins a year from now in you know January 2024 but has like an expiration in in January 2025 so just wanted to set the stage there uh for a few for viewers but in terms of you know crypto EXO it's like a fairly young Market but what sort of like products are you seeing demand for and one of the sort of structures that tend to to price attractively yeah I feel like you've done my job already going through all the products yeah look I think like maybe one product one exotic product that's quite familiar uh and quite talked about in them in mainstream news is uh is a variant swap which is Iniquity is known as the fix and that that VIX Index is very well known and so people try those variant swaps in uh in trotify it's extremely liquid product really probably mod or similar to vanilla options draw you probably know better than me for Equity but this is a liquid product um and so uh you know I'm from FX background not so much but still World swaps and variant swaps are very common product and we've also seen um demand or for these products in crypto I think for exactly the same reason as the existing track fire basically people want people have views on whether the market is going to be volatile or not um and they want to express those views without having to keep changing their position if your view is that volatility is going to go up well you can buy an option no that's great that's that's a good good thing to do in this in the beginning but then after Sports starts moving then maybe your exposure is not what you wanted it to be suddenly you have a directional exposure rather than a volatility exposure and that's not your view anymore so you need to keep rebalancing this thing maybe sell that option by a new Option Etc people don't really like doing that that's a yeah yeah so let's Deep dive into that for uh you know for our listeners right so um so let's say I have a view that volatility is going up traditionally what I would do is I would just go in and buy a vanilla option and then Delta hedge multiple times that spot is moving and as spot moves far away from the strike then my Vegas less and so I have to go in and buy it buy a different option Etc so you're basically Outsourcing that entire function to to you yeah exactly you just you you want to you think volatility goes up you just buy a so-called volatility Swap and your payout is exactly whatever the volatility ends up being the realized volatility minus where you bought it so that's a very clean way of taking a view on volatility and all the the nitty-gritty of you know doing the vanilla option doing the Delta hygiers rebalancing the vanilla options Etc you don't have to worry about that that that's for us to do and that's um much more efficient for a dealer to do than for an individual um Trader because you know we can aggregate all different positions and and we will have a lot of offset so that we don't need to keep rebalancing each individual position and and that will give us economies of scale whereas if you're doing it for your own position that becomes really expensive all these all these rebalancing and rehashing so that's that's one example uh that we've we've definitely seen on for this year actually both ways some people wanted to buy East volatility I think our friends at ribbon Finance were actually pitching that idea to to buy each ball and oh so I can eat like a like a systematic eat wall swap uh yeah to their wealth investors interesting is that is that cap Ford yeah exactly yeah so that it has to be the loss has to be flown uh because you know that that basically that sets a maximum loss and that that fits into a world format much better or into any kind of D5 format and um yeah usually these things are just cups and floor it kind of makes the payoff a little bit smoother for for all parties uh so so we had some interest uh in that um that looked really good historically like if you look at over the long term essentially something always happens over three months period that you know there are some non-volatile periods but if you look over frame on something always ends up happening so that looks good and at the same time I think at the time like a few weeks ago the the BTC evolved versus eastball that looked a little bit um like not wide enough like BTC one was a bit too high as able to be born if you compare to realize so some people were interested to sell the the BTC World swap um so now so will you show will you show spreads as well have you seen like interest in the spread where like you know sell BTC by Eve especially with the Shanghai upgrade you know coming now and you know the massive rally that was that we had you know in BTC versus Eve you know I could see people kind of looking at that trade yeah no totally I think that makes total sense now with the Shanghai upgrade I I actually think people only maybe uh like not really paying enough attention because nothing happened on the merge and now it's like uh whatever happens on the East chain you know it's just non-even but yeah but this one might actually has like supply and demand effect more more so than the merge so I think it could be interesting and we've definitely had interest uh all over that event yeah yeah I mean just speaking to the vanilla options Market we we saw I mean we saw so much you know interest and in demand for premium like ahead ahead of the merge and I mean a lot of that kind of just you know went to waste right um and so far around around the upgrade as you as you say that has you know much larger Supply demand implications we really haven't seen seen anything yet right like it could be the case you know people are going to wait until next next month uh to start putting on those views but as of now they they they they just really haven't um so we'll we'll see the the event is barely priced in ruined as like barely noticeable in terms structure on on the March contract yeah so it's it's cheap at the moment I would say right and I mean just like operationally as well right like there's there's also just like technology risk that that's just not a big fan right you know where something has the potential to to go wrong so like okay so how do you how do you guys see this you know the crypto exotic Market you know evolving going forward like are you are you guys seeing interest from like like for example I come from from the equity ball background we were doing like a lot of like structured no business right you know like the the worst of Auto calls you know out of you know the Japanese and Korean family offices was was quite massive right so just for the viewers effectively what these structures do is they combine a coupon payment with a a short worst of knock input on a basket of underwise you know s p Euro stock and okay for example uh in in equities would be like a very common um Auto call these things would have like a two to four year maturity and given effectively whoever owned this note had this long covariance exposure on a basket of highly correlated assets you could collect some optimally you know attractive yields on this stuff right so are you guys starting to see uh you know some demand demand for that sort of stuff it kind of seems like a a logical target audience if these guys are kind of looking to collect these juicy yields already in equities I mean hell what happens when you put a basket of BTC even I mean God forbid Solana I mean let's let's hope those were good because those would have knocked right nasty like have you guys seen any demand for that stuff yeah I mean look it's a bit um I would say it's a bit different from what we see in trade fine like in try to find this business is um is very well the infrastructure is very well defined you know there's the the distribution partner in in Japan and Korea and then there's the issuer and then there's the Investment Bank acting as the swap dealer and and so all these things have been happening for for 20 years and the process is very well defined and like Smooth um I think that I mean we are nowhere near in in crypto at the moment of having all that infrastructure in place and and all the different roles well set up um so we're ready to be uh to be a dealer in these products we've done them yeah I mean maybe maybe yeah look at I think those products are very complex uh you know I mean I was literally about to be like can we talk about something simpler um like like I mean I guess like in terms of like the way Paradigm works right like you know we have a bunch of market makers and then we have a bunch of takers that communicate to express a very directional view so uh you know these these you know these hedge funds or you know Risk Takers they're they are completely not um you know taking a ball view right they're coming in to you know do like a very specific look youth is going to go to this level right I mean for those guys um is like something more like first generation exotic like a knock-in knockout type uh instrument I mean do you offer that to hedge funds yeah totally I think the the simpler product and probably the most popular as well is the the reverse knockout um in terms of the those directional type trades so maybe for for those who are not familiar with the product um let's if you take an example let's say you think it is going to go up uh between now and end of March um you want to buy a nice car but that's quite expensive um so okay you're looking to cheapen it up so one simple way and common way to do that is to buy a call spread uh which people do so maybe you buy 31st of March 1700 2100 call spread and I'll costume I don't know five percent or something um but but you can cheapen that further uh and one common way to do this is to say okay actually if spot goes over 2100 at any time during the life of the trade then I'll get nothing so with the call spread if it's over 2100 your payoff is capped but you still get something and it can go up at any time and come back down Etc but with the reverse knockout it needs to never go over 2100 if it does you get zero so your view is that it's going to go up but not quite that much 2100 is pretty far yeah and if you have that view you get a much you can get the option for much cheaper uh about two percent like I'm throwing numbers like those numbers move around but you know that around around that kind of discounts are very meaningful discount yeah honest on a similar Note have you guys looked at a peering call spreads an appearing call spread so you're under longer vanilla call and then you're short a further out of the money call with a knock-in higher right so you have the vanilla option exposure and but then if you knock in it just goes to the call spread yeah yeah yeah that's quite common as well yeah I think the at the moment I would say people seem to prefer the the okay all format but uh but yeah yeah I mean I guess I guess it's a very similar view right it's like it's going to go up but it's not going to go up too much but like exactly summarize you get something with the with your setup you know like if it goes way through you still get something yeah yeah I mean like so like let's say like you know a big client comes in and says look I I think uh Shanghai upgrade is going to be a really um a big event but it's really we're not in the right macro environment for it to really roof it right so as spot goes up you know there's going to be a lot of selling pressure because you know a lot of people you know suddenly um they're not down as much as they used to be right so um you know like for them the option is like that as in the three things that they can do is either buy a call right and then buy a cool spread which they can do uh on their bit or another exchange and then OTC they can do an RKO or like an appearing call spread or something like that which is even more leverage right and you get twice as much is it like a 50 off like if you in that in that example that you just gave yeah I think usually or even a bit a bit more like people will look to like 60 70 discount that's all the thing yeah the the upside the upside SKU is so jacked out there right you can you can really get a lot of um a lot of discount by by selling those strikes I mean I mean it makes sense I mean a lot of look at like the the upside realize that you know if or even BTC could potentially have I mean look at the beginning of the beginning of the year right you move 40 in two weeks uh so yeah it yeah it totally makes sense like in the in the equity world we were doing a like a fair amount of these like on like fxi for example or you know like the Chinese internet names that could just absolutely have like massive moves to the upside because and there was a lot of interest in these structures just because you know you could just get absurd discounts you know that were optically quite attractive sorry go ahead I think uh just on Joe's point right like I I actually think it makes a lot of sense even even for those people who think there is going to be a 40 move right because in a 40 move in most cases people are long Cash Long Delta long long wall like you know that they have all these alts which are really pumping at that time look do you really care that you lost the premium that you bought on this option right like I mean at that point you're pretty happy anyway right so it's kind of like a levered way for you to you know have the view that it it grinds higher yeah and I think I think the way you pitch it is from like a portfolio diversification perspective right it's like okay like if you're allocating x amount of cash to just like vanilla calls right now like why don't we take like 25 of that premium allocation and then throw them in you know put them in these Knockouts right like that that was a very very common thing um you know from some of the big traditional asset managers who didn't have such a strong view on path I mean especially with crypto like how could you right like so in order to kind of you know reduce that premium outlay and you know get exposure or uh on the same same token get exposure to a higher amount of notional you know taking you know some of that portfolio allocation than putting into some of these barriers I think makes a lot of sense I think it looks particularly good sometimes in crypto because the this queue tends to be not very consistently priced I would say like the risk reversal it varies a lot uh you know it it swings widely from like very positive to very negative and you wouldn't see that interest file I think there's less there's less market makers in crypto who are ready to Warehouse risk and so you see those wild swings in in those second order parameters and so that that makes those uh those reversional colors actually even more attractive when when that's queue is for the top side when to be honest it shouldn't be like or at least not for the long term you know so it still calls over in BTC I mean yeah you know it's been it's been like a month or so of like doing nothing right yeah we're kind of just just sitting here yeah that's yeah I mean yeah I mean if we talk about the skew right like I I I I think maybe it'd be good to understand exactly how you hedge these instruments I mean I understand it's a model and it's complicated Etc but like roughly like how how does how would you hedge this 1700 uh 2100 uh RKO um when it you know if somebody traded it today yeah of course so like usually we would look at it in a kind of portfolio uh approach so you know we have lots of different trades and and none of them are exactly hatchable uh but then as a portfolio you look at the overall kind of sensitivity to uh different parameters the the most obvious parameters are Sport and involved so we would very systematically hatch those and then you have exposure to other parameters like the skew like we just talked about the shape of the surface Etc so this is a bit kind of abstract way of thinking about it basically you have your entire portfolio and you look at your sensitivity and you try to match that but if you think about it more um like I guess granular uh way so you just have one exotic you don't have a whole portfolio the then what do you do with that one exotic um then then you definitely have some pretty closed captioning not available theoretically be hedged exactly um you know you have to buy the vanilla strike like the 1700 and then for the 2100 digital you have to do a call spread around to to hatch and the title The call spread uh the better the hatch in in short file or OTC you can do as title call spread as people will code it uh in in a listed Exchange Market then you're restricted to whatever all the listed strikes around it so the the Hajj are not going to be perfect but you know that will if you do if you did like um 1700 2100 2200 type fly and then you you kind of match the the Nationals to be roughly there um that will that will be you know a pretty good hatch to a to a European knockout now for the continuous knockout that's a bit different because well if spot goes up very quickly you know you can put on your static hatch like I just described but then sport goes goes through very quickly 2100 knocks out then the option is gone the Exotic option that that option has not nothing left doesn't exist anymore then you need to unwind your Hedges so you don't want to you don't want to be putting on very exact Hedges you know that that maybe you won't need and so there's like some probability adjustment in terms of what exactly you should be hedging or how much you should be hedging and what ratio of it that that comes from pricing models yeah I hope that clear enough yeah I think I think it was that was super yeah it's very clear yeah I think I think it would be interesting to know how much like when you hedge because all of this is OTC right so you're directly facing um you know like a hedge fund or some kind of risk taker and they buy this option from you um so when they when they trade against you it's OTC but then when you hedge in general um do you use the OTC market or the Exchange Market um to hedge so for look there if we have any any risk that we need to hedge the primary venue in crypto is clearly uh derivative like including via Paradigm obviously you guys are like the the top venue to to find liquidity so it's the question is more how much do you need to hatch um you know if like when I when I worked at uh people talk about something called the internalization ratio which is if a client does a hundred of something how much do you need to actually go and hedge outside and how much can you internalize and the the target is to have as high as possible in internalization ratio um you know Banks like in the spot Market they will Target 98 99 99. something percent and so well why is that firstly is that the as a dealer you don't you don't spend fees you don't cross spreads and secondly you reduce Market impact also for your client because you don't go and hedge everything they do so that that kind of a high internalization ratio is ideal for both sides and that can only be achieved with a big Network and a big client franchise of people who do different things and have different interests um I don't think the the ratios of like internalization ratio of dealers in crypto are anywhere near where there are banks but that's kind of the the Target and then whatever residual risk you have as far as crypto options go certainly is by a derivating paradigm at the moment yeah open for changes but the moment is this is it yeah yeah it's it's just I mean like like I mentioned you guys are kind of the first ones here right and you need you need to have you know like our my former Equity business you you have you have that two-way flow and you're able to internalize a lot of risk because you know risk risk that I'm putting putting in my EXO books you know I can kind of repackage them and you know out to out the hedge funds right you know and you know to to have funds that are looking to you know just buy vanilla options right um I want to shift gears a little bit so I I hear you guys are offering you're doing some yeah and you you did allude to it some like D5 exotic options right like I read there was something guys were doing around in permanent loss in in uni swap liquidity pools in this is really interesting to me because this is like one of the first examples of an exotic that Hedges an exposure that is non-existent in traffic right we've been talking about like barriers and like ball bar swap like all these things are already existing in the tri-5 ball markets it's just you just have a different underlying asset but like what you guys were talking about talking about in Hedges and permanent law school that's a that's a concept that's unique to crypto like I would love I'd love to hear more about that yeah not only actually when I uh it was shortly after I I quit my job and I started reading about crypto and I read about this uniswap impermanent loss and it was kind of I thought it was interesting so I read a few medium articles and the more I read the more I realized oh you know this is just another exotic option like I can definitely price that so it was kind of the the first things that got me interested into crypto so I'm definitely happy to talk about it yeah so the the incoming loss on uni swap essentially when you provide liquidity on uniswap so let's say you provide an easy uscc pool and your exposure like we can keep it to V2 to to keep things simple your exposure is half and half USD cnes and so like in the simplest analysis you might think that well you just have 50 uh sensitivity exposure to ease and the other half is just in dollar and that's not but that actually that's not quite that because of the the setup of the automated Market maker the formula and the way units work works you end up having some some short convexity exposure and that has a well-defined payoff which is well the formula is a bit messy and like there's a for v2 there's one square root for V3 there's like quite a few square roots in the formula yeah you need a separate range as well in terms of yeah NLP right yeah exactly but ultimately you know this is something that you can you know the payoff is just one formula and you can get that in Excel and and that's going to be uh however much you lose on the impermanent loss effect as compared to what you would have got with just a simple half and half usdc and ease exposure so that is just when you have a a pair of formula like this that's deterministic you know in the sense you just need the spot at the beginning and the spot at the end and you you have a formula that determines how much you're gonna make or lose that's something that can be priced like that is exactly the definition of an exotic option I think uh you know any payoff formula that is in the court or put then that's an exactly so so this is what this was and so we can price it uh with our extended um pricing model and we can hedge it uh in a in the kind of more abstract way that I described earlier where you you look at the sensitivity and uh and you you try to hedge um and and replicate the payoff as close as possible with uh with the vanillas that do trade on the exchange and that's um actually pretty easy to do because that's uh European payoff like I'm like I was going through earlier on the barriers us when fields are European meaning they only depend on spotted start and spot at end they're they're a lot easier to hatch and and the impermanent loss is is European so this is something that we've been talking about with uh within with various funds and and people who are interested in in Define who've been providing liquidity on uni swag or other folks like similar to uniswap and yeah we've had a lot of interest in people looking to hedge empowerment laws we've seen different approach like some people just they just buy a long-term V2 hedge one year V2 hedge and then you know they probably do some rebalancing of the exposure but they don't rebalance the impermanent loss Hajj like they just keep that as a macro hatch I think to their portfolio right we've also seen people doing very uh I would say Advanced strategies on the V3 liquidity provision which I'm not expert in but you know if you look at like exactly which range has a less liquidity but is likely to trade you're going to earn more fees than you can provide the equity in that range it's going to be more profitable um so they try to to hedge exactly those range that they provide liquid for they they had that incoming loss and then they keep rebalancing to to make it right so we see different approaches but it's definitely has been yeah it's had a lot of interest right yeah so yeah at the end of the day it's just it just seems like a short gamma exposure and it's a that's just a function of the final price but it's independent of the pack right like you're talking about like edging continuous barrier options right that this sounds like from um a replication standpoint sounds a lot less complicated than a continuous barrier option as path dependency and then you have the listed databit Market already that is quite liquid so you have this implied probability distribution of you know for a given app free and then you just apply that distribution to the different potential Final prices and that determines the expected and permanent loss and then you just wrap a contract contract for difference around it and put charge of B on top be similar to you know a fixed versus floating interest rate swap because you're giving a liquidity provider this opportunity to walk in in permanent loss is it is that going to sound right yeah no that's exactly right yeah okay I mean I think I think the even bigger thing is this is like so far we've talked about very sophisticated investors right there they have a very you know very simple like view on where it is going this is uh this could be mom and pop right like because literally anyone could put money into uniswold and then they could come in and um they could they could Hedge yeah I guess it would need to be packaged by some intermediary and you know where you can provide liquidity on unit swap in a hedged way and and then the intermediary is kind of um managing the buying the Hedge from the dealer like us or others so I I think that comes back a little bit to what we were saying earlier on the notes like it lacks a little bit of Market infrastructure and people having the the role of um you know trading with the Final End clients and issuing those whatever the exact format needs to be in each countries so all these things are are not there yet I Feel So currently the main interest has been coming from very much Institutional Investor like hedge funds type yeah right I read something that you guys are also looking to do something similar with with staking deals right it's kind of a kind of a similar problem if you're if you're somebody that's trying to lock in lock in that yield you can structure that as a fixed versus floating as well right obviously a lot more variables at play here uh that you need to take account for but can you tell us about that where you're looking to do that yeah definitely I guess the like the underlying source of the yield is a bit different um you know in uni swap you earn the yield because people pay fees when they trade on the uni swap decentralized exchange um in the case of the staking yield well uh the fee the yield is coming from essentially people using the blockchain so the more the blockchain is being used the more fees are being generated and so by staking um the if you have you can earn some of those fees as a yield the the difficulty with that I think especially for institutional investors probably is that that yield is completely unknown and variable it changes every day so one of the main uh taking device taking services at the moment the Lido protocol so they they publish an APR every day that's coming from transaction on blockchain and you don't know you know if you take some ease in there then every day you find out how much you earn and that's it so if you're planning to earn yield for three months then you really have no idea how much you can earn over three months so that makes it quite difficult like that that lack of predictability I think for some investors so we've been offering uh the option to swap that variable rate into a fixed rate um then you know you let's say you're an investor who's stake the your East into Lido then the investor is going to pay us the variable rate they earn in Lido and we're going to pay them a fixed rate so this is really very much like a fixed floating interest rate swap in in short file you know where you don't exactly know where the FED fund rate is going to be or Ionia or whatever is the short you know the short rate in the country but you want to fix rate so you do an interest rate as well to fix it very very very interesting uh okay so the last thing that I want to talk about um that applies not only to crypto EXO but all crypto derivative markets is this whole concept of you know OTC counterparty risks right it's it's certainly on the top of Mind of all our crypto derivative investors you know given the credit crisis we've had and I mean how you think crypto spots volatile then you add derivatives on top of it with you know exotic rappers and it's like wow right like and in traditional markets you know you you can have custodians you can have these tri-party agreements to help mitigate you know some of this risk but it doesn't really exist here yet right like what are what are things that you know orbit has been doing in order to manage that counterparty risk discussion around an exotic offering and you know how have you guys been you know giving investors confidence around that so I feel foreign I don't think it makes too much of a difference if you're doing a very simple um product or a very exotic one you know as long as the loss potential loss is the same or potential profit for the other side um you know if that's very explosive like in a variant swap then okay that's an that's an extra problem but if it's some kind of linear payoff uh then you know then it's basically the same so still that still makes it a big problem in crypto um so I think like to me one of the the biggest issues with the converter risk is uh the lack of transparency because in in trotify you trade from One bank to another or one or even one bank to a fund but there's a lot of transparency around uh counterparties financials um and that gives a lot of confidence when you trade right but but in crypto there's very little transparency and not just that even if you have audited financials well these only come once a year and and one year in crypto is an eternity right like it's much it's a much shorter time frame than in traffic so that that just kind of makes it difficult to have confidence to trade within with different counterparties and take risks and I think the the standard setup of you know exchanging collateral every day based on the market uh that is like absolutely standard in in banking I think that that's a good thing like that that works uh pretty well and that reduces risk for both parties not it doesn't it doesn't make the risk zero you know but it does reduce it materially to however much the market market can move over one day so that that makes it much better I think the you know the overall full setup with custodians um that still very nascent I would say at this stage there are some decentralized solutions to this like uh you know we've had um counterpart is interested to use um nurses safe I think the brand is safe now um which is uh which we think is actually potentially a pretty good alternative to custodians like essentially multi-sig wallet that that locked the the margin so I think that's still you know not completely clear how that can work and there's still a lot of questions around operational controls but potentially it could be very um scalable and thanks to the device setup where you know you have you can have liquidity tokens and then those tokens might be in the safe but you can still stake them somewhere you could earn a yield like it's quite composable so potentially I think there's a lot to be done and there's a lot to build yeah I I hear you I mean Sohan we should build this stuff right like I was just about to say well we needed multi multi-signal it right like no no party has you know singular control over it right both parties need to improve approve a transfer of collateral right like it's not like multi-sig is like a very novel Concept in crypto right like this has been good this has been been around for quite a while right and if Paradigm is looking to Pivot towards D5 like eventually right this could this could potentially solve the entire bilateral OTC trust issue right that is affecting all our markets right and you know so a speed of settlement number one no need for intermediaries number two lower cost number three it's asset class agnostic right you can you could easily bring like this sort of concept and bring it to equity derivatives bring it to FX derivatives right and then you have then you can also have this automated collateral transfer because of the open source nature of the contract right you're able to monitor the mark to Market in real time and you know even like the daily collateral management right at Banks right you have so many people that are in the weeds doing it and it's always constant causing constant headaches for customers right like I mean this is just I mean it's easier said than done but like I don't know it kind of feels like defies the answer here especially when the C5 is like you're not you're not getting the big custodians coming into crypto like all like the big state all the stable coin stuff right is like FTX what have you is setting it back right like bmy like the biggest like the biggest custodian is not coming into crypto custody anytime soon right aren't they in it yeah I mean I I think I think are they I think so then why why are we working with them I I think the main thing is like you just need I mean the clear need here is that for all these complex payoffs you need either a centralized scoring exchange or like in like an lch type uh you know type empty or you need um a defy solution right um I still think that's like it's mixed right like some people just can't take D5 right I mean smart contract risk is just not something people can take and then likewise some people just can't take C5 credit risk so it's a yeah I think it's you're gonna have both Solutions I think concurrently uh you know coming to the front yeah that has been audited more than just like some black box balance sheet where what I don't know what the hell is behind it yeah I have 100 yeah I mean a good idea we should definitely build this yeah whether let's catch up tomorrow I'll be done yeah exactly well that's I mean that's everything for me it's been it's been 45 minutes it's been it's been a great conversation um any any closing thoughts or are we good to end it here oh yeah thanks very much for for having me great great having a conversation with you and uh yeah look forward to keep working with you guys [Music]
