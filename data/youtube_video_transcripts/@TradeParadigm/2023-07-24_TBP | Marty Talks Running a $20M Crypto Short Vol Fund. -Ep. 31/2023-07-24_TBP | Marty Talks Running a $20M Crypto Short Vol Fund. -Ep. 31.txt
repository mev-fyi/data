[Music] hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hey guys welcome everyone to another episode of The Big Picture Your weekly Deep dive into the crypto derivative markets I'm Joe Crewe alongside me we have our in-house macro specialist David Brickell as well as my fellow colleague Steve weingroth I think this is Steve what is this your second big picture second time on yeah so excited to have you back and today we're privileged to have have Marty on so Marty is a seasoned option Trader crypto option Twitter short Vol sensation and uh I would also say a meme master so definitely give him a follow if you if you are not currently following him but before we dive in if you if you appreciate these discussions you want to hear more help us reach a wider audience by hitting that like button smash that subscribe button help us continue to share this podcast to the world uh Marty super pumped to have you on today man and we're kind of intrigued I guess just to start uh to understand your journey into the crypto world and brought you specifically into trading crypto options sure sure what's going on guys I think you missed that I also am the owner of a creepy discontinued giveaway hat business [Laughter] Morris and disbelief yeah I'm sorry gutted that I I didn't get to the office this week to get my hat um I was gonna send all three of you a hat and you all had it on for the show that would have been maybe too much but um uh yeah I'm originally from the states but I live down here in Brazil full time now um I'm not like a traditional Trad five guy you know New Yorker that turned Vault Trader I more got caught up in uh I guess kind of where everybody starts trying to trade I don't know you buy Spot then you go to um drawing meme lines and I don't know ascending triangles and whatever some ta stuff and then you move into oh well what are these perps so let's trade some perps then you go on how do we hedge these perps and slowly snowball to now we're managing uh small boutique size options fund but um that's kind of where I'm at right now I guess I started when Bitcoin was a hundred dollars so my first like 10x was 100 to a thousand and like oh my God this is amazing and uh it rolls into how do you keep the money right like you can hit these 10 X's you can hit these big paydays but I think I wrote it all the way down right I I probably didn't even make much at the end of the day um then 2017 came around and 2018 and that was like the big hype I think everybody was talking about it I specifically remember a lady at the bus stop in Portland OR Uber stop in Portland was like oh could you help me uh create a crypto wallet she heard me and my buddy talking about crypto so that was like maybe it was time to sell that was probably like pico top and really got into the crypto Vol side uh more recently we were number 10 Market maker on the FTX products uh specifically the US stuff right so doing more spot trading and things like that spot Market making and really got into the options stuff more recently of course I've used them for a few years now but as a main income not focusing on Delta one stuff or spot stuff um that's where we're at now what's what's more interesting recently is you have this ETF hype you have to have in coming up you have this um presidential election right you have like these organic ball-inducing events or of all bringing events um I don't know if I guess Vol is a 40 handle right now right so the market isn't like oh my God it's coming back right now today today's the day you know uh hip hip hooray you know BlackRock is going to carry us to Valhalla we're not there yet uh clearly we've all's just been down to the right since November and uh the East merge was the natural or was the last kind of spikes um and since then she's a 40 handle like I have a bet that if not not a historical fall but if if Deval goes into the 20s I have to quit trading crypto options and stop selling Vol until it comes back above yeah with one of my CFA buddies yeah Molly he seems to have caught the move pretty well um what was it that you you were looking at over the last few months that kind of really sort of got you on that wave of being short though it was kind of looking at nothing right there was nothing coming there's no besides another Black Swan or time you're not going to dig yourself out of this this ball hole is what I say right uh November was what like 140 eth or something like that and we hit like 70 or 80 handle during the um the Chappelle move the eth update and besides that nothing's changed there's no you know USD liquidity no no Ventures really getting backed like there was in the hype cycle there was just nothing to look at right so what are we going to do we're just going to sort Vol and manage the Greeks that's all we can do until the fall regime changes and I I know I say that a lot recently but and I get a lot of questions well when is it back when is it back I don't know nobody knows right so maybe we do get our face ripped off one day but essentially we've been selling their short dated stuff and trying to buy some long dated Vegas so if there is a pickup hopefully we should profit from that pickup but like we can't time when Vol comes back it's not like oh yeah on Q3 or Q4 it's gonna come back I think that we have the having in the presidential election as some like natural organic vol-inducing events but nothing like I don't know when are we going to go back to trading a hundred handle 140 handle again you know I missed those days those were fun this is boring this people want crypto Twitter getting more meaner by the day [Music] no I I no I I totally totally hear you there and it definitely seems like some of the flows that I have on screen is just you know a lot of people kind of seeing the moves and in spot involved like what we saw late last week and then just like completely top ticking this thing right so the these are all flows that were coming through when you know you know eth was breaking out uh you know around 2K and you know BTC was above 31 and you know it was it was quite interesting we just saw this a massive upside and and gamma gamma buying on the spot move higher from the xrp ruling especially in ethereum that that is just completely played second fiddle to BTC pretty much all this year outside of the chapel which you which you mentioned and you know it's it was pretty much all one-way flow and it turns out these guys completely top ticked this thing and and from your Twitter Marley Marty it kind of seems like something that you you saw coming you know implies now are back in in the mid 30s looks like Marty Marty wins again right like so when you when you saw this Spike higher in spot involved like did you see this as kind of an opportunity to initiate um some new short Vol positions you know that you know would have paid off well or you know were you managing risk of shortfall positions that you had on and you know potentially temporarily offsides on the move sure yeah a front end picked up like a lot especially in eth but not necessarily Bitcoin because I think eth was riding this uh eth is not a security hype right so that was like instant pickup on the front end uh but you never saw like the uptick in involve a little bit later right you never saw the end of the year you never saw March you never saw June even pick up like at all if I remember correctly it might have even been down um and it seemed crypto Twitter was euphoric like always right you can only be on Twitter so much you can only you know don't listen to anybody on Twitter there's only like five people know what they're talking about besides that we're all there for fun and games and uh you saw like eth really pick up in this short short uh short-term stuff we covered a lot of our uh short shortfall positions but it wasn't like oh like oh my God we got blown out Loris is like baking a cake you know like it wasn't like it wasn't like this Grand inducing event like if we would have saw the back end pickup we would have made a lot more money it wasn't like a super crazy day for us um put some more positions on uh towards towards like the end of that hype cycle but it wasn't like uh you know we probably could have just stayed where we were and made even more money but we still collected data every day and um unfortunately you know we don't have like a billion dollars to play with or I think it would be a totally different story I'm pretty comfortable where we're at managing this little Boutique you know sub 20 million um micro Boutique fund we have a lot of say on what we can do and not a lot of uh You Know Chief investment officers trying to make a make a play or trade or trying to make a play right now what what are the um what do like the core kind of strategies you you tend to put on to express this View yeah yeah I mean the more complex it gets the you could just really just one line one simple words just sell more Vault right just trying to do as much volume as we possibly can so we get you know uh okay x and by bid and some of these other guys you know hopefully we get a gold star from them and they like us um and then hedging out the the Greeks with some perps and some spot and and it's all become automated now it used to be like I don't know let's let's short their strangle with with a few clicks let's put this on and let's let's um rehedge every hour every 30 minutes at like the very beginning right and then instantly saw like oh that's only going to work so well if you're only playing with the small chip stack we need something that can scale Marty um so like you know broadly and you know Investment Management space like in crypto it's kind of all about like how well you can manage your Capital so how like how do you go about sort of managing like cross exchange and like different margin requirements and C5 or C5 like how does that look for you sure the problem that I'm seeing now is there's money to be made because in in C5 defy or a mix of of all um there's a different price on every exchange of every hour of the day the issue that and maybe the reason why it's not fully armed out yet is because of capital requirements right on some of these D5 things you need 100 margin so oh my God you're going to put I don't know a million dollars on a smart contract let's say to make a thousand dollars oh God please let's not do that right you can only uh it would be a lot easier if there was some more margin ah it'd actually be better if there was a prime brokerage for all D5 and if somebody's making this just ping me because I would love this if there was a margin like one margin for all defy of all the protocols this would be a game changer for sure right you could play uh send quote you can play a Avo avocado or they opposed to avocado so I always call them the avocado exchange you could play these guys uh on one margin book and oh my God it would be life-changing but I think all of these different pricings would be priced out instantly you have Lyra Premia sing quote all these guys right well I want to talk a little bit about it's a pretty interesting case of you know short Vol going wrong you know that that that happens over over these um past few weeks you know we've we've discussed continuously on the big picture you know the presence of this this large ethereum overrider in the market that was very active you know throughout q1 and Q2 these guys don't trade on Paradigm so we're we're happy to happy to talk about it and we've been tracking the positions of this overrider and what's very interesting is on last week's xrp driven rally we saw this entity in what appears to be complete Panic covering mode you know buying back a large amount of their short upside positions you most notably was with these March 2300 calls which was the largest open position of this entity I think they in the March 2300 calls in early June they sold around 400k Vega of this thing and they they sold it so if you'll see see on that chart the majority of this flow was occurring where that left arrow is and being sold at 44 Vol and when they bought it back last week to cover this thing you know he was paying roughly 52 yeah and the as I mentioned you know the Vega trade initiation in this strike was a roughly around 400k so on the Vol move alone they lost eight Vols on this and you know eight balls on 400k and you know this is an underestimate too you know given the Vega exposure uh being dynamic in both spot and Vault so just looking at where this guy opened and closed this trade you know they crystallized a three and a half to four million dollar loss on this thing and you know we saw this and honestly we weren't really surprised to see the covering when we saw you know the large move in the long dated fall we one thing that we've been working on a paradigm is this thorough derabit ethereum wallet analysis basically looking at the inflows and outflows into the major darabi wallets from the start of when this program was going up and the the main takeaway of that is we did not see you know inflows into Dara bit that would have been enough to sufficiently collateralize the these positions on the Move higher unless they already had a ton of funds and you know that were just sitting there dead on there a bit which seems like a pretty inefficient use of capital to me so the natural conclusion is that they needed to cover all this risk and you know we would assume that the program is over for the time being and it could be I could be wrong it's it's impossible to know for sure but like you know Marty you have first hand experience in shortfall strategies like did you see this flow like how do you prevent your shortfall strategies from significant drawdowns to the point where you know you're closing down positions and you know you might be out of the market for a while this is the same guy that does like the on on book quoting right it's the same main player that that was aspect right for the last I don't know a year and a half or whatever so that's the same major player yes yes it is yeah I mean not every major player is always going to be right I think that that guy won a lot and kept winning a lot a lot a lot and kept winning over and over and over and you can only win so much um maybe it was a little too panicky right because we instantly saw it just flow back down and I don't know who who he is or she is right we don't know I don't know if it's a minor or if it's an entity or if it's a fund or whatever right um how when you're looking at this like were they better off probably just holding on their positions or re-adding collateral I I think that this BlackRock followed by this xrp ruling really put a lot of people on tilt or on edge or offsides whatever terminology you want to use I didn't necessarily feel like super risky I didn't feel like oh my God I need to cover everything we covered some but we still collected data the next day right it wasn't like oh we need to go long super long dated stuff we need to change our whole strategy today um still like I said in the beginning there's still no real Catalyst we've had the catalysts like these were supposedly the blacks the upside Black Swan Catalyst the BlackRock is coming to bring us to Valhalla the SEC is probably going to lose every single case from here on out right because now how are you going to say eth is a security or not a security or or some or some of some other coin what was interesting there which I don't think a lot of people even realized was that the SEC said it xrp was a security when offered privately to funds but it wasn't a security when offered to the public which seems a little backwards right yeah if anything it's a little backwards right I mean they're going to go back to court they're going to go back to the drawing board this this fight isn't necessarily over um when when you see somebody like this this ether overrider guy win over and over and over of course he's going to get his face ripped off once but I think that it was maybe he was too jumpy you know like yeah we're back at a 40 handle right like uh CPI was what like a 50 let's say right and we're below that and they're like Jesus Christ like if we hit that 20 I'm done dude I can't come back until we get above 20. I gotta go trade Trad five products which is totally okay I'll go trade some some AI stocks and and follow the shiny new toy if I have to but yeah I think just essentially the guy team whoever over overreacted I think that maybe they could have posed some more collateral they could have wrote it out for 48 more hours and and come out on the other side of it as probably the  goat Trader of all time if they wrote that one out yeah yeah exactly we were really surprised by by how quick you know this guy was was willing to cover and you know I mean you saw where these these things were printing too right it really only trades with with what looks like you know one market maker so I mean this Market maker I imagine made an absolute killing on the way in and out on this thing yeah you just have to look like go ahead and he's on your knees on your hat Marty yeah yeah whoever is the market maker or whoever is this guy I will send you a box for free okay a 10 pack I'll send you a 10 pack okay of the discontinued merch yeah you need that one after that play for sure no it just could it could have been one one of these events like that we saw 40 handle to 80 handle you know and imagine that loss that he would have accrued on on something of this scale right losing three four million bucks after making I don't know we can go back and do the math right on the last year and a half uh I don't know you made 100 million let's say just randomly oh you lost three well whatever you know still still happy right um yeah it's definitely could have been a lot worse it could have I mean we could have saw 70 80 handle and imagine we saw that in in two hours uh like an FTX black Black Swan or something like that uh yeah he would have literally had his face ripped off and Loris would have baked the cake for sure yeah yeah we're kind of on of the assumption that you know maybe you know this program you know might be over a little bit for the time being but as you said right all look at all the other trades that that had done quite well would not be surprised if this guy's you know back ready to play again and you know Q3 Q4 yeah and just go look at like all these people trying to buy Vol especially in like a directional way it's like if you don't get that big move and if you don't get that big move fast essentially you lose every day every time you pay Theta you oh my God this I even like retail I had a buddy who oh I put on some directional plays of decent size for retail and I was like oh have you looked at your Theta tab he was paying like 2 500 bucks a day and I was like do you even know what what that is do you even know like what that means or you just like just straight out you know punting you know 100K option long like you know 100K cash long and he was like yeah I'm just over here gambling basically so I don't know this besides like the smart ball players and the Trad five guys that have come to the Vault space uh options is still just still like a whole new yeah we see it we see we don't even know the words like um especially like an execution style and kind of like what Joe's saying earlier and how people like well top ticket and like the Flows In the last side of it um you know people just because people come from the like from paradigms like view right so we have you know like a group of takers and that are just directional directional traders that will come in when like an xrp ruling comes out or like CPI day or things like that and when they come in they come in the flows are just so aggressive and like just so violent and they're always on the move and then the next day it's nothing like you're collecting data you know like there's not really much it just is so quick and then I feel like they're on the wrong side so often but I agree with you that the big players and you know the smart shot Five Guys Who do like size bigger and they're usually like in a little bit earlier like obviously they're the ones yeah successful at the end of the day um but yeah we do see so much of Jumpy flow I like that go ahead what's your um obviously right now as well we're very much in this um positive spot Vol correlation World um so I'm always interested when someone who's kind of running a consistently short vowel um does that does that overlap with a view that spot's not going anywhere soon or are you are you kind of um you know neutral on that you know if we just grind higher and grind to all 35 40K you know vol's not going to do a lot on that like how are you viewing spot within that within the uh Vault view that you have yeah I mean wouldn't you trade on dare a bit um or I guess even okay X right it's all coin margin right so essentially you want the Vault regime to shift and you want to be just balls long and you want to be coin margined and you want to double dip in in the profits but right now it just seems for us just to be collecting more coins every day let's make a little more coin a little more coin and I can't wait until the ball regime shifts whenever it comes and just be balls long and just make a killing and put out new memes and the you think the short ball memes are good wait till the Long Haul moves right I'm just trying to pass time right now I'm trying to have a laugh you know uh essentially it's been boring but boring is good right especially as a short ball player you want just to be boring you want to collect data every day you don't want this spot uh I'm happy right here 30k and 1900 I don't want it to move right um it's been like I don't know but so long in this range like of eth 1600 to 2000 I think it was like 100 plus days like that's amazing for us right I don't want this that's uh this I don't know let's say fifteen hundred three thousand fifteen hundred three thousand I want these more tight shorter ranges for longer periods of time um whenever the ball regime shifts and we're not super max short right now like we were um I think we're positioning for Q4 and q1 of next year kind of like everybody else hoping that this uh maybe there's even a front run of the having and that brings back some flows so just some more not macro but more bigger picture plays instead of oh my God it went from 43 to 42 and the next day it went from you know 40 to 43 to 42 handle or today it's 40 like we're still just down and to the right if you just look at the default chart right if I really want it just to come back organically without a Black Swan because you don't want a Black Swan like binance going down to and to bring back fall that would not be good for anybody and you know traffic will continue to laugh at us right um yeah coming out of that it's just I can't wait until we're just balls long and it's just so much easier just you could just hold spot in 10x like that's always fun for everybody you know but I have to make money every quarter I can't make money every 10 years right I'm not a 10-year fund right people can redeem every quarter and we're not that big right we don't have a billion dollars like you know if you're redeemed I don't know 10 million you redeem half the funds like oh geez you know maybe I'm out of business right but if if I want leverage and you know long vowel exposure and I look at some of the performance of these crypto equities right like sure like BTC looks like a complete dog you know compared to some of these um compared to some of these equities that actually has you know decent uh option markets right like I'm looking like mstr Marathon here let me I have a chart here um right here right so like if if I want to play that sort of long ball and look I unders I understand that you're going to be paying much more premium for these things these things are trading around 110 1 120 but but marathon and Riot up 400 you know mstr 215 I have Nvidia there just for comparative purposes I mean coinbase certainly it's a different animal but like it's up 90 or whatever over the past month right if you want these sort of you know upside convexity long ball sort of plays sure agree you're paying for it no nobody's denying that but like kind of seems like the better place to be paying it playing and I think in like existentially you know it's one of these when I think about the current state of the crypto option markets let's say like I am just some retail guy right you know whether I'm offshore or onshore retail guy I'm sitting on the sidelines I have some dry powder like why would I go long Vol in darabit BTC options if I'm looking for that upside convexity to capture you know this next Bull cycle if I want leverage just trade the crypto equities these are leveraged crypto businesses like if I want leverage on Leverage why do I just trade options on these crypto equities right look eight no one's denying that 80 upside and BTC is is you know it's still a damn great performance and of course you're going to expect magnified Moves In in these crypto in these crypto equities but like when I think about it from an adoption standpoint and look I'm not I'm not Shilling Paradigm Kool-Aid by any means on this because obviously we want this BTC uh you know crypto native option Market to grow but like I know my funds are going to be safe at Fidelity or Schwab or wherever the hell I'm trading this thing I can earn four and a half percent on my cash by keeping my money in the Fidelity account sure I'll pay more premium on like a Bitcoin miner Equity but the thing realizes a lot more and it outperforms and if I'm a retail guy I'm trading directionally anyways I just want gamma and convexity you know I don't need to deal with managing funds on multiple venues I don't need to deal with lack of regulatory Clarity and the crypto Vol Market uh you know on darb is a full of all sellers like Marty that just grind the market to a halt so like you're like am I am I crazy here like if you can access crypto crypto Vol exposure and already a relatively clean way with a lot less headaches and things to worry about like cross margin whatever like why wouldn't as a Speculator wouldn't somebody just trade crypto Equity options yeah yeah uh for us personally right we're a crypto only fund so it's like it would be illegal for me to go take that money and go trade stocks right so let's not do that but my personal portfolio is up big right January and March publicly on the Twitter I was like balls long Nvidia just super uh some leap super long leaps one two year leaps and chairs and I was like an AMD if if that's the future I don't know chat GTP was like this hype in I don't know January or February that this time everybody was using it I was like if this is the future then essentially trip to the Future just go buy the chip makers well that that played out on my personal portfolio right and too bad I don't have 10 billion dollars to go make 50 billion right but um I don't think that even retail thinks about what you just said essentially maybe that's why they need to watch your pod right they're just like oh bitcoin's the best performing asset or eth is the future of money or the internet and I just want to be long crypto but they don't realize that they could go make a billion dollars in the stock market and be able to bank that money right go try to make a billion dollars in crypto then go show up at Bank of America and oh hey you guys want to take my billion dollars they're like no sorry you know you have to go find some other wealth manager to go handle that money for you I was telling my wife uh I guess like a month or two ago kind of when like the world was ending in the crypto oh what is it 16k I don't even know when that was November December I was like ah maybe I'll go back to stocks right maybe we'll you could make a billion dollars and go bank that money and not have any regulatory issues or anything like that um but I decided to to raise a new fund and stick with crypto and I live in Brazil I guess we could transition a little bit into that like the regulatory US versus Brazil but Brazil is coming out with a full regulatory framework for crypto essentially as long as it's the one-liner is if it's not a scam it's okay um you can't advertise derivatives to retail like on Twitter buy bit and somebody else binance by bit and finance got in trouble for doing this but let's say if you go to buy bits website and it's in Portuguese if you change it to English you can still trade derivatives it just can't be like publicly on Twitter or uh on billboards and and things like this like the advertisements um I I think that Brazil is probably the next bigger player right I just had lunch with a few guys that were in Brazil for some business in the crypto business I'm not going to name them but um this is becoming like the next hub we're gonna be the first ones to do the digital currency we'll be the guinea pig right the digital hey Al will be the guinea pig for the rest of the world we're 220 million people with sound financial system and soon to be crypto regulated markets and all these other things right now it's like this still a little wild west but as long as it's not a scam it's totally okay you can trade any crypto you can have leverage you can trade options it's unlike the US where um you can't even get on there a bit right you can't even get on uh any sort of derivative exchange you're stuck trading on finance us Kraken and uh I think that's it right Ledger X is finished so where Where Are You Gonna trade uh coinbase yeah but then you pay so many pieces but again retail doesn't even think about that right I think it just goes back to maybe stupidity like oh I'm I'm long Bitcoin I'm a Bitcoin Maxi I'm sticking it to the government while still paying your taxes or you know whatever else back to your thing Joe like yeah I just don't think like people even think about that imagine you bought Riot Mara uh Nvidia or any any of those players for upside even if you're just holding shares you have less risk than holding Bitcoin outright you don't have to self-custody you don't have to worry about a defy hack you don't have to worry about a bridge hack you can Bank the money yeah I just don't think people even think for themselves a little bit right they're just like Oh I'm a Bitcoin Maxi and that's it yeah no that makes sense where you guys are like in terms of regulatory like I know in the states are screwed Brazil's open I haven't even followed up on Europe David maybe you could give some yeah I mean I mean I I guess uh particularly the UK probably got quite good history in terms of exploiting that regulatory Arbitrage angle and and there's definitely a very open sort of constructive um approach to regulation here so it's very consultative um and yeah we're in we're in the process of of sort of laying out a framework within which we can work and and Europe as well uh very similar so it definitely feels um a lot more friendly an environment I guess um and yeah one that's open to I think I think um a very critical always of of the regulator and and the UK government but we're we seem to be taking a a sensible approach um recognizing that we can't necessarily shoehorn existing regulations um into crypto so yeah it's um it's very open I mean Rishi a prime minister he's um he's very keen on crypto he said in past he's he's he's bought crypto traded it or have you um so he he gets it he gets what the opportunity is um maybe in a post-brexit world we we're kind of looking to protect the city of London a little bit as well um so so being open to you know we don't want to be closing too many doors there but yeah it's um there's quite a good Buzz certainly in London and definitely I think across Europe um and it feels like The Regulators are kind of getting their ass into gear same I guess across like Asia and and the middle least and there's um yeah it feels like the US are kind of falling behind everyone else at the moment yeah I mean everyone that we see you know us um just just more more and more you know companies just just moving offshore um whether those are you know crypto Banks or you know trading operations or VC firms you know Anderson Horowitz obviously the you know the main example setting up office in the UK and yeah I mean even even me and me and Steve going going down to Brazil for four for a month or so and then you know we'll we'll be over in the UK shortly you know after that you know it's very clear you know the writing the writing is on the wall you know the UK Europe or Asia or Brazil are kind of you know the places to be I think I think as well like you know we live in an increasingly like globalized World um and I I guess crypto you know is is kind of like the next Evolution into like this kind of borderless World um so it's very very difficult for even that let's have some respect for the US in terms of its size and importance but the these these uh businesses now tend to be Global in a way um and they can then move and go to where the the regulatory regime is going to welcome them and make business easy um so I I kind of I kind of I'm expecting the us to do an about turn at some point um when they when again the Money Talks at the end of the day and once they see money walking out the door um and they're you know there's some pretty lumpy fiscal deficits that they've gotta they've got a service so um I think I think uh what's the saying that uh you know politicians they do the right thing once they've exhausted every other Avenue it kind of feels like the US will get there but they need to do it quick because you know things build in pretty rapidly elsewhere and we're actually seeing it right we're seeing businesses move out the US now and and go set up elsewhere in in more friendly jurisdictions um and and yeah Marty yourself you're out in Brazil yeah no I think what's what's funny there being a burger originally myself like the burgers only think that there's only burger land there's not the rest of the world right and the SEC is the the enforcer of the world financial markets well that's not how it works right and I think that recently they've really overstepped like their grounds on on just just I don't want to get too into it but essentially like how are you going to enforce something when you don't have any rules you have some book from the Securities laws from 1940s amazing can we just rewrite those rules and if you just clearly state that this is illegal and this is not illegal this is a security and this is a commodity if you just State those simple things and if you do this then it's illegal and if you do this then you're okay to do whatever and have clear sound financial markets then none of this would be happening right they wouldn't be losing out on Innovation and I know that USD is the one deserve currency but I I'm not at the point I was at the point but I'm not like a Bitcoin Maxi anymore after going through everything I used to be maybe I'll be wrong right but I don't think that like oh my God we're gonna move Bitcoin from Central Bank to Central Bank to settle debts like yeah maybe when I'm dead cool have fun you know but like today that's not how it works in the next five ten years I don't know unless the US goes Bust or something in the next 50 years I guess then maybe but um no other currency right now looks fit to be the world Reserve currency and that's not a burger statement right that's uh yeah yeah I mean we we've spoke about on here before like we've kind of debunked the whole the dollarization sort of narrative I mean particularly in the world of Foreign Exchange you know it's a relative game right and who else is going to take over that that Reserve sort of mantle certainly not China um you know unless you're going to open your Capital markets and and have free Capital markets there so yeah it's um yeah I'm kind of with you on that um I'm not seeing that with China right like Sequoia just had to totally separate their China fund and the US fund now it's like Sequoia China like it's not owned by the well it's probably owned somehow you know somebody has some Stakes somewhere but it's not owned by like Sequoia funds you know San Francisco or whatever they are uh Stanford I guess right next to Stanford right and it's like oh the one of the biggest players in the game is totally like cutting off their China arm of course it's still going to run of course it's gonna do this but but who wants to go become a CEO and some in China when they just show you and tell you can IPO and that's just like not not cool and not safe again like you just people have to come out with regulations and laws if it's crypto or stocks or companies Venture and and then people play with those rules they play in that sandbox and in the US right now is losing out on this whole crypto crypto regime whatever that is whatever follows that mean in the future and I think that's the most frustrating thing right because like most of us you know that are involved in this space and particularly from the institutional world I think like every everyone just wants that Clarity right we I think we're all in agreement like no one wants consumers getting burned no one wants you know um criminal activity being involved in in crypto you know we kind of want all those protections but also you know there's there's we want the Innovation we want to do business in the space um so I think it's frustrating because actually the the world is you know the crypto world is crying out so yeah give it give us the rules tell us what they are so at least then we know we could you know what we're playing with um I think that's I think that's the the massive frustration from from so many people in terms of how the US are approaching it and unfortunately it feels like certainly in the UK we're taking a lot more um open approach and open-minded approach to it I think it goes back to if the bankers have something that they can make money with some product that they could sell then there will be a hundred percent shift 180 you know turn shift in one day overnight I think if the bankers have a product to sell I don't know a spot ETF or leverage ETF or all of them at the same time you know and you have uh various other crypto ETFs tracking what we have on the screen right now once that happens and the and everybody has something to sell and there's money to be made then sure but right now like totally anti-crypto from the SEC I don't know if that changes when if or when cancer gets replaced uh it's just a sad thing because the US used to be like Innovation everything open markets everything you know America we have rights screw you basically right and now it's like well poof the candle just blew out you're totally missing out on this yeah sure go trade your tech stocks and of course they're still I don't know four trillion dollars of USD moved in Swift every day of course you're still the world Reserve currency but you kind of just missed out on like a new new flow of innovation which is uh not not what the US has been Stan been created on stood for whatever you want to say so yeah moved down to Brazil and I I can't vote right so whatever politics doesn't doesn't affect me uh I pay my taxes it's only a 15 percent under a million dollars a year 15 uh capital gains tax and then I still have to pay those damn Burgers a little bit forever unless I get rid of the passport what's the uh what's the crypto Vibe like Martin uh Brazil in Sao Paulo it's getting bigger right um and in Brasilia which is like our Washington DC um Brazil is in like the middle of the country and Sao Paulo south of Rio South of me um it's getting bigger all of the banks are now doing something in the space um even new bank which is like a online uh bank for younger people you know they give you access to credit card and Banking and it's on a cool app and whatever right oh you can buy crypto inside the banking app well imagine you could buy crypto inside of I don't know your Wells Fargo or Bank of America app like that would just be a cool thing right it's not leveraged it's just spot they cussing it for you it's inside your banking app oh that's cool um and if you're in Rio it's not like a big thing uh specifically in Brazil crypto has been like us used for scamming and and send me usdt or and scamming and sports bet scams and all these other scams so the people are a little like standoffish a little bit but then you go to especially in Rio because there's been a lot of these Bitcoin scams one of the biggest Bitcoin scams I think was in Brazil too and then you go to Sao Paulo and it's totally different right the suits are on it the banks are on it they want to make money they want products to sell and uh once the CVM which is the Brazilian SEC comes out with their crypto regulation which they had 180 days to draft it and up and 180 days to implement it so within the next year or so um and again that's just like the one-liner it's if it's not a scam it's okay and you can't uh publicly advertise derivatives to the public but you can offer them so that will be a total regime shift you have uh fire blocks down here you have a lot of hedge funds down here you have a lot of uh people get getting into the space especially bigger Banks unlike the US I don't know like you don't see Bank of America you don't see Wells Fargo you don't see First Republic like off it's just even offering crypto inside of the app that that would just be a game changer of of stance in the US right yeah for sure it's an interesting world for sure down here like uh a lot of people had to have a hard life right minimum wage is 200 a month and then you have a huge wealth Gap to the people who own all the farms and all the oil and all the stuff and you know billionaires driving Rolls Royce or multi-millionaires driving Rolls Royce and whatever and uh there's a market here people people always like to gamble here if it's sports betting if it's crypto like there's a total market for I don't have whatever roll bit or whatever kind of you know gambling crypto sites there's a full Market down here already and the next phase is like this digital hey Al and more like the institutional route not like retail not focusing on like investing or oh how can we trade with uh all of the maricos tool which is all South America how can we trade with South America how can we settle it instantly well it's going to be some sort of tokenization of some money whatever they want to call that whatever kind of coin they're more taking this government and institutional approach instead of trying to Shale to retail basically yeah well awesome uh really really uh cool hearing
