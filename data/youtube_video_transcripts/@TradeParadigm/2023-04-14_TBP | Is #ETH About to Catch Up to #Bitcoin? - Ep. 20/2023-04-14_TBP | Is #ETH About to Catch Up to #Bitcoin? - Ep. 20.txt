[Music] hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of life hey guys welcome to the big picture my name is Joe Crewe I'm at Paradigm in the weeds around everything crypto of all markets I'm joined here by my colleague David Brickell as well as Gordon Grant from Genesis who's becoming a more regular guest on the podcast and very very happy about that really glad to have you here Gordon greetings chance good morning yeah let's so I think we should obviously a big day right with um with the chappella upgraded and I'm kind of excited because it feels like this is the first time this year on this podcast maybe in the the short history of the big picture where we're not really meeting with Bitcoin and you know Bitcoin optionality which has been the main narrative for the year and so I think it'd be a kind of like a good good start um to basically frame what the convo around like what we what we've been seeing pre-upgrade and then what we're seeing this morning so with the Chappelle upgrade we had previously been discussing like this you know lack of interest in ethereum optionality leading up to this event because you kind of have this unclear net outcome of you know new interests coming in versus you know outflows given the withdrawal flexibility or or potentially just because BTC had this more compelling narrative and I mean just like as a few data points right so in March Bitcoin option volumes versus ethereum were the highest since 2021. so on Paradigm 77 of all the optional notion world that was traded in the month of March which was the biggest month for crypto options ever uh on us was you know Bitcoin outpacing ethereum three to one and and then this chart on the right by kaiko it's a very similar similar phenomenon that's occurring you know in the spot markets where you know ethereum spot is only 30 of the volumes and uh Gordon I'm kind of I'm kind of curious in in terms of what were you seeing before the before the event right the only flow that we're really seeing on Paradigm was you know maybe we saw some some covering of some 2000 strike calls you know but this kind of just felt like you know not really risk additive more so like dealers covering before the event yeah I think that's right I mean either completely uh suffered um what I would call asphyxiation by dominance um you know to put it neatly this year and bottomed at 41 um in early to mid-January and has been on a tear um and the story The Narrative that's driven Bitcoin back above the 30 000 level really hasn't they're in any meaningful way we all knew that the chapel upgrade was going to happen they all knew about of it technological complications and thresholds about bonding periods withdrawal limitations what could occur and respect to that but it just hasn't really part of the narrative we also all know that for a period of time there's been a size overrider in um for options Market really weight on upside down the other day there's a stellar 1800 1900 000 calls or call spreads um in September in particular which has written this most would say pretty horrendous of all compression Bitcoin right down mid 50s for curved Tanners like June um we saw a trickle from core dedicated clients of ours you know who have been looking for ketchup playing either start to scoop shorter dated upside um in the weeks leading up to this event with a little more fervor over the past few days and that's obviously built to something of a small fever pitch overnight right um all on the one week tenor was as low as 53 54 um last Friday it rolled up very fiercely over the weekend such that you basically could have bought a strangle or a straddle and held it for free not paid away any Theta um has been a steady demand since then most people are still feeling fairly complacent about ether right to the extent that we were 1900 000 today it's not a market that's yet running away but when we say that it's important for if there is a much smaller Market than Bitcoin when it comes to options when it comes to the ability of option market dynamics to influence the spot performance and the amount of gamma and Vega that's out there you know still at the 1900 2000 level is not inconsequential so you know in some sense there's kind of this weird sort of um you know is it underpriced or is there something going on which I'm not aware and so when we see people saying okay you know what I'll Scoops are created optionality now um well he's just moved 100 bucks right so um that's a five percent move you know inside of 24 hours which annualizes to um close for like 100 um and so I think today for the first time right looking at the Paradigm tape and seeing what's hitting um you know the the blotter on the institutional liquidity Network much more of a Vega oriented uh strip of trades on the tape longer dated calls and call spreads linear options and a little bit more of a convex position um I think there are very sound kind of technical reasons to believe that if we can break out from the gravitational pull of those large overrides that we may see some significant acceleration to the upside purely from a volatility perspective all else equal right and especially if Bitcoin is going to continue to remain well supported at 30 000. right yeah um and those those overrides are a big part of it and you know that's flow that we really didn't see um until after after the merge occurred and you know just just for context uh after the merge on a monthly basis we were seeing at least 80 000 Vega being delivered into the market via these systematic overrides um I believe uh you see if you look on the screen as well that that fourth line the sep 2400 2500 calls we believe that this is that same entity uh that sold 30 000 Vega into the market uh this morning it wasn't an override rule but you know it's it's something that has resulted in this you know combined with the you know the macro narrative that is you know more conducive to owning Bitcoin versus ethereum that is kind of discouraged in our opinion a lot of participants from owning uh from owning that ethereum Vega and I was kind of quite I woke up this morning it was kind of quite surprised you know to see this strong ethereum bid you know I thought it was gonna this was gonna be a non-event right and now finally you know we have these ethereum floats and Falls that that are starting to wake up we're starting to see that demand for that Vega and you know just speaking to some of our clients this morning you know some of our more sophisticated guys that are saying look you know ethereum in the low 60s that's pretty cheap and when you look at it on a historical basis and of course you know there's there's more to to just basically looking oh these are the lows you should buy uh you know for example just because of you know all those overriding flows that have really changed the Dynamics but if you look at that ethereum BTC one month at the money spread you know you could make an argument that the ethereum ball is looking cheap and you know I think you know that's also part of the reason reason why you know spots kind of waking up and we're going through 2000 there's definitely been some talk I don't have the chart now but you know that gets chart that's basically showing that there's a pretty pretty strong uh short gamma concentration around where we are right now so maybe we do get that like higher and honestly it'd be nice to see just because it kind of feels like everything we've been talking about has been you know Bitcoin related I'm not sure how much conviction I have in that you know it kind of still feels to me that ethereum is going to play second fiddle to BTC given given some of the macro narratives at play and this potentially could just be a short-lived phenomenon just given you know we're so close to the event but you know what what's your view on that do you think that you know the eth optionality is gonna is going to come back to focus I mean over the past 24 hours I think it's like the first time this year so the ethereum volumes are Outpost outpacing Bitcoin yeah I mean I I surely would not want to be short East Vega um at these levels that would feel a very comfortable position and I surely would not want to be getting shorter East Vega at higher levels of ball that would also be a very uncomfortable levels um as We Know ease is a market that is um much more susceptible of incremental flows than Bitcoin where you you have I would say a more balanced um erogenous version of Traders Uber Riders miners back Vega Chad fights not a lot right enough basically it's a market here in this level well what if someone came to buy a hundred thousand dollars there you go right now right where is it gonna go um and I I tend to to kind of look at the upside downside and looking at how the term structure is performing today interesting to see that on a factor weighted basis June is actually doing much better than you would expect right so so you're April and your May dates are up whatever three to four points but June is up two to three points um you know for mid-crow tenor and I think that's very telling and if you're a large overrider that short these strikes you're going to have to buy those things back and either sell new strikes or you're going to have to take a look and see you know what this trade is great crushed it made a huge amount of incremental yield accre creation over a period of time is the time that I just don't give that back to the market right and allow youth to have more of a geometric appreciation let's not forget about it it's still a deflationary right asset um you know it's it's got a very um demonstrable rate of token burn that we're seeing the merge it's still an apex crypto asset maybe you know Apex tier 1.5 but but very much part of the fiber of this industry I'm sitting here today broadcasting live watching Symposium at the Deep Center we just said chairman uh listen unequivocally from my perspective there's a Futures Contract on it it's a commodity right and he's clearly stopped up and said and it is a commodity this is big stuff right so every other crypto maybe it's a security maybe it's at risk of that but he's really stupid as a benchmark s in that respectively if your asset allocator if you are a yield Seeker if you are a credit manager um if you are perhaps someone from the crowd advice me Sovereign won't start to look at a certain relative price point as a potential diversifier and we've seen this in the past right we've seen when Bitcoin took off in Q4 um of 2020 right and broke through those 20 highs uh through 20 000 and then went on to its historical run you've had a little bit of a lag but when it catches up it really catches that so what that tells me here is you don't want to be short Vanna you don't want to be short Vega and you you want to make sure um that that if you are playing this options market and you sort of care about convex exposure it certainly gives some deference to Ethan respect and subside potential it's very much silver Dynamic of crypto that we've talked about many times in the past Bitcoin being more of the gold style options Market etherby much more of the Silver Platinum uh on the market Which is far less liquid far more flow driven far more gappy and kurtotic which is saying something because Bitcoin is obvious all of those things and some already right so yeah definitely expect the upside I uh I'm favorably inclined to adhere certainly from a volatility and purely quantitative perspective really encouraging like the comments from cftc um on calling uh I'm calling ether commodity because I I yeah yeah like yeah that's that's pretty huge now I know I know that to be fair they've been leaning more that way anyway and it's the SEC that that are intent of coordinate a security but again yeah I I think I think that's pretty big and I mean I I've said on here before right like the thing with eth obviously Bitcoins had like the digital gold narrative you've had Gensler coming out like calling everything but Bitcoin or security [Music] um we've had the the Shanghai upgrades coming up yeah just bitcoin's just being the cleaner trade um and obviously now we now we're through that upgrade it's just kind of come off without a hitch doesn't look like there's any kind of significant ceiling pressure at the moment um it's kind of now you know um time to play catch up I guess a little bit and if you're starting to get comments from the cftc sort of reaffirming it as a commodity um then all of a sudden you're building a nice narrative now around around ethereum to play catch-up I mean Joe and I are speaking just before we come on on the show about you know I think we've underperformed Bitcoin by about 15 20 percent so just on that catch up alone like probably puts ethereum around on a two three hundred or so and then all of a sudden the two 500 level becomes a magnet um so there's there's a lot of room to to rotate out of Bitcoin and rebalance the walls walls eth and um yeah yeah I completely agree with your sentiments in that it'd be a difficult one to want to be short here and and to be short the vague on this yeah and and you know flow-wise I think you know Joe can speak to this as well we've seen some of our sharper um and start to put on these um you know Bitcoin versus all spread trades the challenge being we're still a ways away from having strike variants as an option for people to elect to trade in in crypto notwithstanding the recent release of default features which um I think even in their current state are far too illiquid to be able to support that kind of structure where it to exist for eth so it's hard because most of the the folks that we've seen putting on those trades have been doing meteor at the money strikes just to get as much Vega on uh long eat and short Bitcoin and the problem is of course that in a geometric rally right for each where you find yourself back at three thousand or four thousand you're going to blow through those strikes and not have um you know exposure to the fixed strike ball that you actually want where you could really get out performance versus Bitcoin and of course that's that's one of the tricky aspects of trading this we've also had people look at each BTC outperformance um you know and we have traded Genesis those ratio options in the past with some of our more dedicated sophisticated institutional grade clients we've seen A Renewed interest in those recently and quite clearly the East BTC crossfall has had far more life in the last three months than it's had at any time previously where realized correlation between each dollar and Bitcoin dollar pair was upwards of 85 percent really wasn't a lot to say about that other than well there could be certain scenarios in which there would be a decoupling but q1 was very much about decoupling between Bitcoin and Eve could Q2 be about a sort of recoupling or decoupling to the top side of these it's entirely possible people have a lot of wins in Bitcoin there's a lot of liquidity in a salubrious fashion it's been created by the Resurgence of Bitcoin it's at a level now where there may well be two-way flow and it could support right let's say a more sustained and idiosyncratic move to the upside by by Ether particularly if cftc is starting to talk like this is definitively a security it's going to remove some of people's uncertainty about about it we're willingness to participate in it um and now it was staking that you get five percent yield or more if you take this Embark it um on on main chain or via staking service um that you believe is the from a regulatory perspective and it's not going to allow it to be designated to security and that's neither a recommendation for or again staking your eat but it's an iteration when you talk about how you treat this acid and what you do with it but certainly it's yield as compared to bitcoin is a factor right that can weigh into people's minds especially in a world of five percent dollar interest rates where you've got a a positive um you know carrying but a negative carry cost to belong Bitcoin at the Curve um yeah yeah I think I think there's certainly some some potential for that spot and involve reversion uh in terms of in speaking of customers in q1 seem to be a fairly consensus trade that the ethereum volves we're gonna we're gonna come in relative to bitcoin especially when we have that really sharp rally you know in January so you know speaking to some of our our customers you know especially like dealer Community you know buying the BTC getting a lift then over the over the counter these guys were getting lifted out of ethereum upside and effectively just running that short versus BTC and then kind of in the lead up to the to the Shanghai upgrade starting to cover starting to cover some of that short ethereum that they were using to fund that that long BTC and health I mean we're even seeing some some of that even more this morning you know from what we've heard there was a fair amount of short dated OTC flows that were being bought I mean look at the third line seven thousand of those April 21s 2200 calls being bought uh in our in our view and even before the merge uh or not the merge uh the Shanghai upgrade we we saw a lot of those 2000 calls uh being covered as well so it could be the case that this is you know this unwinding of this spread is something that potentially takes us back uh and provides that catapult for spot and all higher uh Gordon you're on mute I was just going to say optically right taking a look at the order book here and seeing where you know there's actually still a good depth of liquidity you're you know 40 to 50 Delta strikes um for you know Q4 and ether still um you know these are not even 62 Vol on the offered side it's really quite incredible in that respect to I think that we've had these moves but the pattern recognition suggests that when things start to Boogie you get demand in the front of the curve at first you will get some some back rotation of the term structure of volatility and eventually if the move sustains itself you get players who are better capitalized with p l behind them to be able to reach for Vega and win your options and that I would say is more of my central pace for thinking about how either um you know options market and volatility service can evolve from here there's any um like psychological damage from the merge last year when we saw fans putting on some sizable sort of topside sort of Vega plays and some really wingy stuff and and um obviously we didn't get anywhere near that and and not not because of eighth necessarily but obviously things that happen a bit of FTX and what have you um do you think there's some like once Bill and twice shy it's website psychology behind it that people didn't want to go pulling on sizable trades into this event I think so I think that's right um going into the merge was sort of the second uh and a slightly less pronounced in ether that we have seen since um 2021 everybody remembers the Q3 2021 volatility squeeze that was at least in part catalyzed by some of the comments of a well-known Twitter proponent um you know who suggested that the best trait for folks to do was go out and buy 10 000 plus strike calls further out the curve to gain what we would consider to be an upside convex exposure to eth and that drove Vols from let's say the the upper double digits well into the triple digits from the strikes we saw similar activity again around the merge to a lesser extent but we still saw ethos well into the triple digits um and and of course volatility simply did not perform on an implied basis post-emerge it was some of the sharpest IV deflation I've seen in my lifetime with IVs dropping quickly across the curve from you know the the low to mid triple digits all the way down to about where they are today right from 90 to 80 to 70 to 16 very short succession so yes if you're a risk manager or a risk taker if you are a portfolio manager an asset allocator you really have to have I would say a This Time It's Different pieces to step up and along a significant amount of Vega here and if you're a market maker or dealer book given the relative paucity of liquidity in ether options markets as compared to bitcoin you also need to have a This Time It's Different different thesis because your expected hold time for any given East position and your expected Edge capture in the event that you need to liquidate on a risk-adjusted basis is far less than Bitcoin right it is starting to suffer from those same ailments as let's say the silver options Market compared to Gold to use the prior um you know illusion and analogy I think it can change I think liquidity can get back in but we will really need to see more retail adoption um you know within the youth option space whereby dealers who are holding Vega and those convex positions could get paid out of them by retail flows and whereby we see more institutional grade takers as the kind that Joe has mentioned get back in and start to utilize derivatives as a way to express directional Muse on ease will that happen less clear if you hold ease maybe the best thing to do in some people's minds is simply the stake it on main chain and earn those kind of Juicy rewards if you're wanted in a derivatives perspective you don't get that incremental yield and as a result maybe the characteristics of these as an asset are changing or at least the character to the class of takers that want to express directional use on it are we'll have to see it's it's a very interesting Dynamic call skew is not the cheapest I've seen it here right looking at the curve to September we're seeing um you know 2500 strikes which are almost 50 Delta at this point offered at under 62 ball um in December um and your 10 Delta strikes are almost 74 volt so 12 volts of skew for the 10 Delta Point versus the the 50 Delta point it's you know I would say it's a fair value price for having the optionality it's not rich certainly given the potential for ether and if you're talking about holding a 5k strike could that trade upwards of 90 or 100 implied at all if it really gets going yes absolutely um but you're also going to pay away a heck of a lot of smile Decay to hold that position if it doesn't perform um and you know for people who don't have the ability to warehouse at risk it's a painful proposition sit on something like that without any natural flow to offset it right cool makes sense I think it's a good segue now uh into the macro David obviously big CPI print yesterday yeah [Music] yeah I I mean I I think like the macro just continues to play out Joe as with kind of outlined uh for the last few months um and it continues to kind of follow this this sort of peak inflation Peak rates Peak Peak fed thematic um I mean everyone like there was kind of something for everyone in yesterday's CPI data obviously quite a big fall off on the headline from six percent to five percent uh core core was actually up from five and a half to five point six but but I I think the the kind of General sort of trend is is you know we've seen the peak um on inflation um that's really been supported today by the PPI data um so you saw headline PPI come in at 2.7 down from uh 4.9 uh the month prior so I I kind of think uh given given some the the sort of definitely two-sided risks um to this Market from a growth perspective from the banking sector um uh sort of in instabilities there's plenty there for for the fed you know to take the pause in in may now I think markets pricing like like 70 for a 25-bit hike um that looks a bit high for me so I actually think there's room for that to come a little bit lower um just sort of given the data also something else that was interesting to me um last week like we had a really like poor run of data um we actually started to see some cracks in the labor market um it seems a long time ago now but the jolt survey uh we saw uh job openings full below uh 10 million I think that's like the first time in in two years um that we've been below that number um we saw some massive upward revisions to sort of jobless claims so we started to see some cracks there and then then you had like confirmation that the manufacturing sector is still massively in contraction territory by the ism and then for the first time we start to see the service sector um through the service desire ISM uh looked like that's starting to get hit as well um not quite contraction territory yet um but but still you know we've seen some big give back there so I kind of think the data's really slowing um you know and we we are we are going to reach a pause so whether whether the FED height 25 bips in May or not it looks like it's flat and dumb um now granted the market is still pricing in cuts for the back end of the year but but you know the thing things can sort of change pretty quickly and I'm conscious of the fact as well with it within the macro that we're seeing the inflation data slow I I keep saying that there's you know about a 12-month lag uh between you know in the transmission of fed policy um you know 12 months ago we'd only just started the hike cycle so there's a lot of lagged impact to start to buy it and that's on top of the fact that we've had this this banking sector stress that started to really uh weigh on credit I think the last last two two weeks of March uh sort of Bank lending contracted like like 105 billion or something like that um so so I I think I think there's some really sort of big disinflationary factors at play um that keeps us in this sort of um Peak fed narrative we're approaching the pause and I I still think markets are kind of under position for that um for this change in that macrodynamic um so so yeah like the macro for me is looking good I I still think we get a continuation of of the the themes that we've seen so far in um to start the year um so I mean 30km Bitcoin I guess around number everyone kind of always wants to fade round numbers but but I I think this is just getting going and I don't I don't feel the um I don't feel the Market's particularly heavily positioned for the top side in fact I'd say we're under positions um the other thing that's interesting to me on the macro is is um I always look at China um and the China credit impulse is starting to pick up as well um we had sort of uh loan and Credit Data out yesterday and uh total social financing I've run it down here was it was a 5.4 trillion yuan in March that sat from 3.6 trillion so China as they kind of battled their own slow down and started to really sort of pump credit into the system and and there's actually a pretty strong correlation between um it's between the Chinese credit impulse um and what they're pumping in with with Bitcoin as well as sort of domestic property and equities in China um so again I kind of think you've got a nice liquidity narrative um is still going to underpin this Market running alongside the fact that the FED are approaching a pause I guess the offset to that is is the worries about recession risks um I'm not so worried about that I still think we're a function of rates and liquidity um so um yeah I I kind of think we're going to be all right so so yeah I I I'm still pretty bullish on on crypto and um what's ahead I like the conversation here around you know the potential now for eth to catch up so I I kind of think with the Shanghai upgrade out the way you're going to see some rotation into that um and some catch up trades yeah I I think um I think we're just getting going yeah interesting your thoughts Gordon yeah it feels right I mean look we were just discussing yesterday amongst ourselves in a bit of a boys get together and saying all right so how many markets do you know that just doing 80 rally that just sit there and chill I haven't seen it too often right it's not not men anymore it's crypto periodically does it right where we have these debt function moves these sort of syncopated gaps higher and then we reprice to an equilibrium as unsteady as it is but the fact that we're up here quite comfortably I think the way that we're trading limited pullback no drama no Spike and dip even as we saw the first time we pierced 29 seems to validate your thesis which is to say there's clearly going to be some Supply from the mining Community I'm excited to see the numbers from bit Farms Marathon Riot and others who likely would have been selling into the month of March um we haven't seen from our flow's perspective that many significant um bullish option structures being put on since we Pierce 30k almost incredulous right that you would see the market act in this way and people not coming out to open to call spreads risk reversals one by twos anything that would give you leverage gearing to the upside after all this is the part that lives on this fat-tailed serial autocorrelation and we're just not seeing people playing for that I I think it's partly due to the fact that as you say once bitten twice shy no one wants to say I was still a bag order at 30k after searing 50 rally when you know well we know any number of things are lurking out there including regulatory flood including you know an ostensible negative disposition of you know the say Western Alliance to things that kind of hit at the cracks of the foundation of the banking infrastructure but here we are and the market is trading that way it does very much feel a little bit like that market from let's say summer of 2021 where you know hated it at 15 sort of disliked it in the mid-20s I'm indifferent to it at 30 but at 40. I'll buy this right I'm I'm high on it 40. and as a result maybe we will see some acceleration to the upside if we get there I don't see the policy making rhetoric dialing itself back you kind of have to take it for what it is I think we have to appreciate and respect the strength of the policy making Community by the tone that it sets what was the number one statement that came out of the IMF spring meetings this week it came from Christina Giorgio Who said We believe that the fair value terminal rate for monetary policy in a developed market like the us or Europe is one percent one not two not three not four not in accordance with the rate of inflation just one and there are obvious reasons why they would like to be one including the fact that you know the the overall Financial stability and help the banking system is significantly bolstered um and and the finances of the IMF member countries are significantly bolstered if policy rates are that low because fix this massive hole in the balance sheet of Institutions that leverage long duration at absolutely horrific levels that that's that's the dream that they want to sell to people and as a result I don't see a narrative in which we're going to be talking about runaway inflation even if it's really there or is not going down as much as people want and overall right we're also seeing people talk about the need for other kinds of macro Prudential or fiscal measures to tend to areas of the economy that are correct or otherwise haven't participated in the growth cycle and and let's be serious right this is not a um you know sort of a far into the tale view about the distribution of economic policy or the course of human events over time policy makers rely on controlled senior and monetary valued basement in order to support economic growth this is a fact of life that's why people prefer positive rates of inflation to negative rates this is why the idea of printing paper money and running it as effectively as a business is part of how the West functions it's not an indictment of that policy it's it's not to say that this is all going to blow up overnight but it's simply going to say we're at a point in the cycle where we hit the pain threshold where tightening appeared to be breaking things and policy makers now particularly after the words of the cftc chairman of the Symposium are I think deathly afraid of inducing any further detrimental measures that would jeopardize that sustain that that stability right or the sustainability of the Legacy system as we know it so in that context I feel constructive uh on crypto I think there are is always scope for a pullback there's leverage that's entered the system it's entirely possible that if we break through technical levels at 29 or 28 could we have a quick pullback to those breakout highs in the mid-20s sure obviously it's Bitcoin yeah Jace I think within that as well that I find interesting is like the the price action for me is like super constructive like we've had to have like an 80 odd move um you know you kind of had this move to 30k like pullbacks have been minimal and like anyone looking for a dip to get in like you've not really had a pullback and it reminds me actually over the past year like when we were selling off when when when the the sort of weight of flow is the other way you never really had a big bounce to like to to get short or to get that trade on so it just all feels very orderly and it doesn't it doesn't feel like um it doesn't feel like a move where there's kind of any exuberance or any kind of fomo um you know it kind of It kind of just feels like a slow orderly kind of grind higher punctuated maybe with with some uh short liquidations that give us a few of those little legs up but yeah it doesn't feel like there's any kind of exuberance uh Joe and I were talking earlier about um it still feels like a lack of retail participation um that doesn't feel like he's going to come from the U.S given given the starts and things out there but but obviously in June we've got this big thing happening in Hong Kong where um you know we can start to see some Asian money uh and big size Asian money from the retail Community start to come into the space as well so yeah it just it just feels like constructive um I I'd worry if we'd got the move up here and it was like a volatile sort of whippy sort of move and but you know we're nowhere near those kind of blow-off top type scenarios and then yet the other thing as well um to me is a lot of the fans and people I speak to I've kind of missed the move q1 and they're they're kind of chasing performance and it's difficult if you're a crypto fund a Bitcoin fund like you know if you're massively underperforming the actual move in Bitcoin itself um then you you have to kind of be involved at some point um and kind of almost you know just just kind of start rewinding and having some size in this move so I still think there's a lot of money to come into this this this uh into Bitcoin and obviously ethereum and The Wider space what do you think so if it's not coming from retail where did that impulse come from uh Gordon I know you have some some interesting and unique views around you know Sovereign Sovereign wealth you know coming to the space and you know that coupled with the fact that you know crypto on off payment rails are you know kind of a show of what they were order both liquidity is not there right you you get that strong impulse from maybe a sovereign wealth you know it's it's going to move and it's going to move quick I think so right um we're seeing sovereigns take decisions that have heretofore been inconsistent with prior policy practices um that includes comments from folks like the European Union saying that we're just not sure we should get ourselves involved in other people's crises that's not a statement about Bitcoin that's a statement of um I would say autonomy in terms of their overall thought process and regime we're seeing countries like Saudi Arabia a long time partner to the U.S doing things that are not consistent with the prior our life is in dollars our business partners are in dollars and we look West we don't look East and we're also seeing tactical moves by Regulators it's very encouraging to see what Hong Kong has done they've made a complete 180 in my view from being anti-crypto to being very Pro crypto and realizing almost in a sense that a Mia culpa and trying to bring people back into the fold is valuable creative to what their standard is an independent nation-state um notwithstanding its size of China that is for open Capital markets and Innovation right Hong Kong that clamps down on crypto that wants to walk the clock backwards is not the brand of Hong Kong that was founded by folks like Mika Shang and others that can bring retail in from sectors that were previously either afraid to touch it or discourage from touching it let's not forget there was actual Chinese State media less than a year ago that came out and said holders of Bitcoin should sell everything because it's worthless right that was like a real statement that that came from State sources I don't think that that's the tone that that is being transmitted now given the stance that Hong Kong has taken we've seen Singapore at a sovereign level make its second largest ever gold purchase also another significant data point Mas isn't buying Bitcoin yet but they're buying something that serves a very similar purpose they are value-oriented buyers they're not buying gold at 2000 because they're momentum players they just don't know what else to buy and the price action that that's been mentioned here is consistent with a bid under the market from a player or a number of players that at this point remains somewhat inexplicable bit Loch Ness monster that anytime we really find that we're selling off to those key levels it's right there right the way it was at twenty thousand in the midst of the Silicon not there at twenty thousand incredibly tranquily before it had this you know geometric move it's sitting up here at thirty thousand yet again and you did below 29 extremely well absorbed and we've seen it all the way up could that be a state actor quite possibly I'm more of a view that it's a number of State types in the sense that um there are people who use Bitcoin for real world activities let's leave it at that they don't want to use dollars they don't want to use Swift they don't want to use other kinds of activities either for reasons and convenience or regulatory scrutiny or strictures and that this has become an instrument for financial Transmission in the way that it may have originally been intended to um when it was voice designed and that also keeps a bit under the market folks are not necessarily Keen as they were in the past to hold on to all of their dollars for Reserve management purposes and if Bitcoin is being used for real legitimate trade flows even if it's being traded back and forth there's going to be that bid under the market and I think the other component of this too and we discussed this show is how much sound playing pressure is Bitcoin folks that are mining it in other quarters yes there's been a lot of minors selling that's been quickly absorbed at lower levels that are now 30 40 below this Market but there are now people mining Bitcoin uh starting to mine Bitcoin who do not sell it um particularly in the Middle East and that's a very new Dynamic and so if you put those together you can see greater potential for this kind of Ratchet effect whereby incremental supplies leaving the market Bloomberg coindesk and other reputable news sources have noted the number of Bitcoins that are moving to personal wallets which seem to suggest according to Historic metrics a tendency to want to hold right even at these prices not surprising people are scared about banking system stability and you know the viability of holding dollars in a bank or holding other fiat currency but we're also seeing Emerging Markets right consistently having currency crises whereby Bitcoin actually offers some utility to them whether it's in Nigeria right whether it's a country like Sri Lanka whether it's a Latin American country like Venezuela or Argentina where there is policy heterodoxy that's another source of a bid for Bitcoin and collectively it can create the kind of dynamics that we're seeing I think as observers as Watchers it would always be interesting for us to imagine you know what if the pif is going to announce that they aped into Bitcoin and would not be fun April flooded they bought a bunch of stock which is not working so um you know buying Bitcoin doesn't sound that crazy now if you lost all your money investing in one of the world's supposedly most robust and August financial institutions but I tend to feel that it's more a disparate set of players acting not necessarily in a Cooperative fashion because this meets some needs of theirs right in the current policy environment we're not seeing policy rates being tightened we're not seeing access to Dollars being made any easier let's not forget right Russia is not being welcomed back into full they're not old that Swift is open to you in your Banks we're not being told um in any stretch of the imagination that there is a nuclear deal with Iran whereby they would have an ability to sell their oil for dollars and ten dollars again these things matter right and it's a choice it's a conscious policy choice that has now for the better part of a deck they've driven people out of dollars and into Alternatives like gold and maybe even Bitcoin right let's see foreign do you have any final thoughts no I mean yeah yeah I think I mean that that's a really probably good point to to kind of end things but yeah just um find a thought so yeah like um it's it's a we I think we're a really interesting juncture um in the things that have driven us here um this sort of digital gold narrative um the sense that there's still a lack of participation in this market um and I think everyone just feels this kind of fade and fizzle out um and I think to Gordon's Point earlier um we kind of seen that before in 2021 and and then and then we started to sort of really climb so I think it's going to be really interesting to see how things play out over the next sort of few weeks um because I I kind of feel like there's going to be some towels that get thrown and people just get drawn into this Market because they just have to be in it I think that's a great place to leave it Gordon thanks so much for joining enjoy the rest of the symposium thank you
