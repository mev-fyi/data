could tell you my my thesis and then the trade structure that we like and and Adam you may agree or disagree but I tend to think that what comes out of eth will be replaced by what goes in uh I think that you know institutions like us if we had Solutions where we could stake and then use staked collateral to trade uh that would be huge so if you have institutions with thousands or tens of thousands of bees sitting on the sideline because I can't put it in because there's a liquidity mandate that I have but now it becomes liquid I think there's a huge supply that would be able to come into the ecosystem for steak beef um so yeah I guess the trade I like would be long Delta short Vega which is I think it's uh basically a non-event from the ball side I think it's like a sell the April 14 Vault and and maybe belong the back end while our back end Delta but uh that's the structure that I like to trade in
