hello and welcome to the big picture the Paradigm show where we talk about macro markets and micro Market structure today I'm joined by my unbearably talented co-host David Brickell our resident macro expert and Joe Croy how do you say your name Joe is it Crewe yeah you've been butchering it the past month so I might as well correct you now crewy it's uh it's Hungarian I I think there's maybe like you know five people on this planet that that share that last name it almost sounds like there should be it's spelled krui there should be like those two dots to um loud to over the years but uh yes so is it it so let me say it again is it cruit exactly okay Joe Crue our master of flows um I'm of course uh Justin the intern and I have no special talents just an ordinary desire to live like a human being um but we have lots of interesting things to talk about today so instead of me rambling on Joe why don't you walk us through what you have for us yeah yeah absolutely uh well it's kind of interesting you know I'm I'm back home you know it's it's December and funny enough so in I used to work in equity options and you know I always find myself comparing my experiences there to the ones that I now have in crypto options you know and in before December expiry which I think is right about now in equities this is like the busiest time of the year like I'm sure David's heard of it all the December quadruple witching and like this very like overblown phrase that that people use you know happens four times a year and effectively it's just when you know the index futures um the index options single stock options single stock futures uh it basically expire at the same time so it's like December expert is always like very very busy uh on an investment banking desk which is which is where where I worked on on their Equity options desk and you know you you have all these big hedge funds and asset managers that are rolling their positions out the curve and the largest amount of expiring Equity options is always in December it's just the way it is uh and this year certainly no exception so I wanted to tell you I wanted to take a look I'm like is is crypto following suit like can we there's a lot of similarities between equity options and crypto options but then there's a lot of comparisons that you make where it's like Ah that's not really actually that fair so uh let me just share them just as well on that why does everyone get so excited around um like so I kind of get why there'd be a lot of volatility around it but then um people start drawing lots of conclusions about like expecting big moves once we get through that expiry is that just because I don't know the the strikes that act as an anchor to the market and then we we get through that yeah it's certainly an element of that where like look a lot of people need to trade but then also like you always hear inequity options oh we have this big like chunk of gamma that's expiring uh and it's it's always the case that quarterly expert is um for options tend to be the um you know have the highest open interest in dealer exposure right so it's like oh we have all this long gamma expiring you know long gamma that was potentially keeping that market anchored as you mentioned as market makers you know meet the Hedge and readjust their Delta exposure as the market moves well the way that works is as they readjust their um rebalance their Delta they actually end up muting Market moves in both directions so as as the market is rising you have market makers that are selling into that strength and then as the market is falling to rebalance that Delta they're actually buying into that strength and then as as you guys know as you get closer to expiry and see closer to um you know the ACT where most of the strike exposure is concentrated that is when you have the most gamma exposure so people talk about okay when you know we have a lot of gamma that's that's rolling off the board on December expiry oh maybe this is a catalyst for the market to start moving again right so this is one of the big reasons why why people talk about it at least from like an options perspective but I agree with you there's there's a certain element of this where like it is a little bit overblown and a lot of it is kind of like wishful thinking I remember when I started in the business back in 2017 this is when like realized Vol and s p was like 10 or even lower you know people like oh okay we have all this gamut expiring because people were just hammering Vol systematically and getting dealers washed with gamma okay maybe this is actually a catalyst for the market to start moving again um so yeah that's that's kind of the context there uh let me like the original degens they don't they don't like to associate with it but no jump come on yeah definitely not to the extent in which we are okay that's why I got out of that um give me a second uh as I was mentioning you know December expiry is always the busiest in EX in uh Equity options so we wanted to look at it in crypto as well and kind of see you know what what's the story here right and the results are like pretty surprising right so if you look at it here so like this um these yellow ones down here Bitcoin open interest rolling off in ethereum openness interest rolling off so 55 of Bitcoin open interest and about 51 of ethereum open interest is expiring by the end of the year and of course most of that is going to be concentrated in the December 30th expiry which is you know the standard end of month expiry for crypto so I've looked at these numbers I'm like Jesus that seems like a lot like as I mentioned before I I kind of use my experiences in equity options as a barometer monitor for how I would view crypto and as again like some of those comparisons that are are kind of fair some of them are not fair but I thought it was like damn that is quite a lot of open interest that is expiring in the next couple weeks and like is this going to be replaced right or is like the open interest can just gonna completely fall off a cliff as we as we um up get into the new year so I compared this to s p options open interest and I'm sure David can lament about this as well like not having access to a Bloomberg anymore is certainly in pain so I I went on the internet the old-fashioned way and I pulled up an s p uh options chain and basically downloaded all that data to Excel and looked in to try to determine how much s p option opened interest is rolling off the board and then comparing that to what's happening in crypto so in s p only 28 percent of the of the option open interest is rolling off and you'll see here I'm comparing I'm only using data from December 2022 to September 2023 I'm only looking at those expiries kind of just for an Apples to Apples comparison because these are the expiries that exist uh in Bitcoin and ethereum right so 28 of s p open interest is rolling off by the end of the year which is about half of what is rolling off in crypto and I looked at this data I was like Jesus like that that is a massive difference uh in the cryptos versus Equity open interest and what I wanted to do like I was like why is this the case and and David I'll ask you not to put you on the spot what do you think what do you think is the big reason why um the crypto open interest is rolling off so much larger than uh yeah well I mean I mean I I guess it's just that well partly partly being a smaller Market in a way um so I I guess um these periods can can be exaggerated but I I I'm assuming obviously post FTX and everything that's gone on um there's just been a lot of risk that's been taken down uh we've got some existing stuff that was probably put on a while ago um that people will run you're broken up the right tree there is it coming from the eat merge yup it's it's all merged trades that are expiring worthless that's that's the reason why this the open interest is massively falling off so like I'll move to the next slide here [Music] um I'm sick that's actually crazy right so if you look if you look at the largest trades that went up on Paradigm between the dates July 15th and August 15th it is absolutely staggering like like David I I can imagine like the amount of conversations that you were having with your customers like oh we have this big upside merge trade everybody's getting super bullish you know I mean you could certainly argue that a call fly is not too bullish of a trade especially when you know the the strikes are as wingy as they are as you see on the screen you know the March thirty five hundred four thousand forty five hundred but regardless there was a ton of these upside structures that were printing in the market in the run-up to the merge and these big these structures because like a caulify is is a four-legged structure right so like that March thirty five hundred four thousand forty five hundred well in this case I'm buying in terms of ratio buying one of the 3 500 I'm selling two of the four thousand and then I'm buying one of the 4500. so this quantity of 87 000 when this trade prints in aggregate it's actually adding 87 000 times four in terms of open interest so what is that 87 000 times three I think 348 000 contracts are added to open interest just as the result of this one call flag trade right so that one happened in March in March expert but we also have it in December like this D 2600 3000 another upside call spread that was bought you know the December twenty five hundred three thousand and thirty five hundred right so 280 000 roughly contracts are added to open interest whoops sorry you can edit that up uh are added to the open interest as a result of these trades right so and after the merge so we saw all these all these massive upside structures in terms of number of numbers of contracts being added before the merge but then the merge proved to be a non-event as we know with the spot action but we only saw a little bit of unwinding of these positions you know there was some there were some tips that were taken off the table once it realized that you know ethereum wasn't gonna murder it wasn't going to Moon as a result of this merge you know it was very much a sort of sell the news uh sort of event but most of the open interest actually remains outstanding and this is why the December open interest is completely bananas you know compared to every other expert so if you just look here what would surprise me a little bit on that Joe's like if I remember back to when all those trays were being put on there was there was also like a lot of March dates um put on right March expiries um so I'm is that it's there's not a higher percentage of well a higher level of open interest still out there for those dates as well but well there is here look I'll go I'll go back to the first slide look at it so here so ethereum open interest right so 46.5 is in this December 30th date which is where all these call spreads and call flies are printing but look here do you see this March are you guys able to see my mouse yes okay we are cool right so in March right that is the second highest open interest there's 1.3 million contracts out there yeah and 25 roughly of those contracts are driven by this one trade this March thirty five hundred four thousand forty five hundred because it's 87 000 times four a call a call fly has you know four legs when you include the ratio right so 25 is just driven by this one trade and then look down here each call fly March 3 500 4500 5500 that's another 240 000 contracts just from this one trade so you're exactly right the open interest in March is also massive does that make sense yeah it does make sense so what does it mean Jay then so we get we get through this all this uh open interest rolls off what does it mean so what it means is that the open interest is about the fall off a cliff right so if you just look at where so this this is a chart from um G Vol or Amber data and so the two highest open interest strikes are the the bellies of the call fly right so that December 3000 and then that March 4000. right and look these are way out of the money like these are way out of the money trades like we're talking a December 2500 3000 3500 call spread like we're we're 50 we're 50 lower than the than the lower strike right so we're not expecting these large December call flies to be rolled right and alongside this call fly position right or specifically these December 3 000 calls there there are 280 000 contracts out there from other strikes as a result of merge trades like we we did the analysis that are going to expire worthless you know all these strikes up here right like these 4 000 you know 5500 these were all put on pre-merge and clearly you know the open clearly we're nowhere near you know the uh the strike the strike prices there so a lot of these trades are just going to roll off completely worthless and the ethereum open interest in the next two weeks is going to fall by at least 500 000 contracts just as a result of merge flow so so for a smooth brain like myself when open interest falls off and like at this rate um and all these expire worthless what impact could this have on the market in terms of like direct impact on the market I think I think it's just going to show that what we've seen it's basically just going to bring the the open interest back in line with like the volumes that we've been seeing over the past month and you know the volumes are you know very light because it's very easy to say like oh okay yeah like you know this this is great open interest just keeps going up and up and up and up and sure that has been the case through December 2022 as shown in this in in this uh chart right here but what's going to happen as we get through December in March the open interest is going to fall off a cliff and then you're gonna be like okay I guess that makes sense given the amount of volumes so it's not it's not really uh you know an analysis in terms of like oh like what it what does this mean for like spot action or these things it's more so just kind of talking about like the state of the market and this is and this is where we're at I I guess you could argue um I mean firstly given that a lot of open interest um and those expiries are so far at the money that they're not having any they've basically got very little gamma um attached to them so they're not having an impact yeah a lot of other like Greek exposure you know kind of like second order grease exposure that uh you know is just pretty you know just pretty meaningless at this point unless we start to Rally a little bit yeah um and I guess through that um if open interest is low if if uh you know there's generally sort of less gamma and stuff in the market um and I guess like if one of a better word than sort of spot trading is a little bit cleaner because you're not you're not kind of being impacted by dealers managing gamma and stuff like that which we don't want to see from from our point of view but but the thing is these like this is why I would like to get like somebody you know what like one of our like big like market-making Traders you know on on this podcast with us because then we can they can actually tell us like look this is just like my opinion in terms of like what Market impact um but you know getting them on there and they might have a different opinion be like well actually like sure like these you know these March four thousands they're really far away but like we do actually have a little bit of impact uh we do see a little bit of impact from this like outstanding open interest like I can't really answer that question uh compared to you know a market maker that's in the weeds kind of you know rebalancing their risk around like this position that they've put up but yeah so like the reality is so like we calculated merge trades positions represent right around 25 of the total ethereum open interest when you include the December and the marsh exposure and that's not even counting you know the dealer Hedges of this flow that is also going to expire and lead to a further decrease in the open interest so the main point is I would expect that these open interest uh this open interest chart in the towards like the beginning of the next year to really start trending down a bit but you know this isn't me being like a you know crypto doomsay crypto options doomsayer I know the the tone of uh this podcast has has has been a little bit pessimistic and I mean I guess rightfully so given everything that's happened you know with with FTX and you know the inner dealer flow analysis that we did last week that we all agree is not great for the market of course but you know it certainly our view a paradigm that this is a temporary phase for the market and to be honest it's my view it's going to persist as long as spot trades range bounds and participants feel this discomfort around this centralized exchange exposure uh which hopefully can start to diminish uh you know just with time but yeah my view is crypto spot you just needs this it needs a catalyst in order to get excited whether that's a central bank pivot or some crypto specific narrative like we we saw how much option volume that the merge drove right we had this big Catalyst for ethereum and we saw this insane amount of upside flow that was trading ahead of it again 25 of all the ethereum open interest were what quote-unquote merge trades we see the volumes that events like this can bring but when I look forward into 2023 like what is that story I just I just don't see one like are we going to be really you know relying on the macro here or are there also crypto idiosyncratic things like there's on the Bitcoin side I'd say it's more kind of a structural overhang sort of story I know people talk um you know talk to death around like Mount docks and these sort of things but in terms of like a potential positive crypto Catalyst I don't think I see one really next year foreign in terms of what what that means free um when that happens um I do think as well I mean um like to your point there is a lack of narrative right now I think in the market I mean we kind of crippled by fear um but I kind of think and I know I've kind of been banging the drum for the last sort of a few weeks in terms of like this this macro macro regime shift but I kind of think when you're when you're experiencing the regime shift you you end up in this little no man's land for a little bit where we kind of lack in the narrative because kind of like the price action is not really matching that that kind of shift um the I mean the pushback that I've been getting um and even obviously you had Greg on last week and that was interesting um but that pushed back around um you notice this sort of tightening cycle and and that's going to keep Weighing on price again I kind of think it's a 2022 story and and it's been and done um but we're not yet at the point um to have the Catalyst for people start certainly not start getting bullish um so I I kind of think like we we yeah we need you know maybe another really weak uh CPI print or something like that or something to happen that that the feds start changing because equally of other land like the kind of idiosyncratic sort of crypto blaps we're seeing it it doesn't feel to me that we've got a macro Catalyst necessarily for the downside at the moment um but yeah I I get it price action looks pretty um it's not really you know no no one no one kind of really wants to sort of buy this dip um at the same time it's like people don't really want to sell it and we spoke about Vol last week it's difficult to Salvo down here but then who wants to buy Vol so we kind of in this no man's land where there's there's we're just kind of drifting um and yeah we need a catalyst we need and hopefully 2023 brings it a market tend to flip pretty quickly um we certainly know that in crypto right um but also in macro things change like pretty rapidly speaking about catalysts uh can you walk us through what happened in Japan yesterday yeah um to say just when we thought we could all like completely relax um obviously Bank of Japan came out and and surprised the market by tweaking their yield curve control um and the more I sort of look at it and think about it it I know we we all try and read into everything that Central Bank does it feels like they're sort of tweaking policy I understand people are saying it's setting up to um you know to actually start embarking on a tightening cycle but effectively what what they did right they um they had their yield curve control where uh 10-year yields were capped at 25 basis points um plus or minus they widen that's a 50. um and obviously immediately jgb sold off and uh yeah 10-year yields in in Japan went towards I think they got around 40 basis points and then the rest of the market kind of reacted to that um I spoke briefly uh yesterday when we we put out uh some quick thoughts um the reason why Japan's so important it's it's one of the largest Capital exporters to the world uh so got huge excess Savings in Japan and those excess savings go and invest in assets around the world so when there's a change domestically at home um the fear is always that they'll sell their foreign assets and repatriate that that cash back home um Japan is also the largest foreign holder of U.S treasuries so obviously potentially it's a big move when um when Japan have reasons to to um adjust their portfolios away from treasuries back to JD jgb's back home um so we saw equities initially in Egypt lower um we saw treasury sell-off um and treasury yields went towards just above sort of 370. um now I guess the fear is is now does that now spark this big sort of portfolio um reallocation away from treasuries back towards jgb's and then obviously treasury start selling off you'll start going up um then that starts to blow up equities and then also the potential for them to start selling equities as well my view on on the treasury side of things is that I I don't think that's a huge sort of risk at the moment um the main reason being is that hedge treasuries so if you hedge out the out the FX risk back to Yen given we've got this inverted yield curve right um so the sort of front end impacts your your hedge um uh like the cost of your hedge and so hedge treasury is back to Yen uh we're yielding negative in a way so if you're if you're if you're Japanese and you're buying treasuries and hedging out the FX risk you're actually yielding negative on the treasuries so they weren't attractive to hold in a way and consequently throughout the year um the Japanese uh have generally been a net seller of treasuries so I don't think that's a huge change to the the uh flow Dynamic that we've seen all year in a way so I don't think it's something that's going to spark just a huge saying of treasuries um so I kind of didn't feel it's such a big deal in that sense but I understand why I sort of Market reacted um and yeah and and I guess it feeds into this theme That central banks around the world are are playing catch up with the FED we saw a more aggressive ECB last week um who are also talking it up uh but the this kind of positive side for me that I kind of highlighted I'm still bullish uh treasuries um for for the three reasons that we've spoken about before uh Peak CPI Peak fed we're near the end of that hike cycle and also we have growing sort of recession growth fears um so I think they'll continue to weigh on on Treasury yields um and will come lower and there's some quite sort of solid technical levels that I've kind of been looking at um not keen on technicals but um but sometimes it's good to watch I'm not a big Tech guy but um they can sometimes be self-reinforcing um so we kind of bounced off the levels that I thought we would at 372 and the bigger one is 380. so I think we'll continue lower the other thing that I think is interesting is um this kind of policy convergence trade now that we're seeing where other central banks are converging towards where the Federer and what that's starting to do is to weigh on the dollar and as we know the Dodd has been the wrecking ball that's kind of you know strangled risk assets throughout the year um and they're starting to ease and and this actually in some ways feeds into that so I kind of had a more positive take on it because if if I'm right on Treasury yields which I think are gonna trade um kind of idiosyncratic to what's going on in Japan and I think they come lower if the dollar comes lower as well then that's not a bad outcome for risk and I kind of think that's why equities have actually bounced since that initial knee-jerk um and and yeah and uh treasury eels have recovered a little bit uh without any particular follow-through but um but yeah it's um yeah everyone's always nervous about about the Japanese Market I think as well like it doesn't really trade now like the bank of Japan owned that market so it's not really a market anymore um so the historic significance of it I don't think is so big now again not not to underplay the importance of Japan as uh I say a capital exporter to the world like if they start if the life is in Japan start shifting uh put photos about then it's going to have a big impact um but I yeah I'm not sure if 25 Pips is is going to be the thing that that makes them want to bring all the money back home yeah yeah like I I I hear you here like on on your your rates analysis but like I think it's more so in my view just like about the implications here right like the last you know the country that has held off the most in terms of like removing easy monetary policy is now starting to get away from that right and when you do when you do the first hike right when you then you're just opening up more opportunity now to to do even more Heights right like they're probably like the precedent is is completely set there now right and so if you're going to like I was reading this Twitter threat and they're like okay if you're now going to this world where like now you can actually have real returns then like maybe those Japanese lifers do get their get their money out of uh you know equities bonds what have you right the massive Japanese asset managers that have a very very large portfolio allocation to U.S equities these guys start moving their money back to Japan then you know crypto I can't imagine is not going to be prone from this just I mean just because you know crypto has such a high uh High beta right to what's going on in the equities market so I guess that's where my concern lies is like okay if the money starts going back then you know that could be a problem right and the thing is these carry trades aren't from what I understand can be pretty highly leveraged right so like 25 basis basis point move you know it doesn't seem like a lot when we talk about it but like it could actually be quite painful and if you go another 25 bips then you know it gets even more painful and then this is kind of like a self you know reflexive self-reinforcing thing where potentially Capital uh you know gets repatriated back to Japan and then you know you have asset sell-offs because of it look I'm not an expert on the subject but by no means right like I worked on an equity options desk but like to to me this kind of seems to be the risk where you know money is going back into Japan and these Japanese asset manager is kind of just selling out every selling out of everything and then that has a follow through to the crypto Market yeah I I get that the one thing I would say as well that like the big flows come from the Japanese life is right and the Pension funds and they they're slow moving animals right they're not like a hedge fund that's gonna just kind of you know a bit of data comes out or this has changed and just shift too quickly I mean these guys got pre-announced often like their their plans in terms of Hedges and things like that so I don't think that happens if it's like more of a structural shift over time right I might say it's going to be like a violent unwind but if you kind of have this structural overhang where like these guys are raising rates and then money is going back to Japan then you know that's gonna potentially put pressure on asset prices and yeah and any other thing to me as well it's not clear that that you you want to be um moving money back to Japan if they're gonna sort of tighten rate and slowly economy like like you don't want to hold jgbs if you think jgb years are going higher you want to wait till they're actually up there right like if you go and buy jgbs Now call it 50 basis points and you think they're going to 100 um why are you going to go and hold them um so yeah I I I kind of I get the reaction um I I still think the only game in town for me still is the Fed um and that's kind of where my focus is at the moment to to kind of stay with that um wary and watch for what's going on in Japan I mean they did stress that that this is not a a tightly move or have you it's it's too uh yeah and I get that in a smooth microphone I I actually think it was there was a big part that was aimed at the currency and to strengthen the currency um but yeah so and it all depends as well you know like if you think about equities a lot of it depends on on how well hedged they are like currency hedge they are if you're unhedged and you're seeing Yen strength and then either you're going to rush to put on the currency Hedges or you're going to sell out your equities because they're they're losing value back in your domestic currency uh but I think hedge ratios um you know they're they're typically um sort of reasonably higher so yeah I I I I I I'm not as concerned as what a lot of other people seem to be um on that but yeah I mean if it develops into something more and I guess I guess the bigger fear everywhere is like this is feeding in that sort of global tightening ECB doing it I mean the one thing I do think is the two most Service central banks uh for the last 10 years have been uh ECB and uh Bank of Japan and it would just be something kind of poetic almost if they were the ones that essentially called the top in this hike cycle everywhere and also in this inflation sort of uh sort of cycle that we're seeing and I kind of I kind of got a sneaky feeling that's what's going to happen ECB have definitely got formed for hiking at precisely the wrong time um it feels like maybe they're all going down that route cool so I think we're coming up on our time here so Joe closing thoughts closing thoughts main takeaway um from from my standpoint is that the open interest I think over the next couple weeks especially as we get through December 30th expiry is going to completely fall off a cliff um for the crypto options markets and then potentially happen to get again in March as these merge trades roll off Joe I mean I'm sorry David yeah I guess my closing thoughts as we sort of come to closing out the years it's been such a bruising year it's been a tough year for everyone um and the sort of drivers for that the main driver aside from Luna and now FTX and and all these idiosyncrasic things out of really um hit crypto obviously the macro has been a big driver of that and essentially we've we've had to ride out the sharpest um sort of fed hiking cycle in in recorded history um and a massive drain in liquidity um and that's here here not just crypto but but equities and other risk assets I think that tide is turning into 2023 and I think the path through 2023 looks easier um so happy to shut the book on on 2022 and uh uh sort of recuperate over over the holiday period um and I think 2023 looks looks a better year so I will enjoy celebrating Christmas and uh and look forward to what what the new year brings I hope you're right yeah just as a final note we will we will not be doing a show uh next week given us the holidays so thank you guys for watching we'll see you in the new year
