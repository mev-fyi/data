everyone welcome to the show this is uh the Paradigm show where we talk about what's going on in the markets um and we take a deeper dive into macro I guess macro and microstructure um so today we have David with us who is our resident what would you call yourself David master of macro I think someone calls me macro Man Randy Savage or something like that um but yeah yeah let's let's call me uh yeah man I actually like that macro Man Randy Savage the Savage that's that's amazing and uh we also have Joe with us Joe you can go ahead and introduce yourself so I work on the institutional coverage team in the US and you know I'm more kind of like the boots on the ground in terms of you know actively trading with with our customers and and kind of give some color around the flows and you know yeah the ball parameters and things like but you need a cool nickname [Music] you didn't prepare me for this I don't know the next okay we'll come up with a cool nickname for you let's go over the macro stuff so David like what are you seeing in the markets right now and um yeah just give us your take on that yeah I mean I've been talking um I guess for a few weeks now that I kind of feel that we're witnessing quite a significant like underlying shift in the macro um in the macro sort of dynamic that's been driving us over the last last year or so um so obviously look the story from the macro point of view has been the FED hike cycle and it's it's been obviously the the most aggressive um hike cycle that we've seen in recorded history and that that's obviously devastated um you know the stocks in fact nearly every asset class um has been absolutely obliterated and obviously crypto being a high beta um asset class is is not immune from that so we can't ever talk about crypto without thinking about the macro but I think we're we're seeing a significant shift in terms of we're now starting to price the end of that hike cycle and there's a lot of time being spent talking around um you know whether we're seeing a pause or a pivot and people sort of pushing back on that idea because we know we you know we're going to see probably another 50 bips of hikes in December and maybe that followed up um with another 50. but but I kind of think what's important for markets always is the direction of travel and also rates of change and it's clear so we're going to step down the pace of hikes um in December from 75 bips to 50. so that rate of change is slowing and then then we're moving towards the pause so we're now gone from spending a year essentially pricing this rate hike cycle which has seen Bond seller fuels go higher which has seen the dollar rally super strong and and that kind of dollar wrecking ball that everyone talks about which is kind of sucking liquidity out of every sort of corner of the world you know really strangling Global growth and then also crippling assets we're now starting to see that that kind of process come to an end so what's really interesting to me is looking at again if we just look at rates in a dollar we've we've broken some pretty significant Trend levels so we're seeing yields sort of come a lot lower and break some Trend levels and we're also seeing the dollar start to roll over and I think the data is particularly interesting in all of this in in the sense that I think FX is probably the asset class that that kind of sniffs out a change in regime um probably better than any other asset class because you know we know even if we get a pause rates are going to stay stay there so you won't see front-end rates do too much but that view will be expressed in the dollar and I just think it's interesting that we're starting to see the dollar roll over which then I I think obviously has massive uh implications in terms of um obviously High beta risks you start to perform NASDAQ which is massively underperformed she starts to perform and obviously the higher speeder being being that of crypto and also it makes me if we if we're pricing in this sort of peak inflation narrative which we are um and we had obviously the first kind of rollover on the inflation um last month we've actually seen it even data in Europe today suggesting that inflation here's peaked as well so we're kind of pricing this peak inflation um and it's still sticky and still probably uncomfortably higher um but we're past that Peak inflation hump um we're seeing growth sort of slow down certainly the activity indicators pointing to to slowing growth so then that should start to be good for for bonds and let's say we're seeing long duration start to perform we're seeing 10 year yields and 30 yields come lower and crypto for me again is is a is a high beta long duration asset so if we think long duration is going to start to really perform here which I think it will with the slowing growth Peak inflation narrative then I I think we're going to start to see crypto potentially perform obviously we've got some idiosyncratic issues right now um with with the implosion of FTX and and you know there's perhaps more liquidations and and that process to run through but um I actually think the macros turn much more constructive and you're always aware of calling the bottom in in markets and and particularly crypto but I think we are seeing a significant shift that might Mark Mark the lows in in Risk assets generally so what's your so what's your one key takeaway from all this I guess I think my one key takeaway is is the the regime has shifted um from pricing fed hikes to now moving towards a Fed pause and I think I think my takeaway from that is that we're going to see risk assets bottom here cool it does always seem low like whenever we do have these risk asset rallies you know because the Mark it's happened a few times now the market thinks that the FED is going to get more and more dovish and then Powell always comes out and says Market hold your horses we still are not even close to being out of the woods yet which takes us even lower yeah that's true and not like he's speaking tonight right um after we record this and I fully expect him to do exactly that uh Joe and just say you know he he can't he can't go soft on on what they're doing now um and he certainly doesn't want markets to to kind of loosen Financial conditions too much ahead of him but I kind of feel like he's not in control of that and in the same way that markets tightened way ahead before the FED did um will also sort of loosen and you know he he's trying to he's trying to kind of you know again slowly kind of land the plane um and want to keep things pretty smooth so I think he's got to talk corkishly but but what's quite interesting to me if I look at the last couple of fed meetings or when he's spoken and he has been pretty hawkish and aggressive I expect the same later but the the impact of that's pretty short-lived because a lot of this stuff's priced in we kind of we're priced him for Peak terminal rates around five percent so he's kind of talking about we can't we go in there we're not easing up yet but we kind of go we Panic we sell off we need jerk sell off I expect that to happen today but then very quickly we kind of go okay well it's peaked and actually what's the new information the new information is that the FED is slowing down the pace of hikes and they are moving towards that terminal rate which has got 100 100 bips or so away so I kind of think the the we've priced in for those scenarios um and then markets that think six nine 12 months ahead of themselves then start to price them on what comes next what comes after the pause and typically uh a pause is full followed by Cuts so then we need to start to reprice that cycle and Marcus will get ahead of that yeah that makes sense there's there's certainly a lot of uh talk going around in the Twitter sphere you know if if these recent events didn't happen you know Bitcoin would be at 30 000 you know or you know or around there you know ethereum would be you know at 2000 like I guess what's what would what's your view in terms of where the market would have been you know given all the dovish talk if if this didn't happen I mean I know we're we're just speculating yeah well I mean but I mean 100 so I've been saying um before obviously before the FTX um implosion that that you know picking up on this shift um in the macro Dynamic and again it's quite a subtle shift um and you know that's why the dollar breaking down is quite interesting to me and and we I wanted to see us breaking those levels and before before the FTX blow up um you know crypto looks pretty big right and yeah I I think ethereum now given you know see if you see the rallies we've had in NASDAQ s p over the last month or so in response to that shift in sort of macrodynamic yeah I I think ethereum probably would have been over 2000 and been making some some sort of new highs there um for the year um well certainly since the summer and and yeah I don't know Bitcoin at twenty eight thousand thirty thousand I think that's probably where we we would have been heading so obviously we've had to deal with this huge liquidity event but one thing I do think is interesting Joe is is I mean God like if you look at what's gone on this year from from a a the sort of sharpest tightening cycle in recorded history you know B lunar blow ups you know three arrows you know Celsius now FTX a war in in Russia and Ukraine um that I I can't think of a worse sort of macro backdrop and yet here we are what that's 17 000 where we are in in Bitcoin now um so I'm actually pretty pretty encouraged by the resilience and particularly as well ethereum over the last the way that's trading over the last weeks um I I think there's a lot of resilience there and you kind of go I mean you don't want to give it the kiss of death but you know what's what's the next bit of bad news that comes out now yeah there's gonna be more dead bodies and we expect that but wow we've survived a lot of bad news yeah yeah it could it literally could not be worse I want to say that but then it will probably actually actually get worse but we've had like seven or eight like almost Black Swan events happen in a row in the span of like you know a couple months and we're still here actually I was talking with someone about that yesterday I was like man this it cannot be worse and yet Bitcoin and the thief and Eve like you just said have remained like somewhat resilient right so with all that in mind um Joe can you like walk us through flows and what you're seeing in in markets right now yeah sure so in terms of the crypto auction markets there's certainly been a lot quieter since uh FTS event happened you know and it's quite evident by the the volumes that we've seen on derabit we've been right around 500 billion dollars combined across Bitcoin and ethereum you know since the market has calmed down after the event you know which is quite low you know uh relative to what it was beforehand you know the the microstructure of the crypto option markets as well has really changed quite a bit since the event and I do think that there's a fairly large imbalance between the number of market makers and crypto options and the number of real buy side takers who are actively Trading so breaking that down if I look at from a market maker perspective there are a lot of firms that have cut back on their wrist risk taking and exposure to centralized exchanges and a good handful of these firms definitely took significant losses in their Delta One Market making arms and that of course reduces the risk appetite on the option side but that being said most of the option market makers that are on Paradigm are still participating in some capacity right not a lot of these guys have really shut off the lights sure they're hurting they're licking their wounds but a lot of these guys have not shut off the lights but then now I compare that to the taker side right and I'm sure David can speak uh a lot about it too you know he's kind of the boots on the ground talking to a lot of these risks these Risk Managers but we've definitely seen reduced interest from real takers looking to add risk and actively trade and to be clear when I say a real taker like I'm talking about a buy side client I'm talking about a hedge fund I'm talking about a family office a high net worth individual I'm not talking about a market maker that is acting as a taker to recycle risk that they previously facilitated so you know most of the trades from the buy side takers that we've seen since the FTX event have happened have been on the risk reduction side you know it's not been adding new risk and we can go over some of these flows in a little bit specifically but it's very clear that a lot of strategies and a lot of funds have taken a step back and are remaining on the sidelines for now so now we have this Market microstructure that is very different than what it was even a few months ago and sure Luna three arrows that certainly wiped out some big takers especially the systematic Vault sellers who were quite prevalent in crypto but we were seeing a ton of interest uh in trading upside ahead of the eve merge from a variety of clients you know there was a ton of taker interests even a few months ago right and now you fast forward to today and now it feels like you have this larger supply of market makers that as I mentioned they're licking their wounds but a lot of them are still there but then you have real buy side taker demand that has really only been limited to a couple counterparties that have been adding risk so that's kind of The View on on the microstructure so like again like what's what's the one takeaway here I mean like where do you what do you see happening in the next couple months I think the main takeaway is that the supply demand picture between the number of market makers and the number of active takers adding risk has definitely shifted more towards the supply of makers in less demand for takers and if I'm being perfectly honest given recent events like people are gonna be sitting on their hands waiting to see what happens they're still potentially a lot of bodies that have yet to rise to the surface here we're not out of the woods yet and I think a lot of these guys are going to be taking a step back so I think this has kind of kind of be the status quo for for the foreseeable future cool yeah it's tough I mean it's um I mean one of the things I'm hearing when I'm speaking to people is I mean right now you know like credit counterparty risk is is is you know the number one priority and concern right um you know there's me trying to sort of talk about the macro and and all these things and and the opportunities he's presenting you know we we we put out the other week about you know like looking at the opportunities and call spreads which which looks quite attractive um and you don't get too much pushback on that the the pushback is yeah we we want to know you know where the risks are from a counterparty and credit uh point of view and we we need to get our house in order uh to make sure that you know we feel sufficiently protected however they're gonna do that be it through use of prime Brokers or however they're doing that so yeah I I think I think short term until people get their heads around that and and have more comfort in terms of sort of what risks they're taking uh from a a counterparty credit risk side of things um yeah it's going to keep volumes a little bit more muted do you yeah yeah especially on the on the derivat side but one thing that has been a really interesting shift has been the increasing interest in trading on the CME so Paradigm in the month of November had the largest amount of volumes traded on CME since April 2021. right so we were so in terms of like just the history of Paradigm this was before I had joined the firm but throughout late 2020 and early 2021 we were quite active on CME but then there was this sort of year period or so you know leading up into ftis where we weren't doing any CME volume this isn't me saying that like CME it was not happening on Paradigm but then now FTX happens you have all these these counterparty concerns for centralized exchanges and then you see a sort of a flight to Quality if if you will right you know the regulated exchanges that um you know have been around for a while that have you know that have a proven track record in other asset classes so you know anecdotally I was having a conversation with a customer yesterday it's like hey what would it look like if we're trying to back to back all our risk off of derabit and onto CME right like conversations like that are very very telling that people are looking for that counterparty assurance and it's going to be interesting to see what happens on the over-the-counter side right so when you directly face a counterparty bilaterally over is the rather than facing an exchange like are we gonna see a shift in the OTC markets to bilaterally trade only against the most reputable counterparties right I'm not going to name them here um just for protection purposes but like you know those market makers that have been active in equities and rates and have been trading all these different products bilaterally for 20 30 years are we going to see a sort of flight to Quality in the OTC market and you know that's a question that you know I don't have the answer to yet I mean Justin like might be a good idea eventually we get one of our customers on you know one of our big market makers that are active in the OTC side and they can kind of little Pine them you know and and we can hear what they think I agree think we should definitely do that I was going to ask that question like where do you think flows Go From Here given that you know people are worried about counterparty risk and do you think that drives uh you know derivatives flow on defy it certainly could um or do you think that people are too still like a little worried about D5 I guess for lack of a better term if I'm I mean I mean I think we say d flat D5 flows like pick up like 50 or so right in the last you know there are those volumes are up like huge in the last couple of weeks so so and there's probably more more in the spot side of things but but definitely flows are going that way I I just see it from like an Institutional perspective and if I'm looking to get my toes into the crypto derivative sphere right like I want to be able to have an experience that is quite similar to what I have already in kind of other asset classes right you know you really need to become an expert on like smart contract risk and there's all these other risks that you are adding to the equation when you go into D5 I just don't see it this is my personal opinion you know where you know a traditional Finance investment manager that is looking to make the jump into crypto immediately is like okay I'm gonna go into D5 and trade on this protocol yeah it's a couple steps in and then they've got to sell for the kyc AML issues I guess to access D5 um you know so so yeah I think the that's probably a bridge too far right now yeah it might take a couple years um okay so like I think do you guys have any final thoughts before we kind of close this one out I mean we're already at the 20 minute Mark so yeah I mean I guess I can talk a little bit more because no I was kind of just talking more about microstructure and the market generally kind of what actually has happened over the past week from like you know you talked about it from a parameter perspective and some of the flows that we're actually seeing like getting getting more Deep In The Weeds there but like we we were looking yesterday so Bitcoin seven day realized volatility as of last night was 32 and a half right like that is absolutely insane that is crazy to think about like sure you can make the Army markets quiet over you know you have the long weekend you have Thanksgiving us holidays but if you told me that on the day FTX went down that seven day realized has still not hit the lowest value it would hit in the month of November I would have said you're out of your mind right and realize Vol has done a complete round trip despite the fact that there's all this contagion concern still out in the market and implied Vols are now sub 60 right out to February I mean the implied Vol is coming lower makes sense because the realize has been absolutely terrible and you know the fall risk premium as in the difference between implied and realized has been rising every day hey if that melt lower makes sense but like the question is where is the new floor involved going to be you know because there's all these bodies that perhaps have yet to you know rise to the surface like see more skeletons in the closet here I mean look maybe I'm a glass half empty guy I know David thinks it's a bottom but like you know maybe I'm being a little bit more pessimistic pessimistic but it's just crazy at the lack of like spot action that we've had in light of these recent events and we've seen some guys even yesterday like we had a big uh December uh strangle buyer you know some guy just um the December 12 000 21 000 strangle that was bought 400 times um on us right and with such tepid realized trades like that are going to get painful pretty pretty quickly right so I think Nigeria I think that party speaks to the fact that you know a lot of the actual sort of deleveraging process run run its course in in the summer um like posted at the sort of lunar blow up and and the things that followed that so I actually think um that's perhaps why the actual spot price action has been pretty muted um all things considered I think we've seen that deleveraging also let's not forget as well FTX was a good place to be able to short and to actually uh actually sort of short but via perps and with the margining there so it's probably a little bit more difficult for people to put on those shorts so we've got a market that's kind of delivered throughout the summer um and and then you know those that would want to take uh sort of sort of more um of that directional risk and short the market is probably a bit more difficult to do so as well as kind of thinking about the the counterparty risk at this stage and the caution around that Joe when was the last time uh Vols were this low do you know November 2nd well seven day seven day realize I mean before FPS of course um but you know the point is like you have this crazy systemic event and in less than three weeks the balls are back to where what they were before it happened right like typically you know that that mean reversion process you know takes a while and sure like I'm seven day realized maybe I'm looking at too small of a window here you know given the holidays but like it the fact that we went from moving a ton to moving like basically nothing at all and this the span of like two or three weeks and there's still so much potentially influx around you know like the whole like dcg situation right it's just it's just very surprising yeah it's quite funny when you think of all like the Boomer no coiners who have you know one of their things against sort of crypto and Bitcoin has been uh you know the volatility and the volatility is too high I think it's been lower than it's been in the bond market this year so um well it's nothing it's nothing at all or all yeah that's it man yeah it's it's actually interesting looking at some of these equities too like they're they're trading like [ __ ] coins at this at this point and so like yeah it's it's funny of watching them like oh we don't like volatility and in crypto so we're not going to touch it but now you look at some of the charts from like traditional markets and it's like dude they're just they're just as bad yeah that's another interesting point is like the movement the or the lack thereof of the movement and the coins versus like you look at crypto activities right I mean look at the sell-off that coinbases have right and then you have Armstrong coming in on Twitter and trying to you know reassure the market and I mean look at Marathon digital you know they they came in on their on their earnings call like literally they they reported earnings the day before FDX went down and they said in their earnings report that we are budgeting our mining business is budgeting for a bitcoin price between like eighteen thousand and twenty one thousand right and then we started to sell off and this thing went down 40 in the course of you know one one a week and a half right and it just you compare that to the Brazilian you can see that we've seen in in the coins and it's just crazy to me yeah people are just getting beaten up everywhere um well I think that that's probably the show for this week would you agree and pick it up again next week sure all right cool that's it [Music] foreign [Music]
