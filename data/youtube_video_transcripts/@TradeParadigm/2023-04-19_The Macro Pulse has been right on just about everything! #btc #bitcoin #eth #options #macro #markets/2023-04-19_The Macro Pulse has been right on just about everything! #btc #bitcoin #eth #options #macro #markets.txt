it seems like the macro pulse has been on fire the last few weeks why is that why what are you seeing that other people aren't seeing Joe I I think I've got a consistent macro framework that I look at and and um view the world through it's been one that's been honed over like a long time um like certainly 18 odd years macro and obviously less than that in terms of applying it to crypto but um I I think it's trying to drown out the noise and kind of keep with this framework I think we've spoken about before I look at rates liquidity the dollar risk positioning and flows um like pretty much and if if you kind of get in those things right then I think you you can pretty much kind of get crypto right and then it's kind of trying to anticipate that regime change um you know what signals we're picking up so it's not foolproof
