but if I think about this week one move that I really don't understand is the moving rates it doesn't kind of fit with anything else that I'm looking at um okay I can understand that we now got a Fed that that is still talking quite hawkishly data I think has been pretty poor but you know that they're still being strong enough elements okay maybe that we we don't need to price out or we can price out some of those fed cuts that the market was pricing banking sector seems to stabilize for now although I don't think those problems have gone away so then I kind of look at the rates move with yields going higher and think that looks a bit overdone so then I'm kind of questioning within the framework is there something that I'm getting wrong or something I'm missing um and I don't really see it I think the only thing I I really see is um you know we've got this uh this tax payment date in the US and I don't know if that's having an impact um and how that's possibly feeding through
