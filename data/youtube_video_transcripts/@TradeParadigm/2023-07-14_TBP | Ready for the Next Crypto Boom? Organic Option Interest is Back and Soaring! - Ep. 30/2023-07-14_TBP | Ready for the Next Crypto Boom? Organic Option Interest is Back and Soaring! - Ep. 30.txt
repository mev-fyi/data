[Music] hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hey everyone welcome back to the big picture I'm Joe frui looking at everything crypto volmarkets here at Paradigm joined today by our macro specialist David McKell and unfortunately we had a a couple last minute guest cancellations uh unanticipated so we don't have a guest this week um but and we'll definitely be back with one in uh in the next episode so this episode is going to feel a bit more like the uh the first days of of the big picture when it was basically just just me me and David going back and forth when we when we didn't have guests and you know what we're going to do today examine some crypto crypto Vol thematics that we found interesting over the past couple weeks uh though we are going to lead off with the the macro today and I think it's quite timely you know given given the recent CPI release and you know some pretty puzzling you know Bitcoin spot action you know after the prints that you know some people were attributing to uh you know some Silk Road wallet movements but uh David let's start with uh with you in the macro what's going on yeah I wasn't Joe looking forward to to stripping it back to where we started right so yeah yeah great yeah and actually he's quite timely right to um with you know the first half of the year in the bag um to like start looking ahead to what what we're expecting into the second half um and I think in terms of thinking where where we're at on the macro um I think first thing is like like we came into this year pretty bullish right um and certainly which felt non-consensed at the time and that bullesthesis was based on this peak rates Peak inflation narrative as the market transitions from an aggressive hiking cycle to to the pause and we've seen that play out pretty well um nasdaq's LED equities higher and obviously Bitcoin is outperforming all assets once again um kind of offsetting that a little bit and spoiling the story a little bit as being the lag data which is as shown I guess a resilience um and the pace of disinflation um has probably been slower than I expected and certainly more than the central banks would like but I I think the key point on the macro is that we we are Peak inflation it's coming down um I I think the the kind of stickiness and the slowness of it as kind of stock markets fully embracing this this pause um thematic um but but nonetheless we're moving there and and I think we're gonna see that that move accelerate as as we move into the second half of the year and you see those sort of lagged impacts um start to feed through and again I guess case in point and and with the child up there is to look at yesterday's CPI number um which came in at a week of three percent year on year um Joe this is like the 12th straight month of year and year declines uh on the headline CPI yeah we're regarding that chart right there I mean three percent yeah I mean look that doesn't feel like that way in the UK though right no no I mean like I kind of see we're on the lag to where the US was um yeah I I I think obviously that there's been a few things probably being a bit more exposed to to some gas and energy um over here and maybe a little bit of brexit uh kind of um causing some problems on the food inflation side as well but um I think we'll we'll kind of follow follow the US lead and yeah let's just look at that rate a year ago we're at 9.1 we're now down at three percent um I think it's kind of crazy that that the FED uh you know still talking more hikes and salad hawkish that they've broken the back on inflation um so yeah and I I think uh I think we're just going to see that that move accelerate um into the second half of the year I did Mark it now I mean July looks a lock right for a hike um I don't see why I think if you paused in in June uh to keep yourself tired to assess the data we've since had a weekend on front payroll print we had a weaker inflation print so I'm not really sure what the FED look at to go oh we need to we need to hike rates again but it's the FED right they're gonna do it in a way um but it looks like we say it again it looks like that's probably the last one um and then and then we can kind of fully Embrace that um that pause narrative um so and and also just back in that number up we we had earlier just today and we had PPI out um and that was 0.1 year and year um now again that was 9.8 a year ago so like this is a very very different uh backdrop and in 2023 than what we saw in 2022 and this disinflationary pulse is really going to help risk assets it's going to draw us to the end of this hike cycle and ultimately uh yeah I think it's going to be super positive for crypto into the second half of the year um the other thing as well like we always talk about uh rates and liquidity like liquidity still pretty much bottled um about October of last year now it's it's a bit of a complex uh you know concept to kind of measure but um but I I think kind of a big picture on the liquidity front you know you've seen a bank of Japan and Baker China um they're sort of pumping liquidity hard and that's been quite a big offset um to what we've seen from the fed and ECB I mean the FED obviously we had the bacon crisis in March and they sort of Pumped 400 billion into into onto the balance sheet that's since tapered off and we are lower on the year but again the liquidity uh tightening uh hasn't been as severe as many would have thought coming into into this year so I think that's a lot more positive I was worried um as you know when I saw the term bearish a month or two ago um worried about this debt ceiling hike um and the liquidity drain that would mean it's pretty much because they've done it via T bills it's pretty much been offset by a drawdown on on the RRP um so we've not really seen that that big sort of negative liquidity event now so I kind of think liquidity like generally looks looks pretty good here um so yeah and then and then you're going to run on the rates stuff right um we we had that vicious sell-offs in rates last week and I I commented in the macro pulse like actually I thought Bitcoin traded pretty well no given given that rates move and the rates move didn't make sense certainly the kind of global nature of the rates sell-off would yields higher everywhere because the days for Europe's been pretty poor um there's definitely a disinflating pulse now in Europe like ppising negative territory and that'll start speeding to CPI and then and we'll talk a little bit about China in a bit but obviously China is really struggling so which all kind of weigh on global growth so the idea about that bomb yields everywhere should be going up in this kind of reflation type move didn't make sense and and I don't know it's really something technical was going on now but um obviously yeah I mean that like you know BTC didn't really react too strongly when you know that that higher for longer you know narrative you know started to really emerge again post the jobs data but then again I mean look at look at this chart on the left right I mean rates uh rates really rallied you know after the print yet you know Bitcoin was you know flat to down on the deck in both directions right it's kind of weird nice and no and like so so by coming in the macro pulse like once once that rates once race reverse which I you know I'm super bullish like duration like I think senior yields are going to come a lot lower um in the second half of this year and and once that rates reversal happens I thought that would you know kind of um release the kind of pressure on bitcoin and we and we we ramp up into a new Range highs and towards that 35k I was looking at it yesterday thinking here we go dollars selling off yeah yields are coming lower quite sharply lower NASDAQ pumping goes up you know I'm like like come on let's go let's go and once again we faded into that 31k um I don't I don't know what's going on there now obviously there was lots of like talk about Silk Road type stuff maybe that slow is happening or the anticipation of It kind of knocked us back down um and maybe there is a flood out there right you know like kind of reminds me of my FX days often when when a currency didn't move how you really felt it should you know you find out a few days later that yeah there was a big flow going through so I I guess my point on it is I don't know why Bitcoin didn't really rather yesterday um you know it rallied initially right it kind of went to like 3 900 and you know I wasn't surprised to see pretty strong uh resistance in that 31k level uh I mean you kind of just your 31k has kind of been you know a pretty strong resistance to break I mean if you just look at it you know on the charts or you know the couple cup and handle patterns and what what we've actually seen is as spot approaches 31k a lot of shorts in Futures open interest is increasing kind of really indicating and then you know we hit 31k then it immediately gets pressed down so there's there's definitely some shorts that are being put on when we kind of get up get up to that level but what was more surprising was the fact that we retraced all the way back down to the bottom of the range you know we backed out to like 3 400 3300 but I I think that for me that's kind of classic like classic post it's uh price action like everyone everyone sort of pays the highest in anticipation of the break and then and then we don't break and then we kind of start to move lower and then everyone just gets squeezed out like so all the short-term punters are just like kind of chopping themselves up basically on those moves and yeah and then we end back to Flats like to small down but I I guess I don't really understand why we didn't move but like everything I'm looking at Joe is like telling me that we should be breaking higher um I mean like look at this dollar move um I mean since we we snapped that chart we've actually broken below 100 in the dxy um now I think this is pretty significant right um and certainly when I talk about liquidity like the dollar is quite a big input into that um obviously as a global Reserve currency it's that strong Donna which suffocated pretty much every asset class uh last year so a softening dollar is generally good for risk good for liquidity and good for Bitcoin um we we sort of dump him pretty hard here and I I think that's interesting because if you remember back to kind of end of November December when I started getting pretty constructive for risk and and on bitcoin one one of the the early signals for me was when the dollar topped out um and and I often say that I I think FX is probably one of the best asset classes for sniffing out regime change and it kind of to me the dollar was pointless towards the idea that yeah okay we're gonna start going into a slower rate hike environment and obviously we went from 75 bips to 50 25 Wars um and I kind of think maybe the dollar is telling us a game where we're about to quite kind of maybe Step Up in terms of the move into that new sort of regime as the FED of done and then we start thinking about when do when the rate Cuts come not not necessarily expecting rate Cuts this year but that you know I I think we certainly coming now properly to the end of this rate hike cycle so I think that's interesting there's also uh which is quite interesting I've seen a lot of people talking about uh Janet Yellen visiting China last week now China were obviously struggling with their economy they're also struggling with their currency that that keep keeps uh getting weaker and weaker um now I think it suits them and they're kind of allowed it to drift um but what they don't want to do is lose control now where you've got the set still kind of you know probably going to hike again in July and you've got this massive um Divergence of interest rate policy if China really want to raise they can't they can't have they can't lose control of the currency so I think they they wouldn't mind guiding that weaker um so there's a lot of talk they do a deal with Janet Yellen um around the currency um certainly as well like their biggest competitor uh Japan that they've seen like huge weakness um in their currency and we've seen this sharp online of that dollar Yen carry trade so I don't know there's uh there's a lot of yeah a lot of talk out there that maybe maybe something something's been uh agreed um because certainly the dollar has been hit pretty hard since you haven't had a visit to China um so and again like either way um yeah this is this is pretty sort of positive for Bitcoin um yeah and then and then look look talking of China I I think um when I think about when I came into this year um probably one of the biggest risk risk factors to my bullish Outlet um in this peak rates Peak Peak inflation theme was the China reopening um and and the idea that you know they'll they'll see that massive boom like postcoded reopening boom that we saw in the west and and to be honest it's just not happened right the Chinese consumer is a lot more conservative um it feels like they're probably licking their wounds a little bit um and the Chinese economy at the moment looks in in real trouble um we've seen growth slow pretty sharply um so far the efforts had made to try and stimulate the economy is just not working um you know they really need to stimulate um the consumer and it's it's just it's just really not happening um so I think China's been really interesting we haven't seen that kind of inflation pulse coming out of China um and and then that that chart we got there so try it China's China's battling deflation now and trying to carry a lot of debt as well and you don't want deflation when you've got a lot of debt um so uh PPI the other day was minus 5.4 year on year so there's there's a huge disinflationary pulse coming out of China the CPI numbers are negative as well and and I like that chart uh China PPI again you've got to think that a world's biggest exporter um so when Goods in in China are sort of come in you know in negative territory uh tends to to kind of put out this disinflationary pulse around the rest of the world and that's telling me that that U.S CPR is going to follow sharply lower you're seeing it in Europe actually as well like Europe European ppis are negative and I think you'll see CPI follow so China is is emitting this disinflationary impulse Across the Western World which just goes to reinforce the idea that we're at this peak Peak rates uh Junction whereby you know I I think certainly the Third if they go in July which looks like they're going to I don't think they should but they probably will I think that's the last one and I don't think the ECB have got long to go before before they're done as well um because I actually think we're going to see um inflation or disinflation really pick up pace in Europe and and yeah this um this this hike cycle that we've had to endure he's living looking pretty good right now I think yeah and interesting I mean I'm just I'm looking at some charts right now on some price action it looks like Bitcoin now is above 31 000 again it looks like there's some news just just looking through my telegram chat live Ripple wins verdict that xrp is not a security judge also rules that institutional sales of xrp by Ripple were Securities okay wow so this is happening literally as as we record I that as of now that is that is not confirmed that is just what I'm reading reading a telegram chat but I mean ethereum really outperforming on this because the you know the basis that that the SEC is using to go against ethereum as a security is pretty similar to that as xrp so we're finally starting to see that out performance and breakout in ethereum versus BTC just just looking at trading view right now ethereum up on the day three percent versus Bitcoin up 1.7 and again flirting with that 31k resistance Set uh that we've been talking to talking about yeah that's a pretty uh pretty good segue into this this chart right here so kind of just to set the stage right since since the rally and and uh spot when range round it's pretty clear that previous resistance of roughly 30k which we saw you know a couple months ago before the rally has become this new sort of support level for this new range between 30 to 31k with that 31k level you know being a pretty strong resistant we've yet to you know meaningfully break it on a weekly or even like a four hour candle I mean hopefully this is this is the time where we can actually have a have a meaningful candle where we are above this level and you know currently spot is forming this wedge pattern in this new Range as shown by the chart and if we can meaningfully break this 31k level there's a lot of technical analysts and chartists out there that are predicting 35 to 37k is the new level uh you know the bullish flag uh um patterns as well as some Fibonacci retracements kind of at that 35 to 37k level you know we're not we're not really a charting a charting podcast as you know I'll leave I'll leave it to the I'll leave it to the guys that are really good at it you know crypto Banner crypto World they literally dedicate their channels to this stuff but the consensus seems to be that if we can break 31k then 35 to 37k is kind of the next level on the upside and as as long as we kind of remain above 29.8 k then you know we're still kind of in this crypto bull market so yeah yeah go on yeah yeah I mean I I just everything I'm looking at at the moment from from the macro which I think is lining up like beautifully um and really sort of playing out as as we were expecting um and now like you know we've had this positive narrative shift around crypto um certainly obviously with the BlackRock spot ETF now now if if obviously we just see on this Ripple news now um you know that that potentially is quite significant in terms of certainly for Ethan we've spoken before about this this uh mean reversion trade on Ethan the potential that Eve to play catch up and the fact that we've felt that you know Bitcoins being the cleaner trade not just from the macro kind of driver element but also um it's just been cleaner because you know what uh one of the second label uh East you know now now maybe this is what what you know helps us play catch up but right macro combining with this like positive um narrative and then that started to build around crypto and I I really think we're going to see some explosive upside moves yeah well that's that's certainly been the case you know throughout the year right it's kind of it kind of feels like a coiled spring sort of deal right you know you have the move chop chop chop chop and then you have another big move and what we'll talk about now is you know are the option flows kind of agreeing with this sentiment and this is a new chart um that we're going to start including on the big picture a little bit more uh apologize for the size of the bars we're we're still we're still working that out with with the data you get this but effectively um what this chart is showing is it's showing you know the taker open interest by strike and maturity on Paradigm so let's say a taker comes in and buys you know 500 contracts of these 40 000 calls and what that will do is that will add 500 contracts to that d uh 40K bar so in terms of what we've been seeing on Paradigm you know since this Spa breakout is the option flows kinda suggests some uncertainty around the timing of the next breakout and how long we we might be stuck in this 30 to 31k range I mean if you remember last year it's really really proved as quite a sticky level you know before spot even took the next leg lower back in 22. but over the past month or so the hottest strike on Paradigm continues to be this December 40 000 call so if you look on the chart on the left that is that biggest bar there uh where it says 8 400. so there's a roughly 7 000 of those 8 400 contracts of that 40K strike have been bought and they've been in December right and to put into perspective the second largest open interest contract on Paradigm to be clear this is on Paradigm this is not aggregating you know derabit uh flow as well this is just Paradigm blocks and the second biggest is the DS 35k call at roughly 3 500 contracts which is also a long interest uh so generally the largest positions from our takers are in these 33 to 40K strike ranges where our taker clients are significantly long and it is quite interesting that compared to earlier in the year when we were seeing upside being put on it was much more shorter data like David remember back in q1 we were talking about like literally like dailies being put through or like literally one week trades in these massive sizes and you know long dated in terms of like these big upside boxes that we were talking about were kind of you know like one to two months yeah but but now we're seeing most of this interest in you know December we're seeing it out in March you know March 24 call spreads that I'll put those flows up on the screen pretty shortly but it kind of again it kind of speaks to this you know uncertainty potentially around how long you know we are going to remain here I mean BlackRock ETF approval I think we both agree it probably ain't happening yeah right yeah and you know there there's another Catalyst that not a lot of a lot of people are talking about it's more of a longer data Catalyst that um Michael Saylor at microstrategy is endorsing but there is an accounting treatment change of Bitcoin where it's going to be classified away from an intangible asset which effectively is going to make it easier for corporations to own the asset on their balance sheet because the way if you hold an intangible asset on your balance sheet it is only subject to an impairment so you can only write it down so let's say let's say that you you know own own uh or let's say that you buy some Bitcoin when Bitcoin is thirty thousand you know last year and then Bitcoin goes from 30 000 to 18 000. well you are going to have to recognize a loss as impairment but on the rally back up from eighteen thousand to thirty thousand you cannot write it back up because intangible assets are only subject to impairment and and what Michael Saylor is saying is like this is like a big barrier for for other corporations um you know that are subject under U.S Gap from actually owning this asset on this on their balance sheets so he's been a very big advocate of changing this and changing the guidelines around the classification of crypto assets on U.S corporate balance sheets so we'll we'll certainly see but like that's more of like a longer data sort of catalyst I think it was on um he's either on crypto Bank banter Bank list saying you know whether he's kind of targeting March of next year as potentially this this going through but it's not going to happen for a while but uh conversely you know the taker interests are are short the downside strikes I mean look at that left chart right so the take her open interest on Paradigm kind of has this you know cell put buy call sort of risk reversal lean which is pretty consistent theme with the Paradigm open interest that we've seen in 2023 and perhaps speaks to some of the positive spot fall correlation um that we've been seeing and then on the right uh this this similar sort of analysis also extends to ethereum but much lesser to an extent than Bitcoin as as David was mentioning you know ethereum is just much less of uh you know the Hot Topic these days uh you know just given uh the cleaner Bitcoin narrative and potentially this sort of Specter where the SEC is coming after them around Securities just just checking price action right now um yeah damp so ethereum now is up to 1935 uh up three and a half percent on the day um so just quickly looking at the flows in July definitely a bit of a quieter month hopefully things start to pick up a little bit more you know after this xrp news if it is in fact confirmed but Bitcoin continuing to see action in these these 40K strikes or these 40K calls that we just spoke about but then also some some longer dated call spread buying like in March you see those March 35 000 50 000 call spreads that are being bought seeing similar activity in December as well as the September expiries as well and in comparison I I mean you look at you look at ethereum right you know given their longer data like I don't want to say those are small trades like they're not but I mean just compare to the to the David the flows that we were seeing last year right where granted you know those were called flies a lot smaller risks you know of course you know you're going to have much more contracts that are being traded there but it definitely feels like from our main takers that you know Bitcoin is is still the main interest um and then quickly Justin involve parameters here um the the bitcoin's sort of upside uh I guess Euphoria if you will versus relative to e is kind of really just shown quite simply through this 25 Delta skew you know that bottom right chart where Bitcoin is trading uh calls over puts basically across all maturities uh I mean yes across across every maturity while each skew at the time of snapshot this is going to be a lot different if I if I were to if I were to put it in now given the move that we're having here but if SKU is puts over calls in maturities out to December so the sentiment around this Euphoria is not only in the flows but it's you know it's also in the option pricing which as you'd expect you know are certain are certainly related uh but implied Vols back in the in the doldrums in in the 40s post post at CPI and given the drop and realize I think realizes back to you know 30 Vol you have this increase in the ball risk premium and look the longer we stay here the more the ball sellers are going to come in so I'm really hoping we break out I can't because it does the ball down I kind of just all tend to just hold this here longer yeah um right oh go on David sorry so so we've seen the term structures deepen up pretty significantly right yeah exactly the front of the front end is really really starting to come in uh as you'd expect yeah I mean what are your conversations Ben like uh you know over the past couple weeks or so around around the rally like what is a sentiment out there like people I talked to was like yeah we're going to 40K in no time but you know I'm also quite wary around you know pretty strong consensus to the upside like this yeah excuse me contrary you know I'd say it's been pretty mixed um like again I'm not seeing well obviously we've seen some really Punchy flows to the top side and which feel very sort of directional in nature um I'm seeing quite mixed sentiment like again people not fully willing to embrace um you know fully willing to embrace this kind of new macro regime and I do actually wonder if that's why we're seeing like the more bullish trades and the larger size get the lawnmower in the back end um because it's like we we know we know the pause is coming and we know you know that's gonna be the pretty uh positive for Bitcoin but you know are we gonna get another higher kit in July and then another one in September it's kind of okay that that might be this kind of really sort of messy like little period where not much happens and then and then yeah we know we know we know it it's ending um there's no signs on like inflation sort of picking back up so I I think um there's some that concerned about the speed of certainly inequacies and and how quickly we've run it there and the idea that AI was this kind of new shiny thing and that could wash out all of those AI ad-based stocks and then obviously at NASDAQ and everything gets smashed then it's gonna just weigh on Crypt though so again I I think I think there's been a reluctance broadly to like fully embrace it um I think it's been a good good market for like RB role players to sort of play a lot of people want to be kind of short front end and and you know own that that Vega and for that that you know optionality if we do sort of rip higher um so actually it'll be quite interesting seeing on this news how the front end performs because I imagine people quite sure about um but yeah I I think I think overall bullish but not um we're certainly nowhere near that exuberant you know bullishness that you'd kind of get nervous about I still actually think from my conversations people around the position risk generally and and certainly in Bitcoin I think if you're a fund that is benchmarked to bitcoin you've probably underperformed um so you end up having to chase some of these breaks because um you know you need to at least kind of keep track with with your your benchmark so again I I think positioning the sentiment is kind of whilst it's turning bullish obviously we've seen some bullish flows I don't think it's exuberant at all um which again like keep keeps me pretty bullish um I don't think we're anywhere near to seeing that kind of blow off top yet where you'd maybe go you know what this um let's step back a little bit and this looks a little bit overdone yeah and I I just ran some fall moves kind of kind of on the spot move here it looks like a lot of at least in the front end as you would expect given given the out performance spot out performance in ethereum versus BTC ethereum Falls are now trading over BTC Vols uh out through out through next week um you know obviously we need to see how how sticky this is going to be and if we see his continued rally but maybe maybe the start of a little bit of this uh reversion where I mean BTC Vols were just trading over Heath Falls for for so long and I remember when we had uh a couple a couple weeks ago we had the Knox guys on basically calling for this calling this yeah so look I'll give I'll give a shout out to I'll give a shout out to those guys right yeah um yeah yeah it's a good again like it was lining up pretty well right for that that mean version trade again you're always looking on these things but what's the trigger gonna be and and maybe we've just got that um and and Joe as well this is like one of the things that you know that I I know you love about options and me too and that um you know they they often give you pretty cheap ways to play these directional views um and you know you know there's a really good sort of Trades out there that you can put on at the moment and we've all so cheap again if if you're more of a role player can be painful to sit in there and just be theater all day long but um if you're just directional and it makes a lot of sense the guys that are sticking on these like deck 40ks and and then I I imagine you know people start looking at some deck March um Ace like you know you start looking at like two and a half k type levels and maybe upwards um but yeah yeah yeah well I think I think that's right yeah because I mean you just look at it in comparison to like you know the crypto equities the crypto equities have been like I mean granted they're expensive much more expensive because those things have been on absolute Terror and they you know they realize a lot more but just in terms of you know I mean I was like I was looking at some some Marathon um December options and you know those are trading at like December at the monies of trading like at 130 ball you know what I mean so it's just it's just interesting that's right yeah I'm not saying I'm not saying it's like you know unjustified that they're trading that expensive it's certainly not they they realize a lot more like in a sense those crypto equities are kind of like uh you know levered you know coin plays in themselves right and then you're taking options on these sort of levered coin plays uh but you know it's just kind of just interesting to see um you know that that dichotomy there the I think Joe on the um go on the option stuff um so obviously like the last few weeks we've seen like you know obviously at deck 40K was was a big uh a big strike and focus are we seeing sort of people we don't sort of roll those strikes up at all or and out there let's be going I'm literally I'm literally looking at my chats right now where this is starting to actually happen yeah like like you the the timing the timing couldn't have been more more uncanny on that like there's literally roles going like if you ask me like 10 minutes five minutes ago I've been like no we've seen a little bit of like come of people coming in to buy the dip we saw this on Monday remember we had that pretty decent sell-off and then we saw people coming on the July 14th 31 000 calls basically just playing for a play back to that top of the range and I I looked at the the purchase price of where the where this counterparty got them versus where we were trading at the end of the day and you know the guy was up like 60 on his money in like an hour because because we we basically crashed he was buying he was buying the call options by the dip and then we kind of rallied back again towards the top of the range you know yeah and for for a play like that where you're kind of just looking uh you know potentially for a trade to not or to close out before maturity you don't necessarily need to go above 31 000. yeah to make money on that trade is my point just lastly but before we finish off here wanted to give a quick update on the inner dealer flow on Paradigm so we've discussed this in our institutional insights report uh that we should have Justin Link in the description description uh which is on our website as well as previous episodes of the big picture and what I mean by This this term interdealer as a refresher in the option Market refers to trades between liquidity providers who operating Market Market making deaths as their core business so we basically look at all the trades that have occurred on Paradigm and classify the trade as inner dealer if both the maker and the taker on the trade is a dealer per the definition I just gave you I I they run core Market making businesses whether that is you know listed markets or in the over-the-counter bilateral markets and the main takeaway is as spot went range bound from March to June the organic taker interest started to disappear from the market a little bit and we and we certainly felt it too and More in more of the Paradigm trades as a percentage of the total were inner dealer then I ran the numbers today fast forward to the BlackRock ETF news and then the subsequent rally and what do you think happened well the organic taker interest came back through significant upside interests like those December 40K calls that that we mentioned earlier so despite the market remaining range Bound in July the inner dealer percentage of all our flow is only 25 which is quite low given this sort of range bound price action uh that we've seen like we've continued to see plays to the upside by natural takers that I.E are not market makers kind of playing for this next spot like higher and you know the longer spot remains here in this range uh obviously the higher probability that this metric is you know continuing to take will will take higher as kind of organic take your interests take a a step back from the market and then once we see a continued rally it will take it will take higher again but it is super interesting like and I mean it's not entirely unexpected but it's it's kind of cool to kind of have have the data to show that like hey this isn't just David and Joe saying that the the taker interest is returning because we're rallying like this is actually data showing that this is actually the case on Paradigm and that is shown by that uh by that metric by that line falling from 35 down to 25 percent but that that's all for me uh David do you have any closing thoughts or if not we can just end it here yeah yeah I think just to kind of summarize the view at the moment um so I think that Peak rates Peak inflation narrative it's largely played out in H1 but I think set to go into overdrive in H2 um the lag feed through from uh monetary policy plus China are exporting disinflation I think we're going to see inflation quickly back to Target we've got the dollar breaking down we've got improved cinnamon and this narrative shift post to Blackrock ETF announcement um the institutions are coming um and we're combining this sort of macro with that narrative shift and which I I think is going to combine beautifully to see crypto take uh another leg higher in the second half of this year and yes I I think those debt 40ks look a good place for me Joe yeah well as as we uh as we speak ethereum is up 4.2 percent above 1950. so let's let's keep the hopium going and until next time [Music]
