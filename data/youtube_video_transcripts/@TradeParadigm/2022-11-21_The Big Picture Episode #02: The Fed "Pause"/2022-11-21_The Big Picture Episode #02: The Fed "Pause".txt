foreign [Music] director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture so obviously the headlines and the price action in crypto this week has been dominated by the FTX news it's certainly a body blow to the crypto industry and a pretty major setback I'd say on the path towards institutional adoption I'm short term we're seeing a deleveraging as markets try and work out exactly you know where the exposures lie I though I imagine a lot of that process would probably run its course now however we are still sadly likely faced with more sort of false liquidations as casualties emerge which is likely just to keep the pressure on crypto and make for a difficult couple of weeks as we navigate our way through this longer term you know this could be potentially the Catalyst that moves us to towards greater transparency and towards more effective solutions to deal with both credit and custody risk there's somewhat of an irony I think in all of this and with the failure of another Central institution that he kind of reinforces the value proposition I think for crypto in terms of the need for decentralized trust as forms of value exchange so you know who knows long term this may well be the crowning moment for D5 and it may accelerate actually the longer term path towards where we all kind of know this space can get to elsewhere and quite importantly I think the macros certainly turn more constructive I've been talking now for a couple of weeks about just some underlying signs that we're seeing a shift in the macrodynamic as markets start to price the end of the Fed rate hike cycle now finally we had a week of data last week weaker inflation data which came in at 0.27 on core which is the weakest reading since summer of 2021 now the Market's kind of been trying to play this pivot narrative and I think I've said before that it's less about a pivot or a pause What markets care about is the direction of travel and Jerome power at the fomc a couple of weeks ago he kind of confirmed that they're going to start slowing the pace of hikes now we offset that bit of good news with the idea that terminal rate the actual endpoint of where rates end up is potentially going to be higher than where they last thought however it's clear that we're now starting to see a Slowdown in the pace of hikes and we're gonna move towards that point where the FED finally pours now this in Poland and certainly the inflation data last week although it's only one the first kind of real sign that with you know that inflation's rolling over what's really important about a pause I think Morgan Stanley released a really good chart this week that just showed exactly why pause is so important to markets and you can see here exactly why that paw is important because historically every pause is followed by a cutting cycle so in pricing for a pause even if they hold that there for a while the market will then start to price the subsequent Cuts also important about every pause is that it's also been met by a substantial rally so markets who tend to look ahead of themselves and send to price ahead of themselves are just starting to price for this pause in this hike cycle and the data's now giving them cause for that that's a price for that and we even saw brainards just this week talk about the fact that the risks are a little bit some sort of more two-way now so clearly once the FED doesn't want to get everyone carried away and they still want to maintain a level of credibility that they're going to deal with inflation which is still too high Market switch price 6 months to nine months ahead of themselves are just starting to price the fact that we are now nearing this hike cycle now in looking at which assets I'll look at to establish that changing regime the two most important ones for me are U.S rates and the US dollar and we started to see those top out a few weeks ago and post the inflation print we start to see those movies really accelerate and break some significant levels so you can see here that two-year yields have broken that uptrend that that really started to steepen when the FED again renewed their hawkish rhetoric in August a much bigger move has actually been in the U.S 10-year yields which is broken Trend and now testing this sort of big 380 level now I think that's particularly important for tech stocks and for crypto because effectively Tech and crypto along duration assets so you kind of want to see 10-year yields and further out start to come lower and duration rally and you'll tend to find that Tech is the high beta duration and crypto perhaps the highest speed up so this starts to look pretty positive I think generally for risk and for crypto but however the biggest asset class to watch is the US dollar and we've seen a significant breakdown in the US dollar and from its nine month uptrend now for me if you kind of get the dollar right you'll probably get a lot of the macro right and you'll get crypto ultimately right now the dollar has been the wrecking ball that's destroyed pretty much every asset class this year it's a strangle on global growth and it sucked liquidity out of every corner of the world and every Market of the world so this breakdown in the data is potentially super significant to our markets and the other interesting thing for me is that FX tends to be in the asset class that really kind of sniffs out regime shift much more quickly in other asset classes so I think it's potentially very interesting that we're now seeing this breakdown in the dollar if this momentum sustains I think it signals the end of the current bear market now obviously crypto's got its own issues at the moment and I still think we're in for a couple of difficult weeks as we try and unpick them however I do think this is a significant shift in the macro I'm keeping an eye on us rates I'm keeping an eye on a dollar but it's a significant change and it may well be that we see in that final capitulation in crypto that then gives birth to the new bull market and I think the dollar would be the asset class to keep an eye on to signify that change [Music]
