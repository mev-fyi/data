hello everyone welcome to the Paradigm show where we talk about micro markets as well as macro markets today with me of course I have our ever present co-host David the macroman um hello David nice to see you again yes it is and in fact I took a shot at you last week too because you've missed two shows but I know it's for good reason uh so I think you have to introduce yourself properly yeah you have to introduce yourself again because people have forgotten who you are by this point but no our other co-host Joe uh welcome back I hope you had a great time in the Bahamas while we were here working away well I mean clearly I wasn't on a beach very much I mean I'm looking at myself into the screen I look as pasty as I was when I left right you look great well a lot of work not a lot of play unfortunately yeah who takes vacations in crypto anyway that's a myth yeah yeah [Laughter] and today we have with us Gordon from Genesis I'm very happy to have you on uh if you could give us a little bit of background that would be great sure yeah pleasure well greetings everyone good morning it's um very much a privilege to sit down with the guys at Paradigm um you know as as uh We've made mention in many sort of public discussions in the in the past and tweets from Genesis we're very proud to to be executing and transacting and to be one of the largest market makers on the Paradigm platform um xenogenesis is an Institutional uh crypto broker dealer's Market maker my background is in quantitative finance and econometrics um I've pretty much been trading options since I was 20 years old and started right out of college graduated from a an accredited New Jersey state institution and and went to the buy side and did macro volatility and ran a large book of risks with a bulge bracket hedge fund for about 10 years before getting into crypto made my way to Genesis in 2021 and have really been quite impressed I would say at the depth and breadth of this market and you know I would say that the quality of of the institutional grade trading tools that are out there including Paradigm so I'll kick it back to you guys and we can probably get into some more details about the market and how we're thinking about things coming into this you know slightly akimbo Ambiance at you know still the early days of 2023. um actually I have a question before we get into before we get into like the ball and all that um how did you make that transition why did you make that transition from what you were doing before into crypto sure yeah so um but you know the macro volatility environment had a pretty incredible run from I would say the post 911 era right through the global financial crisis kind of into the taper tantrum um but but then you know the regulation of hedge funds and and I would say the kind of dissemination of information about trading volatility products and stuff like Forex and commodities took a lot of the edge away um and it became far less appetizing to do that kind of uh a business and you know tail risks type trades which obviously paid out in in 08 and again sort of in 11 started to be serial underperformers as systematic ball selling came into play so when I discovered crypto by random chance in 2013 at a Formula One event of course where does someone discover a crypto um you know I sort of picked it up and ran with it you know got involved as a as an entrepreneur as an investor as as an advisor and an independent Trader an Arbitrage or a crypto enjoyer if you will and you know I'm more or less operated independently for for the better part of um you know six or seven years and I I really always felt that there was basically no reason to do kind of a real day job in crypto unless it was doing institutional trading of options right because I know what that takes what that looks like what sorts of venues one needs and um I I was you know bopping around the Middle East and and Europe at that time and um all of a sudden it sort of came to my radar that there was this thing called derivat and that there was actual um institutional grade crypto trading taking place so uh kind of shift myself back to the States at the time of the pandemic and um and you know connected with one of the former principals of the trading business at Genesis when I was pursuing some Graduate Studies at Columbia in in data science one thing led to another and um you know I just started running bunch of data scientific you know tasks and and research oriented projects within crypto space focusing on some of the same stuff that's come out in recent work by by Amber data and others about spot volatility correlation volatility regimes term structure service Arbitrage and the like um and you know I pretty much decide at that time that there really wasn't anything else worth doing in derivative space besides trading crypto so so that's really the the origin of the the transition from you know kind of a an independent sort of crypto Nomad to um you know getting back in a seat again and trading institutional uh of all that's that's funny because I actually Dove down the rabbit hole of crypto at a Formula One event as well in Singapore in 20 2018 so that's right yes it's the uh it's it's the Gateway uh it's just the Gateway not not a Gateway anything else just the Gateway yeah exactly exactly so yeah it's quite it's quite fascinating kind of kind of hearing your background having the traditional macro um experience and then coming into crypto it's very funny you know when I made the jump uh into the space professionally about a year ago you know going back and speaking to my former colleagues at JPMorgan or Deutsche Bank like it's very funny speaking to them they're like wait this is a market this exists you know you're telling me you're telling me one month like 25 Delta calls don't trade 10 Falls wide and you know but people actually will put on a trade that's over like a couple million notional what like this is insane right so you know it's over time increasingly you know we're going to hear more and more stories um like Gordon and of course Gordon you know he's the governor he's the he's the OG in in the space and we're very very lucky to have him as Apartments yeah I think that's true right like there is always this surprise Factor sorry yeah I I was gonna say as well like coming from the macro side myself and um from FX options and what have you and I I think that's one of the things that if I think about sort of slight changes over the past year or so and when I'm having conversations it's kind of moving people past that you know the no coin is who kind of go oh Bitcoin is is just uh this Ponzi scheme what have you so actually talking about some of the stuff we're doing and then when the penny drops I uh you know you know that that's kind of you know these derivative structures that you're overlaying on this is what we've been doing for years and then they start to think and see the opportunities and yeah and as you say to know that you know this stuff isn't trading 10 volts wide there's a real marker in it and then you know institutional grade uh infrastructure to trade this stuff um I've definitely noticed more people getting interested to to start looking at this and taking the space seriously it's interesting yeah and it's you know David you you make an excellent point and you're obviously from a Forex background I would say crypto is like it's one of these places where you kind of you go to some kind of social event or some Soiree or Gala to the extent that those exist anymore post covid and you know you find out all of a sudden that you you know a surprising number of people who are all at this wonderful party right and and they may have been your liquidity providers at a bank they may have been your peers at another hedge fund they may have um they may too have been at that that Gateway Formula One event of years past right it's it's a little bit of a um you know Society of the initiated uh and a coalition of the willing to step in every day and trade volatility in these markets but I think it's because this is perhaps the most intriguing ball Market that I've ever seen right so I I you know for a little bit more background I started on trading em Forex options right so I showed up day one 2005 at my job even before I graduated and they you know gave me a bunch of material to read and said this is the Mexican local interest rate swap curve and these are the new swaptions on this and we we want you to build um you know a stochastic volatility model that you know appropriately Maps this surface because there were like options in bantamax was quoting them and all that stuff and that at the time was super interesting and then it became super commoditized right um I was just talking to some colleagues this morning about trading you know Peruvian inflation linked local currency denominated bonds against um you know dollar offshore ndx right like that was exotic at the time and there was good Edge but that's all been done now right I mean that that trade is literally done there's literally you know 50 billion of assets chasing those same trades so if you want to do any thing I believe is kind of quantitatively robust and you come from that discipline um you know crypto you know crypto is where it's at and I I often say sort of jokingly in many of our chats right like the space of crypto of all Traders is very much one that still kind of adheres to the way I feel to sort of an old set of codes right and we often say it in the chat like there's a there's a Bushido there's a way of the warrior um because it's it's such a brutal asset class right the and such a brutal Silo of volatility in terms of how fast the regimes flip how big the swings are in volatility how aggressive some of the flows can be and um you know you really have to be centered based if you will I think to to kind of you know keep yourself um sort of centered in in this zero-g environment and make reasonable decisions about risk management and trading um you know the old saw of course is that Wall Street in general if you don't know who you are it's an expensive place to find out crypto ball I would say if you don't know who you are right this this is sort of a a potentially fatal place to find out but but that's what makes it fun um without question that's what makes it fun and yeah and public service announcement for all the Trad five ball players that uh want to give it a shot but not take away all the edge here's your information exactly um on that note Joe if you could go over some flows and maybe some ball with this yeah yeah absolutely well Gordon's been in the thick of it so it's gonna be a good discussion here so just a star so back in December so when the crypto option volumes in December as Gordon can attest to it was so dire the market was just was absolutely awful right no nobody was trading everybody was scared of FTX blah blah blah so we ran this inner dealer option flow analysis uh that was actually lucky enough to be featured on coindesk and there's going to be a link in the description of the video below so you can you can check out that article but just a recap so in December the buy side taker interest that we saw so like family offices High net worth individual hedge funds it got absolutely obliterated in the aftermath of FTX and then you also had seasonal effects uh into the end of the year now just you know performance was bad people were just cutting their losses and just waiting for January so we wanted to quantify that and see how much of the Paradigm flow was actually just market makers trading against other market makers which I'm sure Gordon has opinions on it probably is not the best way to make money so but the main takeaway was that in December the inner dealer option flow as a percentage of Paradigm volume was easily at 2022 high so you see that jump in that chart up to the 45 you is absolutely brutal the market and he ended that podcast by asking the question are buy-side takers gonna jump back into the pool in q1 and boy have they you know we've discussed this on the previous couple episodes you know large takers fomoing into this rally you know starting with the large outright calls and then now the and now we're seeing more and more of these calls call spreads so we re-ran that inner dealer option flow analysis and the percentage of Paradigm flow now occurring between only market makers is back down to the healthy median levels which we saw throughout the passive um throughout the rest of 20 to 22 which was at that median was 28 and this is right around 30. and sure it's the result we expected you know given how busy the past couple weeks were for us but it's always good to I guess to back it up with that data so Gordon a question I'll post for you is you know what's your thought on real interest coming back to the market is this just a result okay spot rallying people following in like is he here for good is it going to be you know just dependent on spot I I feel that that is highly likely that there is an extreme degree of spot ball correlation and spot volume correlation and spot Ball volume correlation right um there's been a lot of work research related work about reflexivity in crypto markets I think the first time I read what I would consider to be a somewhat erudite piece about um reflexivity was uh was in Q4 of 2020 um Eric Peters at One River who I think has been a pretty solid voice for crypto adoption at an Institutional level and and sort of looking at some of the distributional benefits of the addition of crypto to a portfolio talked a lot about it at the time and that was when Bitcoin was really ramping up um you know from from the mid to low teens and on its way to breaking through 20 and the huge historical Bull Run um the derivatives Market at times also exhibit exhibits that same kind of reflexivity and I think that's that's in full force here right so why is that right so if you think about it what we saw to close out the year was price is low for coins volatility low both in realized and implied and volume is low um and and that has a lot to do with one people just really kind of left the asset class for dead and there was a lot of thought process that well I just don't want to be in it I want to wait I want to see if there are better opportunities whatever the case may be but it's also just a function of the pure arithmetic on balance sheets in the asset class which is to say essentially um you know when you talk about coin denominated derivatives markets which is derivative which is what we're all trading people's ability to have Deployable collateral or assets to spend premium on is oftentimes a function of How High those coin prices are and and so when we found ourselves down at 15 16k Bitcoin and he's kind of languishing around 12 1300 people just didn't have a lot of Firepower right to make bets and and no willingness to do it but yet as soon as prices ramp up you have higher coin prices greater ability to play Capital greater ability to margin positions or take bets plus that sort of psychological self-fulfilling prophecy of higher Vol higher volumes um higher prices and that kind of virtuous feedbacks group so there is likely to be that sort of persistent relationship um I I find right and and that's one of the reasons why I think when you start to look at the performance of SKU right the realization of um you know sort of sticky dollars or sticky strike volatility regimes and to what extent you know we're looking at um a distribution of returns that resembles um you know past practices for crypto you really need to think about it almost in kind of a markovian sense right because there are clearly times where higher levels of crypto pricing will bring materially lower levels of implied volatility and that has to do with let's say minor Dynamics or call overriding flows or what have you but coming off a bottom it was I would say as desperate right as um you know as kind of utterly languishing as as the December lows were for for spot and especially Vault um you know we've seen this reflexive bounce right and that's where you're getting a huge amount of taker involvement that um is clearly going to persist at higher prices I mean from our own metrics just looking roughly at Paradigm statistics which is easier for us to talk about on here um you know we we saw our volumes basically triple right from the first two weeks of January now to um to the back end of January and that's not a surprise and that has to do with exactly as you say right the deal or the dealer um you know sort of two guys fishing for for one fish in the same Pond and hooking their lines against each other all of a sudden became this C replete with um you know sort of Happily participating takers not to say indiscriminate but happily participating takers who have a view and are willing to deploy their balance sheet again because the 22 000 Bitcoin it's a very different world than sixteen thousand absolutely and I just want to go back to your point on reflexivity very quickly there's a lot of talk in in the crypto ball Market of like actually how you know dealer dollar gamma exposure like how that actually matters which I think maybe we we discussed this Gordon like four or five months ago how late a market that is so small compared to the size of its spot of course you hear about you know dealer gamma positioning and you know s p options and Equity options in general quite a lot but given how small this Market is there's certainly a lot of talk around oh like people you know people when we have these rallies kind of like point to things right it's like okay yeah it's you know technically driven because of the liquidations and then oh yeah we had all this crazy buying upside buying pre-cpi which you know got dealers short gamma and then that is fueling that reflexivity and fueling that rally like how much do you think that that is that is actually a thing and was a driver for these higher coin prices yeah um gamma gamma counts more so for this Market than almost any other part of what I spent my macro life doing was was trading a significant amount of precious metals volatility particularly markets like silver from 2009 to 2012. and that market was one in which you saw the re-engagement of the Institutional Investor and and perhaps you know more of the dedicated buy side um you know traffic transactor crypto feels um feels a bit like that which is to say open interest at a specific strike can count for almost everything oops and we see this in the rapid collapses of uh realized and implied volatility whereby there is that same kind of flywheel effect both to the upside and the downside and and flow Dynamics count for a lot because it's not a market in which there's continuous uptime of two-way participation on both sides of the market for every given strike on the surface and and as a result right it means that if you are long or short a given strike you're at going to in many cases if particularly if you're a dealer you know you're going to end up needing to dynamically hedge it if you don't want to cross a large spread a relatively large spread to get out of it notwithstanding the great Improvement in liquidity on derivative itself and certainly the great enhancement to that liquidity um you know via Paradigm the reality is just that it's not Capital efficient in order you know to to manage a book of risk to Simply trade out of stuff back to that flows and so as a result people tend to Warehouse in my view right based on the flows that we see people tend to Warehouse um fixed strike risk and they tend to trade around those fixed strikes as opposed to dynamically moving strikes in and out of their book which would tend to give you this this more of a floating Dynamics which is also why we see sort of pronounce shifts between you know the the age-old dialectic of sticky strike versus sticky Delta ball Dynamics because it really depends whether people are holding on to something or whether people are dynamically hedging you know a spot around it or trading out of those so so yes and there's clearly a lot of good data on this there are many data providers that have gotten into the game of analyzing strike topography and oi and what that means there are even more sophisticated takes on it now trying to estimate how much voi is short how much is long is it dealers is it takers um and what are the behaviors of of the holders of those positions around that strike and in that sense right again kind of coming back to why this is an interesting asset class it is very game theoretic I find right when I when I sit and look and trade this asset class I think the the application of game theoretic constraints to many financial markets is often overstated a lot of people that say well hey if you're a great poker player you'll make a great options player or vice versa I think a lot of times that's just not true um you know because the games occur and completely different circumstances I might argue if you're a great back-end player right you could be a great options Trader or vice versa but but when it comes to crypto I do think it is more like that because you know I'm sitting in a room right now with um you know with eight chairs around a table that's what the crypto ball Market feels like trading a lot of the time right which is to say you know who you're trading against and and quite literally if you're counting cards you're going to be able to understand with a reasonably High degree of probability what positions are and the certainty you have about other folks positions and that informs you know the kinds of risk management decisions that you make it is highly conditional right based based upon the information that is available in the markets which is really getting better and better and so that gamma effect 100 matters doesn't matter all the time and I would say matters less when liquidity gets better and there is more taker participation because when that happens right you tend to see more of the two-way flow at a greater number of strikes across the service right I I think where people kind of get like caught up with it is when you think about like dynamically hedging Deltas to to manage to manage your gamma where it's like oh okay like I need to rebalance my deltas and you know maybe I need to trade you know five million uh of spot in order to do so like how how would that volume that seems very small like in comparison to you know the spot market like actually meaningfully be able to move the spot Market higher I use this just like a function you know of low order order both liquidity Atop A Book Like it it's something that when I came into to this Market it you know I certainly struggled yeah so yeah crypto I would say looking at it you You observe volumes that were traded on exchanges like FTX that are traded around exchanges like Finance for derivatives linear derivatives I should say and you look at spot exchanges like your Krakens coinbase bit stamps and I should say those those mentioning of names is neither an endorsement for or against the use of those products or Services there are many many exchanges out there I'm mentioning those as a representative heuristic sample um but the reality is that transacting significant size even in linear products is for um obviously it's far trickier than the gross volumes that are traded and a lot of that has to do with how crypto participation happens and and how people are sort of involved on both sides of the bid and ask and and you know kind of who is moving markets but yes five million dollars of um directional risk and linear derivative or even a spot product and crypto is more material than it would be in other markets because sort of liquidity has a bit of a sort of a vaporware element to it which is it's there but not necessarily at the perceived price on the screen I think that's especially true for Vol but it's certainly true in the linear space and we've seen liquidity change over time too I mean you know it can't be overstated the extent to which an Enterprise like FTX was responsible for a huge portion of global crypto liquidity and as a result Dynamics within the market including um you know hedging Delta risk have obviously changed and they will change right if there were to be a resurrection of an FTX style exchange as a competitor or as a peer to binance or the emergence of such a linear derivatives product hygiene facility on an existing exchange whereas you know coinbase for instance if they were to roll out or continue to develop things like Perpetual Futures markets and in a bunch of their products and so that that will influence it as well but but surely um you are a world away from essentially assuming zero slippage hedging costs um you know in in the linear land as you would be in equities or Forex right I mean I as I said I cut my teeth in a Forex world you're talking about two to three basis points of um you know a bid ask spread in maybe a hundred million dollars of value at times in something like Euros or Yen and even an illiquid Emerging Market Forex it might only be 10 to 15 basis points in crypto the tick ball um can be far more significant I think a statistic that I saw on Friday when Bitcoin was absolutely ripping you know was that Bitcoin was moving uh or ticking around 20 basis points per second right um and and so that is absolutely going to to dictate right won the price of volatility products and also the decisions that people make about um dynamically hedging those in linear land do you think uh Gordon do you think on that I mean obviously we've had a couple of um sort of big weekend pumps in crypto do you think um guys kind of knowing that and knowing there's short gamma positions out there and that Dynamic hedging uh relationship kind of Target those those illiquid periods over weekends to kind of trigger some of that and and false false guys into sort of chasing it yes it could happen I I can't speak to whether I know of it happening or or I believe that it does happen but I can say it could happen um it's certainly been an observed phenomenon in much larger markets like Forex right where you have known barriers um known strike exposure that are in the market or that have been made known through interdealer um you know price Discovery mechanisms and you you trade to those pins you trade to those barriers quite clearly in crypto and we see the incidence of large fixed strike appetite coinciding with significant movements in in spot and I would say either sort of simultaneously or almost preemptive it has the appearance of a preemptive nature and you know crypto participation I think is different than other kinds as well right which which is simply to say people evaluate risk differently than they do in other asset classes because we're still nascent right as as a as a silo right we're not not everybody's sitting around the table the the metaphorical table that I've mentioned has 20 years of experience trading options at an Institutional level right they may have gotten into the crypto space within the last five years they may have accumulated a significant degree of capital or raised that capital in a very short amount of time and are deploying it in a relatively new space with I would say a lesser degree of experience or a more permissive set of risk controls than would be present if you were talking about a Trad Phi um bulge bracket financial institution and I believe that also informs things right to say you have someone sitting on half a yard or a yard of capital that may or may not have a risk manager that's going to tap them on the shoulder if they bust over some kind of Delta again or a Vega limit and someone that's just simply willing to make large concentrated bets because that's you know how they got where they are that's their their ethos and as as a money manager and they may have consenting Capital that backs them to do that but that's very different from from tradify where there are a limited number of people that can make those kinds of bets and especially in sizes that would affect the markets in which they are and that comes back to original observations about scale right all of a sudden 50 or 100 million of AUM in this asset class you know the the conversion factor of the similar size meaning and traffic is literally geometric right it might be a power of 10 or more when you talk about traffic yeah and it seems like the most like reflexive and flows and the ones that are able to bully the market you know the most you know it tends to be from those guys that seem to have like this unlimited War chest of like being able to you know to spend on that you know outright calls so I think I think that that totally resonates of you know why we do see this this reflexivity in the market but moving on here Gordon I want to get your view on all this on all this you know gamma selling straddle selling that we've been seeing so for everybody on the screen who's watching there was an insane amount of straddle selling and short dated this week you know as the spot action started to die off you know we were actually you know joking with Gordon and some of his colleagues in chat like that all this selling is just killing all momentum in this market I mean you just look at these prints right 1100 of the Feb 10 23 000 sold you know a thousand of the Feb 20ks another thousand of the Feb 23ks and you know the 27 Jan won was particularly interesting uh as we discussed you know on Monday those 27 jams were trading in you know the high the high 60s and then we started seeing the selling pressure on these later in the afternoon and it turned out to be a hell of a sale I mean if you just look at that right picture you know that those Jan 27s are now trading at a 51 ball right so I mean clearly had a large impact on the curve you know along with the lethargic realized and kind of just goes into previous discussions that we've had around how like the ball of all in this market is so crazy so like Gordon what's your view it's all selling back is this going to kill all the fun in the market I I do think it's yeah yeah I do think it's back um and and we should expect that I'm a bit surprised that it's come in the form of straddles uh as as opposed to outright selling of calls I I would have expected net net OLS equal more explicit overriding and in fact it's been a bit of the opposite in the sense that most of the optionality demand has not been local to spot I think if you look at the flows that have appeared on Paradigm there were a huge amount of calls spread buyers into the rally there were also a significant amount of winning call buyers right guys that are picking up inside of one month um you know sub 20 delta type options but when it comes to what people have elected to sell they are selling very meaty at the money type options and in particularly shorter dated ones it was interesting to see that the march at the money straddles or RFQ today didn't trade but a more um you know let's say a robust bid was shown for for the Feb dates and that's what was given again quite quite aggressively if you look at the break-evens for this trade it's not hard to see why a taker might find it appetizing right you're selling an option that has a downside break even if somewhere around um you know 20 000 and and an upside break even that is above the post-crisis highs of Bitcoin and so sort of optically at an overall level you can rationalize why someone might do this um and and I think that there are sound reasons for it I do feel though that at this level of Bitcoin prices it's not as easy as sale right and we know from the the start of the bull market which was arguably you know kind of coming off the the bottom um you know the covet bottom there were periods in which volatility language tremendously but they didn't last very long and they didn't last very long because again with that flywheel effect higher prices we get more involvement we get greater demand for optionality and as a result selling Vol you know a straddle a one-month straddle around these kind of 13 percent type levels seems optically appealing but the reality is you have to kind of think about really what you're selling and and you're selling an option that is priced according to a model that values volatility in some sort of log normalized sense even if we're making modifications to um a parametrized surface that attempts to account for this in some way at the end of the day you know the the pricing that appears on on sort of Paradigm reference prices or or thereabit is still based on a black trolls model you know most of the time we can talk on a later podcast about how we think those parametrizations happen and who's making them and what kind of traffic trading background they come from that's a very interesting topic um but suffice it to say you may end up making the wrong assumptions about volatility both to the upside and downside right when when you're trading this and um you know I think that that that does you know bear in mind when when you're stepping in to make a decision uh you know whether to buy or sell all or managing a book of risk about trading it that um Vol being today sort of bid at 56 and a half 57 for Feb dates and having been you know bid yesterday at 61 or 62. doesn't really tell us a whole lot other than that's where where the marginal propensity of dealers to take down risk is because tomorrow Bitcoin could actually just move like 15 in either direction quite literally right and it doesn't it's not a it's not a six standard deviation event to get a one day 10 move in Bitcoin so you know I'm I'm we're not dealing with one normal distribution or not and I think that you know look there's been some very interesting statistical results including those that were published by Amber data about the profitability of selling um certain Tenors of straddles over a period of time using a dynamic hedging strategy which you know generate a reasonable amount of excess risk um you know premium returns associated with them that also assumes a certain ability to hedge in real time and I would argue that as we've seen in the move up right you you don't have this kind of you know sort of Brownian motion wiener process based um you know sort of zero drift regime that's just not how we operate in crypto and so um crypto quite literally we could get stock to this 23 level and realize at seven to eight percent annualized for days at a time and that's what we saw in December when there was a large amount of volatility Supply and a low degree of interest but we can also have these large breakout events um and I think the other thing that that you know sort of bears keeping in mind and I can certainly say we've seen this which is the lower volatility gets at higher levels of crypto prices there are takers that are going to look at it and say hey you know what a 50 implied volt I will just load the boat and so it's less of a one-way Street as opposed to at 15K Bitcoin with volatility down at 50 you're even 40 in the front months people simply don't have the balance sheet or the appetite to load up on this stuff and so it does become more sort of reflexive downside whereas I would argue with current prices there's more of a two-way level so ball selling is back we know that that volatility selling under certain back test can generate tremendous excess returns we know that there are funds in the crypto landscape that have done well selling volatility as a programmatic strategy notwithstanding you know 50 plus percent periodic drawdowns and that's what makes it a great two-way market right I mean I think you know it remains to be seen there's a huge amount of event risk on the calendar we've got um you know a GDP pce jobless claims uh you know coming up in the immediate days you've got fomc next week we've got CPI after that um you know the the crypto Market beta to those sorts of releases and the implications to to things like interest rates and Equity markets is certainly declined since you know more of the bear market trading days but um you know I I would argue that selling Vault the local lows is less of a of a clear call than um you know the kind of letting it go when it's when it's at 70. and that seems a bit taught illogical but but that is crypto right you get greater supply of all at the lows and greater demand at the highs there is not a um economically classical uh Supply demand curve uh type of intersection in this market it is very much it with that I think it's a great opportunity to segue into the macro stuff uh that's it for me I'll stop sharing but um you're up yeah I'm just gonna say I'm sorry I listen to this like fascinated golden um like really interesting and just sort of getting your take on it enjoying this conversation um my pleasure yeah that's great uh from the macro side I mean uh not not A lot's changed in terms of how I'm viewing things I mean if I think of how I look at crypto for a macro framework and the things that I think are driving things rates liquidity dollar risk and flows I think those things are all trending um the way I'd like to see a continuation in in the rally so you know we're seeing rates uh still Trend lower uh we see in liquidity starting to improve uh both with the TGA drawdown as the US hit the debt ceiling and also you're seeing uh the Bank of China a pboc and Bank of Japan balance sheet expansion outpace that of the fed and the ECB so liquidity is improving uh the daughter sat on the lows lowest level since like June of last year um and it looks like it's gonna sort of break to to new lows again um risk looks pretty stable right uh Vic sat on a low 20 handle um so wrist looks pretty pretty steady um and then flows you know um I've been talking about Market being under positioned um for for risk generally we've seen that from surveys over the last uh sort of week or so and we're seeing that in some of our flows come into this market right particularly positioned for the top side and cool spreads so I I think there's a real um there's a real kind of macro Dynamic Drive in this market I don't see it as a sort of bear Market rally um I think the consolidation in price that we have in is is uh constructive um and I I think as we sort of move through the FED next week um I think we formed a nice sort of Base here till intake the next leg higher so yeah feeding constructive and I think the macro uh is is is is kind of supporting these moves that we've seen so far this year yeah I don't I don't disagree there I mean you know we've seen a big leadership in Gold amongst the commodity complex and although the correlation between Bitcoin and gold has varied widely and wildly over periods of time um you know there is some propensity there to uh to associate or prognosticate um you know kind of future asymmetric upside um to you know to bitcoin possibilities given that gold is trading back in 1900 you know and last year with in the macro space was was a bit of a curious year right because we saw a significant online of some of these code error liquidity trades gold got absolutely dashed trading back below 1700 um you know you saw higher beta plays like silver trade down from 27 28 to 17. right so pretty pretty vicious unwind there for a obviously more retail driven product and and Bitcoin of course factored into that mix and in some cases it's it's returned performance was way worse those assets have indeed come back gold has had a major Resurgence back uh for a very obvious reason which is a huge amount of Central Bank buying right this is out in the Press it's been reported that everyone from you know the Uzbek Central Bank which is a relatively smaller Central Asian Central Bank which produces its its own um you know gold and buys it from its own domestic producers to the Russians to to others people are at a macro level quite clearly looking at other dollar Alternatives this is a fact right um we've seen States ranging from um you know sanctioned States like Russia and Iran who are talking about forming their own currency right um backed by some kind of other asset in the case of Iran and Russia they've talked about doing the gold back currency Argentina and Brazil talking about having their own currency right for the purposes of trade we have seen um relatively more Fringe players like the Central African Republic now adopt Bitcoin right as as actually um you know an officially accepted payment methodology and you know you can question whether these are memes I think the El Salvador exercise has been largely laughed at but I can say having toured um you know toward the world you know reasonably well in in 2022 and talked to a wide variety of players the diversification impetus and and we can talk about whether that implicates crypto directly or indirectly is strong and the ability to use decentralized Ledger technology you know blockchain in that process is also strong right um Central Bank digital currencies may or may not immediately implicate the use of blockchain Technology probably from your more established players Like Me CB um they're they're less likely to of necessity and certainly from the FED they would be less likely to but we know that other such projects including the Sand Dollar including the digital rent and B are out there and we know that real trade is is actually happening in crypto and so I I kind of come back to way back when where this all got started and why people were so excited about crypto and and crypto and Bitcoin in particular um you know is this interesting uh crystallized teardrop that sits at the Nexus of the price of data and money and energy and I think now as the world is staring down the barrel of a gun at decarbonization the attempts to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions for the global economy by 2040 as well as wrangling with the effects of a geopolitical decision that's been taken by the small L small D liberal Democratic Western Bloc to boycott or otherwise cap consumption of Russian hydrocarbons um this is a decision this is a policy it's a policy that is no more or less um official than let's say quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve it is a decision there is a consequence that comes with it and part of the consequence of that policy is that on the margin the acceptance of dollars is likely to be less right and as the acceptance of dollars in the macro world is likely to be less people start to ask the question not necessarily to say that they would use Bitcoin immediately as a transnational payment mechanism for things like hydrocarbons or other Goods but people ask what are my Alternatives and the more people start to ask the stronger that narrative is and there is the potential right for for reflexivity there's also the potential for um energy Surplus countries to think about monetizing the value of their state reserves in the form of cryptocurrency it's a choice you can today take a look at the economics of proof of work mining be it for Bitcoin or some other token and and determine what your internal rate of return is at current hash prices difficulty um and you know Global hash rates as well as the price of Bitcoin and thanks to these great wonderful liquid derivatives markets that we're trading in you can hedge it um and and you can arrive at a dollarized rate of return that effectively only depends um you know on on the difficulty and hash rate of Global Market assuming that you depreciate your rigs to zero this is fascinating right and this is a real conversation that's going on out there and I think that the people who need to pay attention to that and I I do think it's part of the narrative coming back to where I started this about the macro again no specific Insight here you know have not had any conversations to this effect but going back to you know what really engendered a sea change in a market like gold and um you know what took that kind of out of out of the you know crisis doldrums and and gave it a leg up as this new de facto flag bearer for the anti-dollar asset class it was when India stepped up and bought the IMF gold right around the time of the GFC and every time we've seen a material transfer of gold as an asset from a longer term low conviction holder to a shorter term High conviction buyer that has spurred a new leg up in the asset class right there was the so-called uh Brown bottom in gold right when the bank of England dumped all their gold at 250 an ounce and and that was literally it right and it took off from there then there was the IMF uh you know liquidation to sale to India at whatever the price was just under a thousand dollars an ounce at that time maybe seven fifty eight hundred and then gold had a double what if a sovereign state investment arm we're to be thinking about Bitcoin as an allocation right what what would the return distribution of Bitcoin look like if we were to find out sometime over the course of 2023 that pif Kia qia or Adia or adq or you know any of these other GIC alphabet soup you know Sovereign Love funds were even to be looking at Bitcoin right and and I think I think we all kind of know what that would look like and um that to me feels more real as a possibility than than it has ever felt given the macro conditions that you've elucidated yeah and and I think that's the thing right that's you know in my conversations with people it it's kind of like you know you've got a low Delta call option on this potential Feud of State future state of the world um you know size it accordingly to a portfolio that like you can stomach the volatility but yeah like you're long Bitcoin and sort of crypto generally you're yeah you have this sort of call option on the potential side of the world because like you say if that if that headline breaks then man um you you're going to struggle to get into that trade so yeah you just you just like the the last like 10 minutes of monologue there there was so much to unpack you mentioned so many interesting things that I want to ask you questions about uh I don't I don't think we have enough time but but I do want to go back to one thing you said um like I I have an economist friend in Argentina and I've been there um a few times and we've talked a lot about like what the state of um their currency is and so like two years ago I wrote about Regional currencies or like a regional currency that was a basket of currencies that could potentially be backed by Bitcoin what are your thoughts around that um Argentina is a very cool use case and let's set a little bit of macro context there um and and I hope maybe we'll have an opportunity to have a bit more of a multi-planary forum about this discussion of some other informed persons at a later time but if you think about sort of why crypto has survived um you know and and expanded to where it is today some people would argue it's it's because the conventional policy mix from both the emerging and developed world has been so rotten for so long right so Argentina you know to give them credit for for many wonderful things that they do including Tango and soybeans and winning the World Cup and all that stuff they may they may have saved crypto in part right I mean quite literally Argentina Ukraine Venezuela Zimbabwe and other jurisdictions Nigeria have put a bid under crypto that never existed before right because if you live in a place like Argentina whereby you know that at any given day the official transactable rate of the currency May devalue by 50 or more 100 in in some cases um and and the street rates can move as much you don't think so very badly of holding Bitcoin which has 70 annualized volatility doesn't feel like a bad trade-off right you can take it anywhere with you your pace says you can't exchange them anywhere so so this idea all of a sudden of a regional currency board that is backed by Bitcoin doesn't seem irrational is it immediately implementable there are policy related reasons why that may not happen as quickly as it should right we've seen these Sovereign crypto initiatives before believe it or not in 2017 late 2017 it's it's sort of a piece of crypto Arcana Venezuela came out with a cryptocurrency called the petrol right and this was a Nicolas Maduro uh sponsored idea whereby there was some loose affiliation of the value of assets under the ground in Venezuela and this cryptocurrency no one knew what blockchain it was on and what its degree of fungibility would be um there there was sort of you know barely an IRC 20 kind of standard at the time and I doubt that Venezuela really got that far along in their analysis but needless to say Venezuela was sanctioned to Oblivion India idea never took off but now as we sit here this is very much a realistic possibility right for a community a market like mercosur right um in Latin America to say or Andean countries to say hey you know what um we we can implement this in a number of ways including communal Bitcoin mining right whereby we translate Surplus energy which most of these countries have or other energy fungible Commodities into producing Bitcoin which goes into a treasury um you know with which sort of backs and whole are in part by faith and credit this this Regional currency board and what if we actually set some kind of you know um Bitcoin standard for those it's entirely achievable um and in a time now where dollar access is harder AML kyc regulations even for friendly jurisdictions or jurisdictions that used to be considered friendly had never been more difficult um people like the idea of having an alternative right um it's it's not it's not obvious to me that if you look at you know West African jurisdictions like Nigeria or Angola or economically complex jurisdictions in Latin America like in Ecuador like a Bolivia like in Argentina like a Venezuela um that you would be opposed to this de facto and say you know what I would just really rather have dollars I think as a policy maker especially as a younger policy maker and there is a younger bent to the policy maker mix in these countries right who are under 50 years old maybe under 40 years old who understand what blockchain is what proof of work is um I I think there is an increasing likelihood that some of this experimentation um you know may well take hold right in the same way that there's been a tremendous degree of sort of medical grade experimentation in in Western monetary and fiscal policy particularly since the pandemic and and more so since the global financial crisis we should expect this to happen in some of these jurisdictions as well and and I think that's part of the narrative right and and it may well bring two-way volatility the asset class it will certainly bring more activity in the hedging space and the role of derivative markets in facilitating that kind of participation is going to be very key right there's no doubt in my mind that's it and that's why we're here one last question like going back to going back to Bitcoin mining I have a friend who runs a couple Bitcoin uh mobile minds and they they use flare gas um to do that and it's it's really interesting really cool and probably another a topic for another time but you were talking about like different um Sovereign wealth funds holding Bitcoin or potentially even mining Bitcoin um do you think if you were to speculate that Russia is actually mining Bitcoin and holding Bitcoin I would say uh you know let's work backwards from a few statistics so I was reading a good report today about Kazakhstan and and the the decrease in the hash rate um uh the percentage share of hash rate in Kazakhstan which at its peak post-china Exodus was almost 20 percent and the report was touting the fact that the hash rate in Kazakhstan has collapsed and and Fallen now to you know below eight percent maybe below six percent and of course this was um trumpeted by folks who are proponents of a green or mining regime is to say that you know basically most of kazakhstan's mining came from um you know hydrocarbon sources some thermal coal and some you know burning mouths that are never other forms of heavy fuel oil which are obviously not what um uh what what anybody wants to see in terms of reducing the carbon footprint of mining so Kazakhstan uh you know sits on the Caspian Sea um in in an area of the world kind of known as Central or West Asia and and its closest neighbors um are who its closest neighbors are uh Russia to to the north Azerbaijan uh to the West Iran to the South across the Caspian Sea and China to the east um putting mining rigs in containers um is possible if it's seaborne shipping but of course Kazakhstan I think is what's known as a doubly landlocked country so not very obvious that their mining rigs would have would have gone into cargo containers and um so when you look as to where all that hash hash power when you can ask China and and China still has very severe bans on cryptocurrency mining and I think it's pretty well monitored and understood as to how much mining could be happening in China um so it really doesn't leave that many possibilities and if you go by a process of elimination it it really would would basically exclude Azerbaijan it's a smaller country it does have some Surplus energy but their uh their grid is tightly controlled by um I guess you would call somewhat of a a monarchic um you know governance structure by the Alia family and and I think if they were in Bitcoin mining it probably would have been talked about and so that really just leaves you with Russia and Iran as to places that that the rigs would have gone from a logistical standpoint and then the final step down from that is what's your cost to power and when you look at the cost of power quite incidentally Russia and Iran also happen to be number one and number two in global gas reserves um you know quite quite literally by a factor of almost two from the next highest ranking power so I think you know Iran is like 1.2 trillion uh BCF and Russia is maybe 1.3 or 4 in terms of proven reserves so what that means is especially now if they're sanctioned countries they have all this excess gas domestically and they got to figure out what to do with it um and and then you put the last piece of the puzzle together which is magically um you know right now in the midst of a very cold winter in a place like Iran they're reporting severe uh gas and electricity shortages in certain parts of the country that normally should be amply supplied and people are sort of batting their heads and saying like well how come I don't have gas to heat my home I mean this stuff is basically free here so putting all those together right I leave you to your own conclusions but I think it would be it would be um uninformed to opine that some of the mining Hardware from Kazakhstan has not made its way to neighboring countries um and and particularly those that find themselves less able or unable to access the Global Financial system have Surplus energy that can be monetized and have a reasonable degree of Financial and technological sophistication with lots of otherwise unemployed engineering graduates who might be able to do things with those kinds of rigs so that's my answer to the question all right a good answer um closing I'll leave it to you guys closing thoughts a joke do you wanna do you want to wrap up or um yeah just go for it yeah I mean I guess the main takeaway is you know compared to December where it was just a brutal market market makers training against market makers not a good way for anybody to make money that has significantly decreased in in the month of January and and we couldn't be more happy uh to see that but take our interest is back but that being said fair amount of gamma involved Supply now coming into the market hopefully that does not stop the momentum we'll see David yeah I just think from my side um say I think the macrodynamic is supportive of this move that we've seen throughout the start of the year it continues to support it uh the moves are unfolding if I look at rates liquidity dollar risk and flows um so I think this kind of consolidation uh correction we're having in price just now is constructive um I expect it to be a little bit like that um into the sorry so am I back sorry about that yeah you're back do you uh back like he never left so I'm back now yeah uh should I should I wrap that up again in terms of yeah just just wrap it up I'll cut it up yeah sure yeah so so I think my final takeaway is that um I think the sort of macrodynamic driving this rally we've had in in crypto to start the year um is is still sort of continuing looking at rates liquidity data risk flows um so I think the the consolidation we're having in price is is constructive um obviously fed next week's going to be a big event but um yeah I think uh the the macro is still pointing too further upside um and yeah we'll see that past the Fed cool thank you uh Gordon I have a million questions for you so maybe we should we should do this again I'll but um I'll leave it to you uh do you have any closing thoughts on everything we just talked about Vols whatever you want to say yeah um you know look as as a a derivatives options Market maker someone that really doesn't live too much in the Delta space and and focuses mostly on Vega and some of the higher order Greeks I I guess I would say taking a look at everything netnet ol SQL I continue to to believe that volleyball is um is is probably underestimated is probably um less appropriately priced than some of the more fair value mechanisms for um you know of all risk premium as measured by at the money straddles across the term structure and I tend to believe that the ramp up in in spa and the commensurate moving ball that we saw since the 10th of January is um is probably not done the contraction that we've seen over recent days has once again been breathtaking and um you know is proof positive that this is an asset class to be involved in if they're a great two-way trading opportunities to be had in crypto evolved and that um you know there's certainly the the potential for the rapid expansion of um you know kind of Vols and and skew and convexity across the surface and you know I do believe that 2023 will probably prove the adage once again that um you never know exactly what to expect in in crypto and I think you have to be positioned for that if you if you know if you really want to be involved in this asset class I'm very much looking forward to what the year ahead has to bring and hopefully we'll have a chance to get on some more podcasts and rap about that with you guys that was perfect that was perfect well thank you guys for uh hanging out talking with us and we'll wrap it up here
