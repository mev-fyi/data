hi I'm Dave Brickell director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation Peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about it's an expensive place to find out crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hi guys welcome to the big picture my name is Joe Crewe at Paradigm in the weeds around everything crypto ball markets joined here by my macro All-Star co-host David Brickell as well as Neil Patel and Nick treleski who run the crypto derivatives desk at drw this is going to be a really exciting conversation around something that we really haven't discussed on this channel before and that is the CME crypto derivative offering but before we We Begin please hit that like And subscribe button really helps us as we continue to build this brand and this channel to become the go-to source for insights around crypto derivatives but before we We Begin Nick and Neil if you guys can just give a quick background for our viewers how you guys ended up at drw and then ended up pivoting to pioneering this crypto derivative space sure thanks for uh having us on um I'm uh one of many drw lifers been with the firm since 2006 got my start in rates stayed on that desk for 14 years and then when covet hit CME launched CM uh the Bitcoin Futures and options and we decided to get involved into the Vault space um being that we already had the large um OTC spot desk so it was a natural fit um it was a lot of growing pains as you can imagine it was very slow to start um you have the CME oi chart and you can see as recently as Q4 of last year the open interest was only 400 million and um it really started to kind of uptick um q1 of this year as we saw a lot of people looking to onshore and we saw a lot of people prefer the safety of a regulated and compliant exchange so we saw the CME oi hit about 2 billion in q1 and early Q2 um but yeah we've been in the crypto space for about three years now and um Nick and I are running the CME and bilateral trading desk hey guys um yeah so pretty similar to Neil um I started drw straight out of college um was also on the rates desk so did uh overnight trading um covering London hours and did Market making and rates um yeah with the pandemic um after Samuel launched their product we um started the the crypto options Market making desk um you know this space has been growing a lot and been focused on that ever since all right awesome yeah thanks for that intro guys so yeah this is going to be a pretty informative conversation for our viewers around CME crypto derivatives and to be honest selfishly myself and David as well like as you know naturally on Paradigm our Focus has kind of been around like other venues so so really grateful to have you guys here and you know I think the start kind of Neil as you alluded to you know in 2023 we saw this significant surge in uh CME BTC Futures and open interest which I think logically you know makes a lot of sense in a in a post FTX world where you're naturally going to see this Capital flight to Quality to trade against exchanges that aren't necessarily Financial black boxes or you know have something else to lose with you know other product offerings of you know going down in their crypto business so looking at this chart you know volumes in December were extremely low in the immediate aftermath of FTX and of course you had the seasonality effect as well you know due to holidays but as people came back to put money to work into the new year especially due to this rally you know the volumes and open in interest immediately covered so I I guess can you like speak a little bit more to this sort of flight to Quality that you guys have seen in the crypto derivative space Not only to CME but I mean also into the bilateral business obviously drw has been been around for a long time has a stalwart balance sheet has been you know you know has a very solid reputation so how are users you know into 2023 really starting to think harder about managing their counterparty risk and kind of what is your picture on that sure so one of the main considerations to take into account with CME is it is completely agnostic of crypto a lot of the offshore changes would be um wouldn't exist if Bitcoin hit zero whereas CME wouldn't bat an eye so if you really need to hedge downside exposure puts or short Deltas um CME is the safest place to do it and it is the venue of choice during any sort of um uh crypto bear Market we saw front month um basis flip from positive 10 to negative 10 um during the FTX crisis as CME was the only safe place to actually put on short Delta plays so that was a catalyst um for a lot of people preferring the CME um it's also just a regulated compliant exchange and they also recently lowered their margin which helped kind of bring on some of the counterparties that thought the margin was a little bit too high um it's down to about 24 so it's still higher than some of the offshore venues but people are gladly willing to pay that you know extra four ten percent margin to have the safety of the CME right yeah I think that makes sense and you know other other venues we really don't see you know too much put buying and I guess that might might make sense right you know you buy a five five Delta 10 Delta put well how confident can you be that you you know are gonna get paid on that and and David I'm going to bring you into the conversation here you know you are our boots on the ground so to speak with prospective Paradigm customers and I'm curious to hear how you you're you have hurt seen your prospecting conversations evolve like I would imagine the FTX aftermath a lot of questions around CME is counterparty risk came to Greater focus and and David now that we're well into Q2 like would you say that interest has continued to be sustained yeah I think so um I mean to Neil's point I think post FTX um you know everyone was looking and thinking uh you know deeply about counterparty risk um and obviously CME is a place to to kind of trade safely the big the big drawback has been around uh around margin uh which in in many cases was prohibitive um and then also the the the tech connectivity um as well you know when people are set up on other venues um not always easy to Pivot um but yeah I I think I think definitely um you know we're still in a world where counterparty risk is is pretty key to people so looking at either other venues like CME or even you know around other other kind of ways of managing that that counterparty risk um I I definitely feel if you look at some of the sort of larger institutions and um and particularly those from Trad fire moving into the space um CME is definitely something that they're they're kind of keen on and looking at and it kind of they've got the economies of scale and scope as well that kind of that integrates quite nicely into into like current business models and they get the kind of some of the Cross margining benefits from that as well um so I mean and actually I was interested to to ask from you Neil like over this this year have you seen the the kind of makeup of of the sort of client base that sort of trading with you guys but I see me change much at all yeah so some of the crypto native funds that were originally trading offshore have um had internal um dialogue where they needed to trade on a regulated and compliant um exchange that offer you know that does some sort of kycaml um compliance so we've seen um us-based crypto funds essentially uh prefer that venue and some of them make the switch over a lot of people were unaware of the type of liquidity on CME and um the liquidity has really improved over the last six to 12 months um you know you can see one year out options two to three Vols wide for a good size so similar to what other venues are offering um and then um like I mentioned earlier the downside buyer and we're not talking about 25 Delta puts we're talking about like you know end of the world puts 10K puts 15K puts if you want to buy those the CME um is probably the only venue where you can feel comfortable buying those so we we see a big premium um usually the ball surface is about you know two to three balls higher on CME relative relative to other venues um but on the put Wing you know you could see 10 to 20 volt premium on some of those low Delta puts because it really is the only place to safely hatch downside risk yeah that's interesting especially you you have I guess this you know disparity in the vault pricing on the downside between you know because this is the venue that you go to if you need tail risk I would imagine that also presents you know an opportunity for for Underwriters as well wearing you know potentially you guys you know have a position where you can you know you guys can facilitate those and uh pretty competitively you know kind of just looking at it from a perspective like okay if we're down there I don't mind getting long down there yeah yeah for put sellers it's definitely the best place to go because of that premium um we think on on offshore venues the the put SKU doesn't kind of reflect reality because the demand isn't there to kind of put it into place so um we don't see we don't see that the demand is is going to change it's going to be on CME and that premium you know I would say on average it's probably about five to ten balls for that five Delta put area it's gonna kind of stay in that range wow interesting and um oh yeah no it's fine alternatively on the top side um so for calls you do see most of the supply enter the market on offshore venues because of the margin reasons that you talked about before so when um call overwriters need to sell calls they generally go to Offshore venues because they can actually margin and native currency and um that's just something that the CME uh doesn't like offer as a as a benefit because you have to margin in dollars and it's expensive for firms that have you know quantities of ether BTC to borrow dollars to sell calls on top of that so um we expect that to kind of change over the next uh coming years because um recently there was a uh there was a cftc declaration that um CBOE digital was granted margin on BTC and eth Futures uh so margin in terms of posting underlying coin with a custodian to sell BC any Futures So eventually hopefully that flows into options and we can see some of the call overriding Flow right the same music right and in terms of you know the main audience for that my my impression would be it would be perhaps you know the onshore miners who you know look at sort of yield enhancement strategies but can we talk a little bit more about I guess minors in general and I guess this existing community of CME derivative users not not just the ones that have kind of you know capitulated a little bit and moved some risk off of other exchange not to see me but like have you guys been seeing you know miners real for example realizing they need to get their act together and you know actually you know sell forwards the hedger exposure if they want to reduce the capital the cost of capital of their businesses or I would also expect maybe some traditional macro hedge funds coming to the CME either for the lever Delta exposure or some of the basis plays that you guys are talking about but curious to hear about that existing customer base yeah um so for miners um we haven't seen too many miners arrive on the CME um and you know that it does make sense especially in these kind of conditions when uh hashray continues to increase um so it really push pushes the pressure on margins as the price is kind of low um so that's something that like we have been continuing to expect but haven't seen a lot of especially in the options space um in the future space as possible um especially if they just go through you know a broker to hedge Futures against their um production um but then we saw much more of the ladder where it's like macro hedge funds or hedge funds in general maybe some of them are dipping their toes into being crypto hedge funds um have been arriving on the CME and uh you know putting on either highly lovered beta plays or just like trying to trade macro risk around um around BTC and eth and at the same time we've also seen some of the um of all premium selling as well um there have been like new um participants have been selling fall premium and BTC and Ethos on the CME similar to like how other asset classes has done in other asset classes where they just come in and sell strangles so I've seen the kind of a bit of both and to add to that for minors and Underwriters margining it all comes down to margining and if they can't margin in coins most of them are dollar light so CME might not make sense for them so that's why we see the ball surface significantly lower on exchanges where you can margin in coin or on bilateral where you can margin in coin versus the CME because most of the natural wall sellers need to be able to post coins instead of dollars got it so you so you would say that most of the onshore miners are you know trading in the in bilaterally uh because of this yeah they definitely have a preference towards bilateral versus um CME right that makes sense so you know elephant in the room news flow last couple days which we don't really need to dive into here but like in light of kind of the recent developments that we've seen with other onshore exchanges like like what do you guys see do you guys foresee institutions kind of taking you know another step back to evaluate their options and when do we see this you know it's the million dollar question you know this next wave of traditional institutional adoption well the beauty of the CME is they don't touch any coins um The Ref you know they have the reference rate the Futures are financially settled the options settle into the Futures so the CME doesn't touch any coins so they are a little bit safer than other venues um in terms of the SEC versus coinbase lawsuit yesterday um very unfortunate for the industry you know coinbase has been arguably the most compliant um Exchange in crypto by far and um to see them Target that exchange is unfortunate and bad for the space it's just bad for onboarding new users and we continue to see a lot of just crypto native firms decide to essentially be based offshore but we don't think it will have a significant effect um on the CME in the short term I think um it's interesting to say I don't know and and so Joe going back to earlier the question around you know conversations with clients I think one one of the things that's really struck me since uh particularly since FTX um and in terms of institutional adoption is I kind of think people understand that like what happened around FTX was a failure of a third party uh you know um and a bad actor within the space I think people kind of get the value proposition for for Bitcoin and and sort of crypto generally and it's all now about um it is about counterparty risk and understanding um I understand exactly the nature of those risks and where they are so I I think what's when people keep talking to me about or and conversations we have around you know what's gonna be the effect of you know SEC coinbase um I don't think it's this oh that's that's the end of crypto then I I think again it just drives the right okay what's the solution and that's some one of the things that's actually um you know brought me a lot of sort of optimism around this space in that the actual push has been okay well where where do we trade or what are the solutions to this and and obviously CME would be one of those um but I I think people people kind of get it now people kind of get the value proposition um we just need to put the right info structure um and and the right I guess regulatory um Frameworks within which to trade and be comfortable with Trading yeah and I think it's that's coming over the years um as more firms develop uh custody Solutions and more um you know well-known firms like uh Fidelity build out their custodian Solutions partner up with exchanges um hook up you know margin um you know as this infrastructure and tradify gets built it'll enable more trusted venues to kind of you know move value and allow hedging allow trading in general so I think that's something that we're looking forward to um and looking to support um and you know hoping that the industry you know prevails until that until then so right that makes sense definitely feels like you know especially with the the range bound price action that we've seen I mean at least we've had some ball the past couple days but uh you know it could be a little bit more of a slow burn until we kind of see you know this break out of the range and hopefully to the upside and you know David I know you have some have some thoughts on this you know given macro developments of the past couple days or so so uh do you want to get into it yeah yeah I mean happy um happy to talk about that um I mean yeah it's funny because I've been quite bearish sort of crypto and risk I guess broadly um over the last few weeks anticipating this liquidity drain with the with the debt ceiling lift um but we've been talking about that for a while now on on this show um and it feels now like the world and his dog's talking about this liquidity drain oh sorry did I cut out there you hear me am I back yeah uh yeah you're back now yeah let's start over yeah so so I've been talking for a while about this liquidity drain and um that that we expect once the debt ceiling gets lifted um and that was making me pretty sort of bearish I guess for for crypto in the short term uh given we know particularly Bitcoins a liquidity junkie um it feels now that it's quite a common narrative um out there I'm surprised you know Uber drivers haven't been talking about this liquidity drain uh because everyone's kind of talking about it um but the the the irony is is you know as we kind of there's two aspects to that I guess um in terms of there's I think there's a mechanical aspect I do think liquidity and how it sort of funnels its way through the financial system um that you know mechanically can sort of drag us lower if we suck that out but also there's quite a reflexive aspect as well and I think particularly as it pertains to to crypto and I'm kind of thinking now like if if that is such a common story um maybe the impact of that reflexivity is kind of diminished and I I certainly feel that's why Bitcoin hasn't joined in the the tech party um that we've seen over the last few weeks um because if you're looking at NASDAQ you kind of thinking Bitcoin should be ramping up and yet we haven't joined in that and I think it's in anticipation of this liquidity drain so there's part of me that's thinking that maybe we see a sort of buyer rumor sell the fact type uh Redux in terms of how that's going to pan out um this we got up here you know net dollar liquidity I think this is the one to to watch um as you can see actually um the liquidity has actually been climbing over over the last sort of month or so um and that's been a function of the quantitative tightening being offset by the TGA drawdown now obviously the the big worry now is that yep hey David can I just stop you for a second uh yeah it seems like somebody yeah Neil I think it's your slack okay yeah I I saw your message you know yeah let's just go yeah it's just going yeah it's right now so Mario sorry sorry okay that oh good I'll get it all good yeah go on David sorry well yeah we'll just cut it out it's easy yeah so so the looking at that chart and um and liquidity so liquidity dollar liquidity's actually been improving over the last um last sort of few weeks as a TGA drawdown um has been offsetting the the quantitative tightening now the worry is is that green that green line in the bottom Channel absolutely collapses um as they rebuild the TGA but there are there are potential offsets to that um so I mean we've already had like 170 billion issued this week um in bills that's kind of been digested okay um and the potential the more the more that that issuance is is uh via bills the more digestible that is and potentially is offset by the uh reverse repo that's parked at the Fed so it's it's going to be key for me to keep an eye on that chart there um to see does that green line does does the Dollar liquidity absolutely collapse in which case that's going to weigh quite heavily on on bitcoin um but there there are say there are offsets and from a global liquidity perspective um you know there's offsets and one of those that I'm looking at um is China um yeah China seems to be struggling now with a a Slowdown obviously the currency is under a lot of pressure right now um and interestingly they're not they're not intervening to slow that currency uh depreciate Nation so it kind of tells me that China is quite worried about the Slowdown we had trade data today which was pretty awful uh decline in exports declining Imports um so sort of China feels like they they want the currency weaker to export their way out and likely a prime in the liquidity pump uh pboc putting some pressure on on banks to to cut uh lending rates so so we we might well have for all this fear about liquidity drain pretty big offsets be it from the US itself if if it's all Bill issuance and and the RRP actually uh funds some of this and then also the potential for um China to come in and then and then the other chart I was looking at earlier um and we were discussing um is the move index um so when I think as well about things that are going to drive liquidity um which is quite a broad um a broad thing to try and measure um the the move index so this is the index of bond volatility now this is pretty important in terms of um you know more volatile sort of bonds and treasuries are um the more difficult is to take leverage and what have you say so Bond volatility coming lower is actually pretty good for actually greasing the the sort of wheels of the system and allowing leverage and which also allow liquidity so so I'm looking at this and uh this for me sort of looks pretty good for risk actually so if you see the move index coming lower it tends to go pretty well for for risk the vix as we've seen is is what on a 13 handle or something now so so for all this it's insane um I mean partly it feels like there's a lot just this kind of General apathy in market so even though nasdaq's been sort of pumping away okay um but look the sort of broad risk environment into this liquidity drain looks pretty good um now again just mechanically does it start to weigh over the coming weeks I'm just wondering if given how anticipated it is um it becomes a bit of a damp squib and given these offsets that actually we could be setting ourselves up now for a ramp to the upside and then in in light of the the uh the issues we've seen this week with the sack and around coinbase and binance you know you kind of really feel that we should have sold off more heavily and we haven't and we've been sort of in this range for for Bitcoin and eth for for some time now and the flush out that we saw particularly on the binance news was you know from what we're used to historically was pretty weak I thought um and I I think that's partly reflective of uh the lack of leveraging the system I don't think anyone's kind of known as leveraged long I think position in Germany is pretty light um I think as well given given some of the issues with offshore exchanges exchanges it's um it's a lot more difficult to short these markets now so when I think of past liquidation periods it's come because there's a been a lot of Leverage in the system that's been absolutely flushed out and B uh you know you know you've had false liquidations with bankruptcies and what have you and people that just have to sell their Bitcoin um as as they're kind of coming out of business so in the absence of that it's not obvious to me what actually sort of drives us you know materially lower um and I actually think it looks quite constructive yeah I think that I think that makes sense yeah I mean like even I'm just I'm just looking at this the top part of this chart and it's like damn looks like a pretty nasty Head and Shoulders pattern and you know one metric that I kind of follow closely is you know the 200 week moving average which is around like 26 100 and I think we've tested it you know you kind of see this range here um you know here where we kind of tested that you know three or four separate times where it was just like damn if we kind of break below you know the neckline was kind of right at this 200 week moving average and if we broke lower well we could fill the Gap all the way back down to 22-21 but the fact that I mean even yesterday you know we I mean we're down to 25 700 or so and then we just kind of really bounce through it again it kind of seems like we're in a place in this market where like I mean how much bad news have has crypto had you know over the past few months yet look at the price right and it seems like every new piece of news flow that is negative for the space that comes in is just having a more muted reaction so for me like that's a pretty strong bullish symbol uh signal there but like Nick Neil curious to kind of hear what you guys think around the more like medium termed you know short to medium term trajectory are we going to stay range bound or is there a possibility as well yeah so I mean just as you go to answer that as well and perhaps the time with that what I'd be interested in is is because over the last couple of days we've not seen a material rush to put on downside um you know in in a lot of those news now it could be the factors we mentioned earlier in terms of um you know the the reasons why people might not do that on offshore exchanges so just interested as well whether you know you actually saw a a significant up in in downside interest over the last couple of days sure yeah I'll try to address that um yeah so I think well to start you you're mentioning that like we you know given how much NASDAQ is up and how um how rates are doing you know we kind of expected uh if you saw someone did like a model where you know they just use it uh like NASDAQ gold and rates to kind of predict where Bitcoin should be as like a like a four-factor model um so like that would have indicated that Bitcoin should have been higher but you know right now it's you know kind of firmly below 30k um you know not gonna really say any opinions on that but um you know that's definitely part of the reason part of the reason that that has to do with that is obviously all the regulatory overhead that has been coming out this year um that combined with like Supply from you know everyone keeps talking about the gox supply or the um announced U.S Marshal Service Supply as well um so people are being cautious there is not a lot of Leverage that we see um in the system like there's you know Vol is very low there's a lot of call overriding going on um it's just like a natural uh tendency of risk markets I mean NASDAQ Vol was around like 33 at the beginning of the year um NASDAQ is now up 30 and the implied ball there is like 18 right now um you know similar uh topic with Bitcoin and Eve they're both up like 50 60 of the year um and their implied balls like at all-time lows um lower than it was at any point during the bull market um you know that's just uh kind of the nature of risk markets and you know naturally Bitcoin and ether still uh risk assets so when when the assets go up that much you know that leads to a lot of people who are along to sell calls to override it and then the natural risk is to the downside um so uh we have seen some people take stabs of this implied Vol um uh you know here and there but it's still pretty muted because I think people have been kind of demoralized by how tight this range has been so no one is willing to really stick their neck out there but you know small tactical plays here and there potentially but yeah nothing nothing too inspiring yeah that makes sense I mean even what we're what we're seeing is like I mean we're not really seeing those big uh you know BTC upside call buying that that we were seeing earlier in the year but rather kind of like smaller sort of tactical plays where we see this like crazy spot down ball down like I mean even two days ago right when BTC was down like five or six percent right with the August you know fixed strikes were like lower right it's it's like pretty it's just pretty crazy right so we're kind of what we've been seeing is kind of like you know the smaller sort of tactical plays where it's just like damn ball is so low that's just gonna you know Delta play to top of the range you know back to like 28 29 but like nothing sexy or exciting you know beyond that how about you Neil yeah to talk about the price action a bit I think what was the Catalyst for BTC from 20K to up to 31k was the regional banking crisis um we saw big rallies right after you know Silicon Valley Bank and silvergate and there was a bit of diminishing returns and it was basically the first time ever that Bitcoin had an inverse relationship with the regional Bank ETF kre um that has flipped back to positive so in the end Bitcoin is a risk asset and it is going to correlate with the broader Market um so I think that Regional banking story is basically over and you're not seeing banking crisis lead to um Bitcoin rallies anymore in terms of the ball reaction I think the underwriter supply has just overwhelmed market makers so there's very little room for appreciation they're kind of selling um options at Mid or on the first uptick just to kind of lighten their Theta Bill and um doesn't have room to breathe it doesn't have room to grow the underwriter flow is just the largest flow in the space so that's been a reason for not having any sort of ball reaction on this move but surprising toss nonetheless I think as well um like when I think of the macro not harming this point too much but um we are in this change in macro regime um where we're going from the this sharp fed tightening cycle to now the pause and the eventually the cuts but but we've gone from a pause to now skip um and we're just unable to really Embrace a new macro regime quite fully uh we I think the Market's comfortable with that we're no longer in this this aggressive hike cycle and it's coming to an end but we've just got no Clarity over when that end hits I think if we if I look back we came into the new year with the market starting to price the end of the hike cycle um you know started to price some aggressive cuts into the curve as well um and and then the data's kind of stayed resilient the FED of kind of okay yeah we're going to pause now we're going to skip so no one's been able to embrace a new regime and I just think we're in this kind of No Man's Land um as we say transition from one regime to the to the next so my my my assumption is that we are gonna start to see the data start to to sort of Fall Away inflation starts to fall away so that the feds sort of fully go pause and then the markets can then start to play that and know the regime we're in right now we're just in this uncertain you know are we going to see more hikes are we not and and the market doesn't really know what to do with it and every conversation I have with clients at the moment they're just really lacking conviction in in and across asset as well not not just within crypto some of the macro guys you know not sure you know where this kind of goes or or they they kind of feel okay we we're moving towards this pause we're more bullish say the top side and Bitcoin it's just about timing that um when when's go time for the next leg higher and now it kind of becomes all right it's Q3 or it's Q4 and it just keeps getting pushed out and meantime if you're trying to put on these longs to play that then you're just kind of bleeding theater and and it becomes a painful trade to sit in yeah I mean yeah it's been really tough to nail this uh macro regime um you know it's kind of it got kind of taught everything got kind of tossed to the side with uh the baking crisis and even right now I mean the markets are still pricing in potentially like one more rate hike and uh in the summer um you know inflation has been persistent it's hot it's been sticky in certain places and in other places like Commodities it's like showing that it's actually coming down um so it's very um difficult you know for people I mean even the employment numbers have been coming out like the economists have not been able to nail like you know a downturn unemployment um every every single employment uh announcement has been like a complete um you know whiff on their end so it's I think it's just been a really tricky environment um as this economy comes out of this like post-stimulus World um and uh yeah it's hard for people to you know put on like a crazy risk play one way or the other because you know if if another um emergency like with another emergence of inflation like we're gonna have to keep hiking um we might have to pause and wait for a while or we might have to like start emergency Cuts like it's no one knows what's going to happen so it's just like it's uh the pricing is I just kind of flatlined yeah for sure I think as well for me that's that's the biggest risk to this Market is that ironically if the data keeps coming in or if the data comes in pretty strong and remains resilient and inflation higher if we start pricing in a higher terminal Fed rate um I don't know towards seven percent or so then I just think that's that's the thing that would would really hit risk and probably Bitcoin and take us lower I don't see that's not my that's not my base case but I think for me that that's the sort of biggest risk out there at the moment that's kind of like materially take a slower and a normal friend all the good work we've done throughout so far in 2023 the banking crisis at all a terminal rate of Southern so I think the FED is definitely incentivized to pause for the next meeting I think it's about a 30 chance of a hike at the next meeting but they do not want to um further worsen bank's balance sheets which will rate I could do so yeah and we're still seeing um some pretty lumpy deposit outflows on an unadjusted basis I don't actually know how you adjust deposit outflows um surely outflows or outflows but the the adjusted outflows look okay but actually on an unadjusted basis we're still seeing constant deposit outflows and that'll be particularly interesting given this treasury issuance where we see Bank Reserves um fall quite heavily over the next few weeks and then all of a sudden we could be back into a um you know more banking issues because I I don't think they've gone away because the factors that that drove the deposit outflows and this deposit walk you know is the fact that fed rates are simply too high for for these markets to handle and for banks to handle so the money's going to keep leaving in search of higher yields Banks can't materially sort of jack up their their deposit rates um you know otherwise they'll lose profitability so I still think we've got those risks bubbling in the background and it does feel a little bit like this Calm before the storm and you know everything in my my sort of 20 years of experience trading you know we we do feel like a coiled spring at the moment in terms of volatility and um you know it's often surprising what sparks it but there's certainly we can see things out there that could spark some volatility over the next few weeks all right awesome well we're we are at the 37 minute Mark so I think uh I think we leave it at that that was a super insightful conversation you know especially around like the CME stuff that you know David and I are not necessarily you know touching every day and I I think for our viewers as well kind of getting a sense of you know what traditional institutions are doing and what what how the flows there kind of compare to other venues is is really just awesome Insight so and as well as your macro takes you know giving you guys I think you guys are former rates guys right yeah right so yeah right so I mean yeah thanks thanks for all the all the insights here really really enjoyed the conversation and uh we'll speak soon thank you [Music]
