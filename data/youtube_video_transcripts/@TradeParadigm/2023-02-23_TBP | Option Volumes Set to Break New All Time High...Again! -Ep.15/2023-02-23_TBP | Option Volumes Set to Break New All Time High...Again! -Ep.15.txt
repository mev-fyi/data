and it's also very clear that the market is able to rebound from literally the most historic like exchange related disruptions and the rebounded really rather quickly you know so I mean I find this extremely shocking that you know knock on wood we're on Pace to hit all-time high again in option block fines hi I'm Dave Brickell director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture so the obvious trade is always the expensive one to the whole Peak inflation a peak rights narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about was an expensive place to find out a crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hey everyone welcome to the big picture my name is Joe Crue I'm at Paradigm in the weeds around everything crypto ball I'm here I'm joined here by Sohan on our sales team in Asia who joined us last week when we spoke to Carolina at orbit as well as David who's back from his brief Hiatus after being in Europe Barcelona right David Barcelona yeah the European blockchain conference how was that yeah it was good man it was um yeah there was a good vibe there it was a good Buzz um if if I compare it to some of the events I went to back in December um it certainly felt like crypto was back um in quite a big way um so no yeah it was cool there's a really good breadth of um sort of attendees there um it was kind of a good reminder that there's a lot of money flying into this space still um apparently as well um there was double double the attendees from the previous year so man bull market might be back after all but um it was good um it was good connecting with a lot of people there uh quite a few allocators there so yeah there's still money coming into this place and like the appetite for blockchain seemed huge uh so yeah it was cool well look I mean if you're if if you're a VC or an investor in this space and you're you're looking to get in when you know the valuations are not not great a crazy 2021 sort of levels I mean this is this is kind of this is kind of the time if you're if you're an investor looking looking to get some exposure to the space so I'm sure there's a lot of guys there as well I mean because I mean as you said there's still a lot of really interesting things going on in the space and I mean luckily you know the coins have have really rallied to just to start the year so some of that fervor it kind of feels at least in the options Market that fervor is start is starting to really come back yeah yeah nice great um and that I kind of feel like it's reinforced the idea that I had uh post FTX that kind of anyone that was moving into the space kind of knew knew the risks and um you know they they've been building for a while and starting to you know put in place the infrastructure uh to come into it um so yeah it was kind of reassuring just to to sort of meet with like some traditional sort of funds and stuff as well that were there and yeah like like some some like Trad fire asset managers um who are still sort of big in Trad fire but you know building out crypto desks and things like that um yeah it's quite interesting to speak to them and not not pull off by what's going on but again the focus was very much you know how are we dealing with counterparting credit risk one of the solutions that to that what are the custody solutions to that um any other kind of prime broker Solutions and credit intermediation so it's very much kind of solution focused not our crypto's dead it was a big Ponzi we knew it and let's forget about it um so yeah yeah it was quite a good vibe you can you probably tell them for the cold and like burnt the candle at both ends as well so a little bit too sangria and uh in February right the weather was nice as well so that was cool all right good well we'll be back with with guests uh next week but we thought we'd use this time to go over some of the more interesting crypto option block data that we've been looking at we've here at Paradigm we've really been starting to focus on like building out this sort of proprietary sort of data offering what is data that at Paradigm we can present to the market that you can you cannot find anywhere else so like what we'll do today was we'll start a little bit more General and then we'll get more granular right specifically we'll talk about you know the growth of the crypto option block volume into 2023 potentially what is explaining that growth what time what times are the days is in days of the weeks is block markets most busy you know what is the breakdown a multi-lay trades versus single leg volume so like consider what we're going to talk about today kind of like a teaser to to a quarterly report that is going to start coming um being published by Paradigm that doesn't include some of the data that we're going to talk about today but in that report we're also going to be including stats around like liquidity you know block liquidity or Greeks exposure by maturities and Strikes and as the viewers and in our audience we would love to hear in the comments uh either on Twitter or you or YouTube wherever you're watching this in terms of what are things that you would like to see that would be very valuable so we'll we'll jump right into it let me share my screen well okay so this chart right here so so block trading of crypto options in 2022 as you can tell from the chart it continued to to Really Thrive You know despite that the spot Market turmoil and for the for those that are you know potentially new to the podcast what is an option block trade right an option block trade it refers to a significant transaction of options contracts that are traded outside of public order books on a privately negotiated basis but still settles on the exchange I.E darabin so a block trade on derabit must meet the minimum size requirement of 25 contracts so Bitcoin or 250 contracts of ethereum in a single strategy and then of course use the pre-existing contracts that exist from The Exchange so from the chart you can tell so Paradigm option block volumes experience tremendous growth in 2022 right so if you if we look at that chart so January 2022 we were at 150 000 Bitcoin notional right and then fast forward about a year later and we're basically triple that size right and so that last chart right there so for February volumes I mean we're not we're not fully through February yet we're about three quarters uh through at the time of recording and we forecasted it through the rest of the month and February is looking like it's going to be another all-time high right and overlaid on this chart as well is the one month realized fall that as you can tell I mean in February I mean it's been decent but it's still been quite low right and the month-to-date spot returns are pretty marginal as well right so this is it's super promising right so volumes are increasing in option block contracts even when the market is involved isn't too volatile the spot peaked a trough I think in Bitcoin over the month of February is only like 14 right compared to January we had this massive 40 rally you could you could have made this argument like look yeah we had this massive rally you know people putting money to work at the beginning of the year of course you're going to get outsized volumes but when you look at the chart right January doesn't really look as much of an anomaly anymore right we have realize fall in February that's fairly low right the Market's not nearly as exciting as it was right this peak to trough spot range is not that high so and the volumes are continuing to increase which kind of tells us I mean of course we're biased that this Market is here to stay and it's also very clear that the market is able to rebound from literally the most historic like exchange related disruptions and the rebounded really rather quickly you know so I mean I find this extremely shocking that you know knock on wood we're on Pace to hit all-time high again in option block volumes what do you guys think yeah I mean I I think I think one of the you know one of the ways you need to think about blocks is it's the more institutional size right I mean it's the non-retail players so if if volume if um if realized ball is low uh there's no you know dramatic need for people to you know go in and you know hedge their risk and buy options or sell options so this is what this tells me is there's real demand for people to come in and express a view via options and it's a directional View right so and it's institutional players that are coming in to to do that which is obviously very promising for you know for for us right yeah I mean I think that being said when it when I first pulled this chart I would have thought okay the the highest volume months are going to be the ones on average that have the most that you know have the highest sort of realized ball no when the Market's moving around a lot and you actually look at the correlation um of the trailing one month realize all versus our volumes and there's really no correlation at all which is a good thing because that's that's saying that the volumes are not dependent so much of what's happening in the spot Market it's rather the market is just continuing to grow because more institutional players are actually entering and more people are kind of realizing that crypto options are actually a thing and you can actually get access to these things and the markets are tight yeah I mean so what what you're basically saying is that as a percentage of the spot Market I guess we are continuing to grow right right um which is uh which yeah that's that's great news right I mean that that's I mean let's not let's lock it over our skis here right I mean like a big a big day on derivat 24-hour option volumes between like Bitcoin and ethereum is like one and a half billion dollars right like that's if you can if you compare that to you know just I come from the equity options background right we would be like a champion we'd be doing three times that size in a single trade of s p auctions right the daily option volumes of Bitcoin and ethereum combined are kind of like a mid-tier sort of you know NASDAQ stock but you know that being said it is continuing to grow and you know hopefully we start to see uh you know as FTX kind of moves more into the background when we start to figure out some of these custody Solutions uh over time that David was mentioning that we actually start to see a bit more you know exponential growth rather than you know kind of I mean you kind of look in the chart right it kind of looks like a uh you know a logarithmic sort of rope right instead of like an exponential sort of growth but you know that being said it still is a success in itself that this that the volumes have continued to grow You know despite the fact you know FTX was only two months ago yeah I I think um there's a couple things that are interesting for me actually when I look at that chart if you took out December like you could pretty much draw a steady like uptrend in terms of the growth um and I kind of think I think that speaks to a how say the the institutions are still coming into the space which we're obviously very exposed to here um and also as as the pi itself kind of grows um I mean to your point not not only is crypto as an asset class still very very small um compared to the traditional world but then within that asset class options is still very very small as well so I think I think um options is something like two percent of the open interest of the crypto ribs whereas in the Trad fire world that's like 20 so when you kind of think of us as a business um you know and and the growth opportunity here you've got the growth opportunity in terms of crypto he's going to get more you know established and will grow as an asset class in itself and then the role that options plays within that is going to become much bigger as as it's used for as a use for speculation used for hedging you know they're going to play a vital role in there and I think we're kind of seeing that this year already right um in what's coming through so I I think it's an exciting time and and actually going back to Barcelona I think a lot of conversations we had around that um I mean everything in crypto is on like hyper mode right we kind of we kind of reliving like the the evolution of Trad fire that went on over decades we're kind of doing it on like Hyper Speed including making all the same ups and mistakes and what have you that uh that crypto made right um that that Trad fire made and um yeah so so I'd kind of I kind of don't think it's any different and like it's it's still so early um and this is there when you're in the space I I think it probably ages you quite a bit and it's like dog years um in terms of working in crypto but it is still so early um and yeah there's you know there's big Trad fire guys that are just kind of sniffing around the space I mean The Regulators still don't know what they're doing uh around it so yeah I I kind of it always takes me back to um I think it's a Bill Gates uh quote that uh you know most people um uh what's the saying but most people um you know achieve less and they think they're going to in a year but but tend to underachieve on a 10-year time frame um and I I think that's crypto like even though he's the most optimistic in the space we kind of all get a little bit carried away in terms of where we think things will be in a year but I think we probably I underestimate where we'll be in 10. so it's kind of like everything needs a little bit of patience but it's it's kind of stepping back and remembering we're super super early in this game and there's so much growth to come so much money to come into the space and and you're starting to see that reflecting in some of the in some of the charts and some of the flows certainly I think that we're seeing yeah yeah absolutely and I mean I would say block option volumes tends to be like a fairly decent proxy in terms of institutional participation because as we mentioned right in order to be able to do a block trade you need to have sufficient Capital to do so right you need to be able to meet the contract sizes of 25 Bitcoin or 250 ethereum and right so if I just go to this next chart here and um yeah ignore ignore the title here this shouldn't that shouldn't say multi-leg versus single leg option block photos this is this is rather just the market share over time of blocks of option block volumes relative to the total uh option volumes that are trading on derabit right so if we look back in 2019 of August for BTC you know that number um so that would be that orange line block percentage of total notional only 20 of the trades that we're going through were block trades right fast forward January 2023 now 40 or February 2023 40 of all the trades that are going through now are blocked and ethereum it's showing a very similar picture of this long-term growth where in Q3 2019 we were at 15 and then q and then by Q4 2022 we are at 30 right so even like we all agree that more institutions as you know the custody issues and regulation hopefully gets sorted out that more institutions are going to enter but you know that being said you know the institutions already have been entering I mean as I said this is kind of uh this is kind of a proxy for the amount of institutional involvement in this space and it's kind of double it's proportion of the pie has doubled uh in in a couple years right so like I my opinion is like okay so you have this growing institutional participation that we talked about but you know at the same time we've also have a lot a lot more improved liquidity and in our quarterly report I would love to be able to report on some of these stats right we've had this entry of more and more market makers that are enhancing the capacity for in institutional takers to come in and trade these big block sizes at tighter bid offer spreads right and then also I I would I would also say that derabit has done us a solid as well because I mean even when I got here like the fees that you were paying in order to do a block trade were like were insane right like if you're you're telling me that if I want to do a call fly structure that is effectively four legs right one by two by one you're telling me that like I need to pay you know three basis points of fees on every one of those legs well I mean so many my point is so many of these trades were just so non-economic due to the fee structure and now we you have lower fees so dare a bit reduced the fees for multi-leg option strategies that combines legs that are trading in the opposite directions so like if I'm trading a call spread for example I would get fee netting between the long and the short leg but if I were to trade like a straddle or a strangle I would not I would not get that discount but you know that that being said it's it's come a lot of way it will come a lot of ways right like you have the growing institutional participation better liquidity you know spots moving around lower fees you know there's a lot of things that are that are leading to this but it's it's been a great story so far that's awesome yeah I mean I think I think one one important point to note here is that the blue line is the block percentage of the total premium right so it's very easy to say like blocks as a percentage of total notional because but that notionals may be relevant right I mean it might be a super one Delta option or like if like a 50 Delta option which is real right and you can see this is this is 60 of BTC blocks um you know in by total premium so that means it's real real options that people are buying It's Not Just Wings you know lottery tickets that are people buying again pointing to the fact that it's real you know real players who are coming in and you know trading this so yeah right explain what's what's sohan's saying so when you calculate like notional of an option trade effectively you're just taking the number of contracts times the current you know Bitcoin or ethereum reference price it doesn't account for you know the money-ness of the option or the amount of Premium that's being paid you know if I trade trade when you just look at no total notion all a ethereum 5000 strike call is going to have the same notional as a ethereum 1700 call so that's why we included this blue line as well be like okay look this isn't just like a bunch of winning option volumes are going through this is actually real risk that is going through all right yeah that's huge let's move on yeah well I mean I guess I can I can you know briefly mention that briefly mentioned this I mean if you say if you do if you look at this isn't kind of just like another proxy for institutional involvement uh versus retail I would say it's fair to say that retail is going to be much more likely to trade single-legged options you know rather than multi-like right retail is just generally scared going short options right even even if you're just like trading a call spread right people like oh like uh you know people just get dipped a bit nervous right as opposed to institutions that you know are doing multi-like strategies all the time right and you can basically look so the Green in that this left chart has just continued to shrink while the blue has continued to increase so that blue is the multi-leg proportion and then that green is that single leg proportion so you can kind of really tell that towards like the end of Q4 2021 this is what kind of really when the institutions really started to enter and you can you can see that in the right chart as well this is basically just the multi-leg option blocks as a percentage of national which was 30 in December 20 21 and it just completely skyrocketed now we're at this seti steady state or so where about you know two-thirds to to three quarters of the volume that is traded is coming in the form of multi-leg block options yeah and the fee reduction obviously has a lot to do with this as well yes because you know like the moment um you know the The Exchange changes it to make it easier to do multi-legs doesn't don't get charged on the second leg almost everyone is like well that would make sense to do a cool spread right before it was like well I don't want to pay twice the fees so I'll just do one and worse comes to us I'll do this I'll do the next leg right right I mean I think the like the next big step for this Market is the tied up Delta hedge Trading right I mean like so you can you came from FX right like trading Delta hedge I would imagine was pretty commonplace right yeah I mean so the market Standard in almost all markets is you know if you're a bull Trader you make a volt price so you you'd have a Delta hedge you don't care about the Delta and then that's it um but uh for some reason and uh crypto has started off as a as a width you know like with Delta risk um and it will it will change it will change over time because you know and I I noticed many times two of our dealers are dealing together and both of them are clearing their Delta at the same time right in in the open market they enjoyed live they face each other and then they clear the Delta themselves um it's yeah as you said it's just a sign of a market which is gradually getting more mature like you know Paradigm didn't have the ability to do Delta hedged uh you know like options you know until until about a uh a year ago um so it's just gradually the market will get better at this I feel yeah I mean a lot of it too though is like so when when you trade on garabite you can't cross versus spot right you need a cross versus the purple for the future and I mean nothing nothing gets everybody we love them but like the liquidity of the perp in the future on derabet versus the liquidity of the perp or the future on finance is just completely night and day right if I if I get delivered this Delta in the form of a Dera bit purple future well I need to be able to manage this thing and the reality is there's a lot of cases where if I were to trade like Oco a in option structure live not versus delta and that same option structure versus delta I would get a tighter price on the live versus versus the you know the Delta exchange right that coming from you know like that that is just complete craziness to me right I bet this is that this is a thing um and who knows me maybe as more liquidity comes onto there a bit of the perps or we kind of figure out this whole like cross more this whole cross margin thing right like imagine if you could trade an arabid option versus a binance perk right if you can do that and you deliver them Delta that you can actually trade or you know deliver the or like a binance you know Bitcoin spot then I think the market gets a lot tighter yeah I mean it's actually it's actually one of the main reasons why I I feel there is um you know that that there is room for another exchange player to come in as an options exchange right like so like we have you know for example buy bit right um that they offer they are able to they have a they have a more liquid Futures uh you know Futures Market absolutely right if you had something where you know even if you don't have to do like right now people are doing cross-section I completely agree with that right like somebody trades on terabit then they look at their bit future uh it's too expensive I'll head somewhere else right right and then his counterpart is also doing the same thing right uh if there's one exchange where you can do everything um that that would materially you know save uh save the liquidity um you know of off the market um actually I think I think that that might be the you know the the thing that we we are yet to see right which is you start merging the Delta Market a liquid Delta market with the options Market that could that could really cause this to really roof right what what you need what you need is like a liquidity Network that's settlement agnostic that you could do all of that in one place oh here we are paradigm you're an Institutional Investor who's like or you know fund manager that's running a ball strategy in equity or FX right who's used to doing everything Delta hedge and then you kind of realize that you you're coming into here and you're introducing a lot of the slip at risk and you know the cross margin implications of managing your Delphos and your your option risk on different exchanges well that's that's kind of something you know that would cause that fund manager to be like maybe this Market isn't ready yet maybe we'll revisit when we can actually when I can actually somewhat efficiently trade my ball strategy right for me that's kind of like the next step of where where this goes but like I mean as at Paradigm we were kind of the London responsible for figuring out this problem so we'll get there we will get there we will get there yeah and then I'll just finish on this so this is this is a cool chart right so this is when our block option volumes the highest right so the below chart shows crypto block volumes by the hour of the day in the day of the week okay so the hours of the day are divided into these eight blocks uh in use in UTC time you know zero to three UTC three to six six to nine and so on and so forth and then each colored bar represents a different day of the week right so on so Monday is yellow you know Friday is orange and there's there's some pretty cool things to like interpret from this and this is something that we're going to include in our uh and include our report in our quarterly report like imagine if you're you're a market maker and you're like hmm I want a market make on Paradigm what and because of the nature of crypto I need to have a global business and maybe I'm located you know in you know Asia or in Europe when are the times of days that I need to be focusing the most in order to actually get the most volume and this data is actually pretty enlightening right so the option block volume it tends to follow this General trend of increasing throughout the UTC day but it Peaks around 12 to 15 UTC I believe that's that's 8 A.M New York time to 11 A.M New York time right so that that's when the that's when the volumes of crypto option blocks are peaking and then it gradually and then you get some activity as well in the afternoon of the US but then it gradually decreases into the end of the U.S the USA and then the highest activity buckets are actually Tuesdays and Wednesdays during this 12 to 15 UTC bucket and I found I found it pretty interesting if you were to ask me before pulling this data when are the option volumes what to stay of the week are option volumes the largest I would be like oh I would I would imagine if probably you know Thursday into Friday because that's when the option expiries are and I mean we're kind of splitting hairs here right because Wednesday Thursday Friday volumes are kind of all similar but I I found it surprising that Wednesdays are actually the busiest days in turn in terms of option volumes is is that is there is Wednesday a big data day David okay I guess uh it's when when the FED always is and fed minutes oh you're right but but then again that's not consistent right throughout um you know throughout a month that's just one day right um that's interesting as well I think time wise at seven till nine um so like 12 to 15 is 7 till 9 New York time so that that in my head kind of makes sense because I know crypto is 24 7 but if you think from the Trad fire world most Traders sort of start the day at seven o'clock um us arriving at seven seven two nine putting on positions putting on risk that kind of makes sense to me yeah it kind of looks exactly the same because the FX is also a global market rate so basically when New York walks in is the is the is the most liquid time because New York is there London's there and the stragglers in Asia are also there right so you you kind of get everyone together um what what's what to me is most interesting here is that um you know like a many many people in Asia are contributing to this this volume and they're not trading in Asia morning right like that if you look here they I mean Asia morning is basically zero to you know nine right I mean that that's the Asia morning afternoon um that that time is yeah like those guys are wake up and not doing anything and then they're trading when the market is more liquid which is you know when us is here when um when London's in um so yeah it's very similar to FX effects I feel um yeah I'd I'd love to know as well how I mean I can kind of infer I imagine but like how that impact spreads as well like so obviously those Peak liquidity moments are spreads much tighter a lot more liquidity which again might make you think in terms of if you're running some kind of art strategies actually you want to be operating in the wings of that chart um we should overlay this data with the bid offers pressed and like the distance in which trades that are going up on Paradigm are clearing from their marked fair value over that time to see if it actually is the case that I mean more volume you would expect more liquidity but you know let's back it up with the data I think that'd be pretty interesting yeah be cool I mean that's that's uh that's that's a pretty standard um a standard graph but I'm still surprised by the fact that you know Monday is I mean it's not that different from Saturday right no it's it's like I mean two times or whatever but so it's still there there are still prices being made um it's just um yeah it's I mean it's obviously less yeah and if you're a market maker watching this and you don't want to be on on the weekends the highest volumes on the weekends are observed on I think it looks like Saturdays from 12 to 15 UTC so if you're if you're looking to be active for three hours over the course your weekends and log on to start trading I mean albeit like it's still very small but that's probably where you want to focus your time if you're if you're trying to take a break from um your weekend boozing I I I'm surprised um I thought Monday would be higher actually um just because again like like thinking back to then from my FX days like Monday people come in either something's gone on the weekends so you kind of reacting to that or you're adjusting positions or pulling on positions that things that you like for the week uh I would have thought Monday might have been a bit higher volume so that's that's good I mean I I think I think I think that I had the exact same reaction and I think it's tied into the fact that the weekend is kind of not zero right so basically yeah Monday we start dealing with all the other guys come back even though it's 24 7 it's not really 24 7 but there's no liquidity on the weekend so you come in you start dealing on Monday but here it's kind of getting split across that Monday flow is getting split across like Saturday Sunday and Monday right right and don't get me wrong there are days I I remember there was there was one day I think June June of last year remember we had like that big rally before the merge in the Summer where I logged on on Saturday and like ethereum was up 17 I was like oh my God and that day felt like you know a Wednesday during that 12 to 15 UTC bucket right so there are days when there are things going on you know a big set of news where crypto is just going to react right away and the volumes are going to come in right away and due to the fact that you actually have some liquidity on the weekends so I think that's why Monday's not you know not nearly as high but I I know I know you've you've been doubling down on your views and you've been right for for a long time but yeah dude this this rate Market's kind of nasty yeah I must admit so obviously I've been pretty brought up since mid-December early December um you know talking about this changing sort of macrodynamic as we transition from a world where you know fed fed ran the most aggressive hiking so I call in recorded history to coming in sort of pause and thinking that it will start to position ahead of that and then tying that in with the sort of peak inflation type narrative dollar starts to sell off like about end of October early November time which which I thought was a bit of a tell so yeah so and and obviously we had our own stories within crypto right uh with FTX blowing up um and everything came with that but I kind of felt that a lot of the bad news was in you know coming into this new year um you know we well I certainly I think we said back in December that I felt the lows are in it's always a dangerous thing to say um yeah yeah well let's see right um but but yeah so so that that sort of thematic was playing out pretty well um I've kind of spoken before about within my to try and simplify my macro framework uh where we look at sort of rates liquidity dollar risk and then sort of flows and positioning and that's kind of how I try and look at the world um and sort of rates have peaked and we're rolling over which was like a big tick um we spoke about reasons why I think liquidity was kind of at its like tightest levels if you like um the dollar was rolling over so that was another big tick um risk like it was settling down and then sort of flows in position in the market was was all pretty bearish so you had that kind of nice Stars aligned moment um that kind of precedes a nice rally which which we've kind of seen so now now the question it becomes you know where are we now in in that in that sort of framework um so yeah the the rates move is worrying me uh quite a bit so we've had a sort of huge um sort of race free price um over the last couple of weeks in response to better data um what's quite interesting in that um is you kind of getting Twitter arguments with people about you know markets are going to sell off because of the recession and there's me going it's about race and liquidity refunctional rates and liquidity um and here we are kind of under the pressure in equities after a good rally because the data's getting better not because it's not because it's getting worse the worry now is that the data is going to keep the FED engaged and keep hiking so we we've seen uh we've seen a super sort of sharp uh repricing rates um I think we're now sort of pricing a terminal rate above 3.5.3 percent uh that was sub five just a couple of weeks ago so in rates world that's that's pretty pretty huge uh yeah and we had sort of 50 bits of cuts uh priced by the end of the year from the peak and now that's pretty much nothing um so you could kind of argue that maybe the market the rates markets called up with where the FED has said they're going to be um one one thing I will say is I kind of I kind of think there's been a bit of an overreaction uh to a few good data points generally data can be quite uh messy in terms of there's lots of seasonal adjustments that get made and we've had quite an unseasonably warm January as well so when you're kind of make any seasonal adjustments because normally January's cold and no one goes out you know shopping and all this stuff so they make adjustments to try and you know like uh kind of keep keep an underlying track of where the data would be if it wasn't for that so hence when you throw in a warm January that that kind of method of data but I don't want to be I don't want to be that guy or that's guy I don't believe the data because we have to take what's what's in front of us right so clearly we've had um a decent run of data be it from NFP be it from retail sales um so that's kind of spooked everyone into thinking right we're not seeing that level of demand destruction that the FED effectively wants yeah I mean just look at the pmis yesterday right we'll be printing the advisor at 50 and a half yeah versus a 47-2 expect patient that's the highest reading since June right what's weird yeah and what's weird it's kind of gone the trend of data was all going one way and everything was pointing to like contractionary pmis and then everywhere not just in the US but like we had really strong numbers out the UK so it kind of makes me question it a little bit um and uh yeah it'll be interesting to see whether that sustains my feelings it won't and we'll we'll revert back to the trend of sort of weaker data prints um but nonetheless that that is what it is so we've had this pretty sharp repricing in rates um that all things equal um should have absolutely hammered risk and should have hammered crypto um and it hasn't so in the sort of most recent newsletter um that actually came out today um again macro macro is never about one thing and it's trying to think about it within the framework and there's lots of moving Parts I think the other big thing that that that is offsetting it is liquidity um so I spoke before that liquidity is kind of getting easier so the the big sort of four essential Banks if you've got the feds uh the ECB Bank of Japan and People's Bank of China their net balance sheets are starting to increase because basically China and Bank of Japan are injecting a lot of liquidity and expanding their balance sheet and it's outpacing the contraction that you're seeing at the fed and the ECB also in the US we have um we have this debt ceiling which means uh the U.S treasury happened to draw down on their TGA the treasury general account balance at the Fed so effectively without getting to uh technical about it effectively when they're building that up they're issuing bonds taking liquidity out the market and then they're put keeping their cash at the FED now they can't issue new debt because they've hit the debt ceiling they're now using to base they're needing to go and tap that cash of Reserve at the Fed so effectively they're injecting that back into the market so you've got that as a massive offset to uh to QT plus you've got the Bank of China um and Bank of Japan expanded balance sheets on Friday um we had the largest ever cash injection from the pboc on their seven day repo so net they injected 632 billion yuan into the market so that's huge right um today we had uh Bank of Japan announced an emergency uh Bond buying operation as their 10-year yields started to push past the half bip um uh sort of upper limit that they have so so those two big central banks are actively engaged still basically in pumping liquidity out there so it's a huge offset um to to the sort of tightening that you're seeing from the fed and the ECB and again you know if we have function rates and liquidity liquidity's got a lot easier and it's interesting for me that Bitcoin is kind of leading the rally in crypto because if you kind of plan that pure liquidity play um then kind of Bitcoin for me is like the ultimate kind of play on that and I I kind of think that's why bitcoin's outperforming eth um and why that that's kind of dominating so essentially long story short rates is a massive concern for me uh but I think liquidity levels are still pretty high and I think that's keeping us supported um I still I still think from that core thematic and I've spoken before like macro themes play out over a long time and everyone wants to jump from data to point to data point I I still think we're we're nearing a pause and I think that's massive for a market so I don't think 2023 is going to be 2022 and for for that reason I still think the lows are in like my worry would be if if we see inflation sort of turn higher um and then the FED have to actually properly re-engage if if that starts to happen and then and then all bets are off but you know there's not that inflation day to the other day is still still leans points to the fact that inflation's topped out and peaked out and in fact if you excluded uh shelter which we know is lagging and is set to come a lot lower and follow sort of house prices lower but I don't think it's really so much a question I I think people agree that it's probably peaked I I think more so the question is is it going to decrease as quick quickly enough yeah as the rates are pricing right like if we if we just gradually kind of come into this like you know four percent inflation year over year well if that's the case then and that pause isn't coming and then we were kind of back to this 2022 status quo where they need to continue to raise and which is going to hurt risk yeah but like like right rates have changed matter as well Jay right so there's a big difference between like I mean when you keep getting 75 bips come at you every month like that's a lot to adjust to and I think as we said before right crypto ate first right um I got absolute smashing and you could argue you kind of started to price that um again that that sort of change in macrodynamic into that really sharp sort of tightening cycle and in fact you know if you look at crypto kind of peaked out in in November 2021 when uh Powell sort of dropped the the phrase sort of transitory um the thing that I still keep banging on about um is pow now at his last two outings as I said um the disinflationary process has begun and I don't believe he uses like those words just sort of flippantly um I I think they're fair to looking at things and go look we've probably done enough um yes they still want to maintain credibility and if the data stays strong they can still keep going and I've 25 another 25 but I also think they appreciate those lag you know lagged effect of their policy um and they're comfortable that we're starting to move lower now again does it come quickly enough you know that that's at the moment the answer to that is is potentially no uh which is why the markets have repriced so so looking at uh looking at things right here right now um I actually crypto trades like super well given the rates move I I would have thought potentially lower but I say I I think I think liquidity is offsetting that I still think we spoke before about positioning I still think Market came into this year under position risk generally um and we've had a huge move so the left chasing performance so I still kind of think that's going to gonna still have people sat there on the bid and I think we've seen that pretty much I know we've seen a little bit more sort of bearish flows certainly in the front end um but but we're still seeing people put on some top side right um at this point continue continues to really dominate The Narrative yeah a lot of June and June and then short dated um you know upside convexity plays like Elvis this fed 26 000 strike over the past week traded to 8 500 times on Paradigm yeah right I mean I mean looking at the open interest some of these were like Closeouts of of positions that were put on previously but net net you know people people are are adding to the upside and I think a macro aside I mean you look at what the what really sparked the big rally last week right it was it was all those Mr Sohan you're Mr Hong Kong right the uh all those all those Twitter rumors or that are start starting to seem like they're being uh validated that you know Hong Kong could potentially be the next you know bigger crypto hall right yeah absolutely look I mean it's it's honestly it's great news right it's great news um and uh you know I I live there and it's really suffered over the last three years not just for crypto but for tread fight people have left the left to Hong Kong to go to Singapore or Dubai just because it had a big quarantine and um you know like it wasn't friendly you know the regulation wasn't friendly especially on crypto um so they came out with a regulation which basically said um retail are likely to be able to trade crypto only the top coins but uh likely by June and now yeah they said top top coins um and the rule was that you had to have them added to at least two indices um so yeah it's probably going to be BTC East maybe maybe uh maybe another one or two uh but then I think it's more like the they're willing to work with people so this is not actual rule yet it's a consultation so that I look let's chat to the major Players let's uh decide by the 31st of March you know what we should do and then by the first of June we'll put it in place so I think the the sign for the market I mean I was surprised by the size rally and then I was like well why am I surprised right because Hong Kong is a fairly like small place but it's a barometer for China right so I mean Hong Kong is um you know like it's an experiment right like in FX like for example Hong Kong had the deliverable remember uh as in Hong Kong and that was the test right like to see if the capital account can be opened up Etc so um I completely think it's a test um and they're willing to work with people and see how it goes if it goes wrong so be it right it's only Hong Kong if it goes right it means Mainland could be could be in play right uh and we're talking multi-years but I mean it's a very drastic change to two years ago where you know they single-handedly caused like you know like a 50 crash in Bitcoin right um so yeah um yeah I think it's great news and I think my takeaway from what David is saying is like there's a there's a lot of these external factors like these regulatory you know stories that you know can happen and it's it's great news there's a big macro like uncertainty like you know whether this inflation is you know peaked or not I'm still shocked the option Market is realizing like realizing I realized and implied is that low right like I mean I I I completely understand why it doesn't matter what direction you think it's gonna happen like just buy some right right I mean there's a lot of stuff that could play out in your favor right I mean regulation macro you know random random stories you know the the Shanghai upgrade you know like Etc I I think I think that's the way you keep seeing people come in and buy it at the top side and it's not like we we think a lot of people's like directional but there's also like um you know probability adjusted kind of risk reward and again like if you're if you're a crypto fund you know you can't not have that exposure to the upside and the risk that actually happens right and flies so you have to own some of this stuff because yeah just you know something comes out and and as as we know like you know crypto can move just as rapidly to the top side as it as it does to the downside so so yeah there's there's a lot there's a lot of positive stuff out there at the moment one of the other things as well is that you know we had a lot of fun around the SEC and Gensler coming out and you know going off to staking and and all that stuff and actually like it wasn't that long ago right that would that would have that would have been a good 10 sell-off um and yet crypto kind of didn't blink and then actually the sharper rally was on the Hong Kong story um so it just shows me that sentiment's changed um there's been a pretty substantial sentiment shift towards this space um it kind of feels like it's had a lot of bad news thrown out it survived it's kind of uh it's weathered that storm and now sediments turning quite positive also as well I think I I think there's kind of this sense that look the SEC are going to do what they're going to do and maybe crypto just builds outside in the US and kind of the Hong Kong story kind of fed nicely into that like you know what we we can have maybe crypto builds out outside of that now the US would be stupid if they let that happen but nonetheless that's kind of feels like the route that are going at the moment potentially um to allow you know everyone else to embrace it and build around it yeah the Hong Kong announcement was quite timely right it's been it's been very clear over the over the past two months that the SEC has been tightening its grip around around crypto and then it kind of it got really really bad of course with with Kraken and then oh okay then Hong Kong comes out and you know smells the blood in the water sort of saves the day and it's pretty interesting I mean where are most of our upside flows like coming from they're they're coming from Asia guys and like you know boots on the ground kind of see what's happening and that center of gravity that certainly shifted to the West after the Bitcoin mining got banned is now shifting back towards the east Joe is quite funny so I was in Barcelona and um I think it was on a Wednesday night wasn't it and Bitcoin kind of broke higher um and I couldn't see and I was looking to see like what was was there something out from the fed maybe or you know what was driving it and there was nothing really obvious sort of driving it and then a client actually messaged me saying are you seeing these moves like do you know what's behind it and and at the time I'm in some Sky Lounge Bar in Barcelona I'm like I don't know but like I've been drinking sangria every sangria I have it seems to go up and he was like keep going keep going actually to be honest it happened in the middle of the night for me right like um and uh you know I woke up I was like what what is what is causing this and I read the headline and I was like oh the headline it can't be that headline surely it can't be that headline and I was like wait oh no you gotta you gotta think about it right like it's it's not like a small isolated place right you got to think about it as an experimental future so um yeah I guess that's that explains the rally right but but it it say it's interesting and like bringing it back to the macro say given the rates move which which I think is ugly um you know crypto crypto trades pretty pretty well like considering that um the pullback after a decent move and again like knock on wood here I guess but like the pullback after a decent move has been pretty um pretty shallow so I think the price action still looks really constructive and I'm more cautious here than I was coming into the year just giving this straight move but I still think liquidity is High um I I also question um yeah it feels to me I've said before like Joe I know we've spoken about this like the Market's still trading that 2022 Playbook and I feel it's like the Market's psychologically scarred by what went on in 2022 so it's it's interesting to me how quickly it's gone into this Panic about the cell bonds I've fed again after height rates and you know for uh into infinity and beyond um and they've kind of jumped on that and and I I just feel it's a little bit overdone um and if race if rates top out here then then I think the tower wins and liquidity this positive sentiment then we can take that next leg higher so I'm still pretty positive um that that we we're actually going to sort of take a next day higher but we do need rates to calm down the dollar the dollar kind of peaked out on Friday um so I think that's helping things as well if the data starts to ramp up again that's another part of the framework that that's breaking down that you start to get a little bit more bearish but um but that that seems to have kind of topped out on Friday um the the other thing um and if I can share a chart um I always say oils um oil is quite important um as a macro sort of factor input um let me see if I can work out how to share this chart um so you see in this chart of uh of um so this is oil against uh five-year Break Even inflation and like so oil for me again as a part of a macro framework is is quite an important input right just given the importance of the world of oil uh often has sort of tight correlations with the dollar but it also is a big sort of driver of inflation expectations right for obvious reasons it all goes up inflation goes up um and and and typically would lead inflation expectations um so if you look like the general sort of direction of this as kind of will come off we start to see inflation expectations fall and oil balances again inflation expectations go up so we've started to see um oil starting to come lower again it all looks for me like it's gonna absolutely like tank like the price action looks awful um but you're starting to see oil come lower again but yet inflation expectations keep going higher and actually if you look when inflation expectations bottomed here around the 18th of Jan that's when uh U.S yields topped out so inflation expectations if you overlay 10-year deals with this you really tend to track pretty nicely as well so the reason why the reason why I think uh yields are probably going to top out and we've got the FED minutes later and maybe uh uh that they they completely embarrassed me but but again all things equal just looking at this this this move in in inflation expectations looks like it's completely overshot and I think that's a market that's psychologically scarred by by 2022 and the inflation narrative the FED hiking rates and so you see in a market price in this this sort of ramping inflation again that's kind of against what what certainly what oil would suggest and I kind of think this is going to settle down and catch back down to where where oil is trading so then there's inflation expectations settled back down because I think they've got carried away of themselves after a few good bits of data um inflation expectations settled down catch back down to oil then I think you see yields come back down and then that's when Dollar probably come back lower quite a bit um and then like the that that liquidity that positive liquidity pulse that we've been talking about starts to take over and that's when I think you'll see Bitcoin sort of blow through the the resistance up through 25k and Beyond and and ultimately I I think we'll we'll kind of sort of push towards 30k Bitcoin in 2008 but you I think if yeah we just need to see this rate sort of pull over and I'm looking at this chart to see will inflation expectations turn back lower and I think if oil continues to break down I just really struggle to see how you keep pricing in higher inflation when oil which is so sort of such a fundamental input um is breaking down so I'm kind of looking at this I'm expecting inflation to roll back over and certainly inflation expectations to fall which will then pull yields lower and I think that that'll perhaps um sort of take the the sort of strangle holder for crypto that's kind of just sort of uh creating that resistance at the moment so I think that's quite an interesting chart as well to keep an eye on right yeah I guess I guess my the last point because we're starting to run a little bit over here is I mean I totally agree with you around around the Bitcoin narrative and I think there's I think there's a reason why there hasn't been as much Euphoria around ethereum and you know people a lot of people oh Shanghai upgrade like oh that's a great thing because it means that like ethereum 2.0 is is going as planned but like Shanghai upgrade in terms of short-term price action is not a good thing right like ethereum has been one way it's like literally if I'm since I think it was the beacon chain right if I if I wanted to State my ethereum while my ethereum was locked up unless I did it through you know Lido which was kind of like the liquid stating Pro staking protocol where I'd get the stake Heath and I'd be able to do that but reality is two-thirds of ethereum that is currently state is a liquid right and if you look at there's some pretty good research around this that at current prices of ethereum 1700. around 60 percent to two-thirds of people that have staked their eth are underwater right because they were staking at 2500 3 000 right and then yeah and then of course you know there's people that you know had staked a lot earlier and definitely making money but you could make this argument that there's this pent-up withdrawal demand right that as soon as I'm able to get my money out and of course the the ethereum um withdrawals are subject to I think something like 50 000 like ethereum per day it's not like it's a rush for the exit sort of thing it's going to happen over time well if there's this pent-up withdrawal demand and then for the foreseeable future you just have all these net outflows of of people just trying to get the heck out of this thing well what's going to catch that well it would need to be institutions coming in and being ready but if there's that Supply demand imbalance of okay a Shanghai upgrade happens and then you have all this each Supply that's coming from this and you're not having institutions coming in and catching it while ethereum's short-term I mean I think we'd agree that long term the Shanghai upgrade is very good right because in in the current state of ethereum staking the the percentage of current market value state for ethereum is very low compared to other other blockchains because it's a whole one it's one way staking at this point so we I think we agree a long term it's great but in terms of short-term this can be pretty nasty yeah yeah you have to do an entire podcast on on the Shanghai upgrade to be honest and I think that's a great idea for uh next week if you have yeah we have nothing to talk about but it was interesting to me nothing I know there's no set date in terms of where this is going to happen when this is going to happen but I mean I think everything everywhere I'm reading is telegraphing late March that this is going to happen yeah there's nothing really being priced that but Joe my my actual thinking is the other way on the Shanghai upgrade so like East is my biggest position right um sorry for any Bitcoin Max he's watching this but um but he it's my biggest position I've got a chunk of that Stakes because I've got a long-term view on this and when I staked that uh eth I knew it was locked up indefinitely right or for for a long time um and this this is right before we've even had the merge and what have you um you start locking it up and then you've got to wait for the Shanghai upgrade so the sort of mindset that would have locked that up is probably a long-term holder I would say and more great chances I think it depends on the price that you lock it up at I would agree the people that are locking it up at 500 I believe yes are probably the long-term holders but the people that are locking it up at 3 000 in who are deep underwater are going to have a higher propensity to sell than somebody that is you know in the money on it see see like the reason I think differently on that is because if eth would say at 10 000 now right my propensity to sell would be a lot higher because I'd be that's gonna be a lot of money for me right so like like basically I I don't know if if you've kind of had it staked and you you were staking it at three thousand whatever level that you're in at like you you've kind of you're massively underwater right are you going to bring that money out and go well let's just crystallize the loss you know what it's been there let's let's just leave it now and see what happens I I kind of think there's that element and then and then offsetting that as well is the other flows of those that wanted to stake but didn't want to lose liquidity from staking I.E I want to have access to it if I need it we'll now go do you know what I can tie another that's a really good point actually that's that's a really good point because it actually opens up a whole different world of people who have liquid staking now available right right yeah yeah so I mean maybe that balance kind of um you know it isn't as bad as we think but also like I mean I'm I'm the same way right like as in I if I haven't in the money um you know instrument I probably am less likely to sell if I'm something which is down 50 I'm very lucky to sell and in general people in crypto have suffered in 2022 right I mean most people have lost a significant portion of their bags right so I mean I I would think the even the long-term hodlers they will have like more of a cell pressure it's just whether you know there's new people who are coming in and it you know the the chain is like now more safe so um yeah it's yeah I think that's that's what's gonna Define define how this goes I agree yeah more safe but like I mean Mr rates over here I mean what what are ethereum staking yields what six percent well I mean compared compare that to to what you can get in a 10-year treasury right if I'm just looking at where I am on my on my wrist Spectrum I mean don't get me wrong like I I believe in the whole thing I'm just trying to be the devil you know play devil's advocate here as he may be an Institutional guy involved like oh I get four percent treasury yield versus six percent staking it uh you know with this validator node where I don't know what the hell they're gonna do yeah Fair that's fair the the the other thing I think we leave that um might be holding it back a little bit relative to bitcoin is again genza going after calling anything that that moves the security um from what I understand Bitcoin is the only thing that he's kind of classified as a commodity um so it's kind of like I can understand people going look if I'm bullish crypto I don't know what the second gonna do and I'm unsure around that there may be Bitcoin is just a cleaner play at this moment um so I do think that's how improving and probably my my biggest fear as an investor into ethereum is yeah if he comes out and labels a security tomorrow what does that mean um so you kind of sit there and look at that and go well yeah is it just easier to be holding Bitcoin so I I wonder how much that is planning to invest in psychology as well that's true I think that's a really good point to end up [Music]
