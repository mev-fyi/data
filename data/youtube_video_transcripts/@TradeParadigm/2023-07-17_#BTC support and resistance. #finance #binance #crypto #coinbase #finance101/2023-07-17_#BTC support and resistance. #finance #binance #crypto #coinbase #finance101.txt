since since the rally and and uh spot when range round it's pretty clear that previous resistance of roughly 30k which we saw you know a couple months ago before the rally has become this new sort of support level for this new range between 30 to 31k with that 31k level you know being a pretty strong resistant we've yet to you know meaningfully break it on a weekly or even like a four hour candle I mean hopefully this is this is the time where we can actually have a have a meaningful candle where we are above this level and you know currently spot is forming this wedge pattern in this new rain as shown by the chart and if we can meaningfully break this 31k level there's a lot of technical analysts and chartists out there that are predicting 35 to 37k is the new level
