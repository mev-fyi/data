hi I'm Dave Brickell director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about it's an expensive place to find out crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hi everyone welcome back to the big picture I'm Joe fruey your crypto Vol Market Insider here at Paradigm and I'm joined by our macro specialist David baquel and for today's guest super excited to have Lucas and Allison from Knox Bitcoin in Brazil we've got a ton great stuff to chat about today but before we begin help us out by Smashing that like button hit that subscribe button if you haven't already we're here every week with some of the freshest tasting crypto derivative markets and Beyond so Lucas Allison very excited to have you here why don't we get started with your guys's story Lucas I'll let you go first I'd love to hear you know how you got into the crypto space you know what you're up to at knock Sans uh yeah just go from there yeah here in Knox trading we have been doing lots of strategies uh we like to do look over calls um by evolved when it's ship and so and when it's expensive according to our data analysis and uh while the volatility of eaten and Bitcoin remaining quiet in the last three five months uh uh uh we started to look at the wall spread between the eater and Bitcoin right and uh here we do lots of research in Trader and researcher here at Knox and uh Alison helps me to to validate the points of view and we have been everybody have been noticing that the volatility of eater uh relatively speaking to bitcoin volatility as we might need has Who Remain it very quite so uh if you look at historical volatility the volatility of eater has remained around 80 percent while Bitcoin was 60 percent and now they are the same as sometimes the volatility of eater uh uh he's trading below Bitcoin volatility and uh and we started to um to put together position on this and to validate the the the strategy we also built a linear regression to see if two things if the currencies they are in fact related and cointegrated because you don't want to do a pair trading and volatility spread if the two assets they are not cointegrated which means the if the returns won't converge again so yet uh we have been trading on Dairy bit and Paradise since 2020 and uh we are using Paradigm to to build the the strategy we're looking for straddles uh uh short-term straddles in Bitcoin so yeah we uh we're building a strategy to shorting uh short-term and medium term straddles in Bitcoin and by using it as cash flow to buy uh longer straddles in eater okay interesting so so you look you're looking for that mean reversion in in the role um yes you're looking at that mean reversion involved uh for each to sort of come back and catch up um and revert to it it's sort of typical premium over Bitcoin right yeah you know yeah it's pretty interesting because like I I totally understand the view and from like statistical perspective you know it definitely does like look extremely dislocated but it's it's really interesting just watching at you know the years flows right you know BTC upside has kind of been Yale dominating in town you know ethereum really hasn't gotten a lot of love there's been a lot of vol Supply and Heath relative to BT scene and it's interesting despite this you know dislocation if you will in the ethereum Vol versus the BTC if you look in the top right those are the ball spreads right there we aren't really seeing a lot of guys come into the space to kind of like play this sort of new reversion like so like I guess what do you think about that right like there's there's this element of like okay when something is statistically dislocated however you could also make this sort of argument that we're kind of entering a new regime yeah uh for example uh ethereum interior is a different asset uh when you compare to uh since the ethereum has passing has become uh disinflationary and he says the the merge right and right uh unusing statistical data since uh uh after the merge so uh they they're keeping till they're keeping correlated and cointegrated and the market microstructure I think it's not different but uh what I can know this now ethereum produces yield so what do the people what does the people doing uh you also discuss it on previous chapter of the big picture that people were doing covert calls and uh getting interior or Lido or staking somewhere else so they they are doing a double ute uh passive income strategy they are shorting ethereum calls and by and by interior and putting them to work on stake and this is a great strategy when they talk about uh about treasury about institutional moves but you know uh uh they they become they became uh slightly different but I believe that some sometime in the future do it to market cap size uh the liquidity and the volatility of ethereum must be higher than Bitcoin we would and people are selling wall he's selling the they're selling vote to do passive income so I believe that I will be on the other side of the flow because what I'm seeing here people is short involved material to gain uh passive income the defy options vote they they are doing it a lot they're pushing they're helping to push down the options price on either but I believe that if the data is not wrong of course when you look at the past statistical is looking at the past and see how it can help you on the future but uh if we don't have a fat tail event you know ethereum being racketed Lido being recorded or or stolen uh I believe it will reverse the the returns will will back again to the to the the mean uh we can have it okay so you just uh just for our viewers so these two charts that we have on the screen so from what I understand you guys rock you ran a regression analysis on the Returns versus BTC and ethereum and then you ran in a statistical uh significance test on the residuals and that's the chart on the right so you can get in a little into that like a little bit more and you know how that residual now is that a two standard deviation but what kind of you know that's the point when you should be playing for the reversion yeah you know when we just putting it simple uh when you you run a linear regression you want to use an asset which is correlated to which one to to one and say Okay so let's assume that it iterus Bitcoin now and uh we will have uh a model everything that don't explain this model this model can't explain every variable every everything that this model can't explain it will be residuals so uh the residual analysis we we take the mean of this residuals and we take the two standard deviations so uh the the the assets they are two they they are still correlated but the the they have deviated so much from each one that you know when you talk about two standard deviations I don't know if they will be if ethereum will become uh more cheaper than that when we speak when you speak uh in terms of volatility in returns Interiors too much dislocated and now it's B it's below two standard deviations so yeah I think this trade uh excluding fat tails uh is making too much sense I don't know if we can stress Etters eaters so much yeah that that two standard deviations always the uh the great trigger right um yeah I will say it's like I mean you can just look at the year-to-date performance like just follow aside right if you're just kind of just looking at this thread from a directional View and you know BTC has kind of you know broken out of their this descending Channel a little bit and you know has really outperformed you know a fear and gently you know over the course of the year so I mean not even from like a vault perspective looking at this from a directional perspective like as a as a sort of catch-up tree you know ethereum catching up to BTC yeah I think potentially make a lot of sense uh but that that being said like even even on Paradigm uh you know more kind of see the opposite train so we need to get you guys signed up as a market you guys can provide a lot of liquidity for us like it's just great it's just great to have a sort of some natural takers on the other side right uh to to all this overwriting flow coming through I've given as well Lucas given the um positive spot vold correlation that we're witnessing in in our markets at the moment does that then implicitly make you sort of sort of more bullishy from a spot perspective over Bitcoin please yeah to be honest here uh I think I speak for looks as well he can disagree with me if you want so we're both kind of become maximalists so I mean it would make boss we do believe it had more short-term upsides so the perspective here is well yeah that's cash in on the internet let's enjoy the the ride but when we speak like the the it has more upside than bigger we're speaking like medium short term volatility price I don't before any maximalist comes here and sticks me with but with a stick uh I I didn't mean to say that there's a better cryptocurrency than with the reason it has much more upside than Bitcoin with medium short term especially because uh it had some relevant factors Lucas told the merge uh we don't think it's this this new reversion we're talking about it just means that it doesn't look it has been pricing yeah maybe all those Arbiters that exist because the mountains still like fighting the price for it so that's why stuff is kind of wonky looking statistically looking so yes we do a little bit much more upside for ether also because I mean I don't think it has big record system as a whole deterior ecosystem as a whole has done five percent of what it can do uh uh when without even talking like price me reverse and the velocity that objectively speaking if it hasn't done five percent what it can do uh and those kind of things tend to develop much faster than other adoption for him for the almost divide entity that is Bitcoin the Justice uh but yeah I said a lot but the thing is yes I do believe you have much more upside in the short so mid in terms than Bitcoin yeah I kind of um I wrote actually in in the macro pulse newsletter um for Paradigm the the idea about narratives and the importance of narratives in in all markets um certainly in all sort of macro assets and narratives are huge and and probably none more so than in crypto that does narratives matter and yeah throughout this year Bitcoin has had all the narratives um it feels um you know we came into the year we had this kind of nice macro narrative like you know Peak fed and the end of Central Bank hiking Cycles or so we thought um but as we were kind of positioning for the end of those um and I mean I guess you had you had the merge but then the merge actually sort of brought um a level of uh uh kind of uncertainty um around that um eth also as well the it's the it's bitcoin's the only thing that the SEC is calling a commodity um and they're happy to explicitly call that so kind of just the narratives haven't been there at all for for eth and then and then now over the last sort of couple of weeks um these this whole spot Bitcoin ETS with BlackRock and all the institutions looking uh to sort of come into the space again all the focus back on bitcoin so Bitcoin stealing the narratives right now um and uh yeah the ace kind of just being sort of forgotten about um and I guess it's a more difficult trade than just going along the thing that everyone's talking about foreign look at the chart here too right like from just from a technical perspective right we bitcoin's kind of breaking out of this you know descending sort of Channel and you have this sort of bullish Glide paddling that's you're starting to form around this 30k level and you know we're kind of really approaching this sort of crucial resistance Zone in BTC as well you know that 31 32k you know level which is the level of uh looking back around that uh previous May crash and you know a lot of conversations that we're talking about or that were speaking to customers about they're like look now you have we'll have this BTC uh you know fundamental story institutional flow story around the ETF but then now as well you know BTC is kind of sitting at this critical sort of resistance level where you know if we can break out you know perhaps we consolidate it for a few weeks but if we do break out the consensus is that we go to you know 35 40K so it's like kind of all these things combined it's you know it feels like when we switch our customers it's like BCC BCC BTC especially because I don't think we I mean there's there's no way in ethereum you know spot ETF or you know it's coming anytime sir no I don't think ethereum is getting any sort of each episode some of sorts uh the difference here in in between the narratives of bigquery and nature and mostly art um I'll just simply kind of corny by the ways here's some uh on the outcome of it I mean it's it's the actual guy suffer the spirit of it every narrative you think about Bitcoin every time you like to think of Bitcoin which I I don't mean even adoption I mean like news cases and so on why is it used or why is it important all of those narratives are kind of bearish of the society if you think of it uh if you're like okay why is Bitcoin important because the government wants you I don't understand why is Bitcoin Poland because I don't know USD is going to bust and Society is going kombun when you better have something that is the centralized and confiscable so you have those fats in Bitcoin that I I actually do believe then I'm known I'm joking but I do believe in those and I think those are important has much more been driven by uh by liquidity as of now not by those narratives yeah I mean limited is high on the market people buy Bitcoin because well why not I mean those analysis are valid and if you have like excess liquidity you're gonna go into some more exotic assets just because you can't so Bitcoin as of now has been sort of a I don't know Eternal liquidity index almost uh especially the last few years uh because the underlying narrative is kind of better if you're never going to see something like embarrassing society never get to see someone like yes it's so much wish for the clear as well to go boom boom so I could you see it's kind of a contrarian narrative and and that's why I buy into Bitcoin but it's a harder narrative to quote those facts for like let's say the ETF or some adopts are here and that while they are short-term uh interesting events that bring more liquidity to the bigger Market then also kind of gets it the the Bitcoin all narrative we'll see you see a black rock each year in the end of the day it's just the means for the US government to have in the end of the world and not I'm sorry for the change for a heart here but it's just a another way U.S ownership has a little bit more control in this one uh so it's kind of against the narrative so yeah it shorts and those things do help it they do bring institutional adoption uh you saw like with the stimulus frenzy in America during the Colville people were speculating through all kinds of stuff including Bitcoin on the Robin Hood or whatever but those things are that are about a weaker narrative let's say for society as well then it provides we like I can be uh the world's called Financial computer and you can do credits and you can do that and it's technology and it's technology and you have like nfts and R 2.0 whatever the hell it is so you can push narratives on Ethan much easier because ether is much more Society agnostic than Bitcoin let's say and it has a knowledgeable technology technological development and empowerment so the same way I do believe those shows and Bitcoin in fact might bring something interesting uh big for the same reason I buy into requesting I think all the things uh because it will be very much correlated to liquidity I mean the whole point of Bitcoin I mean not the whole boy because the wife every PHP transaction but anyways one of the major points of Bitcoin is save yourself from from another bailout for banks or something so it has a constructive narrative uh that I very much believe in to I buy into this I mean I got my skin of the game for this but either at any time someone could say okay we'll be running uh Governors uh some crazy G5 stuff that does AI whatever it's analogy people buying so much more easily yeah and it has a much broader scope so in that hospital was a little bit uh digressive here but in bad aspect yes maybe you have some thoughts here for Bitcoin here and value like each ever something but uh but uh macroeconomical scope for liquidity hasn't changed and it doesn't look like we'll change any time soon unless we start talking about China which is a whole other subject uh but is it on the other hand even though it's and now it's been enjoyed less because I'm a bit more of a contrarian it's so much easier to  I mean so much it's so much more sexy to society as a whole there's also the market rotations too uh Bitcoin goes up people start to distribute their liquidity to another crypto currencies when we speak about sport markets yeah of course yeah and I mean that's again I guess like like any asset class you have um you know managers have have to wait and carry a certain weight um in those baskets yeah you have these big moves and then you start to see the rotations and what have you um I mean again it is quite surprising that we haven't yet really seen that um level the rotation out of Bitcoin into e um or even um I mean we saw some of the defile sort of pumping uh last week but we're not really seeing too much of that um which is quite interesting but the other the other rotation I've been talking about because actually I kind of actually think the macro backdrop um looks a little bit vulnerable right now as a market surprise and recession risks um again to twos tens curve you know as as inverted as it was back in March when the banking system blew up um so I kind of feel like uh equities could be under a bit of pressure but actually what we might see is a bit of rotation out of these exhausted tech stocks that kind of were smoking the uh the AI pipe and and obviously had a massive move I think you might start to see a little bit of rotation out of that um into Bitcoin um and sort of broader crypto and and I kind of actually think that's why it looks like with the color correlated um a little bit from broader risk um as we've sort of seen the pump whilst uh equities have been a little bit heavier over the last week or so yeah it you know it comes back to the point I mean uh because still very much very much a liquidity index uh uh institutional can assess the the easier to no yeah the Institute institutional can have much more easier access to it too so better than neither yeah sorry also I I interrupted you your audio was delayed for me sorry no no no worries uh thing is uh stock suffered Bitcoin suffer uh and stock suffer because there's nobody in the streets Bitcoin suffer as well uh the trade about we were talking about uh already charging volatility between ethereum and Bitcoin is because ether is very much affected by the same issues that it's because it's on the same Market somehow so the liquidative factor for Bitcoin affects ether as well however it has a disorder component that it has a broader news let's say I wouldn't say more important is used but I would say a more broader use the Bitcoin uh and has an easy narrative um so why both suffer from liquidity branches has much more upside on random facts let's call it random Factor let's call it I don't know some goodbye developments of nft development some AI development uh some institutional adoption or something big so ether is supposed supposedly I'm not only talking macro here not even talking statistics or graph that also helps but I only talk about objectivity on the map right here instead of supposed to be much more volatile than big boy it has it has more sub not substance but has more more attached strings to it so so yeah I think they go back to the to the point I mean um stocks stocks will be heard macro category speaking it's kind of green uh and while it does for overage and Bitcoin narrative just me at the same time it means less liquidity so it doesn't get the shot Into the Blue Stone it this may hurt either as well but any bounce back or the quality they don't need that on such things and such shocks tend to be higher not only because of the students at the stash attached and everything but also because of the smaller Market cut yeah of course yeah no it makes a lot of sense um I think the other thing as well um Alison you mentioned uh China earlier and it's something I'm watching every day watching this currency move where we're seeing uh the Chinese one sort of depreciate pretty much on a daily basis at the moment and quite interestingly um the pboc in China seems to be happy to allow it to happen and and there are there are parallels uh I saw Arthur Hayes writing about um you know 2015 when uh China the base the currency um and uh and we saw Bitcoin sort of go on a massive ride High I think it trebled um over that period but on the currency devaluation story it feels like they're slowly and he falls off of a cliff and then you start to see you know that massive amounts of capital that are in China look to get out and um and possibly you know looking looking for Avenues to get out and Bitcoin will certainly be one of those foreign but I do expect China to switch along to the arena did you expect China to create the expanded World Liquidator as a whole like increase China has seem to be happy but they have to um they need I mean they need they need to expose they have and also Japan has evaluated a lot so this this hinders China I mean if Japan the basis develops the currency 2050s 70 percent which is a massive problem for China because Japan is one of the competitive not the main competitors of China for exports so they have to to evaluate that anyone and and I won't get much into the China situation here unless you guys want to but it's the the liquidity adrenaline shops we may be expecting may come from there and if you guys may have been noticing as well I hope the auditions have been as well that there have been some movements on reopening or reestablishing Hong Kong when I say as a crypto hub uh who have been here since 2015 2013 now that basically Bitcoin was Bitcoin graphs moved when China woke up there was always there you know oh yeah China gonna wake up let's see this candle so China used to have a much more important role in the crypto Market she's to have uh for I mean political reasons uh platform monetary and political reasons it may come back to to have this important role and Hong Kong has been moving on that in that way because if anything happens in China regarding uh investing in something that is not real estate or Chinese stocks is going to be having to be happening to Hong Kong uh so just to look ahead of a little bit more control about it but you see you're busy in Hong Kong making moves uh in the way of reopening for crypto and you see that the macro situation for China kind of asks for a little bit of currency printing or the evaluating and how Bitcoin right now is synopsis as it was in 2017 for the Chinese government because now the USD is kind of so simply speaking it just points your liquidated to approximately liquidity uh a little bit in the boost for the market from China but then again we're talking about stuff that the decided basically on a stroke of a pen by the by the party so while it does torture that I don't know tomorrow they might have different ideas and while we're talking about like wheelchair bus so guys but talking about um yeah sorry so talk about obviously we're going to now appear to be kind of turning back towards uh Bitcoin and being more open um this this seems to be this kind of uh regulatory Arbitrage um as the US kind of push against it um others are looking to exploit that um tell us a little bit about what what the uh playing grounds like in Brazil and that's to choose towards um sort of crypto there what's the um yeah just just what's this kind of temperature uh check towards Brazil um towards crypto in Brazil okay uh so surprisingly uh in Brazil a crypto adoption is more for people wanting to get exposed to bitcoin returns and at the beginning I at this Market since 2017 my first job was in a cryptocurrency exchange my first job was so I crypto native and uh every client in every crypto exchange they had their account closed by the greatest greatest Banks here in Brazil and they were always marginalized P2P P2P dealers uh exchange clients Exchange by itself because the the banks were closing their banking channels so they they could not receive realize from exchange it they could not deposit as well and surprisingly the greatest pain they're now pushing uh regulations they're now they have a Lobby you know they they already have cryptocurrencies on their apps so the clients can get exposed to cryptocurrencies but some but they but they can't withdraw so they can't handle the the cryptocurrency here in Brazil uh we have a very nice community that with uh people that actually uses Bitcoin understands the technology behind Bitcoin uh we have uh people doing a great job here but in Brazil people they don't want to accept Bitcoin on their business because it's complicated to to deal with uh you know you will have uh you will have to use a Gateway the gate will the Gateway will probably uh charge High fees so and with the success of picks picks uh is the great the greatest greatest star here in Brazil for payments Peaks have became have become uh social uh cultural Festival yeah yeah picks is kind of a Meme here so when you want to send money here in Brazil people don't say oh I will send you money wire VJ I'll send you a wire uh Brazilian hair eyes no I would say the pics the pigs have have become something like money you know so uh I don't see people using their Bitcoin wallet to to pay to do some payments they will use picks but I believe that uh we can use lightning Network to build um to build a layer a layer and we can build uh overclock collateralize it uh a dollar or realize and people can use it to pay but pick so much more easier you know and uh the regulations and the adoption here is more of a financial basis people buying ETFs or buying crypto like stocks you know too yeah just give a little bit of Contours on the pixels that's a very interesting story I don't know how much I think no one is by familiarized with picks but it is a thing yeah what is this yeah yeah it's a decent payment service in Brazil that that is run by the central bank so instead of like setting wires in some countries uh pix is basically each citizen can assign can get a wallet guys I mean I'll cut the story short here it's basically a Proto cbdc yeah uh it's basically a problem they didn't issue the currency itself but they made that the transferring infrastructure and the interesting thing about pigs is that Brazil has a very interesting thing about about Community career community that has many old school hardcore guys like from Bitcoin I mean 2010 2011. uh there are people on on the ethereum foundation that are from Brazil the people working online right now there are from Brazil so it has a great hardcore community and back in 2015-14 I don't remember correctly those guys they got access to Congress and started pushing hey this is blockchain let's take a look uh let's regulate I mean they're kind of they're kind of raising the flag of the Congress uh and the Central Bank in Brazil has it's quite developed I think no one really knows about this but the Central Banking was extremely solid it's one of the most solid in the world and the guy's a real technically the Central Bank in Brazil they sold this Lobby push or anything so this blockchain today is interesting we could have massive control on transaction make some each month faster so pix was built in with a blockchain logic it's not a a one of those uh IBM private blockchains Solutions but it but it is a PhD transaction works on QR codes even enough like you have rabbit is it's source of a blockchain copy that was obviously in the Central Bank servers and it is a pro to cbtc and I think it's the first she's sending on there is it real is it yeah so when I don't know how how wires work in most of the World Bank might have Bank a day we have Bank B I say I send you a transfer eventually when when both Banks session yeah via the Central Bank of your of your country and presumably win the same country you receive the money these usually take a business day sometimes they have some agreements images and graphic compositions and then they physically settled later and Reserve this all happens via the Central Bank immediately so I you're in Brazil David you have a fixed account I send you a big Smite Bank since you sends directly at endpoint an API endpoint shoe we we actually do have picks as well in noxic so he said and then point to the central bank that goes it's basically a blockchain transaction but instead of sitting I don't know sending a high on the sending via Beacon blockchain signature Central Bank server and it may immediately gets gets credited on your wallet on the central book server so you trust me guys they cut the intermediary of the bank here that's interesting that is super super important this is something go on that house kind of stalled at least something that has kind of stole crypto uh development in Brazil the Central Bank when a hijacks this transactional uh this transactional uh uh innovation and also the other thing that Brazil has 20 20 220 240 million people or so but the average income is very low so we're retailing Brazil why is this massive in in volume Infinity in people's volume it's not extremely like it is it is obviously big that's the private banking clients let's say the private banking clients in business for about Los numbers would be 200 000 maybe when a 220 24 40 million people population they have basically the same amount of money in invested money than the whole of retail the masses for the or the 99 percent of the population so you see uh adoption in Brazil by volumetry you can go you can invest a little ton of money to go off to retail to get about the same money you get on custody if you invest much less money for private bug let's say for the one percent of the population so retail has never got this massive investment there have been some attempts but they haven't been much fruitful fruitful uh so yeah no Story show Bitcoin Brazil crypto Brazil in general it's a thing the I don't know people who are let's say uh uh middle class financially speaking May sometimes speculate into private private banking clients let's say the one percent they will have they may have some positions as well retail has some  options but it haven't been really sold into and the central bank has hijacked the transactional Innovation adoption has increased somehow we especially because of the retail Banks efforts to make it an accessible product what we call it adoption degree so that  also should things one most of those people have walked into a Bitcoin each F token something call it which is basically a bank setting you exposure to bitcoin that probably just buying futures uh they don't have like the full Cruiser experience I'm not saying this and not making any valid judgment here on this everybody is they're not like actively like opening wallets transferring getting to know the previous spaces just open the box and so oh there's a thing called thing called Bitcoin right here from I don't know from the paper let me bind to that this is a more fun hobby good experience the sort of government new authorities out there pretty open pretty relaxed about crypto yeah yeah it has been having tougher we also had a bone of pyramid schemes and all kind of stuff back in 2017-18 so there was a little bit of a Crackdown of that but they were mostly focused on the pyramid excuse itself not under the underlying or would I even say on the line probably because there was no Bitcoin both just the name of it but yeah other than that uh it's just what more about money legendary issues regulatory speaking they have there has been some regulation has been pushed since 2015 on the Congress but they're not so worried so it has been like approved and they're gonna set the regulator it's been moving a very slow pace uh governments usually either yeah or yeah I just don't care generally um yeah I mean I I I I I think um that's been a really good conversation um that's really interesting to hear what you guys are are sort of doing in the space um great great to hear that we've got a potential uh say natural interests to take the other side of all this e flow um and it's certainly going to be interesting to see how that plays out [Music]
