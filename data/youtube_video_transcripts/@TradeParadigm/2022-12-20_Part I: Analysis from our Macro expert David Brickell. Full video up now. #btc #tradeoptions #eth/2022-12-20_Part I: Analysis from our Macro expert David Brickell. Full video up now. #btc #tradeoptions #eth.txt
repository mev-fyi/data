here so just to look at 10-year yields so we kind of faded out above levels around 372 which is um a bit of a level some sort of previous lows and and also some previous highs 380 is a bigger level to watch it was the highest um at the end of November so kind of watching those levels but I'm expecting those to break down the biggest moves that we're seeing today has been in Dottie Yen so Dottie Yen has fallen around just over four percent uh Market's still very short Yen and I think the interesting thing for me is um this kind of feeds the narrative post ECB as well that other central banks are playing catch up with the FED which should ultimately lead to a weaker dollar
