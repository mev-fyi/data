collects two order book snapshots for nearly two hundred thousand traded instruments across a hundred exchanges so we have some of the most comprehensive order book data in the crypto data space but of course this data is massive and it's really hard to work with unless you're like a Quant so we build a really nice data set where we take Market depth it's essentially just the sum of all bids and all asks on either side of the mid price and from that at the instrument level then you can build aggregations like total Bitcoin dollar depth across all exchanges or total Bitcoin depth where you take the sum of BTC USD BTC usdt so it sort of Aggregates this immense amount of information and it gives sort of a global measure for liquidity which is what this chart shows and actually this chart Aggregates not just Bitcoin it Aggregates the top 10 crypto assets it's a new data type that we have that essentially lets you take the dollar value of liquidity for any combination of assets across every instrument in crypto markets
