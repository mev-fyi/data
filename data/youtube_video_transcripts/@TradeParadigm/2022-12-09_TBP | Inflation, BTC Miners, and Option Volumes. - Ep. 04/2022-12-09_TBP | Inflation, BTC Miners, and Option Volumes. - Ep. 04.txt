welcome to the big picture this is the show where we talk about macro markets and micro Market structure so let's let's start with the David why don't you start with I start us off with um some macro stuff yeah I mean it's been God it's felt like a long week I guess in the world of macro since we we last sat here and spoke um we had shortly after we we recorded last time we had power speak markets went on a tear everything ripped um you know we're talking about uh the pivot or the pause um and then bang on Friday we get a strong non-farm payrolls number um and it kind of just Unwound and all of that is followed up by um by some stronger ISM data service data so it's kind of like we're in this kind of push and pull between the markets trying to position for this pivot or pause um a lot of people have issue with me calling it a pivot but um you know I as I think I've said before like pivot or pause it's about pricing changing in a macro regime from pricing this this hike cycle to pricing the end of it and the Slowdown and the slowdown's happening right we're going to step down from 75 to 50 bits and then and then we've only got a few more before then we end and then we've got to try and think about what what we're trading next but in all truth like for all the noise and like like Twitter right now is just full of like the world's ending right um it's it feels like it a little bit this week with stocks back down but we've kind of only really Unwound the gains postpower and and that's in here now if you hadn't looked at a screen and we're just checking back in you kind of think nothing's really happened right so um I don't think much has changed in the world on macro I also think right now there's there's a huge amount of noise in the data so like if I look at non-farm payrolls on Friday that was a stronger print and everyone's getting excited about that or that means that you know the FED they're gonna have to keep going for longer at the same time you have like the household survey data which actually showed jobs being lost um so there's a lot of like statistical quirks that I guess like leave room to question even the ism uh data we had the other day that was strong um on the official data but then you had the um the market Services PMI which was actually showed contraction so we've got these kind of competing data points but the one thing I'll try and highlight I guess is if we're talking macro here right we're trying to talk about Trends um rather than like being day Traders and trying to you know yeah and we're up and down the next day I mean clearly the big data point now that we're all going to be focused on is CPI uh next week and obviously we have the FED as well now really if you if you're kind of core macro and we're looking at these macro Trends we shouldn't be be so dependent on one data point right it should be about the series of data points but I I guess that kind of um sums up this kind of skittishness of the market right now um and the fear that you know the FED are going to keep going until they break something but I I kind of Stand By the comments that I I've sort of made in terms of us being in this this sort of macro shift and this change in in the macrodynamic as we transition away from this fed hike cycle to this now um to the end of that cycle the the other interesting thing that's really stood out to me as well is whilst we can debate around what that means for risk is we've certainly transitioned away from pricing this inflation regime to now it's it's the the recessionary sort of growth fears um that the markets sort of really worried about um so it still feels like the inflation's Peaks narrative is is still there um and people more comfortable with that now everyone's worried about growth and what's happening with Grace um people talking once again about twos tens I mean that's been inverted for forever but but now it's it's becoming even more inverted the feds prefer to sort of measure for for the recession signal um the three month 18 18 months uh curve inverted all the cows are inverted kind of signaling recession we can't have this Global slowdown or Oils oils keeps coming lower um and and if we're pricing a growth slowdown versus the sort of inflation fear then it's a completely different uh vastly different implications for for assets and the main takeaway for me is is that the sort of big trade for me in that is long duration is going to perform right so 10-year yields are coming lower 30-year yields are coming lower um and that's kind of quite a different regime now how that relates to crypto is crypto is a long duration asset right so I kind of if I want to start getting balled up on on crypto again I want to see duration performing and then I'm going to play crypto as a higher high beta duration long duration asset so I think this move we're seeing in bronze is is really significant it's also being reinforced by the dollar as well I think which is quite interesting which is coming lower the one the one thing at the moment that that kind of holds maybe crypto back and risk assets generally is is that you then have this um this kind of risk premium that Market's trying to factor in for recession and all this stuff so risk isn't performing particularly well but we it's a completely different Dynamic that we've been in for the last year where Bonds were selling off actors were selling off and the world that the really place I think now we're we're in this world we're actually bonds are rallying on the bad news um yields are coming lower and I think that ultimately say continues to put um you know underlying support to our markets and as soon as we get a little bit of good news our risk kind of stabilizes I think that's where you see the kind of higher beta long duration proxies I.E NASDAQ and crypto start to perform so I I still think we're on that Trend and um I think it's interesting that we're now transition away from the inflation Focus to uh to the growth fear and focus David I I saw that you got into this discussion with material scientists on Twitter can you can you sum up his um his argument and then offer like what you you know your your rebuttal yeah I I mean I mean to be fair I think uh saying the same same sort of thing in terms of um fills up where price and this kind of peak inflation uh should be good for bonds I think he he's rather than whereas I'm looking at at sort of nominal bonds I think he's looking at tips and and seeing what those inflation proxies are doing as his signal I think as well is a little bit more cautious in terms of um we're not there yet but and and just seeing the just wait just wait uh name there like I think we're yeah um but but he I think he's picking up on similar things he's um he's a little bit more concerned about the longer term inflation so I think he sees his ball with perfect where we will we will come off sharply on inflation but um we spoke a little bit around um uh this kind of de-globalization and the potential inflationary impact um some a little bit of disagreement I guess in terms of I think this reassuring instead of getting instead of replacing cheap labor from abroad with with cheap cheap well cheap labor from abroad with people domestically I I think you'll start to see that she play labor get replaced replaced by robots um and and technology so I kind of think technology will act as the disinflationary force um and offset similar globalization or deglobalization I'm also not so convinced that we're going to see that big the globalization move um you saw you saw a PepsiCo uh making making people redundant this week um and talks that meanwhile they're hiring in in India so I wonder if actually we'll see just a rotation from from um from from certain countries where manufacturing and and Labor's sourced at the moment to other cheaper areas that are maybe less politically sensitive and then you still you still got this competition with with technology that is going to still replace all the manual manual jobs so I still think we're in a disinflationary world that demographics technology and those kind of headwinds to inflation for me are bigger and I think we'll settle back into that kind of japanified world as I like to call it yeah yeah the macro does look a bit more constructive now but the question is like for crypto like how how much does this really matter like I know I know that David has always talked about um crypto pricing from this macro angle but you kind of look at some structural overhangs as well um you know crypto specific overhangs that you know potentially would could prevent uh a continued rally if the macro does improve right like we know like Bitcoin miners for example we know a lot of these guys like reading the marathon digital uh earnings right like they're these guys are budgeting from you know 16 that between 16 000 22 000 right like these Bitcoin miners have liabilities that aren't denominated Min dollars but their balance sheet are made up of you know Bitcoin in in Bitcoin mining rigs right so like in order to fund these liabilities I mean who knows right I think there's potentially could be could be some selling pressure from these Bitcoin maximalists that you know really haven't budgeted for Bitcoin prices this low or I mean hash rate has come has definitely taken a step lower as well but you know has not come off massively and then Additionally you know power costs remain high right so I think there's you know potential questions around that and then additionally yeah I'm sorry yeah yeah no like 100 and and this is I mean this is what makes these things difficult right um all those things you say are valid and actually if you look at a chart of them say Bitcoin overlaid with the dollar with 10-year yields with even like NASDAQ um you know it would Place Bitcoin around I know 24 25 000 right now um so we're we're obviously kind of feeling the impact from from the FTX implosion and the Fallout from that still a lot of fear around what their bodies I mean you know the the whole um sort of maple story this week and orthogonal you know again it's another sort of element of fun in the market and you know that there'll be some real um consequences from that in terms of flows and liquidations so so right now it kind of feels the flow Dynamic probably still favors you know false liquidations still don't really know what's what's happening with Genesis and how that's all going to play out um so you've got a really sort of negative flow Dynamic um you know offsetting what's what in my mind is is a more sort of positive sort of macrodynamic um and and probably you know once these things kind of play out um and it's hard to tell when you know no one knows when like that that's that process and that deleveraging process kind of completely runs um runs itself through then when it does then bang and all of a sudden there's a lot of catch up to play and that's probably where the money comes in I I'm we spoke about this before I'm pretty impressed by how well crypto's held up given given what it's going through right now and given the likely full selling so there's probably there's some decent like accumulation going on I would say um but you know the the the marginal Flows at the moment are obviously biased to Sellers and um and that and that's the kind of unknown and that we're trying to work out right the the sort of macro versus that sort of flow Dynamic which Joe is why we've got you here right yeah exactly so this um sorry uh go on Justin sorry yeah to your point um I was just looking up at hash rates hash rates have come off significantly like kind of proving that miners have been forced to shut down a ton of machines lately um but yeah yeah but that chart is that's only a one month chart pull are you able to pull that out for sure no no I not prepared I just looked up the first um the first thing I could see oh it does have the one year uh yeah if you pull that if you if you pull that chart off um yeah you know you'll see that like the hash rate still is fairly elevated right I mean it's come it's come off a lot uh in terms of its you know recent Peak but you know if you just compare it to the level and you know even even beginning of this year right it's it is still quite elevated okay but and and the funny thing is well it I mean one thing I always say kind of from a macro and even approaching crypto from that macro angle is like narratives are so important in markets right narratives actually yeah I think kind of Drive everything um and you know when hash rates were reaching records and crypto was getting hit because of all the other stuff going on no one even spoke about hash rates and now all of a sudden like like crypto Twitter and you know everyone's talking about hash rates falling and mine is collapsing and all this stuff it's like well you you didn't get that excited when we were going the other way but but we're in that regime where we're in that regime of fear um and everyone's looking at the next scene that could could maybe take us lower um but again you know that that for me is sometimes starts to be the signals when when we're we're near near the lows on these things um here is the pulled out chart of the hash rate and you can you're you're right it's pretty elevated um since this looks like the covid crash right there but yeah I mean well this is back in actually this is back June 2021 yeah so yeah it's pretty high still yeah exactly come off so come off at 10. it's come off you know but half rates high and you know input costs for the miners are certainly higher with with the cost of power as well and and then obviously the the output of the mining process is a lot lower right and it's just it's kind of basic math here right and and from what we know right the we talked to all the OTC dealers it's not like these guys are hedging right it's not like it's not like it's like one core's commodity desk that is you know basically trading term structure and hedging their exposure all the time like these guys don't do that for the majority you know because they made so much money on the way up they're all Bitcoin maximum list but you know you could get to the point where you know you potentially need to sell and I mean with the hat with the hash rate falling and sure that presents a decent opportunity um you know to get to potentially get into the space but like especially like you know the the machines on the market like I imagine if you need to sell you know those are there's gonna be quite a significant haircut on those yeah wait are you saying that that most minors are not hedging from the Oak from the OTC dealers that we speak to uh a lot of these guys try to have a conversation with them to hedge their exposure right buy put sell caller the exposure they said it's like slamming their head against the wall it's like I don't know it's it's a it's a little bit crazy to me right like I I imagine a commodity producer like a a big you know Miner like not hedging the price of the underlying like I don't know it's insane to me but but yeah they they kind of set out the top side right like they they sell calls is that right yeah they'll sell call for the yield enhancement but I I I'm more so so concerned on the way down being protected on the way down yeah but but it's a kind of when you think of that so they're prepared to kind of give away some of the top side you know potentially and they're not and not protect the downside it's interesting yeah we should get somebody on the show you know that is you know has a lot more experience speaking to the miners um because as I think we've discussed last week a lot of the miners don't trade on Paradigm right you know a lot of these guys are doing OTC bilateral transactions so that could be one for the future just go to the um again maybe something we can look at but like some kind of like zero cost collar structures or or near to zero cost color structures that kind of protect the downside and all right they'll cap the top side for them um you know maybe maybe they're the trades that these guys should be looking at um yeah to kind of okay they'll give up some of the top side if they're doing that anyway you know sort of then also protect themselves on the downside I just don't know if these guys do you speak to any of the miners David or Joe no no yeah in in the in the US right because these are these are highly you know regulated entities and yeah you know given their base to the US they they cannot trade on derivat yeah so we we kind of avoid all conversations with them okay we do see the flow on the back of it right because you know they'll do the you know they'll do like the yield enhancement like overwriting strategy with an OTC dealer and then that OTC dealer will subsequently recycle the risk from that fall selling strategy back onto Paradise right yeah so we see we see the hedging on the back of the of the minor flow but we don't actually directly see them interesting okay well speaking about flows maybe you should uh maybe we should launch into yeah sure yeah so I think it would be helpful to do a deep dive into the volume Trends around crypto options you know there's certainly been some misconceptions here right a lot of talk around oh crypto derivative volumes they've really trended lower over the course of the year and sure maybe that's the case in USD notional terms which is the y-axis here right but how is USD notional calculated right that it's the token price times the quantity right so it looks like it's trending lower in USD notional terms because the price is all the tokens have full fell but when you look at the volumes in terms of the number of contracts traded it's a very different story right so so this is just an example of a token Insight crypto derivatives report um this was published this week and if you look at this chart in the vacuum right you get this impression that crypto derivative volumes have really died significantly since Q2 2021 but as I just mentioned it's the decrease in the price of the underlying assets that has been the main reason for the decline in the USD denominated volumes and this isn't Me Knocking this report it's actually a great read and they do caveat the fact that the price down drawdown is the main reason for the decrease in the USD volumes but now when you look at the options and the option volumes and contract terms so this left chart is the government contract volume and then uh the right chart is the Paradigm contract volume right like you'll see that it's only continued to grow right despite this increasing hesitancy to hold funds on centralized exchanges right so like in November thereabit and Paradigm hit all-time highs in volume you know derabit printed over 10 million contracts you know in Paradigm achieved 30 of this market share right you see the direction of this Arrow November is this last bar here where it was our was our all-time highs so great but where do the volumes go for here go from here right like one could argue of course yeah of course the volumes were higher right the second largest Exchange in crypto just blew up in crypto derivative participants are forced to manage their risk you know with the large spot move or forced to unwind their existing derivative positions due to losing funds that are tied up on FTX you know and if you look at the daily volumes so that this is basically just Paradigm volumes each day uh over the past uh over the past month right so if you look at the daily volume since the first week in November you would you would see a drop off right and the volumes trended higher into the FTX blow up you know culminating on this day of 50 000 Bitcoin uh that traded on Paradigm on November 8th but then it's trended lower the rest of the month right so will this trend continue as users sit on the sidelines or are they eventually going to re-engage this market and to be honest I I don't have the answer to that question yet right like this bankruptcy has raised like very large unanswered question around like how much risk is actually being undertaken by institutional players when they trade on Native exchanges right and I'm sure I'm sure uh David can speak to this as well like but we we've seen customers like Mad Dash to digital asset custodians to mitigate this counterparty risk and ensure that exchanges don't re-hypothecate assets right so like Copper's clear Loop is a big one that is continuously coming up on conversations with institutions and basically what they do is they allow their customers to to delegate funds to The Exchange in this case derivat without actually moving the Assets in an on-chain transaction right so we work closely with these guys and the you know the market share of their rapid volume that is originating from this copper clear Loop solution now has massively increased over the past two months like this whole way to mitigate counterparty risk is on the top of every everyone's mind when I have conversations with our customers and when you actually look at the data right like the survey data like it makes sense right so this chart here is from acuty's uh crypto derivative management Insight report so what this report does it surveys the number of hedge funds Banks Brokers and asset managers and it's asked the question how have the recent events affected where you store your non-invested capital or excess margin and just as a caveat so this is actually Q3 data so this is capturing events like Luna three arrows you know lenders like block five going under it doesn't even capture the FTX but you know the results are fairly staggering but like not I mean actually not that surprising right so 50 you look at this Arrow here so 50 of participants indicate that they have reduced or significantly reduced exposure on Native derivative exchanges while only 25 indicated that they would increase exposure and again this is before FTX happened right so like since the FTX bankruptcy we'd expect these percentages to be even higher right with more access funds move moving towards you know Prime Brokers and then moving it towards Fiat currencies and we'll certainly like there's an awesome report uh by a cutie and when they release their Q4 batch we'll we'll definitely discuss this on a future episode of the podcast because I'd be very curious to see what this native derivative exchange and fiat currency uh response pool will look like you know once we have data that captures those events as well now just looking at Option markets the past week and so this is something that one of one of our big market makers uh you know spoke to you know actually Genesis you know the lack of trust around the venues it only hasn't affected crypto option markets from a volume perspective but it's also affected it from a volatility perspective right so like Bitcoin one month implied Vols are now at 50 right so this is the bottom of the three month range and we talked about this last week you know it's shocking given the potential crypto bankruptcies still looming and and you know the conversation to have clients I'm like this is this is crazy that the balls are this low right and then you know they're just like yeah they're low but who's gonna buy them right who's gonna buy them we discussed last week that the buy side take our interest is much lower in the wake of FTS and there's a much more unwillingness to kind of keep dry powder on these exchanges to take advantage of these opportunities right like I look at this it looks like a decent opportunity to buy I mean granted the realize has been awful right but you know it could be this fall could potentially be quite underpriced right eventually uh you know if some of these these skeletons do rise uh do do uh rise to the surface here the other thing I'll chime in to say on that chair as well is let's not forget the time of year in right the the incentive to take risk you know as you're coming towards the end of your year um as a as a fund manager they're kind of not there right most people squaring off the book if you've had a good year you're locking it in if you haven't you know you that the year's gone right um and you're not no one's going to give you the limits to come out swinging the bat to try and make something up towards in in the next few weeks so I kind of feel like even if you're looking at opportunities you're probably thinking about yeah yeah let's go in January with those if you're comfortable with a credit risk and and counterparty risks that you're taking on these exchanges but I kind of feel like yeah if I if I'm sat there now managing managing some money like the incentives aren't there to to sort of go you know go sort of hammering the risk and and trying to take advantage of some of this cheap bowl that we're seeing yeah I think I think that's exactly right I just think there's a lot of lethargy in the market and as I said it could potentially be a good opportunity despite the fact that real lives has come off but I think a lot I think the problem is a lot of them like the camp at risk or just don't want to add risk uh into the end of the year and potentially just burn more premium on off and you know just make performance worse so so do you think you see people starting to add risk in January and balls start to rise then could be the case it I mean but you know it depends it depends on the macro obviously and you know it depends what news we get get output between um you know then and now right like if it comes out that you know dcg is is going bankrupt or something and then the ball is absolutely rip and are at the top of the range then no people aren't going to buy them but you know if they are as low as they are now or even lower then yeah I would imagine some people are going to be dipping the toe especially at the start of the new year I tend to I tend to think um like from my experience in in the treadfire world let's get to Boomer on us here right but um you tend to find so December tends to be actually quite a busy month but because people are taking risk down right and just just closing the books and unwinding the books I think that's that process has happened now earlier because of FTX and what have you and we've seen that Joe you spoke to that last week in terms of the flows we've seen a lot of it's been taking risk off the books right so that process has run earlier so that let's let's let's take the risk down um assess our counterparty risk and and make sure we're comfortable with that um and then yeah so so I kind of feel a lot of people have shut the books now and then January yeah I do expect I do expect January we start to see commitment to real fresh positions being put on um and things will look pretty different um so yeah that's my expectation yeah that made sense and we've we've just seen the continuation of that theme this week right like we've had this drip lower in implied Vols but we're seeing it to kind of just put on you know year-end Hedges right so the biggest one was this Bitcoin December ten thousand twelve thousand put spread uh so this was bought yesterday in a total of fifteen hundred I think actually you know they could have executed another 200 or 300 lots of this I think the total size actually might be closer to 2000 but like this is kind of just like a year-end hedge like we know the customer like they've they've been unwinding a lot of all the risk managing the book until the end of the year and this is kind of just a sort of uh you know Hedge for the book in case you know some news does come out uh you know just given the drip lower in the applied Falls but then also on the other side we we've also seen unwinds of out of the money spreads which is suggesting that takers are unwinding brisk into the end of the year right like the ethereum March 1600 2100 call spread you know if this trade obviously has made any money you know June 24 25's in BTC and then the BTC March 14th 15th right so you see a lot of the unwinding of the spreads too to kind of just uh you know reduce the riskings at the end of the year but a bit of a mixed bag uh that's all from me yeah uh so I guess do you guys have any closing thoughts yeah I think my closing thought is um next week is going to be interesting um inflation report fed I think we're gonna see a little bit of action around that um and then then I think markets will go pretty quiet um I still think though we are seeing this underlying sort of shift in the macro Dynamic um and yeah we might actually see that be exaggerated um over the next few months over the next few weeks in the liquid markets as well but um yeah yeah strap yourself in I think it's gonna be an interesting week next week and then I think everyone's gonna enjoy Christmas yeah my my final thoughts quite related to that is as I mentioned the volume since you know FTX have really come down especially last week so hopefully we see start seeing some of our you know bigger customers positioning ahead ahead against ahead of this CPI event you know potentially for some fireworks um certainly I would like to see it but but who knows yeah all right I think that's it for today [Music]
