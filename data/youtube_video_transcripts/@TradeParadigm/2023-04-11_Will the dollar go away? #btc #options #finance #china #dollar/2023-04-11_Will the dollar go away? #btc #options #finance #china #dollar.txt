this D dollarization stuff is yeah like it would take decades to play out like decades and it's barely scratched the surface I think something like two percent three percent of um Global transactions are in the the Chinese one so imagine that compared to like like 70 odd percent of dollars now not saying that the influence won't Wane over time but you've got a system now that's got 17 trillion dollars of debt issued outside of the US so the first move is you have to pay that back so the more actually ironically the more that you're going to have say Brazil China doing deals in their own currencies not the US dollar you you're gonna actually have a situation where there's less dollars in the world circulating and there's um like a slower philosophy of of of that money and and the Dollar's actually going to go through the roof
