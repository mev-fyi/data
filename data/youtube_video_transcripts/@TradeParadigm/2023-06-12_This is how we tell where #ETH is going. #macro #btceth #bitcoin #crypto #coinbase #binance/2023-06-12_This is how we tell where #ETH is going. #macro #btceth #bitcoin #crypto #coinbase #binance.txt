when we're looking at the eth gamma profile this is sort of the dealer positioning of of eth we can see here this is a total profile so this is going to be all the expirations put together dealers are obviously long uh long gamma long ball so any any realized ball we get in eth is really good for dealers if I go to the next slide we can see sort of the the zoomed in version for different expirations so this is going to be the June 9th expiration we can see essentially same type same type of deal uh dealers are net long not not by the same extent you can see that y-axis is you know one million dollars per notional per one percent move if I screw that to the next one June 16th again clearly long uh 1.2 to 1.4 million and then here this is the one expiration order they're not short but it's only by 800 000 and then the biggest expiration is the quarterly contract and so you can see here they're essentially net long uh where we're at here
