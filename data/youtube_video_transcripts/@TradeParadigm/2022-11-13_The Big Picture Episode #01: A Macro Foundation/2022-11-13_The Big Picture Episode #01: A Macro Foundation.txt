foreign [Music] director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture in this series we're going to be taking a look at the world of crypto through a big picture macro lens so what other big stories in macro one of the key developments and what does that mean for crypto so let's jump straight into that so it's been a pretty pivotal couple of weeks in the world of macro the key headline story literally led by a story being that in the Wall Street Journal from the so-called fed mouthpiece Nick timuros and what Nick said in the article was that whilst the FED are expected to hike this week by 75 basis points and and we'll do just that the big conversation that's going to be had this week will be about slowing down the pace of hikes going forward and quite importantly how they're going to communicate that to the market now this isn't a pivot this isn't even a pause but what matters for markets is generally the direction of travel and particularly rates of change and it's quite clear that we're now reaching a point where we're coming to the end of this aggressive hike cycle that's killed all asset classes throughout the last year we've seen certainly in terms of the pace of hike starts to slow we've already seen that with the the RBA Reserve Bank Australia we saw last week with the Bank of Canada who hiked 50 instead of the 75 basis points that markets were expecting and we even saw I guess a slightly more dovish ECB press conference where they are a little bit softer on there therefore guidance and what's driving that I think the main thing that's driving this is now our concern starting to shift a little bit away from inflation which which does remain uncomfortably high and it is pretty sticky but we kind of started to shift a little bit of focus away from that and back towards this sharp growth slowdown that we're seeing globally and in domestic economies just last week it in the US we saw pmis manufacturing pmis and service sector pmis fall quite sharply and show those sectors being in contraction territory we even saw house prices plans the fastest level since 2009 so it's quite clear that the slowdown in the activity data from this this hiking cycle and from this this this pace of financial tightening is starting to buy quite severely policy makers are just starting to take note of that and we've even seen some of the FED big hitters in Brainard and daily they're starting just to talk a little bit more about the lagged impacts of monetary policy and also worn on the risks of over tightening so the Market's just starting to pick this up that we're we're actually about to just start to change Pace a little bit and perhaps we're reaching the end of that hike cycle and certainly we've started to see the what we call the terminal rate the the final sort of endpoint of where we think this hike cycle ends markets are just starting to reprice that a little bit that's just allowed risks to breathe a little bit easier however there's a potentially bigger story that's bubbling under the surface and and I think is potentially quite key to why we saw the risk rally we had last week and I think it's potentially a game changer for for the the sort of macrodynamic that's been driving markets up to this point and that is the story that Janet Yellen treasury secretaries being Consulting with the primary D the banks now these are primary dealers that are banks that are approved to buy government bonds directly from the government and she's been speaking slim about the liquidity in the treasury market and the stability in that market according to Bloomberg liquidity is at its worst levels since March 2020 when we're in the depths of the covid blow up so there's a concern about liquidity in that market certainly we've seen the likes of the bank of Japan who are engaged in yield curve control we saw the bank of England have to step in and support their Guild Market which at one point looked like that was gonna become quite disorderly and Janet Yellen and the treasury are growing increasingly concerned about liquidity in their own Market the treasury market is The Benchmark Market that all asset classes are priced off and if that starts to blow up then that's a game changer now the way a potential treasury buyback would work is they would issue bonds at the front end of the Curve so essentially t-bills and they'd use the cash receipts from that to then buy bonds further out the curve so that will look and feel very much like the old curve control and as we've seen be it through the bank of Japan or when the bank of England were forced to intervene in their markets your curve control tends to lead to a weaker currency which is perhaps a little bit convenient in terms of timing given that the so-called dollar wrecking ball is really starting to suffocate Global growth and we're starting to see some major asset markets really start to to look like they're about to break since we started to have this story which should say is bubbling under the surface we've seen the dollar come off quite sharply from from its highs what's particularly interesting and important about this as well is the point on liquidity liquidity is fundamental to our markets and crypto short-term Still Remains a high beta risk asset and high beta risk assets are very dependent on liquidity and the reason we've seen crypto the reason we've seen the stack and and text box get it so far this year as well as broad assets because of this withdrawal liquidity so liquidity's been tightened through a function of the strong dollar through higher interest rates with Central bank's hiking rates we've seen money supply growth collapse and we've also seen central banks pursue quantitative tightening so withdrawing the liquidity that they pumped into the system during the covid crisis liquidity is the b01 end all to these markets and that liquidity tap has been firmly turned off however with this potential treasury buyback program what this means and why this is so important it's potentially turning the liquidity hose back on here's how this process works and bear with me because this gets quite technical the Federal Reserve they have a reserve repo facility now what this facility is designed for is it's a facility whereby Banks and money market funds can park cash with them overnight they do that to put a base in yields Banks and money market funds typically invest and park their cash in short dated highly rated instruments usually t-bills and if we just for Simplicity stick with t-bills so they'll Park that money into tea bills so they know they can easily access that liquidity when they need if the demand flows t-bills outstrips the supplier then you start to see yields in those T builds full so if the yields are falling lower then that becomes counter to what the FED are trying to do in terms of raising rates so consequently they'll provide an alternative through their Reserve repo facility where effectively you can park cash and achieve a higher rate than what would be going in in the t-bill market money market funds and Banks could then earn bigger returns in in by parking their money at the FED now with this potential treasury buyback program what will be happening is you'll see the treasury issue more t-bills now the importance of this is this will start to draw the money out of the reserve repo now just for context there's over two trillion dollars worth of cash parked overnight just sat there at the fed and what potentially this program does of Treasury BuyBacks it starts to tease that money out of the Reserve repo facility and back into markets so what effectively will happen is the treasury are taking that money to fund the t-ball issuance and then using that cash to lend buyer bonds further down the curve as part of the buyback program so you start to push this this liquidity coming back into the market from Reserve repos you're pushing that liquidity back into the bond market further along the curve and you start to push people this kind of flow of liquidity starts to push investors further out the risk curve now that looks and feels very much like quantitative easing and indeed the impacts will be very similar to what we've seen in QE so it's a potentially game changer for markets that have been staffed of liquidity the potential for a treasury buyback program all of a sudden starts to turn back that fire hose liquidity it should start to see high beta risk assets perform and starts to see crypto perform even more so given its high beta correlation so it's not certain yet there's still still there's still lots to lots to go in terms of how that program is going to play out but markets that are over positioned for this lack of liquidity over position for the aggressive Titan that we're seeing a are just starting to be given a few reasons to think that a would come into the end of the tightening cycle and B we might start to see through the treasury buyback program liquidity switch back on and that's a game changer in terms of particularly given how we're positioned in markets and it's a complete shift in the macro narrative and macro Trend that has driven markets lower so far this year and I think it potentially signifies a bottom in the market and we could start to see the beginnings of a new a new bull market both for crypto and wider risk assets so we're keeping an eye on it it's there's still plenty to play out within that but um we'll keep you updated here and and we'll see how that develops thank you
