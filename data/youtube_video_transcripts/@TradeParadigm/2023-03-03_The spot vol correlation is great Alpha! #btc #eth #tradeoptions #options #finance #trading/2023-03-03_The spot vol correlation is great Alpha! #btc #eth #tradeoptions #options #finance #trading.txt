so what you see is the highs in implied Falls are corresponding with spot at the top of the range so I.E that top right part of the chart while when Vols have gotten crushed that's been happening when spot has retraced back towards you know the 23 000 uh or towards the middle of that range and I think that ball price action was was quite evident at the end of last week so we we had that uh pretty hawkish pce data BTC sells off four percent and then fixed strike implies are getting absolutely whacked across the curve all when the absolute level of implies are quite low we're trading like below 50s here the ball risk premium was not that elevated by any means and then fast forward to a couple days later we'll react we have that rally back and then that coincides with Vols moving higher so it really does seem to me like that this ball regime is quite different then in 2022
