[Music] hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hey guys welcome to the big picture my name is Joe crewing I'm a paradigm in the weeds around everything crypto wall markets joined Here Again by my colleague David Brickell and so Han sen as well as Noel Atkinson the author of The crypto is macro noun newsletter which examines the intersection between crypto and macro Landscapes so Noel was formerly head of research at coindesk in Genesis Trading uh before we begin if you could just subscribe hit that like button it really helps us as we continue to promote this Channel and provide content to you guys on a weekly basis so just to start Noel if you can quickly just introduce yourself to our viewers you know a brief overview of your background how you got to crypto and you know what you're doing with your newsletter now thanks so much Joe and I'm really glad to be here with you today especially today I mean there's so much going on a brief background condensed started out in travify did Corporate Finance equity research ended up in fund management and I left that when my son was born because I was doing Futures and options back in the days actually understood them I was not compatible with like breathing back in those days so I left that to set up an e-commerce company one of the first in Spain at the time which is where I live and was living at the time um one of the first in Spain ran that for wasn't the first it was one of the first back in the day slight parenthesis here when people wouldn't we couldn't find a logistics company that would be willing to work with us because nobody's ever going to buy anything on the internet and this was as recently as the year 2000 and they only threw in that parenthesis because it's so relevant to what we're all doing in this industry today everyone who says this is a fad it's just for speculation of be used I will never forget back in the year 2000 no one believed in e-commerce anyways carrying on I ran that for 13 years sold it then was figuring out what to do for the next career I'm interested in finance technology was doing some reading to catch up on what had been happening in the world in my absence when I wasn't paying attention kept hearing about this thing called Bitcoin watched a video on Khan Academy you remember Khan Academy back and it was a thing this was such an amazing concept actually used it as a all throughout High School like when I couldn't understand like physics con uh Concepts and things like that it's like one of the best places what did what did people do before this kind of learning age I'm telling you anyway at gbt right now you have like part Academy on steroids right so why even bother to learn really I mean right anyways um when I realized that what I was looking at was permissionless payments I got goosebumps because I grew up in Zambia in the middle of Africa and just thinking what it could do in that part of the world being able to try you know transfer value electronically without having to have a bank account or ask permission I haven't looked back since obviously it didn't end up being used for what I expected it to be used for but the more I dug into it the more I realized how hard it was going to be to get that use case up and running and also the more interesting it became you know how when things are really hard and the obstacles are really important then you actually probably on to something quite useful there so I kept digging um eventually wrote to the managing director of coindesk and gave him a list of reasons why he should hire me even though everyone was in New York except for me at the time and most of my surprise he actually did I set up the newsletters for coindesk back in 2016 I think this was I worked at coindes for five years ending up as managing director of research there and then I went to Genesis trading a couple of years ago 2021 no 2020 I don't remember 2020 was yeah 2021 because what I I care for much about markets I mean I'm here for markets I'm a total markets nerd nobody invites me to parties anymore because I am so excited about the plumbing of markets and uh because markets for me skin especially coming where I grew up markets are a tool for freedom and they're not being used as that today they should be but they're not and I see crypto as a potential tool to get markets more extended more open easy to set up and enable the transactions that allow for freedom of expression freedom of savings Freedom opportunity Etc anyways um I learned a lot about how markets work at Genesis and you know sad what happened to Genesis but I know that the trading operation is still doing really really well and I left there end of all this beginning of September last year to focus on cryptos macro now it's what I've always wanted to do focus on the big picture stuff and again especially Nano it's one of these things Joe that if you don't do it now then when when so much is changing out there and this tool that we have that we haven't had before during previous crises is actually growing in unexpected ways anyhow that was a long answer wasn't it no no it was a long answer but it was a good one and you know David yeah that that's David's like math one of his massive value ads at uh you know Paradigm is examining crypto from uh you know this macro sort of framework because it is such just a macro sensitive asset you know I'm curious about I I kind of know what David's framework is now from like reading his newsletter I'm curious like what is the framework you you're using to examine crypto from like a macro lens and I guess kind of what's your current view you know I mean obviously GDP numbers today yeah I'm gonna I'll split that into two sections and they'll try not to make it such a long answer again one is the macro influence on crypto which I know Dave is an expert at all and he and I chat about there's some types of Channel as well and it's the new types of investors that have been coming into the market for the past couple of years that bring their lens with them when I started working in crypto nobody cared what institutions were were thinking when I was assigned to cover the Institute educational Market at coindesk there was a lot of pushback from some of my colleagues I was excited because I come from that world I speak the language they're my friends I know them there's a lot of pushback from some of my colleagues at coindesk we don't need the institutions the institutions don't have a place on this Market and my point of view was we do need them for the following reason yes this is a technology that was created to circumvent the need for institutional intermediaries sure but they bring funding they bring liquidity which allows for the development of sophisticated markets which as a Market's lover is always a good thing and they bring legitimacy and protection and even more importantly if we expect crypto to end up being a retail First Market again it was born retail first it might end up retail first again who knows retail will largely invest through institutions through their Schwabs or their TD Ameritrade accounts so institutions do matter very much for crypto but another lens that I'm focusing a lot on these days and one that I'm even more excited about is how is crypto going to influence Mac quote we're starting to see that already we talked about the potential influence on how markets work on the plumbing that's the low-hanging fruit that's the easy one we know the interest in tokenization of assets is going through the roof we're seeing big Banks start to offer crypto to their clients so we know that that is already happening but it's bigger than that even it's it's markets around the world that don't exist right now it's energy policy it's a freedom to transact in Fairly authoritarian societies that is going to change economies on a local basis it's a huge it's I mean the field is opening up it's absolutely fascinating yeah I mean it's um I mean for me no I obviously we have lots of discussions it's great having like a kindred macro uh spirit um to to kind of Bounce some ideas off and and I remember when I summer first came into crypto and just getting sort of talking very much about the um you know the sort of macro side and the drivers of that um all the kind of crypto Bros um just thought I was talking rubbish but but now it's it's amazing how it's become you know a focus for everyone within the space I think obviously you know it it but there's there's a lot of focus on like the hardening cycles and and things like that but I think now there's an appreciation that um you know the the macro cycle is massive driver and influencer price and you can't you can't think about Bitcoin and crypto and um and where it's going without considering where we are in the uh in the macro cycle uh but we've we've seen what the liquidity cycle does for the prices already I mean and that is just scratching the surf and that is before the big institutional money is even here yet What's um so so obviously we had the GDP print earlier uh which was weak um although sadly the uh core PC so still remaining firm what what what's your thoughts around that first of all and also how how's that kind of feeling into your sort of bull big picture view on on sort of macro and fed where that's going and then obviously how that relates to to crypto and your your outlook for crypto that's a big question and I did say I would try to not give such long answers any adult making videos all right so break that breaking that down GDP figures out today we are so in stagflation I mean if it wasn't obvious it is really painfully obvious now and stagflation is just the worst place to be it is what the bond market most fears is what investors most fear and why is stagflation so much worse than recession it's hard to get out of speculation is when you see I'm sure your your viewers already know it's when you have tepid or negative growth even and high inflation that is so what we have now and normally recessions will bring down inflation fast which is why a recession is better than stagflation with the stagflation there's really no reason for it to come down it's going to stay high and the growth is going to stay low and that is just not good for anyone so that's um what we are seeing now I'm going to jump uh skip to what this means for crypto and then we'll come back to the FED because that's actually a separate conversation I believe um what this means for crypto it's good for Bitcoin because what do you do in stagflations you buy Commodities Bitcoin is many things one of which is a commodity so this is probably going to add yet another narrative to the already rather textured mix of Bitcoin narratives and we can come back to why the number of narratives behind Bitcoin is so key but uh on to what the FED is going to do it's in a rock and a hard place there's really not much that it can do I am in the camp that the FED can't cut rates this year it just can't so I think the Bond Market is getting it wrong I think the stock market is getting it wrong too but for different reasons I think the FED is actually I think we should listen to them when they say they are not cutting Meats this year I believe we should listen to them why do I think they can't cut races here because is not coming down anytime soon it's um there's no reason for it to consumption is still pretty high unemployment has not moved unemployment has not moved after one of the steepest hike hike um hiking campaigns uh since the 1980s and of what it hasn't moved I mean talk about lags right anyways um also consumption really hasn't come down that much either in spite of as you know eye-watering rate hikes so what will it take well what it will take is for the economy to eventually grind itself to a fairly miserable place it's going to take time the FED can't cut also for economic reasons because of the signal that would send the signal that would send is we won we beat inflation and everyone would come out and start spending again and that is just not going to help keep inflation down especially given the trends and the momentum of consumption demand especially what's happening in other jurisdictions such as China I mean they are eager to spend and they are going to keep inflation high for pretty much everyone and in terms of the FED cutting for banking crisis reasons I don't see that happening either it doesn't need to we've seen that it doesn't meet you there are many other tools it can use to ease the collateral crunch it there are other things it can do it doesn't need to cut to save the banks and there's no guarantee that we are in for a large banking crisis but I don't think we are I think the crisis is going to come from other areas I think they're in trouble for sure and I would want to be a banker today but I do think the crisis is going to come from other areas and I'll pause there because otherwise I could keep going down this path yeah I I mean the banking I mean yeah that that's quite interesting because it definitely seems like you're you're you're still bullish uh Bitcoin and crypto in general while David is also very bullish on crypto but David thinks that we're actually going to cut rates so I I kind of want to dig into that a little bit I mean David you're you're kind of in the camp um that's much more dovish right well I I am I mean whether we get rate Cuts this year I mean it looks a bit Punchy to to be expecting that uh certainly the number that the Market's pricing I think what we is still something the best part of 100 bips priced in for the affiliate year which which looks unlikely I mean I I do I I I'm a little bit more sangreneur on inflation actually in terms of I I still think you know if monetary policy act to the 12 month flag which it typically does um we we still yet to really see um you know the the theme through from from that aggressive hike cycle um so I I still kind of think inflation could fall fall pretty quickly um you mentioned employment as well like that's always obviously the last last of the shoe to drop so my expectation is over in the coming sort of a quarter or so we will see um we'll see both roast slowing very sharply we'll see unemployment pick up and we've started to see that um you know we saw those uh job openings sort of drop quite sharply um uh jobless claims is kind of sort of ticked higher we had some pretty big revisions so I kind of think the the unfolding uh will will actually um will actually maybe start to uh open and allow Some Cuts but I I kind of think it doesn't matter um like there's so much Obsession around when they cut um you know so someone someone was trying to call me out on Twitter for um you know like the pivots or car where's your pivot and I'm like the Fed Up already like like again how do you define pivot but for me like you know you've gone from from 75-bit hikes to now 25 bips and then a horse like I I don't know what you define as pivot but you know that's quite a rates of change matter and that's quite a sort of change at least in the rate of change if not the actual kind of Direction um so I kind of think that the pivots happen which which Noel if you you sort of uh follow some of my stuff was kind of underpinning my bullish for your crypto into this um I I also yeah whether we get rate Cuts in the front end I I think what's important for Bitcoin uh and crypto generally is I think if it has a long duration trade um and certainly I think that kind of you know the the lows were in refrigeration uh probably like back in the end of October November so you seemed like 10-year yields sort of peaked around I think end of October um and keep coming lower and the more that you get this kind of sticky inflation um and and the more that the FED have to just stay in there and stay with it um you might not see the movement at the front end but you got to just see like a deeper inversion um and and I'm super bullish of duration I think tenure yields will move quite quickly below three percent um and and if if I'm bullish duration then I'm bullish Tech and then I'm I'm super bullish on Old crypto which is the longest duration asset so yeah it's it's more nuanced than thinking we go get rate Cuts I think across the curve and we have to think about Curves in terms as it relates to crypto right I think we gotta continue to see um certainly the long end rates come lower as we price recession or what have you and and that will be a nice positive Tailwind for crypto um sort of throughout the rest of the year you know Dana and I agree very much on where Bitcoin is heading we slightly disagree on the drivers I don't disagree that pivot how do you define it 90 degree 90 degree turn is a quarter of a pivot 180 is just simply continuing and it's very very likely if uh it's very very likely that after a pause they'll continue raising so it's the beginning of a pivot effectively no how do you think about um because within my macro framework like two of the big things and how I think about crypto obviously rates and in liquidity is the other big thing and I I just want to get your thoughts around that um obviously we've seen I think since like since the fall of last year about a trillion dollars worth of liquidity added um you've had pboc have been pumping back Japan which is offset what the fed and ECB have done and then obviously the the FED have had to come in uh with this sort of mini banking crisis and and sort of flood liquidity again um how how are you thinking about liquidity um obviously certainly in in given what's going on in banking um and and another thing with that if that is important um which we believe it is how are you thinking about it in the context of um if we get this debt ceiling lift and then the treasury are able to to come and issue a ton of debt and then suck that liquidity out of the market is that is that a potential challenge for for Bitcoin in the coming months I was laughing because that's exactly what I was trying to figure out this morning you're doing like drawing my sketches on the liquidity goes this way and this goes this way um yeah it would the debt ceiling let's assume it is going to be lifted and that is going to mean a flood of issuance which is going to withdraw a lot of liquidity from the market what we don't know is what the conditions of that lifting of the debt ceiling will be if it's going to reduce spending then that's going to obviously withdraw even more liquidity because there'll be less money coming back into the market through government spending and that'll be a double whammy definitely not good for liquidity but liquidity is not is one of the most nuanced subjects in the entire Market there are so many drivers the U.S liquidity Outlook does not look great but now crypto's leaving the us anyways so everybody cares right you've got liquidity in Asia that is definitely easing that is going to help you have the oil price coming down I mean just this morning it's now below where it was pre-opac production Cuts so oil is probably going to continue heading downshore they can do more production Cuts actually they probably can't it's really not that easy to do production guns so oil is probably going to continue to head down that is a form of liquidity coming into the market because there's more money in your pocket that you're not spending on energy whether you're a retailer whether you're a business or whatever um dollar is probably going to be coming down as well as we get into the Slowdown and that does give holders of U.S debts some breathing room it's good for liquidity so the overall liquidity on the global level is actually not so bad I think the US is definitely going to Problem the the debt ceiling is going to be an issue perhaps a short-term hit but I don't think it's going to matter that much as you as you hinted that it's going to bitcoin has so many drivers liquidity is definitely one of them and sure we could see some short-term wobbles as we've seen over the past few days but their support for other reasons for those who believe liquidity will come you know we're past the tightening Peak for those that the lien for liquidity is irrelevant it's all about insurance with those that don't care they're just looking for a long-term store of value there's so many different things going on at the moment one thing that you mentioned Dave which I thought was interesting was employment being the last shoe to drop I agree with you and agree that we're starting to see some signs it'll be interesting to see what the next set of data is going to reveal but one thing we know for sure is that when employment when unemployment starts to rise it does so really fast really really fast you look through every single recession and the unemployment rate is you know almost vertical not quite but it goes up and no matter what the FED does if it dropped rates which I we talked about I don't think it will but even if it did it wouldn't matter unemployment moves with momentum and as the FED has reminded us many times with long and variable lags so um that is going to be what brings consumption down hopefully what I'm worried about is this is a very different labor market post-pandemic everyone's view of work has changed there's the remote working there's the wealth Gap there's age differences work the workforce is different and I don't yet know none of us will know what that will do for how unemployment reacts this time around right so it definitely seems like there's there's so many questions on the macro side and you know what that can do to uh you know crypto assets but something you mentioned in your last newsletter was the lack of volatility in the crypto Market You know despite all these questions and this is kind of something I've been grappling with too right it's like it's such an interesting phenomenon where like historically such like a volatile asset can just move so sharply in either direction we've even seen it this week right you go from like 29 7 down to 27 half then you just immediately chop right it's just so you have this move over the course of like an hour then you chop and then you chop 27 half then you have another big move up and then now we're chopping again and I want like it like do you have like a macro perspective or you know something of why this is happening like we we have an idea a little bit on the option side but it just seems very very weird to us especially considering like the pretty thin trading volumes on the spot side and you as we've seen it has this ability to kind of trigger these sharp spot moves but you don't it's not like you move sharply in One Direction and then you have these like retracements and dead cap bounces or things like that I am so very well that I wanted to ask you guys about the volatility issue because you do know so much more about this and before I lead into that question what is going on with volatility back at the beginning of the year when volatility was at its Rock Bottom low I'd never seen it that low before I assumed and I want you to tell me if I'm totally wrong here and why I assumed it was because things were just so darn uncertain the market was hurting so badly and with a high volatility unessential asset you don't need Bitcoin in your portfolios uh Traders were just stepping away and that was what no activity no volatility rather than the other way around you'd think that would mean higher volatility because prices would swing more but no I think it was just that you know Traders are out nothing's going on therefore no volatility but I've been seeing it head up and then still it's still really low although there is more activity judging from the spot figures which is why Focus all tell me please I'm asking you why is a volatility it's way below in Bitcoin well so I mean if you're looking at it from an implied volatility perspective and actually like the cost of options and why those are actually so low yes they are low but like you could make an argument that actually they're not that cheap and let me show you this um here let me just share a slide very quickly so here so this is basically the chart that is that is examining you know at the money implied Vault versus realized fall and when you kind of when you look at the cost of option right so that's you can basically look at uh the red line is a proxy that you know the implied Vault and sure like it is still fairly low but the reality is the implied Vols are low because the real lives fall as well right and because of this you know the options are just you know not that expensive and it kind of like it's kind of like this sort of like inefficiency you know potentially in the market where like you see these sharp like 10 sell-offs where you know spot goes from like 29.7 down to 27 half and then you just have these insane you know risk reward opportunities where you have the ability to purchase optionality for you know some of like the cheapest levels since you know the 2023 rally began and I I think that that's exactly what we saw right you get these sell-offs implied Vol goes lower uh and you know it's just kind of just like a screaming buy to play for a return to the 30k level from a directional perspective if you think about the options Market as you know Dita and Vault Traders right I mean obviously this is that implied minus realized junkies right so they would just look at this and say oh this is that's free money on the table there's something on the five to ten ball difference I should I should definitely be selling what I think on the other side you have you know like we have two macro experts sitting here they have different views on you know the the rate cutting cycle uh different views on you know what's going to happen on the macro side I mean with you had this level of uncertainty why would you not then go and buy a directional option that's that that's that's I guess the very simple thesis right like if you're a smart World Trader fine you look at this you're like all right this is high you know this is this of all time but if you're just a guy who buys an option puts it in his drawer forgets about it right like I don't I'm this is the best market for you right that is the best Market I guess for the marketplace in general because they're so less than this buyers right so I mean I was I was checking some stuff out today just um yeah like uh you can you could basically you know just very simple uh cool spread trades like uh you can end up making you know five times your money for um like in the next two months if spot rallies you know 15 right um so you pay a fixed premium and you get five times your money you spot value is 15 set right I was like okay I mean that that seems you know we've had that move basically you know over the last week right um yeah so it's I think I think it's a uniquely situated Market where both sides can be happy in this in this in this trade and if your options are so cheap why are people not buying them and pushing up the IV oh well I think we've reached all patents actually yeah we're gonna go Joe I think you know about this more no no go go on so on that's kind of yeah so like I mean like to me it seems like it is it is very balanced right like so even if you buy an option right like uh many people are not doing it the way you think that they should do it they're buying like call spreads or uh put spreads or like you know very not Vault intensive uh traits right um yeah just because they don't think it's gonna completely roof it right they think it's gonna rally like 15 20 25 is not gonna double right um so that that's one reason the other reason is yeah this there is the balance between the dealers who are you know who look at this child and say look I should be selling that and then there's a bunch of people who want to buy that so I think it reaches reached at equilibrium is is basically what the market is trying to tell you what would knock it off that equilibrium I am very much a range break I think that um that that's that's the one answer to always always what causes people to uh to unwind this because I mean in a rage break right if you think all dealers are generally um you know like uh position shortfall uh they're the ones who are like very quick to react in a into unwind that position and put on uh like you know unwind that position because they're generally leveraged if if you're like an investor like a long long only investor you bought an option put it in your drawer you you don't you're not gonna handbrake handbrake turn on just just because spot breaks right you might actually be quite happy with that spot Break um so I think I think a range break uh makes sense uh for Mark for the market to you know kind of uh reprice higher in the ball side yeah it makes sense was been watching the options open interest for Bitcoin Klein climb climb and yet IV not really moving I I didn't understand why so that that makes sense thanks I mean there's a couple things on that I say there are this um you know you kind you've got a lot of systematic goal setting strategies that's kind of constantly sort of weighing which again as the guys say you know if if you're if you're trying to play directional uh views then actually evolves sort of pretty cheap to express those the the other thing I was going to say is if I think about how this year's sort of played out so far when we came into January um this kind of peak Peak rates Peak inflation uh narrative was really strong and like narratives are super important for markets and everyone kind of come in obviously we had a really sort of big move in in Bitcoin particularly and and crypto broadly and everyone was kind of grabbing them for the volatility and slowing the upside because the market kind of didn't have it on and there was a really nice kind of thematic right the FED were going to pause you know we had we had like the data for December was really weak and then February come along and all the data in February for January was was really strong and and then it's like oh okay maybe maybe we're not getting the March pause maybe the fed and you know we started pricing the higher terminal rate and then that's kind of again sort of reversed a little bit in March plus overlay that with all the the sort of banking issues and and what does it mean I I think there's a lack of conviction in the market in terms of the path ahead I mean we've obviously had that discussion with a Fed car or they not cut I I think what what really starts to see Vol pick up I mean we've got this positive spot Vault correlation at the moment so it feels like the convex T is is to the upside and where we'll see Vault pick up I I think once there's a clearer path um for the FED particularly um and a clear narrative that can kind of give the green light to okay this is going to be a sustained move higher now I think that'll be the thing that you'll start to see a lot of funds come in and and play more aggressively for some of these sort of top side moves and then you start to get the momentum and the range breaks and all that sort of thing so I I kind I kind of think it's a reflection in part of a market that is kind of lacking a little bit of conviction which is why Al-Qaeda quite Buddhist because I still think we're under position generally in Risk markets because I think there's enough uncertainty at the moment uh to keeping people back from really lumping on a directional view yeah it's amazing that after a 75 gain so far this year we're still under positioned in Bitcoin that's absolutely astonishing I mean I totally agree with you totally agree with you but uh looking at the rear view mirror that is very surprising and especially when we know I'm sure we all personally know many traditional investors who Miss to Bitcoin in the last run up and I'm not going to want to have to explain to their bosses or clients why they missed the second one yeah and then and that's and that's why I think um you know we we see a lot of um so certainly when we get these sort of little sell-offs and Vol comes lower we see this um this move to kind of own own like sort of these wingy options these kind of sort of cheap out the money options um on the top side where it's like look if this thing does rip then I need to I need to have some exposure to it and I need to own it um so you kind of I mean that Joe that's been a popular trade right to to own the wings and um put those trays on Route yeah it's been a bit it's been a very popular trade I will say there has certainly been a lot less of that flow uh you know because as we were rallying kind of breaking it getting into the 2627 range we saw a lot of very big wallets starting to buy upside kind of like in the 32ks to like the you know all the way up to the 36 37 case but now that we've kind of sort of like settled into this reigning well now okay now I own this upside that is you know starting to bleed a little bit you know that being said it is fairly cut out of the money and what these wallets now are doing is they own those upside wings but then they're selling you know at the money straddling straddles and selling ball against it and that's kind of part of the reason as well you know why implied Vol is so low because you know these guys need to collect some option premium to kind of you know basically help you know Finance the one the Theta bills that they're bleeding on that upside and we always talk about on this podcast how like the crypto ball Market especially due to you know less liquidity compared to you know other markets it's just a market of complete feedback loop right so you get people that will come in and sell at the money straddles kind of like 28 29k and then it basically just stuffs dealers with long ball you know who in turn start bleeding it and then basically as spot moves around they're kind of gamma hedging these positions basically muting both moves moves in both directions so basic basically what that means is as the market is rallying they're selling spot and then as the market Falls their buying spot and given their Delta hedging uh a dynamic activity it's basically helping mute that spot action and that's part of the reason too you know why you know realize fall is so low right you have these moves up and then we're not doing anything people lose conviction they're just like damn I'm bleeding they sell the ball healer's hedge it and then it just mutes moves in both directions and I think part of the reason too why well it was like completely insane when we moved down to like 27 and a half K how low the implied Vols were like we were talking like they're like literally like in the 40s the lowest they've ever been and I think a reason for that is you know speaking to dealers that are active on Paradigm a lot of dealers are actually long a lot of downside strikes down there they they basically are getting sold those strikes either via bilateral over-the-counter trades or you know trades that are happening up aerodyne were selling them puts and then as the dealers get long puts as the market moves lower they're getting a lot longer Vol exposure and they're they're getting longer ball exposure all wild ball is not going up so they're bleeding more which kind of is another feedback loop as to why they need to continue selling and then it works the other way too like as we rally dealers are short the upside you know they're short you know the 32 face strikes 35k strikes well as you get closer to those strikes they get shorter of all they get shorter gamma they need to cover that and then it's the feedback loop the other way so that's kind of why you're seeking these weird spot of all Dynamics as of now about the institutions uh you know being involved uh one very clear like sign that the institutional because everyone tries to say institutional involvement in crypto is increasing Etc but like primarily Paradigm is an Institutional uh you know marketplace right and our market share has literally doubled from understand last year right so it's and that's basically so we've gone from about 20 of crypto options to 40 right and that is basically telling you that now it's 40 of the market is institutional right so you know that that kind of tells you um the you know it is it is happening it is actually that's a real data point that tells you the institutional participation is is larger but it can obviously be much larger right I mean um in in treadfy that number is a lot bigger and to what extent is the low volatility today keeping some Traders out I mean crypto is famous for its volatility it's been one of the magnets for those that actually look for that kind of risk to what extent is the situation today keeping Traders out why are are they waiting is that what you're seeing uh no I don't think so I think if you were a vault Trader um you definitely have some positions in this market um you know like that as an if you've ever traded options um I I would say that you are definitely you know have some kind of position uh you may not have a volatility position as you you might be long one option and then show another option as as Joe was saying like um you know it's not it's not as clear if you're like a ball Trader whether um you know you just outright buy an option you always like maybe hedge with in a short dated option or sell a spread or something like that but I I definitely feel like the the auctions Market has um you know has a like if you have a tradable I think you are involved in some form or the other um the only uh people I think who are really missing from the from the market right now because I I don't think that no level of all means there's not participation I think there's a lot of participation it's just that it's balancing right like um uh but uh yeah I mean I I'm fair to think who who who traded last year isn't trading now and I I definitely feel like it's only the people who you know suffered very large drawdowns last year you know in the in the multiple crises that we had right I mean them obviously they've lost like I guess Capital so they can't really get involved in this uh I think the the real upside is if we can convince more of the people who are like buying like long only spot to trade options because I mean honestly this level of all like they should they should be thinking about it like options is always a scary word to people but you could buy an option like this you could ask it but only news about premiums I mean if you were some of these guys like that like guys on Paradigm the guys are doing the best on Paradigm we're like the guys that were just buying outright call options when you know Bitcoin was like 18K and then you know as we had this rally they just continued to roll them sure like maybe sometimes they you know those those options expired out of the money they didn't make money but reality is on the ones they hit they were like 10 Baggers or 15 Baggers yeah yeah absolutely yeah it said yes I don't think that the lack of all is kind of I mean because it kind of Sohan said there's like you get these you have these like sort of crazy inefficiencies where like if you're just a directional Trader try to get upside exposure you have these like insane opportunities but also on the ball side as we kind of showed on that chart like there's been this kind of Fairly persistent you know implied Vault Premium versus realized Vault and people you know people love their back tests people love back testing implied volver's realized Vol and you know playing with assumptions oh if I Delta hedge you know at this frequency uh you know what these parameters like this is what I could have made and people love back testing that stuff and I feel like a lot of like the pipeline that we're seeing kind of coming out of David sohan's team maybe this is confirmation bias it kind of feels like it's all guys like looking to harvest the walrus premium via like overwriting strategies or like selling straddles like I'm pretty sure there's one literally put in the chat an hour ago where like suddenly somebody's like oh I want to sell one-day options and obviously potentially a dangerous gain but people run the back tests and people see these opportunities and want to get involved then that is so interesting because you know risk doesn't go away it just moves right and people want risk I think we we have the it it's a it's a misused word people associate it with downside whereas risk ulcer does imply good upside that's something that you would all very much understand but you know most investors still don't and certainly observers and certainly Regulators don't one one putting this back to the macro for a second and then this will come back to Fed Cuts if you like Dave if you like this one it is in a volatility in the treasury market uh off the charts in volatility in the safest asset in the market is totally off the charts because of Market structural things and the one scenario I can see the FED cutting rates this year is if we start to see serious problems in the treasury market that just cannot happen and unfortunately it is getting ever more likely through Market structural issues but also through the debt ceiling crisis and potential moves in the dollar not to mention geopolitical issues that could send it spiraling so this this volatility in the treasury market potentially influencing fed actions could feed through to the crypto Market as well because Bitcoin is the ultimate risk asset which would feed through to crypto volatility and it all melts together in a very messy but very rather beautiful tapestry yeah I mean and I think um I think was great like you know from all of our point of views is there how how asthmatic class like how integrated crypto is and and the feedback loops um from Trad Phi into crypto and then even from crypto into Trad fight um it's funny it's funny I think when I sat in a bank um Bloomberg which used to be pretty so anti-crypto and um you know would mention it now you know you see in Bitcoin and the price of Bitcoin kind of being reported with with kind of other major assets be it treasuries be it the dollar you know it's kind of equities treasuries dollar Bitcoin you know what's moving and it's kind of you know the correlations with traditional assets and they are really important so Bitcoin in itself is now kind of able to impact and and have an influence on other asset markets which which I think is super interesting and shows like the majority of this space as elastic class I guess Emma growing awareness I mean there are very few economists and macro investors that don't know what it is that some of them have nonsensical views on the asset but at least they know what it is and it's something that as you say they see on their feeds every single day yeah interesting stuff well uh no because I I guess um as we kind of look went to maybe uh wrap things up what would be um your kind of main takeaways that you'd want to leave us with are we hinted before at why Bitcoins varied narratives are a key part of its Outlook we've discussed I think the risk asset narrative here uh Bitcoin is one of the most sensitive it is the liquid asset most sensitive to changes in liquidity that's a very convoluted sentence but I think you know what I mean right of all of the risk assets that are out there in the market today Bitcoin is one of the most sensitive change in liquidity because it has no cash flows Dave you mentioned that you know you'd be long tech because of long duration but Tech has a whole lot of risks that crypto the Bitcoin just simply doesn't is God earnings versus but regulation risk it's got the discount Factor risk which again Bitcoin doesn't so it's the most sensitive on that it's pure it's a pure pure liquidity play practically one of the only ones it is also a store of value and a pure pure store value because it is the only asset Trader today in liquid markets that has a programmatic transparent verifiable hardcast even gold doesn't have that if gold's price shoots up to twenty thousand dollars then uh different types of extraction Technologies become viable we'll be mining Bitcoin uh sorry gold on asteroids and suddenly we don't know what the supply is in other words there is no Supply cap because the price will influence just how much that is real estate as well we can build Islands if we have enough money so Bitcoin is the only asset whose Supply is not affected by its price at all that makes it a good store of value over time obviously but that makes a story about it and we have the insurance asset one of the reasons I'm particularly bullish on bitcoin at the moment even though I'm not so bullish on the liquidity Outlook short term is because of banking strain while I don't think banking strain is going to lead to a flood of liquidity in the market through rates being cut or any other similar measures I do believe Bitcoin compared to the Fiat banking system represents an insurance asset and it would be crazy for investors retail institutional not to put just a tiny amount of their portfolios in something that does not depend depend on having access to your money via centralized intermediate so the diversity of narratives and I'm sure there are many others that we haven't even touched on yet the diversity of narratives lend Bitcoin resilience which other assets let's face it do not have yeah that makes total sense and those narratives just combined with the lack of spot liquidity that we have doesn't take a lot doesn't take a lot of belief or forever in this thing to to really move this Market [Music]
