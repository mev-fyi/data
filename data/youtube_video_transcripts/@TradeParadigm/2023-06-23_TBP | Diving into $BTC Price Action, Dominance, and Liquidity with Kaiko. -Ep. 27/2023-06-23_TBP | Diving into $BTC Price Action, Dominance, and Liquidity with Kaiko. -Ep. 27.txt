[Music] hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hi guys welcome to the big picture my name is Joe Crue I'm at Paradigm in the weeds around everything crypto fall markets I'm joined here by Matt Roman David Brickell as well as Clara who leads research at kaiko honestly guys they truly have some of the best research out there on crypto Market uh microstructure liquidity so definitely check out their website check out their research we'll link it in the description below we're gonna have a massive episode today but before we begin smash that like button smash that subscribe button we're here every week to give you the latest and greatest around crypto derivatives markets and Beyond uh Clark thanks so much for coming on to begin if you could quickly introduce yourself to our viewers you know give a brief overview of your background how you ended up in crypto that you're doing at kaika yeah for sure thank you guys for having me so I'm Clara I am the director of research at kaiko and I've actually been here for five years which of course is ancient in the crypto World um but I started getting interested in crypto back in 2017 so not that early about the first wave of bull market interest um and then I moved to Paris to work at kaiko kaiko is a French headquartered company or crypto data provider but we we do have Global offices we have a big presence in New York in Singapore and in London awesome awesome well again really glad to have you on to and as as I said earlier I honestly think it's some of the best research out there and I think it's timely that we're having you on it's certainly been a massive couple of weeks in terms of news flow in the crypto space you know some obviously not so good with you know the SCC complaints against you know coinbase and finance but also some really good news around you know the blackrocks BTC ETF application that you know we really think has been the main driver of the Bitcoin price action you know through the top of this descending Channel you know that I have on this chart and you know perhaps now we're finally kind of seeing back analyst that's going to kind of take us uh to fill the Gap back towards that 30k level and on on us obviously hopefully Beyond but you know for Arizona Paradigm have really kicked up in um in a big way here right we're seeing a lot more people coming back back and re-engaging the crypto option Market you know praying for these upside moves and that's especially occurring in Bitcoin you know having been in the doldrums uh yeah spot has been pretty range bound it's kind of you know Consolidated and just grinded whatever for a little bit and finally starting to see again this Resurgence of upside interest on Paradigm and you know I don't want to say that it's akin to you know q1 of this year when we saw when we had the very blistering spot rally but it's nice to finally see some of this Bitcoin flow return as Bitcoin but turns into the spot up follow-up environment as we break out of this channel so just looking at some of the prints from the from the the past few days obviously the very big one has been you know just these 40 000 calls and at the time of recording literally uh as we were jumping on there was more size going up in this outright call right before we actually hit the record button today um today being Wednesday but also you know the June 27k call being bought the August 36k and then also a bunch of call spreads you know the June 33 36 33 35s as well so kind of playing for that short term sort of upside move and you know notably you know a lot of the buyers you know of these prints have been a lot of natural take your interests that are coming back and really re-engaging the the market for the first time in months you know really since q1 of this year you know in the action at least on Paradigm in the crypto options Market has really concentrated in Bitcoin you know rather than ethereum which I think it makes sense given like the ishares narrative at play as well as you know bitcoin's relative insulation you know from regulatory action I mean I feel at this point you know Bitcoin feels pretty bulletproof so uh Claire I would really love to hear your perspective on the I share news do you think it potentially leads to this Bitcoin versus ethyl performance uh which is certainly what we've been seeing in the crypto options Market well I think we actually just looked at sort of Bitcoin dominance and specifically on U.S exchanges we saw that bitcoin's dominance has increased from 29 of spot Market volume to 44 since the start of the year so it's very clear that investors are are considering Bitcoin as sort of the ultimate Safe Haven which is what you usually see during a crypto downturn but sort of the pace of Bitcoin volume relative to all other crypto asset volume seems to be increasing um so I think that's that's a sign that I guess back to bitcoin like we typically see during these times of extreme volatility right yeah and I guess what you see in terms of you know the likelihood I mean obviously this is this is like the million dollar right when will we get this spot ETF that that actually goes through I mean oh David I'll open it up to you as well like what do you what do you guys kind of see the likelihood of this happening I mean I mean yeah it's time frames I've got no kind of insight into that um although I have seen some stuff on like social media to suggest it's a little bit more imminent than what what we're typically used to um so so that would be interesting and certainly I don't know like I've always got that kind of Spidey Sense radar up like certainly there feels like something's a foot um it's certainly curious the timing with how how quickly um you know we've had obviously uh BlackRock and and then we've had uh the talk about fidelity grayscale thing coming out um Invesco today um sort of reigniting that application so the feels to me like maybe something's going on um and I I never think these things are too coincidental and knowing the cost and the time that these things take as well it just feels interesting um yeah I I've seen some suggestions that it's it's it's kind of you know you can talk almost in weeks then then in months or years um you know who knows I've got no Insight but I I do I do think this is quite sort of significant um and actually Jay's picking up on your earlier point you know I it does feel a little bit like January to me and certainly the taker interest coming back that we're seeing um and also if I if I kind of thought of where maybe some of the positioning um was and where some of the positioning pain would have been obviously it was talk with talked at length about some of this like East over riots and what have you and any kind of people jumping on that and and that that shortfall move um the fact that we can't again just focus back on bitcoin and um that's kind of leading the charge yeah it feels January man it really does yeah yeah I mean we'll we'll see I mean I mean now we're kind of at the time of recording on this cusp of you know 29k and you know 30k that is kind of like historically been you know kind of a difficult level can break but I mean shifting gears you Claire I've really liked your guys's you know framework around examining you know crypto Market liquidity you know it's some of like but again it's some of the best stuff out there so you know some of our viewers can you give like a big summary of like what you're seeing right now you know the community being on the lows given you know the the US regulatory actions you know crypto on and off ramps being removed you know some market makers retreating from onshore exchanges and on this podcast we've talked about it before and where this low liquidity environment that we kind of have is kind of like a catalyst in itself because because the urban book depth at you know I think I actually have a good shark from from your research oh nice um right here we're gonna so liquidity the lot or lack thereof can almost be like an adolescent itself because it just doesn't take that much to move the market what do you think about that yeah so so our liquidity I guess first to Define liquidity we use order book data so kaiko collects two order book snapshots for nearly 200 000 traded instruments across a hundred exchanges so we have some of the most comprehensive order book data in the crypto data space but of course this data is massive and it's really hard to work with unless you're like a Quant so we build a really nice data set where we take Market depth it's essentially just the sum of all bids and all asks on either side of the mid price and from that at the instrument level then you can build aggregations like total Bitcoin dollar depth across all exchanges or total Bitcoin depth where you take the sum of BTC USD BTC usdt so it sort of Aggregates this immense amount of information and it gives sort of a global measure for liquidity which is what this chart shows and actually this chart Aggregates not just Bitcoin it Aggregates the top 10 crypto assets it's a new data type that we have that essentially lets you take the dollar value of liquidity for any combination of assets across every instrument in crypto markets so this is a huge amount of data and here we're looking at top 10 crypto asset the change in the one percent Market depth since the start of the year and this is all exchanges so we can see you know it's dropped we're down 20 percent as measured by market depth we're really hit with a bunch of huge and like bad events we have the banking crisis the cutoff from Payment Systems um and the regulatory Crackdown which is really scared market makers because essentially what we're looking at is Market maker activity right it looks like it's kind of you know so I pulled this from your guys's Q2 liquidity report kind of seems like we've had a decent Spike back you know over the past uh like the past week or so what's the driver of that is that kind of just you know noise in the data or was it was there kind of some something that you attribute that move to that's a good question I need to look at the exchange level information I mean overall like there's been a lot going on with binance and binance us um and so you'll have market makers sort of react to this negative news they'll remove liquidity from the exchanges and then when things settle down they'll sort of re-add it so we could be just seeing some noise in the data but I'd have to look at the exchange level information yeah it made sense and look I mean we'll tell you from the from the Paradigm perspective you know we see the consequences of this extreme low liquidity environment you know in the Delta hedging from market makers yeah when they they effectively need to rebalance their their crypto options exposure and you know you really see it by when a big option print goes through it really has the ability to move the market and you're considering the small size of the crypto of all markets I mean I think you know given given the volumes have really kind of taken a hit in this grange-found market like a billion dollars a day is like a really good day and you know it's it's pretty interesting this reflexivity of the crypto Vol markets kind of due to this lack of liquidity and when dealers need to rebalance their Deltas it really has the potential to move the markets and I think it's absolutely no coincidence that as we get this move higher we're seeing some big takers kind of come in and continue to buy more upside more upside and effectively just push dealers shorter gamma and shorter Vol which kind of issues the market higher in itself in this sort of you know reflexive feedback loop because as we've talked about on this blog cap there's just some taker balance sheets out there that just have the ability you know to dwarf those of market makers and uh it's it's kind of a nice change of pace from what we what we were discussing a couple weeks ago on the pi podcast where we have seen this massive ethereum overrider and I know Clara I know you guys have kind of you know touched upon it as well in in some of your crypto of all research but what we saw with all these big overrides was the market kind of showing this tendency to pin on strikes where you know dealers were are along a lot of gamma and mute the spot moves kind of in both directions so very very interesting uh Clara I was just going to ask um the two two interesting points sort of you brought up um in terms of what's impacted liquidity obviously we've had the regulatory uncertainty um and then also just just a pure access from Banks we've had a couple of big Banks sort of go under in March what what kind of weight do you put on those to to drivers of of uh illiquidity in terms of which has been more important is it just a pure banking access and ability to you know service those Fiat on-ramps or or is it the regulatory uncertainty oh oh okay or can we not really measure that in any any tangible way I would say for like you can measure banking access by looking sort about the Fiat trading pairs assuming that people trading the Fiat pairs are the ones that need the like dollar off ramps the Dollar on and off ramps with 24 7 access whereas when you're looking sort of at the big offshore exchanges on binance or the tether and TUSD markets where you're still relying on stable coins and maybe you can settle the day and stable coins because you're less regulated so you can sort of use that as a gauge what's interesting is we compared this U.S exchange liquidity versus offshore liquidity and we found that it's about the same so the drop in Market depth has been impacted both globally and in the US which means that maybe it's not actually the payment channels that is causing this it could be just like sort of a global downturn in um in sort of sentiment in the crypto space and like fear genuine fear about what's going on in the US on the regulatory front yeah interesting and shifting gears away from from the US where did you make of the other deep Peg that we had last week yeah so we looked into that on our inner Monday newsletter um and we found that there was a lot of selling before tether actually depeged and by Deep Peg it was very minor it was just like a fraction of a cent but still that's a big deal for a stable coin that's supposed to be pegged to the dollar we noticed that three days before there was a huge uh increase in selling pressure on bidance um and on a handful of other exchanges we measured the quantity of sell versus buy orders on the CBD and I think this is interesting because like who are these sellers no one really knows I was looking for on Twitter sort of scouring all the news sources we normally have and it Heather even then published a press release saying it was a manipulation attempt but who and why because the news that was dropped on Friday which you would expect would have sort of a bearish impact it didn't say that much different from what we've already seen these journalists reporting on when it comes to tethers Reserves yeah and look what would there ever be a significant crypto sell-off without without a tethered deep Peg and uh you'll tether uh I think it was the C the CEO came back so not on Twitter with some like pretty funny meme memes around that um but you know I I mean I I think the timing of the deep Peg is pretty interesting right I mean the SEC has gone after coinbase they've gone after binance I mean I think that Heather would kind of be a match like a next natural Target for them you know so if you're a big order of usdt and I mean there was there was a pretty decent d-peg in the uh in the curveballs as well right you know maybe de-risk uh you know sell some of your usdt and put it into usdc uh or maybe there's people out there that potentially know something that's I mean there's always a tether conspiracy when has there ever not been so like someone might know someone's maybe a large entity just decided to cash out of crypto the thing is like why would you sell tether on spot markets if you are a whale when you can just redeem them um assuming you are a whale and so that's what doesn't make sense is like because spot markets dipped and it dipped below one dollar that means they got slippage which means they weren't getting a dollar for a dollar unless the fees on Tether were higher than what they simulated for Price slippage like I'm not really sure how they did it but right yeah that makes total sense um yeah and just kind of just shifting shifting gears back into you know the Vol markets here you know it's it's pretty it's pretty interesting to see I mean if you just look at these Bitcoin ethereum spreads now I I remember there was there were a lot of Articles going going on around you know the internet when ethelium was kind of priced at a you know zero Vol premium now we're talking about ethereum at you know an eight-ball discount to bitcoin and look I think that makes sense you know given the eye shares you know BlackRock sort of narrative at play and if you look at the skew right so if you look at the BTC versus ethereum 25 Delta skew where analyze for at the money you know this actually tells a fairly interesting story here so 25 Delta skew is measuring the difference in the implied call the implied all of the calls versus the implied fall of the plants but then it's standardized for the for the revenue of at the money wall and if you see it in BTC well it's at the extreme so you know the calls are relatively expensive relative to the puts and if you look at it in ethereum it's kind of like inevitably in the sort of upper percentile the year-to-date range and of course a decent reason for that is you know it's had less of a rally you know over the past couple of days and and I think also another reason is we've kind of beaten the depth at this point in this podcast is this you know this overrider flow that's just drowning the market involved is a big reason for this you know there's a very large open open interest position in the June 1800s and I think that's part of the reason why we haven't been really able to break this level right so you know Vols are on the lows in both assets so it's you know to us it's not really all that surprising you know to see all this upper outright upside interest in BTC but also in call spreads to kind of take advantage of this elevated call scale and you know I typically I think it kind of makes sense right I mean there are no major is barely reacted at all on the negative SEC news around binance and coinbase and well spot shows a muted reaction to you know negative moves and rallies strongly on positive news like like the BlackRock news that kind of tells me that you know the paper hands at this point are potentially gone and it's now just you know long-term holders and and you know rather kind of just some accumulation mode so David and Clark I mean what's your kind of like sense of positioning here like are institutional investors like really damn like under position for a for a move if we were to to go another leg higher and whatever you think is like the continued momentum that kind of takes us to that next level through 30k it's it's interesting you say that because we just in our analyst call last night we did a chart looking at Daily volume sort of tagging the SEC lawsuits which you would expect in any other Market environment to have like a massive sell-off it targeted the world's largest exchange but you see only a tiny tiny increase in trade volume on that day um and other than that spot trade volumes are like at multi-year lows so there was pretty much no reaction at all when looking at spot markets much like how you're seeing sort of on the options front right yeah I mean I mean I I'd add to that um I mean part of the one of the things underpinning my abolitionist for most of this year is being the fact that you know I kind of felt the big the leveraging happened last year um you know there's not there's not a huge amount of you know long leverage in the system um you're kind of left with the hodlers because then anyone that was probably going to stop out they would have stopped out over the last year or so um with everything that's gone on so I kind of feel it's not the leverage in the system you know loads that are long are now hodlers um and they're not going to be puking out just over a few sort of sex scary headlines and then you've been like battered by all this like negative constant like negative um headlines so it's kind of like the what's what's the Catalyst for a big downside sell-off it's just not there which I I think partly feeds this positive uh spot volt correlation that that we've been seeing right every time spot comes off actually vaul collapses because it becomes unexcising so I I definitely don't think there's a lot of positioning and I actually think there's an asymmetric uh risk reward here in terms of the position that goes on will be to get long because people you know fomo and and uh will want to sort of get along the other thing as well is is and I kind of think you've seen this inequities and certainly in NASDAQ is often it's about um about how you manage your benchmarks and one of the things I've been saying for a lot of this year we we come out the traps flying in January and if you remember back in January you know we're still kind of you know working off The Hangover a little bit at least mentally and from a narrative perspective from December um which felt like kind of felt like end of world type scenarios right even though we'd stabilized but um but then all of a sudden we come flying out the traps we had a really quick move and guys I speak so a lot of guys missed it a lot of guys missed that move and before you know it you know bitcoin's up 70 or what have you so I think those are Benchmark to bitcoin those funds benchmarked to bitcoin a massively underperforming their Benchmark so so that underway is is gonna falsomes have to chase these moves so they were probably hoping that we were going to sort of drift back down so they could get back in and all of a sudden we're seeing a quick move again now if you're if you're Benchmark to bitcoin you can't be that far behind your benchmark and I think you're seeing that in NASDAQ and you know yeah full spying because you have to kind of re-weight towards your benchmark otherwise you're going to watch that run away from you so yeah I I think the market is hugely underpositioned um and there's going to be a lot more chasing to come so I I actually think you asked what's going to kind of you know maybe take us through some of these clearly you know big resistance levels on the way up to 30k and and certainly as we get towards the highs of the year um I I just think Force like position chasing um we probably got some shorts I'll get squeezed there's a there's a little bit of negative gamma still to probably run and chase things higher but I I think it will be those that have to just go right we have to throw the towel and chase this positioning higher because we say far behind our benchmarks yeah yeah I think that makes sense but you know that being said David I feel like so much of your argument around the bullish thesis of BTC has been around liquidity right and now we've had we've had a Fed meeting and now there's you know one or two more rate hikes priced this year which which kind of you know goes against that easy sort of liquidity thesis so I guess like what is what is your counter to that like you're pretty bearish uh over the past couple of months like are you are you changing your tune here and if you're if you are changing your tune I can't imagine it's due to the rate rate pricing yeah so I I think um a lot of what's what drives my bearish is over the last few weeks or so um was in anticipation of this liquidity drain post a debt ceiling hike um and the the treasury rebuilding the TGA balance and that massive liquidity drain so that that was that was and you know we're so tired to liquidity so that was um underpinning that bearishness what we've actually seen is the the RRP uh the reserve repo has been actually drawing down to one offset some of that treasury Assurance so the net liquidity impact's not been as big and also uh the treasury been issuing uh t-bills so um actually sorry I can hear myself back a little bit I don't know if it's Echoes to you guys uh no I'm fine okay cool um yeah so um so the other thing as well is that the treasury would be an issuing T bills so that that's that's easier to absorb and actually you know money market funds will flow into that so we're not seeing the same liquidity drain or or you know that we've feared now that's still lurking in the background so liquidity is actually ticked up and improved over the last couple of weeks um you start to see China come back to the market um there's talk of a one trillion Yuan uh liquidity program or or stimulus program um you still got the bank of Japan buying so actually Global liquidity has actually improved and then the big offset as well which actually helps liquidity is the dollars started to reverse lower as well so if you think a few weeks ago you know dollar was kind of going higher U.S rates were going higher the US rate's still a little bit bit peaky but they've kind of looked like they've stabilized and maybe heading lower again dollars come off substantially so actually the courtesy conditions have got better um and we've not seen this big liquidity drain on the TGA so I think we can kind of and those headwinds are now kind of starting to turn into a Tailwind so Global liquidity is actually picking up here Joe foreign I've had you know kind of since you know FTX and you know the increasing concerns around counterparty risk on uncentralized exchanges have you guys seemed like more demand for you know D5 data you know what are you seeing in the D5 space are you guys seeing you know more and more interest kind of going this way due to you know the increased counterparty risk or would you say maybe there was like an initial pop and it's kind of tapered off a little bit I mean I would say like honestly there hasn't been much of a change in terms of the level of Interest I think defy unfortunately was sort of swept up in all of the FTX stuff um and especially when it came to sort of like collateral and how these centralized lenders were sort of interacting with D5 protocols and there were a lot of losses and at the end of the day especially like on the D5 lending side it's only like a handful of people in crypto using them but they're whales so whales certainly use these D5 lending protocols to take out loans for trading but other than that you're not seeing much retail usage at all um and even on the deck side it's still like largely well driven especially decentralized exchanges like curve which are a very nice way to do a stable coin swap but other than that like it's not overly friendly for retail users today so on the data side though I guess that was your question because haiko still is a B2B data provider we do cater reports institutions we're getting a lot of interest on the research front specifically from additional financial institutions on D5 but I still think there's quite a ways to go before there's like this more Global adoption on um like D4 D5 volumes actually up um and certainly since all the banking issues and stuff is that a trend that we've seen um so we saw a huge spike in stable coin volumes during the banking crisis because there was like the usdcd pegging there was a usdt depending last week and the spike in volumes you see is mostly from like the three pool on curve so yeah volumes are up it's not necessarily up because there's like increased Traders it's because there's volatility in markets and Traders are reacting yeah that's interesting the the other sort of question that I had obviously a lot of focus on binance um over recent weeks in fact always but you know they're not just in the US actually in Europe as well um sort of recent news in terms of pulling the FCA application and what have you in a world where binance dominance Falls where does that flow migrate to and why have other exchanges do you think struggle to uh compete with binance um because it's still so dominant in this space honestly binance has rise like it is they are so dominant even today they're still greater than 50 of global trade volumes um despite away wave of SEC and cftc lawsuits like it almost it's almost baffling to just understand its grasp on the world of crypto um in terms of other exchanges I think that their closest competitors were based in APAC you had okx and Wabi but each of those exchange sort of made an error on focusing on APAC rather than going global whereas binance was like we are a global exchange we're not tied anywhere um and so oh okay X and Bobby they're still some of the largest exchanges but they lost a ton of market share um as China banned crypto and that was like the grave error that they all made um whereas binance did not and binance sort of blossomed after that um to say um and so I think it will be interesting to see though what happens as binance gets regulated in the U.S also in the EU they're now under investigation in France um which was supposed to be its big EU headquarters and so where are they going to go are they going to lose all of their usage in the EU you they were just kicked out of GBP deposits they just pulled out of the UK they're pulling out of Australia so it's like where else do they go if it's both the US and EU and and currently are you seeing like any particular patterns in terms of that that flow migration or or is it quite evenly dispersed across other exchanges I mean obviously we see we haven't seen that it'll struggling the big the blog narrative everyone's talking about is Hong Kong you know opening up retail trading like have you seen I I imagine it's probably a little bit too early uh you know just given you know they just opened up the ability um or I think there's only two there's two exchanges in Hong Kong that are approved allowing retail trading but like are you starting to see a little bit more of a migration there maybe those exchanges that were really focused on APAC kind of you know since that's where their DNA is and I use this as an opportunity to you know really get the Head Start there there and what do you think on that yeah I mean it's really hard to measure this stuff just because centralized exchanges are often Global and it's like the data is anonymous you don't know who's executing the trades so what we do typically is um as a proxy is we'll look at like time of day and the hourly volumes whether it's APAC hours versus Us hours or will the fiat denominated currency like USD currency pairs versus like tether currency pairs um we actually did see a slight migration towards a pack right after the first Finance cftc lawsuit but overall volumes are way lower so there's like Nuance between market share and trade volume like finances volumes have not held up as strong as other exchanges but everything's still down globally in in terms of I think you see I think it was you guys that put out like a pretty good chart on you know final day volumes really migrating from you know U.S hours into Asia hours what are like Dean hours of trading um you know of in the spot markets in crypto so the peak hour is at the exact overlap between us and EU you have like one Spike I think it's like 8 A.M EST or 9 A.M EST um and it's where EU Traders are still online U.S Traders are just waking up um then you have like sort of two hours there where it's still really high and then it sort of dips and then you have a slight Spike at APAC like morning and then but it's still lower than what you see us EU that's one other question I had I thought was um potentially quite interesting um obviously there's still lots of de-dollarization uh stories going about which we've kind of debunked on this show before um I don't believe in that story particularly but but yeah perhaps there's a slow move to to moving away from the daughter particularly as it relates to crypto and given the the U.S approached an aggressiveness towards crypto at the moment are you seeing any any kind of move away from sort of dollar stable coins um and daughter pairs um because you know database stable coins is still dominant in in crypto yeah are we seeing a migration away from that at all oh dollar stable coins they're always I think well at least for the near future there's no migration away there's a Euro stablecoin but it has like virtually no volumes um part of the reason I think that is is that there were like zero interest rates in Europe for years and so like the business model didn't really make sense for um for stablecoin issues to do issuers to do like a Euro stable coin what we did see that was interesting was dollar versus Euro denominated crypto volume on exchanges we have seen a doubling in Euro volume from 10 to 20 relative to the dollar or since last year um so it's still small it's just 20 of dollars nominated volumes and I'm pretty pretty sure it's just cracking that's sort of leading this increase Kraken has sort of weathered a lot of the market volatility over the past few months their liquidity is still pretty stable and they're very popular in the EU so I think that's probably linked to Kraken but it is interesting nonetheless okay awesome I think we're we're running out of time here but you know Clara thank you so much for coming on this was extremely uh insightful and uh to our viewers we will link uh some of their research in the description below definitely check it out definitely subscribe some of the best stuff out there so thank you so much for coming on [Music] thank you
