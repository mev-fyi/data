all right welcome to the big picture the show where we talk about micro Market structure as well as macro markets today I have with me um of course my ever-present guest David Brickell our Master resident master of macro and again for the second time we have Steve with us Steve this might become a regular thing uh if Joe keeps bailing on us because he's in the Bahamas right now having a great time while we're stuck in the office um and we also have two very special guests with us today from qcp and so I will let you guys introduce yourself Simon if you want to go first uh okay sure yeah uh so I'm head of derivatives at uh PCP uh we're on a uh on a small uh but very talented team of uh of Traders uh we Market make uh crypto options answer Paradigm of course great platform uh and onto the exchanges and uh yeah and to our uh to our Global customer base as well perfect yep uh my name is Han and um I'm one of the supposedly talented uh options Trader under assignment yeah I've been in qcp for more than three years um being an execution Trader and uh ever since Simon joined we step up on a therapeutic site start the market making and uh my focus has been all there yep perfect thank you it's nice to like actually meet you guys um so I think like today we kind of went over flows earlier this week uh and we and we released that podcast but let's if we want to um or Steve if you want to can you recap some of the the flows that we're seeing or give us a brief update and then maybe like Simon and Han can speak to that okay um yeah so you know as we as we kind of spoke about the other day um on the big picture like it was saw a ton of topside buying um you know takers being just super axed and and you know everyone kind of fomo buying and um you know kind of a Confluence of events of like CPI and as well as a spot rally and you know it was really exciting and kind of saw the return of the natural taker um I would say I've given you know this is just in the last day uh the flow's like there's been some notable closing of risk uh top side you know we saw a big block of uh these these 25k March calls uh get sold yesterday as well as um as well as some downside buying right so it's a bit of selling a bit of like a shift um in views from takers but you know it kind of as as implied Vols I've just I've just created this week um you know you know maybe we do see some riska back on um but you know that's just kind of my view and uh Curious to hear your guys thoughts on it so number one the you know the context to all of this what a what a fantastic uh start of the year right um you know big redeployment of risk it's uh we find it super encouraging after coming out of uh December and yeah so uh it's been so quiet so a little risk on the table and this massively ranging Market it was uh it was a huge relief for us to uh to see uh well number one all of these big big tickets going through right I mean in terms of um even compared to uh sort of early lot last year we're seeing um a lot more very large tickets going through um and these are clearly um clearly directional tickets you know it's uh it's it's to hedge underlying Deltas or to uh or to play specific top side but um yeah this isn't Vol book trading this is uh this is directional uh deployment of risk um but yeah I'm saying that uh after this massive rally up last last week was a reserve I'm sorry this week still um it's a little bit uh in the wrong week uh it's been a little bit frustrating right we've uh spent a lot of it uh stored at this you know 21k level uh and and all of these uh big premiums that got paid uh at the High uh starting to uh Sunny to Decay and uh yeah people could just uh just waiting for a move one way or another um it looks like uh I mean from what we see I I agree completely uh uh received that uh that there's definitely been some risk taken back off the table uh and just tracking uh how I um open interest numbers uh yeah there's definitely uh some trades that have been closed out uh out there and uh is reduced spots and yeah I think the the larger part of the risk is is still out there is still very much deployed and uh and any sort of um uh pull back on the uh on the Vols that we're seeing at the moment is going to be uh pretty short-lived especially in the uh in extreme content I I find it difficult to believe that uh that spot can yeah this doesn't feel like a uh a point of air equilibrium right the uh and it's definitely you know a very different Market to uh what we saw in December at 16k yeah this is a market that wants to see something wants to do something we just uh it's just a matter of time before we break one of these levels uh and continue the way to continue the move or retrace back to uh to 16k level and I believe you guys already covered the options Trader volume couple days ago yeah the amount of risk being put on was comparable to the lunar crash we had last year and it was quite surprising but unfortunately the big prank by the dog caused a lot of risk risk off to the market yeah and we did see a lot of uh people taking profit on their long positions but as soon as Vols start off we also had people trying to pick up the lows and continue being bullish yeah which also shows that um you know there's still a lot of capital undeployed yep and like what Simon said yeah it's not a point where we see a sports settling down it was interesting to me um like with like the doj come out the worst possible time just because we were just breaking up right we were just starting to break some levels um I mean there's some interesting like levels in ethereum that I was looking at and we kind of yeah we just broke that 1600 and and everything um was getting bit up um I think as well we saw implied Vols um uh like this week actually sort of uh trading below realize as well um so so I think we're at interesting times and in other markets as well like uh be it the dollars we're testing some interesting levels you know you've had s p at like like the 200-day moving average so it kind of feels to me that markets just want to break out um and I guess what would be disappointing now if we just kind of mean reverted but um yeah I think the doj I mean that that just seemed ridiculous um given the Fanfare they they kind of uh announced the announcement um and it kind of sort of whacked us off at some really big levels but encouraged like how well we've actually stabilized um in the market and now sort of grinding grinding back towards some of those highs and I'm just looking at ethereum here sort of sort of pushing uh 12 1600 again um so yeah it feels like you guys say it feels like uh the market wants to Once once you know something to happen um it feels as well like the market is still not got enough length on um so still wants to to sort of increase its length and looking for opportunities so yeah it was interesting actually Steve um our flows sort of late in your U.S session yesterday and saw some good deployment of topside um again so yeah so yeah yeah so yeah if yeah how hard an hour chatting about it while I was going on it was it was such a not like a huge flurry in terms of size but just you know pick you know just by buying a lot a lot of buying of wings so you know we'll we'll kind of see and you know speaking of the Ticker on it and um yeah I mean there's a chance that we rally into the FED uh coming up uh first week of February there so you know I think I think some people are getting a position I um I agree completely that um I mean I I'm I'm surprised how how robust uh BTC in particular has been you know right in the middle of the um I mean I mean this was proper fear and panic uh when we saw the um doj uh announcement of the announcement like you say um so but coming out of that yeah the S P's uh s P's dropped down so s P's looking pretty sick right um and yet uh and yeah crypto is holding up uh remarkably well uh we were all sort of set up ready for that uh big squeeze you know drop lower wash out of uh of of short-term loans um but so but the fact that actually we held up quite well even more circuits were dropping and even as we talked but it's uh it's it's put in back in a rallying back up to the highs I think uh I think it's it's looking pretty positive we are talking that's why it's railing you know Simon Everyone's Watching yet and like you know sort of volleyball like I know we talk about it but um you know if you could give some insight there yeah um I mean BTC has been trading in like 15 to 25 seven day realized War last December very boring market and it's incredible how it got pushed up to like 60 70 handle this this year and you saw that uh implied balls pushed up as well um I mean this kind of short-term movements is quite quite successful it's quite susceptible for the front end walls to move a lot just because it's driven by spot but one odd thing that we saw was the back end walls moved along with the front end and we had like um was it like 10 wall movement in my Eve June 10 uh for implied Vols over like four days which is very significant I must say uh yeah and it's that's that's the part of it right like volatility of the volatility um yeah but it's also a function of a liquidity I think that we are seeing uh quite limited liquidity in the space for the options Market compared to the amount of the resistance being put on yeah maybe Simon you want to cover more on the trading ball voice well yeah I I I I think the liquidity um um I think liquidity Point here is very important the um you know to to look on the screen and some of the spreads and volumes it looks like uh you know liquidity is uh is back and everything's fine but um but uh but the real estate of liquidity is far from you know what we saw uh let's say Prelude yeah we we have lost a significant number of market makers from the space um yeah there are and especially sort of uh voice market makers compared to uh your risk-taking market makers as opposed to you know the electronic shops so so what we're seeing is um markets looks tight but it's reacting uh much more to uh to flows and volumes than uh it did six months ago um and you know the the this is how we get these uh you know like there's a 40 volt swing in uh uh Friday BTC uh on Thursday is uh on Wednesday yeah they did that that's that's not a market that's uh that's not a market that's healthy and liquid that's still a market with so a little bit thin and struggling to uh to cover risk Wing buying past few days right yeah and it's also a way to treat the war of War like if you buy the wings and maybe sell that the Monies you do have a profile where your Vega profile increases as the wall increases yeah and the Vega profile decreases as the wall decreases yeah and that's how you trade like the ball of ball and that's why we have I mean Market saw how walls are moving and that's why they are quite big for the wings itself do you think do you think one of the things um we kind of thought into certainly throughout December um and into your end is that we had this kind of horrible um Market Dynamic whereby volatility was was just kind of bleeding lower and lower but yet we've had all these massive risks out there be it from the macro side be it from the sort of post FTX sort of Fallout and just waiting for dead bodies to come out and you kind of you're in this sort of horrible position where like no one wanted to kind of cell Vol uh but it was you know it was really sort of costing to to sort of um you were bleeding if you were trying to sort of pick any Val up do you think it helps in terms of when when given the risk we still got out there particularly from the macro when vol's then picking up like does it help in terms of almost trading the momentum of that and and bring a lot of flow back into the market because we're we've just kind of got a stars aligning moment where Val's picking up and we've got risks as well to kind of justify it what are your thoughts around that yeah I I mean that there's no doubt that as we entered the year uh evolves were uh very low I won't say cheap because you know realized is uh is even lower but um but but it it makes it very easy right if uh if you want to start the year deploy a little bit of capital and put on a bet your bullish well you can do it very cheaply just uh just by expressing that through yeah our cool option a little bit out of the money maybe you do a call spread something like that but uh but it it makes it easy to participate in uh in the rally and to get involved with our you know risking your souls um and and you know and I I and I agree completely December was just horrible right um You you it's very difficult to go short gamma you know received okay which is clearly the right thing given where I realized is but you know knowing that you've got all of this event risk are out there somewhere uh but but if you're not then uh pain thesis is just uh you know it was just some money losing game or all month so yeah we we tried to keep as uh sort of nimble as possible and uh tactical but still it's uh not a pleasant experience um I think uh wait what was surprising is um just how quickly the uh the curve steepened up again now yeah we we we had a big rally in the front ends uh and the back ends through uh you know the first week but now we're back to yeah uh some 50 volts again it's uh and and as you say pillow uh below realized uh at least uh at least for the uh Seven Day stuff so I mean it's clearly still an awful lot of front-end Supply out there and uh and I did maybe this is a bit of a sticky area for strikes I'm not sure yeah it's interesting I I kind of got in a conversation on Twitter with someone who was pointing out that um every time I think implies drifted below realized we've seen uh Bitcoin sell off uh pretty sharply and went back and looked at recent periods obviously around sort of FTX Luna what have you um now now obviously there's an element of that that is realized by its nature is backward looking I just wondered though if in this instance given that we're in this regime whereby Vault picks up when spot rallies like is that actually indicative of that actually the breakout could actually now be Bitcoin going higher uh rather than indicating that bitcoin's gonna gonna set off I mean I I guess implication was implied drifting below realized has kind of normally uh precluded a big move in spot and it's normally been lower but I just wonder if now that given that we tend to see the pickup in implies on on the break higher in spot is is this move lower um actually being driven because the realized valves picked up was spot on the upside I I don't know if this time always where I'm saying this time is different but maybe this time is different yeah interesting um the um I mean I to me it makes perfect sense that you'd see this relationship um you know where where where's all this sort of short-term Supply coming from well why do employees go below realize stories because there's a lot of modern Naturals selling there covered calls all of the vaults um uh so having implied to below realizes and is kind of a proxy measure for the amount of risk taking that's out there yeah and if the whole Market's um you know um heavily leveraged uh also well although so there are a little bit of short gamma out there it's uh it means that uh you you're probably close to a peak positioning which is the sort of trigger for uh for an unwind now I I'm not sure where the uh where the online trade is but uh but I still tend to think that you know if there's a risk is is unwinding of Longs uh and sending us lower but that doesn't I mean just from the price action over the last 48 hours it doesn't feel like um it doesn't feel like we're a Max positioning at the moment it feels like there's still people trying to get in and uh and it's the break on the top side that people be chasing yeah interested got it um so Simon had a question so so what I know you mentioned um some covered car selling what do you sort of think about the direction that um Exotics and like Structured Products businesses yeah I I think that's super exciting actually um and this is one of our main focuses for uh for 2023 you you know the um yeah it could be no surprise to anyone that uh that we expect the uh Exotics Market to uh to to develop you know so you you look at any other asset class and that's you know it's a natural path um and we think there's a lot of uh compelling reasons for uh for trading Exotics especially in in this sort of Market you know and our outlook for the year is you know uh we we don't see any massive rally at least uh you know for the next six months or so probably we're going to spend a good part of the year in ranging markets and in those sorts of markets there's a lot of value in doing yeah uh double node touches the rko's uh you know General sort of structure products which uh give users the ability to you know generate yield or you know on a lower premium base take a little bit more risk I yeah I I think it's a uh it's it's the sort of environment that's good for these uh these products uh and I expect that I expect that this is the year where it starts to kick off properly we've been talking about Exotics for a long time right the uh you know there's a lot of people sort of promoting the products there's not a whole lot going through at the moment and I think there's more chatter than there is flow at this stage um but it's quite clear that a lot of people are uh you know Keen up ready to do it so and I think the conditions are there so I expect to see things go away and you know I I and if I think about the implications of that well okay um that's surely going to uh generate more volume uh push bowls lower I I think the you know the the long long term trajectory for crypto involves is uh is lower yeah in the same way though that we've seen vol's compressed in equities FX Commodities whenever uh you know these sorts of products are introduced but it it's uh it's a long game yeah and there's a whole lot of sort of Education process and uh to be built up around that yeah I was looking at actually building um some structured product vaults some double no touch structured protocols last year but then after talking with the lawyers I decided I just it wasn't worth all the the regulatory headache and which is bailed on the project um yeah so so I saw that you guys um just dropped your or there was an article that came out where you guys were talking about your macro View and what's going on with um the fomc coming up um could maybe David actually could you give a little bit of background and then maybe you guys um Simon and Han can both give your opinions on on What's um coming in the next month or two I I so I thought this is quite an interesting chart um obviously I've had quite a bullish view coming into um coming into the year uh on on sort of macro and risk generally um which is sort of been quite controversial I think and it certainly feels like it's been the the contrarian for you but but basically sort of yes um in a nutshell the idea that throughout 2022 it was all about uh the FED hiking um inflation and we're now transitioning to this kind of peak inflation [Music] um Peak rates Peak fed narrative um we also had like such an extreme tightening of liquidity conditions um throughout 2022 and I kind of feel that some of lassies in now I know the FED is still doing uh quantitative tightening but there's just signs out there that actually liquidity is improving in the market um this chart here you've got uh G4 central bank balance sheets uh combined um so essentially China and the bank of Japan are offsetting uh what we're seeing out of out of the U.S and the ECB um so we kind of sort of got you can see uh Bank Central Bank balance sheets are started ticking up again um there's also as well and I think this was in the article as well you alluded to it um but uh in terms of the feds balance sheet on the one side of it you've got quantitative tightening which is going to sort of reduce it but then there's two other sort of quite key elements um to the FED balance sheet so they have the reverse repo um where sort of funds and banks are able to park um funds overnight with the FED um and then you've also got the treasury general account which is essentially the treasury keeping cash balances at the FED now long story short when those balances are rising this drain on liquidity and when they're folding it tends to improve liquidity now the RRP balances have been slowly falling they're above sort of two trillion at the moment but they've been falling um basically as sort of front end yields and with the FED hiking are attractive uh that money is coming out of the RRP and back into the markets and then the other interesting thing you've got is with this debt ceiling um the treasury are having to draw down on air on their cash on their TGA cash levels that they hold at the FED um rather than being able to issue debt as they hit that ceiling so again that that sort of draw down on the tgas is going to inject more liquidity into the market so I kind of actually feel liquidity conditions are improving um and then that we're also sort of moving into this what you know fed pause um and of course typically followed by Cuts whenever they come so I just feel we're in a different sort of macro Dynamics what we've been in throughout 2022 and maybe sort of markets are starting to sniff that out a little bit and certainly the inflation data has played into it um I thought Brainard was quite interesting uh last night and that she didn't really push back on on market pricing for 25 bips in in front of the pub and another 25 in March so again it looks like we're going to get a slowing down Ace of hacks to all supports um and yeah and I think the macro world looks a little bit better than it did in 2022. so so long story short I think the macro looks a lot better in in 2023 than it did in 2022 and it feels like liquidity conditions are actually easing as well and even um Financial conditions are actually ticked positive I think Justin you shared a chart earlier um sharing that as well so um yeah I think the uh the macro backdrop is more constructive for risk and for crypto yeah so if uh if maybe Han you could give us your view I know I read through um your the qcp article this morning and it seems like uh you guys were saying that basically the punters here in crypto are still driving markets higher and the and the FED needs to quash that enthusiasm right uh so yeah take it away yeah I mean the fat definitely has to um manage some of the expectations of the market that's what I think um quite tough to say whether the market will go against the fed and um like how things has been rallying to some extent yeah the financial conditions are using but it all depends on how what would be the Dot Plot In Dot Plot will be in the March fomc right I I mean yeah it's interesting like honey like the market I mean look the FED keeps sounding hawkish and they um I forget how they they phrased it in terms of they don't want to um yeah unwarranted easing um and I don't want markets from running them and I'm doing all that good work but but the market keeps ignoring them um yeah and you're seeing that in two-year yields so so yeah it's gonna be interesting because I think they're going to want to sound hulky um but yeah the market it's almost like the more they try now and particularly given how Porter data's been the less credible it feels to me in a way um and the markets looking at the data unless not really sort of listening so much to the Fed yeah I I I I I mean it it does look like uh the Market's got a little bit ahead of itself right I mean yeah fed's the ultimate master here and to uh to you know we've got what's it a one percent gap between uh expectations and the FED Zone projections um the um we think that uh yeah first of all FMC is important okay we're done sir okay so let's say we're done on 25 PPS but uh um there's there's room for surprise there uh more key though would be the uh 22nd of March one where we get our uh plots and uh and get to see their uh rape forecast I think that that'll be uh that'll be massive for the market um and it's it also like um it also overlaps with the if Shanghai right so that could be quite interesting one might see some volatility there yeah yeah I I yeah absolutely I'm surprised how much uh how much Focus there's been on you know sort of uh you know June uh contracts uh junath has been trading very actively out there but uh but in our mind uh you know the uh the real interesting stuff is going to be happening in March um oh God all right so the uh uh the March stuff I I yeah I mean in general it's um yeah it's like a lifetime already still um but uh we're we're um uh we're positioning long for the uh third of Feb uh long in terms of gamma uh options uh and uh I think that uh March uh is is good value on the curve so we're we're along that against uh short film in fact a lot of you know for the reasons we talked about Exotics and stuff like uh we showed a uh a lot of the back of it okay perfect taking notes long long march sure June let's go [Laughter] you guys uh you mentioned the um the Shanghai upgrade are you guys seeing sort of clients um sort of actively positioned for that and is it does it feel like merge type um strategies and structures that they're pulling on um um to be honest doesn't feel like kid to me um Market is just a bit more wary on putting on risk for if compared to BTC yeah I mean it's it's kind of um Market is saying that uh there could be a lot of supply and log and it could be bearish but it could also be a good news so yeah and all the focus has been on BTC so far this year so you haven't seen much big activities on Eve compared to BTC what why do you think that is sorry why do you think that is why the focus on bitcoin uh not so much so far this year I mean we saw a huge risk of last year last December and if if people were to put on the risk again should be the majors that they should be putting on before the altcoin right so I think it should be BTC driven like a BTC dominance takes place and if things really kick off then we can see uh altcoin season following although there has been some Alkaline that rally pretty aggressively before BTC rallied as well but yeah I don't I don't really see there's a proper out season yet until we see uh proper increase in the total market cap for the cryptocurrency which should be led by the Bitcoin itself yeah it's been quite interesting I think as well the last week or two the some of the moves we've had in some of the um some of the coins um because like it it feels like we can't have a sustained rally without retail getting involved um and it was interesting to maybe see signs of sort of retail sort of get involved and wanting to ape into stuff again um yeah I thought that was quite interesting yeah that's that that's definitely what we're missing the market but I I think you know because it's been broadly a sort of macro story um uh it's it's BTC that's the better way of playing uh macros so uh so that's why we're seeing all the focus there and of course it's cheap evolves yeah Heath tends to be a little bit more um uh you know story driven right it's you know it's about nfts or D5 or whatever it's uh you've got all use cases there BTC is the macro proxy so so I think it's it's worth pointing out that uh you know riskies are uh pretty positive uh what you they are at uh they are better bid for calls uh than we have seen at any point uh since the lunar collapse right the uh yeah the the I mean the full move over the last couple of weeks has been big the risk reversal move has been even bigger it's huge impact um this is a sign of a market that these are the sort of you know positive risk-avers so I pulls over we we haven't really seen that since you know you did the the this is a sign of a market that thinks there's more risk of an acceleration on the top side than any of these sort of uh big potential sell-off events that we can see right and that's and that's in the context of you know the Genesis uh chapter 11 and uh and all of these other risks so I I find it quite astounding actually that we can be you know a 20K and change uh and already the risk versus uh are pricing in an ultra bullish environment you know one one where people are more concerned about the risk of uh things going exponential uh than they are about say a return to 10K and defaults and whatever the next event is um yeah so so on the one hand that's great it's really encouraging uh but it does seem to me like uh like it's it's it's overcooked and uh a bit of fun that's been able to normalize that a little bit Simon what uh what have you been seeing in your OTC flows like what what's kind of the what's kind of feel out there from takers the uh yeah so so I I ROTC flows uh sort of overwhelming the uh sellers evolves and uh and and so far they've been kind of wary of selling into these levels um I think we can see more Supply uh kick in are you I I I I I mean one thing is so uh much shorter dated than it used to be I think that that helps explain how the uh how the curves have got so steep so quickly yeah it's um but yeah so so the flows are there but uh but a little bit more um a little bit more defensive shorter dated um yeah no one's really Keen to uh to push things out too far with this stage and what what about um like Market making on Paradigm how have you seen the competition kind of develop over the past few years I mean you know from our side right like certainly more makers um feels like kind of into into FTX like takers that kind of come down a bit right is interest sort of faded but you know how have you seen the competition oh yeah you know it it's just it's just waves all right um you know this time last year everyone wanted to be a maker you know they were you could you could point at a dozen names um yeah now there's uh there's definitely a shortage of makers out there you know liquidity is much harder to come by as uh as we sort of discussed uh earlier um for qcp we we uh we just try and be consistent we think it's very important to uh um to support the market and to sort of uh create a sustained grow Market just need to be in there you know and and we are you know all day all night 24 7. but um but really really we the key thing is we you know we're making prices and you know we're not running away when uh when you see a little bit of uh you know a little bit of action you know a bit of risk uh we want to be supporting it all the way through absolutely cool David final thought Yeah final thought you know what I'm just looking at my screens here just watching the E just kind of grind grind higher um I'm hoping it's going to give us uh another interesting weekend like we had the other weekend um where we get some sort of gamma chasing and uh a little bit of fomo so yeah I I still um I still think price action looks like quite constructive um in spot um and it's kind of supported as you're saying Simon in terms of the sort of flows to to put on top side um and and yeah I I still think um into the FED we've probably got a week or two of of you know risk trading pretty well as we kind of play this sort of pause narrative um breaks coming a bit lower so yeah still constructive um I imagine then as we get into the fed you know end of Jan things go a little bit quieter some some money gets taken off the table but yeah it feels like people still um haven't got the length that they want in this market and and are looking to to deploy some Capital so yeah I think that's constructive for our Market over the next couple of weeks at least well uh thank you guys for coming on taking the time to talk with us I have to get off this call and go your solo some uh some use calls
