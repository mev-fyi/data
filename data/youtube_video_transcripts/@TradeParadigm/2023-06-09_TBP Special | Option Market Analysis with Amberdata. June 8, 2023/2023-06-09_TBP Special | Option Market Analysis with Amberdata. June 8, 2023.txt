[Music] hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hi guys this is the start of a new segment of the big picture that we're going to be doing with our partner analyst Greg from Amber data so Greg's been on the channel a few times now and his episode from a few weeks ago which we will definitely link in the description below was so well received that we have asked him to come on more regularly and go through some additional crypto ball analysis so very excited to have Greg doing this for everyone it's it's a great partnership um between our firms you know he's one of the best in the business around crypto ball analysis founding Genesis volatility design specific typically for this sort of analysis that you are going to be seeing today and then subsequently merging with Amber data but before we begin smash that like hit that subscribe Button as we continue to deliver you the best some of the best content in crypto derivatives Greg want to take it away yeah thanks so much for that intro Joe I really appreciate it of course man of course cool so uh as we're recording this we had uh the SEC coming after binance couple days ago and then coming after coinbase so it's been a busy week we've had like the lowest ball regime in a long time and this has gave us a little bit of a pop so now I kind of want to just look at some dealer positioning to see you know how how are they going to be hedging these flows what what's going on so I'm starting with eth because eth dealer positioning is like so clear yeah strong options right now and so any ball for each dealers or option dealers is just nothing but good for them so well let's just see like what this looks like so this is the total gamma profile so just kind of a little bit of a background real quick uh at Amber data derivatives what we've done is we've created a set of rules to analyze flow appropriately so if we look at every times and sales trade uh and we take every instrument back to Inception and when we look at a trade we marry that data with a level one order book so we can see the best bid best ask size fall prices all that stuff right before the trade like milliseconds before the trade milliseconds after the trade and then we have a bunch of different rules to get the true aggressor so like here's a simple rule you know someone uh lifts the offer for a two lot and then the offer decrements from pre to post trade and you can you can see okay someone you know it's paid to spread and lifted the offer that's kind of easy well right 30 different rules to get the true direction we put that into a matrix we score everything and then we get the probable direction we assume that dealers are passive and then the aggressors are sort of like the street essentially yeah that makes that makes a lot of sense because like I mean hell I saw it a ton inequity derivatives where things would trade so tight especially spreads where market makers are like oh I'm gonna lock one leg at Mid and then make like a bid offer on the other where it's just like the directions are just like constantly Incorrect and you even you even do see this a little bit in crypto so kind of this methodology to kind of refine that and make it better is you know that's that's next level stuff foreign love it so so then what we've done here is we get a good idea of the dealer positioning and so we can essentially see how the gamma profile is going to change uh for dealers so when we're looking at the eth gamma profile this is sort of the dealer positioning of of eth um we can see here this is the total profile so this is going to be all the expirations put together dealers are obviously long uh long gamma long ball so any any realized model we get in eth is is really good for dealers if I go to the next slide we can see sort of the the zoomed in version for different expirations so this is going to be the June 9th expiration we can see essentially same type same type of deal uh dealers are net long not not by the same extent you can see the y-axis is you know one million dollars per notional per one percent move if I scroll down to the next one June 16th again clearly long uh 1.2 to 1.4 million and then here this is the one expiration under their net short but it's only by 800 000. and then the biggest expiration is the quarterly contract and so you can see here they're essentially net long uh where we're at here unless we get above sort of call it 2100 and then the gamma is is six million so so essentially you know that realized from all dealers are positioned for that there's been just a ton of uh Supply coming online still so if I look at the term structure richness chart this is one of my favorite charts you know a reading of 1.0 is a perfectly flat term structure we have a catalyst for a pop for the term structure to go flat to slight backwardation a couple days ago you know the binance news the coindesk news all that stuff so to me to me what we're the way that I'm thinking about it is like we had we have a reason for a pop uh but the way that the market is structured right now in the short term here I'm kind of thinking nothing happens still like so so when that term so when this line goes down that means the term structure is going you know flatter in more into backwardation is is that correct or is it the other way around the other way around it's like a reading a 1.0 is perfectly flat I read one is evaporated term structure not it and then uh below one is a is a contango term structure cool great clarification thank you yeah definitely definitely um so my thinking is like okay we gotta pop this is kind of like selling to the pot because right now the inventory uh of short-term options for dealers like they're they're stuck with it so they're probably gonna try to cover some some volumes dude I don't know like things are caught past couple days things are starting to look pretty interesting so you know the I think there's kind of this sort of like interesting changing Dynamic going into the especially the June quarterly expiry over the past few days and you know this large overrider that we've mentioned that was you know short a boatload of these June 1800s the 2000s you know that had previously loaded the street with gamma you know dealers who are the dealers who got along this override have just been stuffed with this strike and puking it on Paradigm absolutely puking it out like as a data point so the net taker Vega sold on Paradigm of the June 1800 uh strike is over 200 000 which is by far the largest absolute amount of Vegas sold on Paradigm of a given strike you know Market maker and it's just the market makers who put over put up this over right acting as a taker and selling it back out on Paradigm but now something very interesting is happening and what that is is this overrider that is previously stuffed the street with these June strikes is now beginning to cover these strikes in the past three years or sorry in the past three days they've bought back over a hundred thousand contracts of the June 1800 to 2000 calls in the lifting dealers out of this long gamma so it's starting to create this interesting Dynamic the June expert if you know hell if this overrider continues to cover this June short and you know they've kind of showed their hand they still have a lot outstanding you know if this trend continues you know and we don't see that much incremental supply of all just given the absolute level evolves I mean we all know what eat fall is capable of right I don't want to hear about this low trailing realize nonsense you know then there is this potential for you know the front end to Jack higher into the expiry and you know potentially see some decent realized moves interesting so when I've looked at the flow I've still seen buyback of June but then roll out to further expirations I've still seen that flow have you not been seeing that so it's just an extension of of essentially right but like this is getting this is getting extended out to like March you know in in sep right you know the June is going to have a lot more gamma and then and then I gotta think about the spot of all correlation so like let's say someone's buying back June well this is going to be upside ball and right now it's not coming from upside mall like the the reasons we have a term structure pop is because of Finance is because of coinbase those are like downside catalysts for Vol and the Market's holding pretty nicely like it was enough it was enough of a surprise to pop the term structure into contango uh I mean excuse me into backwardation and create some sort of demand for gamma I just think it's one of those things like you just sell the pop I I I personally think like the short-term stuff I still like ethol longer longer longer down the term structure because I think it's too unpredictable to see what happens right but in terms of kind of if I look at all these expirations shorter term expirations to me it still looks like dealers are pretty long uh gamma and I just think like time passes that the shock event has kind of yeah no and I I would yeah I would tend to agree with that and we've only started the seed like the beginning of the covering but we still have two weeks you know two or two and a half weeks until June right and you know this is the main guy that is supplying you know all this June gamma to the dealer so if he starts lifting this stuff out I mean I'll tell you like all the block makers on Paradigm that that we speak to like the main conversation is like how much do they have left to cover how much June how much June how much June is left right so it's it's certainly on the top of mind and and look maybe it's wishful thinking maybe I just want some upside real last ball because then we've been stuck in this range-bound market in this this entire time but we'll see yeah very interesting if we go to the realized side so here's kind of what I'm looking at the real life side I mean we're still kind of this like 38 40 kind of zone for seven day realized like the big move this is so if I look up here to the top left so I'm just looking at the past week of hourly realized in annualized terms so sort of the big move was kind of call it 70 Vol for an hour and then that was pretty much that was like that was the event it was 70 and 65 ball everything else kind of back to the mid 30s is kind of what it looks like so like to me like we need to see realized wall to justify gamma levels obviously we have a little bit of a variance risk premium lower lower right chart compression but like assuming that Duval events pass like that stuff will roll off and then we'll go back down to like the the lower real eyes I just think front end of the term structure like I don't know like you need you need something to happen there and if nothing happens like that thing is just going to be overpriced yeah yeah fair enough and I mean we'll see what happens next week I mean next week's a big week I think CPI and you know fomc so you know against maybe there's traditional thinking I mean I just I just want some action so those are real catalysts no no not out uh look at that Bitcoin so bitcoin's a little bit of a different story so the dealer profile dealers are looking good on a lower lower move in Bitcoin um and this is the upper move that they're not looking good based on on our profiles if I break into the different uh profiles like the shorter dated stuff so we could see basically short this June 9th expiration again same type of profile here for the 16th the 23rd uh is the inverse and then the 30th the quarterly expiration is really sort of the same profile so basically dealers would like a move lower and then would not like a move higher and so that'll be interesting I mean if we get like a crazy weird CPI print we could see Bitcoin Rally or at weird flomc thing fomc to me when I was look sorry do you have anything you want to say on this um yeah I mean so I mean I look at this it kind of just feels like dealers are to kind of long this buy put cell call risk reversal you know what I mean like it's certainly indicative of the flows we're seeing on Paradigm where it's just like all the downside flows are just dealers trying to sell but then when you kind of have that tactical buyer especially just given the absolute levels of all like you know just looking for a return to like the top of the range you know not even like breakout sort of call strikes you know I'm talking like 29k sort of stuff and dealers even better like nope man I don't really don't really want to touch it uh so yeah it's interesting um that's cool you guys are seeing the same types of flows yeah kind of from the macro standpoint CPI can do anything I don't really follow I mean I look at CPI but I'm not an expert on deciphering what the next CPI print is going to be fomc I mean sort of the whisper is that the FED is gonna do a uh not a pause but a skip so they're gonna do a rate skip so basically it is being wait and see mode so assuming that they are in wait and see mode that event going by is just like vulk Rush Event um so that'll be interesting um what can we get like what can get us to Rally back into this negative gamma Zone like past 30k you know and we're not I assume we're not going to get like fomc cut or anything like that or like the the guidance is probably still going to be in this way in C mode so I don't expect anything there CPI could that be something maybe um I think most likely though what we're seeing here is the the ball is coming from downside right now based off finance and coinbase that's good for dealers um and so what's going to get us higher I'm not sure um so that's kind of how I'm seeing it I don't know if my opinions there yeah I mean like it's crazy just like the amount of bad news that we've had like I mean you didn't say this year but like over the past week and just like each new event is just like you know less and less impactful in terms of like downside you know sort of spot action and I think for the coinbase case that kind of you know makes sense you know there's not like criminal charges being uh you know thrown at here and the coinbase is much more around the conversation is it a security or not right you like look that I think base case this is probably just going to end in you know some sort of fine and it's kind of just going to be business as usual um you know and potentially it's something where we actually get some regulatory Clarity right so I I think it kind of makes sense that we you know binance took us lower coinbase kind of took it took us back right um you know in terms of upside catalysts you know it's I don't know it's tough to to really see him I know a lot of people were kind of like pointing at like you know the Asia Hong Kong news and you know them green lighting the retail trading but that's just it's just such a long you know medium term to long-term narrative right like there's only two exchanges I think like hash key and OSL that have like the approved applications out there so I don't know uh you know it could be status quo of kind of sticking in this range yeah yeah it's interesting it was pretty cool to see like crypto holder levels pretty nicely going into that binance and coinbase news and yeah to your point like sounds like coinbase is just a staking issue um and so we'll see what that looks like um staking insecurities but not like a criminal thing and then Finance I don't know like could that really be you know funds are not safu I'm not sure about that that would be that would be a bad Catalyst for sure right well right uh in terms of term structure you know same type of pop in Bitcoin so we just had to pop to slight backwardation now we're kind of flatish um let's see what happens you know post next week uh that I think probably gets smashed again and then here we got a a crush in the variance for premium lower right so you know it's kind of kind of near parity um we'll have to keep up realized walls to keep that up though so you know once that event kind of falls out of the calculation window without another event we're going back down towards the 30 level right and then the move in Bitcoin was a little bit higher so we'd have a peek out at 80 annualized Vol over the week um whereas eth was 70 uh but again that that was only a couple hours and then after that we're back towards you know mid 30s low like 40 low 40s right I mean damn I mean it's just crazy how low realized ball is now for this asset class yeah it is interesting it's very interesting and if you look at the macro I mean like the macro ball or like equities fall that's also that made lows below pandemic event so since April 2020 the vix is finally below those levels and that started in these past week and a half so that's kind of interesting like that the the vix fall regime is headed lower ball is usually correlated between asset classes like if things are going crazy in one thing it's because they're going crazy all over the place you know so that's yeah but here it's just like I mean this is crypto and we're talking about like a 30 realized Vol handle for you know BTC like do you do you think it's like this kind of just like sense of apathy everybody's talked about like how low the liquidity levels is and you know the order book depth um you know in the spot Market you know just due to you know what has happened with banking payment rails and you know what's happened with with jump and Jane Street kind of pulling back right you know you would you would kind of think you know less less liquidity in those at the top of the order book would kind of you know exacerbate those moves in both directions but it's just not happening which kind of just tells me yep at this point there's just a lot of apathy in the market yeah yeah that's a that's a great point I mean I I still like the the long end long East like to me that's that's kind of like the wild card um and then financing it with the short end is kind of how I'm still thinking about it I think right while clusters we've had like two catalysts to move all it didn't really move all it flatness term structure so that's kind of how I'm thinking about it but yeah I totally agree with you like this is definitely a low ball regime right and it doesn't it doesn't help that this this overrider sold 400k of March Vega you know literally like two days ago it's like the biggest trade I've ever seen in crypto ball it's amazing um okay yeah should we should we leave it there yeah that's perfect [Music]
