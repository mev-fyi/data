[Music] hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hi guys welcome to the big picture I Am David Brickell director of institutional sales at Paradigm and Resident macro man um no joke crew with us today but I'm joined by my regular co-host Sohan and I'm also honored and privileged uh to be joined by Nikita fadiv a partner and PM fasanara digital Nikita welcome thanks for joining us of course thank you very much for having me really excited to be here yeah no great to have you on we've wanted to set this up for a while um perhaps we can just kick off uh do you want to tell us a little bit about about yourself your background and and how you sort of built things out Fastenal digital I mean for those of our listeners that don't know fastenara one of the uh biggest liquidity providers in crypto say um really interested to hear your story Nikita sure sure um so my story is I guess uh first time long at the same time uh so um I joined crypto space in 2016 uh was a junior doing that uh and stumbled upon this I think Bitcoin I immediately resonated with me the the volatility and some marketing inefficiencies uh once I started digging a little bit deeper um so I created the team who started building strategies and that was fun um we've seen some some tractions without uh why don't we try to pursue it uh full-time so graduated and so there was a really nice opportunity at fasanara where we joined forces we get a lot of freedom to do what we wanted and and a lot of support um so we joined 2018 uh straight after graduation just me and a couple of other guys and started building I and I would say like um we'll be in through the whole cycle from uh just yeah doing everything by Hands On One exchange starting off with bitmax and then over the years really uh taking it quite seriously and it's a building um a lot of infrastructure a lot of Technology a lot of sophistication across every single beat of the trade Set uh trade uh life cycle um and CI was a lot of fun and so fast forward we're trading on all the main exchanges and yeah quite quite active uh on the on the liquidity provision front uh but also I'm doing a little bit of venture investing yeah interesting I mean on on the liquidity division side um I mean that can take sort of many kind of forms I mean do you want to give us a little bit more color in terms of the sort of strategies that you run and how you look to make money and and find your Edge in this market for uh yeah I guess I won't go into too much details but I just uh to paint the picture um so um in crypto obviously uh the market is is quite volatile um but uh liquidity is quite fractured uh so there are primary destinations uh for um for the flow out to go to but uh at the same time there are you know tier two tier three exchanges uh which also you know see a decent chunk uh and effectively if you if you look at all of the liquidity that's out there um what uh we do and so what other Market participants are trying to achieve is to glue the brushes together and crypto tells a lot of um specific I would say a differences how to thread five um in particular um that well Market is quite volatile and as a consequence um you need to have a lot of collateral and so sometimes you know you need to move things around which takes time or you don't have the inventory in the first place to which again prevents you from just seizing the full opportunity to do yourself but more than that there are all sorts of you know constraints and risks around well credit risk of exchanges so that's kind of uh constrain some of these opportunities uh and it's really you know provides them to be seized by you know one or two big players and opens the door for a more democratic Market um and some kind of our function is to really look around and ask and answer the question what is cheap what's expensive and try to close the glue those two things together and kind of once um and how do you answer that question that's where the game really begins I guess yes it's interesting it's it's interesting um I know we've spoken before um like we've launched obviously recently on Paradigm by bit spreads um where you can trade uh sort of spot Perpetual on a one-click spread um which is kind of like a new a new liquidity opportunity um for for makers for hfts um and and also for um you know for funds that are just looking to pull on spreads and play sort of Cash and Carry type trades um how do you go about like assessing an opportunity like that and I guess sort of broadly and generally um the kind of you know you know so many different liquidity pools that you could sort of play in sort of one of the factors that you consider when you when you decide right this is where we're going to sort of put some resource and start start looking to be a liquidity provider in in this market versus versus another yeah I mean this um really really important question to answer right and that's uh where we spend a lot of time thinking uh how to answer it but also how to frame our mind um so you kind of want to make a prediction almost like hypothesis um utilizing a lot of you know historical data which could actually be data but more so also just your track record of making a good decisions uh and so you're kind of you know evaluating each um each opportunity and kind of thinking what's the time that I need to allocate what's the resources that I need to put forward and then you gotta think is it you know an opportunity that's going to go away you know tomorrow or you know in a short while or is it some uh you know investment upfront investment that's probably going to keep on yielding some results uh you know in the future and what we've seen um a lot is that many of these things especially um those that are a bit of you know hype cycle where are the projects or the platforms or you know things that I just emerged although there is you know sometimes a benefit to be the first mover but oftentimes there is not much and so you would rather maybe you know lose you know six months 12 months on some new emerging or whatever thing which usually still would be the pretty small uh size uh in favor of you know those things that already may be you invested a bunch of time and but still haven't got to the point of Dimension returns where you know the inbox versus time um kind of flattens out so it's kind of a bit of science a bit of art of how you evaluate all those things but it starts from you know really radical self-awareness and you know really you know meticulous resource allocation which again is like everyone wants to be there but it's in practice it's pretty hard uh but that's roughly you know a few pointers um so you kind of tried you know in dollar terms evaluate type was the size of the buy and how that buy can grow and so because like you know should I do it today or you know maybe in a month or maybe never yeah yeah it's kind of interesting yeah I mean it is I mean like to me I think the the market is you know the the this trading strategies which make money have really changed since 2018 right now because back then it was just mid Max with the with the with the pubs Etc um then you have later D5 coming in uh and now like you know there's uh you know people really concerned about C by credit risk like how do you think the strategies like can you give us a brief idea of the evolution of the trading strategies on um you know on on your site yeah I mean I can just roughly talk about you know what was what people have been doing right um and um I think kind of give a couple of ideas of where I think it is going to go so obviously there has been you know price components uh that people were speculating up down uh on any of the time frames so as long as Market takes uh this will be part of it um and uh that's not something that we do really like what we try to do is be you know delta neutral and workhouse the risk for very very short amount of time um but effectively you know what what kicked off in 2018 and you know perhaps even before that but not in in any meaningful size and that plant perhaps you know 2021 end of it and maybe a little bit you know a few few months and twice 22 uh it was uh yeah just you know bye by sports or the verb also finally rates were like you know pretty consistent and um this was just uh mismatch in availability of dollars so liquidity wasn't there so people were um really you know happy to pay uh the the funding cost which sometimes were playing ten percent annualized on on majors and much more on out uh to just acquire the exposure quick enough you can obviously do it through spawn but then um yeah liquidity is much worse and not not everyone wears it up or will be ever set up to just do it well and so I feel like there was a Natural Evolution where a lot of people said like okay we can give you know directional returns and not perform Bitcoin either or you know just give Bitcoin like returns at half the wall or whatever they're in a sale pitch was and there were a lot of guys that you know similarly to us and that's uh well Market is fractured um there will be grows because of ABC in the space as long as you know the buy keeps on growing uh and there is a lot of volatility a lot of you know inefficiencies um then there is a lot to do on the market neutral front where you actually just kind of feel correlated maybe to volatility and like uh whatever you know sentiment proxy which appetite for the you know risk assets uh and but effectively like those those things tapered off um you know uh in 2022 and big time because I think a lot of the random participants and just lost a lot of money and kind of exited and so I think like for the market mutual funds it's actually a pretty difficult environment um because well um they're being fired against uh Bitcoin and so on and it's like um it's unfair um but also you know when the rates are you know quite high it's also difficult I think going forward it will be much more of you actually need to build a lot of technology and actually building also smart stuff uh to you know keep on scaling and keep on you know attracting interest from the investors rather than uh oh yeah I assure the burps and you know maybe turn it around once per month yeah I mean it's kind of interesting actually um I I don't think I've ever told you this but like when I first uh today that uh like basically in 2018 2019 um people used to come to me and say look you can make 30 free right like uh you know in in crypto right I was like oh that seems that seems awesome as a treadfy guy uh and then you took the real DJs and they're like well you're trying to make you know 30 you know 30 I've tried to say make 30X right so of course I'm gonna willing to pay that 30 cost on on purpose right um I I think the the market is also like um you know it's it's as you said it's changed a little bit it's maybe become more efficient right like because a lot of uh you know Excel players are looking at and being like well this is free and this is you know maybe risky so why don't I why did I just get involved so that's compressed quite a significantly um what do you think about the fact that you know like if you talk about basis in particular like the basis positive it's a very clean trade like you buy Spot you sell perp right and then you make your 30 uh return or 20 or whatever it is uh what about like in 22 when a lot of the time the rates were negative like what what are the trading strategies that you guys use at that time well I mean um there there is still you know plenty to do right so um you just want to keep on um buying low selling High um on the you know micro second kind of time frame uh or sorry millisecond time frame um and so you know prices get dislocated you know all the time um so you can you know come in and pocket that but naturally this is not you know a game that is open enough for anyone out there to play because it's very much you know technological uh heavy uh infrastructure heavy uh well and yeah research intensive uh and that's kind of more in a in a domain of Prop Shops but yeah I mean um that's why I think a lot of them um Market initial funds struggle the bunch and the investors travel the bunch uh it in crypto in 2022 there was still you know a bunch of stuff to do but you kind of need to be good enough to see those opportunities uh it's a analogy that I'm always trying to uh to draw is that um kind of you started off um you know just crash there right you look at maybe you know one exchange so you're like okay I can you know short the verb and buy the future um and maybe you know I I basically get do like fixed versus variable and I keep it to maturity and maybe roll and maybe you know not expected 30 years you know two three percent something like that maybe can never up but it's all within the same exchange so it's kind of delta neutral within same exchange um but then it's like okay uh execution is probably not great but I do it quite rarely and then you kind of progress and you're like okay Mike he's a better maybe I'm looking at more exchanges maybe uh I'm better you know at executing using some others and so maybe like you actually see more opportunities maybe you can push more size there maybe you can trade in and out more active really and then you kind of go further further further are you you get becoming a good latency or become good at you know at all the fees all the setups and so on and then you kind of see opportunities all day every day uh in quite big size but then it's kind of obviously um that's for the best guys and you kind of you know then there is a tale of people that just don't see any of it uh but that's kind of my construction um so it's kind of you know it's been good and bad here just really depends on like uh who you are um but yeah I think like on the fun side because being quite turbulent I think a lot of them are kind of Reinventing themselves to circumstance yeah to um obviously a lot of stuff that you're doing is in the C5 space um are you looking at D5 tools is that is that something that you're able to look at and um and what are your thoughts around that yeah I remember what we did um I think it's it's fascinating space um and yeah it's everything has a trade-off right uh and so um I think it's uh part of it you know exploration uh and the other part of this exploitation and and there to me um say Atomic swaps this is you know purest example of when it takes all um but it doesn't have to be always the same winner if that makes sense so you could look at a lot of you know isoteric stuff you know different uh protocols different ideas um different implementation different chains um different coins so there is like a bunch of stuff that you could do um to kind of still you know find the niche and so on but that's kind of more suited for you know a couple of guys uh doing it you know in prop capacity uh and it's not really you know offering this as a you know investment because you don't really need like add any money for it it's like as long as you pay you know for the first a few transactions in gas then you always kind of come back with more than you started with um but then obviously there is always a quite fat tail uh if you get hacked or there is no somebody else exploits you and and so on and so on so it's kind of atomic swaps really really fascinating um and there are like numbers where which are quite impressive that people able to pull off but I think that's like crazy crazy specialized and um that's not really you know um set up well for you know for hedge funds at the bean um that's again more like individuals uh here and there um and so yeah some other you know Define strategies there is a bunch again it's like you need to find your own Niche and then are you doing it you know um in a market neutral way or you're happy to take some risk which risks and so on and so on so the recycle by now are quite large um my drinks are of all possible stations of you know of risk tolerance versus you know reward that you can achieve with it and some other parameters of the strategy uh but Baseline I think um D5 is very very attractive and it's uh there are certainly many examples of people that invested a lot in the infrastructure and that paid off well but again I feel like that's not really open to many participants you need to be like actually really good at it to have a chance yeah sure it's um it's one of those spaces that we we kind of all kind of think that naturally will progress to and certainly from an Institutional side we'd like to see really explode but um obviously still sort of got its challenges I guess um that's kind of limiting that but um yes slowly slowly then suddenly I guess yeah yeah I think that that's kind of fish that probably tried this there are some spikes of hope uh here and there um and certainly you know some numbers are really attractive um you know in terms of you know bees volumes or on Junior swap which are you know oftentimes are higher than coinbase or you know dydfs or GMS uh that kind of stuff only The Lending market so there is like a lot of interesting things going on there uh but then what is kind of a bit uh not frustrating but uh a bit disappointing is that the sheer quantity of users is actually pretty much always very small so if you look at you know dydx for example I've run out to many takers out there uh it's like an order a few thousand people uh voluminous is pretty decent but it's again it's like heavy but heavily concentrated uh in like you know top 20 top 30 which again generalizes very well to our other you know CFI exchanges um and you know same way with Union swap a lot of it is done you know by you know a few few firms um so it's again very concentrated but at least you know Baseline that's there is a lot of liquidity a lot of activity in um but yeah I think we need to progress quite a bit more in terms of ease of operating there and a lot more people just getting uh happy with um with the risks and potentially you know better Solutions around risk management I have to just really you know I have a better take off from there yeah sure um I mean I guess thinking about risk management as well um A lot's changed in a in a post FTX World um how how you kind of seeing the institutional space in a post FTX world and and how have you guys as well had to kind of adapt to that um what sort of change have you had to make um since since FTX blowing up yeah I think um I think it's um there were a lot of a lot of thoughts a lot of work to just get more comfortable with uh was the exchanges that were facing uh and served there are a lot of really nice of exchange solutions that are coming along uh that we are quite excited about uh so we're kind of helping to drive that uh effort um but yeah I think in this environment um you kind of and it kind of connects nicely with uh with your initial question around how do you choose where you go uh and how you evaluate the opportunities so it's kind of in this environment where everyone is carried and you know people have short memory but you know still uh in a way you want to cut a pattern on venues that that have long-term you know potential and that kind of already at a good place at this moment um so uh for us the game is uh to really focus on the tier one exchanges tier one counterparts that have a good credit profile that are withheld uh the the storm uh post FTX um quite nicely uh which I think was pretty big um achievement um because uh a lot of the banks didn't perform as well um like in a you know post this review or previous VB situation um so that kind of goes to show that many of these companies although you know maybe they have uh some some questions um they're on a pretty good path forward uh and so yeah regulation uh is obviously Central piece here and uh once we have more guidance I will be in a quite quite favorable but there is nothing better than diversification so you kind of you need to uh be prudent there and spread the spread X Yeah you mentioned regulation there I mean what are your thoughts at the moment on the on the state of the regulatory landscape and again I mean there's a lack of clarity um yeah how do you think about that as a fund um and what's the approach there yeah I mean um Revolution is it's a really big topic and it's mostly for our general counsel at the current time but um effectively we're you know trying to be on top of that side and um and try to be as far away from uh the red flags as possible uh and we're just really trying to be compliant and self-regulated uh if there is no guidance and follow the guidance when there is one all right but yeah I mean majority of exchanges there offshore so uh they're mostly you know self-regulated other than you know jurisdiction of where they are actually you know they are actually regulated but that's not often the ones that that uh that see the most action uh those are usually sure so that's kind of a bit of um the weird spots especially listen to some of the Snippets from the hearing um about you know what is considered to be security commodity and those things it's quite it's quite amusing uh how little Clarity or how little guidance there is um so that's I think it's uh the ball is rolling uh we just need to see like where where we land effectively yeah I think we I think we've all enjoyed the uh Gensler grilling this week and uh oh yeah of the week yeah I mean I mean it's it's I mean we laugh about it but it's a serious point and the fact that you know Gensler you know can't clarify whether he thinks Heath is a security or not and yet wants to go after everyone uh for breaking Securities laws is is just shows you the the uh the nature of the problem it's a it's a bit dabbing on us uh on the U.S regulator right I mean we shouldn't view it as main leaders in general I think it's it's more like yeah it's it's it makes them look particularly bad I would say yeah well especially uh I guess in in the context of um you know uh EU today signing off on on the uh Mika Mica regulations um you know so so this there's an openness there and and the UK as well um you know adopting a more sort of open approach um and then and obviously across Asia as well you know we're sort of seeing some pretty exciting stuff I mean Sohan you're in Hong Kong so um you've got a kind of front row seats of things that are going on there um so yeah it kind of feels like you know outside of the US there there's certainly more positive steps towards um towards you know developing a regulatory regime that hopefully gives some clarity and um you know they that that kind of regulatory Arbitrage always goes on I think the US will actually get there eventually um because they'll realize that this this space is going to build outside and they're in a way so um so yeah it it's um it's an interesting interesting time actually to see what's going on around the world yeah um have a question for a Nikita issue like just um on the on the topic of the whole uh FTX uh you know debacle um it is it is interesting to me that like uh as a market neutral fund there were a lot of opportunities on FTX at the time right like as in that was like the kind of Main go-to Exchange or maybe maybe number two um what were the you know what what allowed you to avoid uh like a significant drawdown there I mean was it was it was it speed or was it as you said a speed of withdrawal or was it just literally you just even though there was a big opportunity and you decided to diversify away from it well you mean like uh exposure to FTX itself or or just trading so yeah like because a lot of our Market neutral funds were were very exposed to FTX right because there were a lot of opportunities yeah uh that in particular all right feel free to you know like uh if you can't talk about it that's also fine yeah yeah I mean in a way after it's um has been uh again like top two exchange uh and quite quickly getting uh some more market share so I think everyone uh was there um and yeah there was I think a lot of people were too exposed to it uh but to be honest I think pretty much all the main market makers all the main funds I think they cut some exposure there um some I kept on the card to relay somebody you know being able to see a bit unscaled uh other than by pure luck um so yeah and especially uh one uh where a couple of appliances that um kind of the bigger you were the card that it was to escape it uh because uh how margin was working um the bigger the size the more margin you have to boast and so the naturally largest firms they had a lot of assets there and had like really big positions so it was difficult to uh well uh wind them down and also processing withdrawals they were favorable favoring smaller withdrawals rather than big ones so you have to kind of um a lot of challenges as a result of it um but yes again some firms navigated better some worse uh but yeah somewhere like surprisingly badly there's a lot of shames about FTX but um it was actually a very very good exchange right it worked um it worked really well it's pretty slick um oh there are there you know we should have replaced some exchanges I mean one one of the big kind of concerns post that world was it kind of Finance basically was was the market for the futures um which of the exchanges that you think potentially rival that and I guess another question as well um that there's been talking recently about you know fftx kind of relaunching um and obviously raise a few eyebrows there's a part of me that actually thinks you know Tech wise why not it was a good exchange and it worked well um but you know from a liquidity provider point of view or be your thoughts on that um I mean that's that's a good question right um I think the answer is uh rather than not obvious I think it actually wouldn't take much uh for it to become quite liquid quite quickly um because you would be quite surprised at how concentrated is liquidity provision uh in the crypto World um right the the top you know few firms completely dominate the markets um so if you get you know one or two of them on board um and it could be you know just as simple as well maybe they have a really big claim and if they get you know Equity um token through a token maybe that can actually be you know pretty nice EV trades just to you know deploy um you know some Capital um and really you know provide liquidity um especially given that there were a lot of things about FTX which were you know which is specific uh to it and so there were a lot of optimizations that you know people did have to be you know faster better smarter and so you kind of you know just put the Train on it already existing rails and just get there um so I feel like to contrary to many other people probably risk Wise It's like as good as it gets uh plus like all of this you know uh scrutiny and kind of gets in the supply side wouldn't be too difficult because all of these guys they already have the towns and you know the fees and so on and and again some of these guys they have 100 million plus um that they that they owed by FTX so you know if they create some Equity value then that can actually be like a well pretty interesting yeah yeah I would uh yeah it's an interesting one to look at um yeah I guess watch this space um the the other kind of um question I had I've seen you speak um several times and you you speak quite eloquently on on just markets generally um as a market neutral um fund do you kind of think directionally um and does the kind of general price direction of Bitcoin and the crypto Market kind of impact you at all and is that something you need to think about yeah I mean maybe not exactly directly but um but there is um somewhat asymmetry between up and down so usually um volatility say or on down moves it will be you know pretty aggressive if there is like really big news or whatever but then like it can die off uh quite quite a bunch in the following weeks uh so um that's actually you know pretty bad um and when Market is trending then you know volumes can keep on increasing open interest it's increasing everyone is kind of making money and it's kind of uh quite synergistic and also um in from exchange standpoint view um you kind of want them to do well I want them to be profitable just then they will start much smaller um so in a way right like uh when Bitcoin was I don't know 15 20K there was like a lot of you know worry about exchanges uh just because uh well we've been um in a downward spiraling market for quite a while I don't know like what uh what's you know what exposure is if they have like how much investment in the long-term staff did they do how much sponsorship did they overextended and stuff like that so it wasn't clear how they can be you know but really profitable and and then that can kind of um make them a bit more risk-seeking uh which wouldn't fit well um with uh with the credit risk um and so in a way it's kind of on the way up there are very few if any blow-ups other than you know hacks and so on but those are out of existing and I think that's kind of the best marketing tool number goes up uh people join join the ship uh and and cruise so I feel like it's um you know in a pure uh isolation sounds Direction doesn't matter but as you kind of explore it in a bit more um uh you know in a bit more depth way then it's actually update the symmetric so there is definitely preference the market going higher like on the allocation fronts on just general bars on usage of whatever and again like I guess another way or I'm saying is that um any any crypto business is like in currently um director or indirectly long crypto um so if if the space you know Bitcoin goes to zero like there it won't be too much to do for anyone yeah I I guess as well yeah spot price goes up collateral values go up people take more leverage and and you've got this kind of virtuous sort of Circle of uh of sort of trading that that sort of starts to happen um what what are your thoughts at the moment in terms of sort of price-wise directionally where things are going well I think um we can definitely go without higher right um because I can definitely comment down is that I think interest from the investor um is not that high I think a lot of the institutional guys that were are looking until deploy into the space uh through their you know talking exposure you know through whatever atps or whatever else they didn't do too well last year uh and those they did uh the Venture I think Adventure overall didn't do well and crypto Venture didn't do well either um and so um and especially there were you know examples of Celsius and Voyager and block fi and Genesis and these so all of those guys um or Gemini and FDX so all of them like really you know Prime kind of uh Estates uh on on the Venture front and they're all kind of did really bad uh so I feel like a lot of them are kind of frontliners um they're licking their wounds um and uh and they're not really looking to re-enter so I feel like um many of them just had their awesome base trying components or if it's family law office maybe they just downscaled so I think not many people are joining the move just yet I think people just need you know time diversity of of Investments and uh we just haven't had enough of it um but certainly there is a lot of you know positive moves and like people are you know paying attention and number goes up is kind of again the best marketing tool um so I definitely think that there is legs to this development and there is a lot of you know positive um positive moves on the East front and like all the scaling Solutions usage gas and so on so I think it's it's quite decent based edges in place and certainly you know day one day after FTX if you sell you know uh whatever April 20s I waste here people would be quite quite pleased with that yeah I mean it's interesting on the VC side obviously but like all these things bull market so valuations get Get Ridiculous um I imagine we're going to go through a similar phase with with anything with AI in it is gonna he's gonna uh command a premium um um actually I saw I saw you repost on social media thing of sell me this pen and you know there's someone saying it's it's an AI driven panel or something like that um from the VC side which you're involved in you know is this is this the time now where you guys look for the opportunities when when others are kind of um you know a staying out the market and B valuations are probably a little bit more depressed yeah I think it's um it's it's good and bad at the same time so all of the VC guys they obviously always you know I'll get the Drone that's evaluations are lower and so so it's great uh but if you look at the um principal components um basically the life cycle of any investment now is way longer um you know say for crypto right like we've seen uh projects go from uh seed stage you know idea kind of uh set up to launching or talking you know weeks or months after and then uh hitting some crazy evaluations um very short after so I think that's kind of uh it's not happening too much um people realize that there will be Benchmark against liquid coins um to kind of makes um some sense of what the price uh floor or Target should be and all of them are you know much much lower um so okay maybe you know the evaluation was you know 50 million and now for the same thing with B20 but also upsiders is is maybe some maybe it's 5x lower so and then for you to actually get liquidity out of it maybe it's uh you know two years longer and then uh there are a lot of other risks right uh what if a project doesn't take off they spend you know have their uh have the capital and there is no traction they just most likely wouldn't be able to raise uh around next round so they're kind of um a bit a bit stuck so I think it's much more risky uh environments uh and that's why I think I am the numbers are such that deployment on the Venture fronts is much slower uh this quarter uh than it's been I think in like two years um and this is very much understandable uh and more than anything uh it could be just saying that uh public markets are quite a bit mispriced against the Venture because with Venture it's like the rule is only so low that this thing can go right but no we're just gonna raise up like 500k evaluation it just makes zero sense um so it's kind of there is a floor to it uh especially you know for good teams and so on and so it's kind of the whole thing is much slower uh people are cutting down on the resources on exploration people just focusing on the core so Partnerships are harder to strike capitals uh harder you know to get by uh and so everything is just much slower and so I think investors are pricing it in and and kind of quite patiently waiting yeah and that's it's an interesting environment um and are there certain kind of specific areas that that you guys look at um in in terms of where where you sort of look to focus investment yeah I mean what we're kind of trying to to do is stick to what we understands um which is um yeah in general decent idea um so what you what we're trying to understand and ask ourselves is uh what things are actually missing in terms of technological stock uh what are the the problems of from the first hand of using whatever there is out there um and what projects that we can buy can actually be uh the end user of um so like one example that we give which worked very well uh is one of our portfolio companies it's called Morpho protocol um so that's um like a layer on top of compound and have it uh which seeks to match uh p2b lenders and and borrowers um and effectively perform the Improvement to the well and to the to the Matched uh Bears um and so that's that's kind of being a one of the high one of the quickest uh Rising erasing lending protocols in the market in terms of tvl I think at the top they I think there are around 500 million so it's quite chunky one and so we're um we see where big borrowers uh overall uh and we're quite familiar with all the problems and they they've been like really good team and start shipping very very quickly and very well and so as being a backer and also user of it is very synergistic uh with kind of food player uh try to achieve so that's kind of been uh quite quite nice uh and um this is some example you know typical Investments that we'll do where we can work with the team um and help to bootstrap the the growth and have them in in directions but I think in general there are a couple of things that that we're looking at uh for existing projects is uh fee generation that is organic right so it's quite difficult uh to keep on paying and in the tokens that you you know print uh to incentivize the growth but the question is uh who is the marginal buyer right otherwise you know it just spiral to the zero and if there is no uh marginal buyer and maybe you know there is like some some dumpsters that keep on beating for it but in a way you want something that's kind of is sustainable and that's a very important word um and that's kind of what we ask it's like who's using this and if incentives go away is there actually a service that they provide that's actually it's worth paying for and if so like how much are people actually you know spending on it that's kind of you know in general people don't like spending money but if they do it and there is a good reason so you kind of try to understand what those reasons are and by those yes yeah I mean I think that again once all the hype always calms down then then you're kind of left with hopefully aided good businesses and B everyone's a little bit more sensible in in kind of evaluating you know have these scenes got real utility sustainability um you know rather than uh you know just kind of vaping in stuff it will be interesting with the AI thing given that is coming so quick on the hills of of the crypto sort of bubble and and uh all the things that happen around that whether you know investors will kind of learn those lessons and they'll be fresh enough in the mind um or whether everyone's just going to get giddy with excitement and and just throw money into AI um I think that's going to be fascinating to watch over the next sort of a few months um yeah I think in general people people um like to chase uh Trends uh and be in order to a trend is is quite useful and it could be in useful in all sorts of ways right so um being at the Forefront of AI uh Revolution I think it's quite you know common sense that it's incredibly powerful um but how to monetize it and how to really create you know service um that's a bit of work in progress for many of these things but all right everything I can be now um you know I'm back back walked um from uh from open AI uh deal right so you could say okay if this thing is that much then this thing could be this much or after you know this Milestone it can be X or Y or z um so I think there will be a bunch of it and um and it's probably will be a lot of kind of um using um just uh open source uh ideas repackaging them a little bit putting good putting like a little bit of you know things on top and just selling as a revolutionary breakthrough at which we've seen and defy like so many of these things you talk to the founders they say yeah yeah like we just ported uh you know away from this chain to that chain and changed and all this and that it's like cool so it's like you know one day of work but that's what composability uh and open source nature of these things offers you but I think all of these iterations on the iPhones um they will be probably overly excited uh in overly overheated um soon enough but there will be some pretty big companies that will emerge out of it I think nope that could be quite impactful and uh the the game for VC guys is to hit one of those you know um Supreme powerful companies that can keep on driving the gross and productivity for the world yeah that is it's interesting um and yeah I think that's probably a good place to maybe um wrap things up I mean it's it's great uh Nikita it's been great having you on um you know certainly I think since we first started speaking uh we we've seen again like all things in crypto you know we've lived a lifetime um but it's it feels like we're in a better place now and um you know excited by all the things you're doing and it's interesting hearing on the VC side and and potentially hope the thing's picking up there and yeah I don't know any any kind of closing thoughts or from Nikita or Sohan I mean my main takeaway is uh invest in what you use I think that to me was a is a great tagline for this uh for this entire episode [Laughter] invest in what you use yeah yeah I mean that's kind of thought right yeah well that's our motto right like uh for the Venture stuff um I think we're probably a bit more technical than the average VC investor and um once you're you know deep in the weed and once you're you know playing with toys uh that you invest in that's kind of you know showcases you what's actually problems are and what actual problem I don't know what solutions could be uh because nobody knows the answers but if you if you went through the depths of understanding something and like uh you know building strategies to profit from some of these things then chances are you probably understand it reasonably well um so then it you always have a very long wish list of things that you would want to have but you just don't because well maybe that hasn't been priority or maybe you know it hasn't come to that time yet um and I think that's not uh the mindset that's uh shared too often uh in the investor crowd many of them are kind of a little bit more on the on the surface and but very a few of them like are really really you know in adaption like would love to go and rest with them um but yeah that's I guess is that is the tagline invest in what you use invest in what he is Nikita always a pleasure to speak to you my friend um and we'll speak to you soon
