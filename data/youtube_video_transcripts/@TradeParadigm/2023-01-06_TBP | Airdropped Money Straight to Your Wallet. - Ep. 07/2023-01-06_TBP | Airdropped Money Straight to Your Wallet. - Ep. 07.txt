all right welcome to the big picture of the Paradigm show where we talk about macro markets as well as micro Market structure so I'm joined today by my co-host David um our resident macro expert and we're actually I mean our our third co-host isn't here today as some of you might have noticed um Joe Crewe which I think I pronounced that right apparently I mean he he corrected me last last episode I was like hey man you've been butchering my name for like the last couple weeks so hopefully I pronounced that right sorry Joe if I didn't um and instead we actually have filling in for him today is uh Tommy Johnson a prolific D5 Builder and Quant and a good friend of mine so thanks Tommy for being here thanks for having me um I guess we'll just start off with the um quintessential question that everyone asked on podcasts but can you give us a little bit of your background for people who don't know you yeah so I've been a software engineer for the last 10 years I actually studied electrical engineering and was a hardware engineer for a little bit in a past life and uh did a lot in Hospitality Tech a few years ago and was always dabbling in the crypto space building some solidity stuff in 2017 2018 and went full time after winning a hackathon on the Solana blockchain and so I've been building on Solana for the last two almost two and a half years now ever since they launched on Main net I've been hacking on Solana what what were you doing specifically before you jumped into blockchain and like why did you jump into blockchain in the first place when I was in college my brother and a business partner started a peer-to-peer Marketplace for software Engineers to connect with business students who had ideas so we ran that for about four years I did that for full time for one year out of college so to make money though that became more like a recruiting job rather than a Tech play so we all decided to shut that down go our separate ways my brother went on to block folio my other business partner went to morning brew that is friends it's a newsletter that his friends have started and then I went into Hospitality Tech so I was building loyalty programs and reward programs in the boutique hotel space for the last four years before going full time in a crypto the last two years cool and like actually can you list some of the things that you've done so when we were at the Solana conference you like whipped out this list on stage when you were speaking or like hey this is what we've done as high options here in in the the like you know the blockchain option D5 space can you list some of those things because that was pretty funny yeah oh my gosh let me see if like I have a a gist I mean so we're the first physically settled American style options protocol in crypto no one had done that before um there was a few that's kind of why we built it the reason we jumped into Psy options was we wanted to automate an options trading strategy and our brokerage wouldn't give us API access and we took a lay to land and no one had built like the true risk profile of an option that like just wasn't possible on on ethereum um so we were the first ever to do that uh then we were the first group to make an acquisition and like like the Solana ecosystem I don't know really if that's been done elsewhere but uh that really gave us an interesting infrastructure we have a decentralized organization that has two separate contributing entities that don't actually own each other it was not like a true acquisition by m a standards um it was really just like incentivization of like hey we work well together like let's just let's keep this going but you guys don't launch a token here's some funding here's whatever coming from the foundation that created Psy um we had the most successful FTX ieo in history and you know that that is locked in stone now because I don't think anyone will be able to uh challenge that going forward given what's happened uh and we're the first ever decentralized organization to move all of our off-chain like the foundations off-chained saps which are really just like sales of future tokens that's how you kind of do private round Investments on chain so there's a four-year vesting schedule with a cliff and a monthly linear vest after that and no one had really put that on chain with governance voting power uh previously that's pretty cool can you really quickly explain what a dow is yeah so just in case people don't know Dow stands for decentralized autonomous Organization for those who have followed me on Twitter you know there's nothing autonomous about it I like to call it just a decentralized organization uh but really what it is is a way to organize people in a decentralized manner that doesn't require the typical legal paperwork that you have in traditional companies and organizations where there's some company that owns other companies or employees people uh you have this decentralized organization that contributors can request grants and funding from and uh it's kind of the central point where you want all the value to go to that Dow and then it the group of members holding uh governance rights to that Dow can then decide how that those funds get used and distributed all right so now that we got all that out of the way we kind of have a foundation upon which to build right so um like we are interested obviously here at Paradigm in options and decentralized options and decentralized trading um we partner with some vaults so I know you guys you guys also have some vaults so I have some questions for you like because you're kind of like the expert now um in well D5 in in this group anyway you're you're that D5 expert um I mean maybe you can give us like like a um a quick or brief overview of how decentralized Finance has evolved over the past few years and like how options came into that and then like what are the what is the state of it now given current events yeah so I think decentralized Finance started out as like a lot of Primitives um and you're building these basic building blocks that can be put together to create more complex use cases so I think D5 really took off a few years ago when we saw peer-to-peer trading with automated market makers amms where any individual could provide Capital as a LP liquidity partner and a provider and um and then other people could trade against that then we saw borrow lending protocols like Avid and and stable amms and things like that so all these basic individual components and then I think D5 evolved a little bit when you saw margin-based trading with dydx although I don't know if that's fully decentralized given how like the matching engine works but then there's uh you know things like mango where you basically take a borrow lending protocol with a central limit order Book Exchange and merge it together and then you have margin based spot trading and so like we're still on this like very low level um like we just have a few Primitives and we're just starting to put them together uh to build more robust infrastructure like you would have in traditional Finance so I think it's a very it's very complex in D5 because you have to build everything on chain specifically to that runtime so the engineering difficulties are a lot harder than if you're building in a off chain where you can just throw a bunch of hardware and servers at it you're not dealing with distributed systems and all these other constraints so it's there's definitely a battle to to build more complex stuff but uh but things are moving that direction and so I think like a lot of things mentioned there were really linear products like trading or bar I mean bar lending is not even really linear but um and Perpetual Futures have been on chain and so options and getting non-linear derivatives is just the next step there's a lot of interesting use cases to hedge positions uh and just physically settled options can incentivize contributors without just giving them spot tokens there's there's a ton of use cases for options that people don't even really like think about every day okay so I want to get into that but first I want to ask a question about DOI DX you said it wasn't completely decentralized why why is that can you explain that I don't know the ins and outs I'm not a do idx like you know power user or anything like that but uh you know you can have in decentralized finance you can have certain aspects that are on chain and then you can have off-chain processes or things like that right like let's take it uh on-chain protocol that has an oracle dependency these oracles have some on-chain data store and then there's off chain you know nodes or Keepers or whatever you want to call it better then piping data on chain and this Oracle programs like aggregating making sure things are in line and spitting out one like common number but like it relies on off-chain processes and so there's you know some some exchanges and it's it's for good reason I mean on chain is one really hard to like build everything on chain and two it's just not efficient you can't really get you can't put an entire matching engine on ethereum L1 like that's why there's been no like true Club there um and so that's that's kind of what I mean like if you have off-chain processes like it's not fully decentralized and if you're relying on that stuff yeah side note uh Club is Central limit order book for people who don't no yeah sorry yeah tell me you're talking like everyone just understands you inherently but I've been in this bubble for two years you know you just kind of yeah um okay so actually I have a question for David like talk about like I mean you speak with clients all the time um every day like that's your thing so what's like the sentiment around decentralized options or defy in general are people still like you know I'm not gonna touch that with the 10-foot Pole or are people more interested in it now I think that is like like a cool sort of crypto and um and here for the right reasons I I think everyone sees it going that way or would like to see things going that way um but I mean as as Tom has alluded to this is still so early in in the development and and of the infrastructure around that but um I mean it's been interesting to me like post FTX um and I don't know if Tommy can maybe speaks this a little bit more but um you know to see sort of volumes actually um have increased uh quite significantly across sort of D5 platforms uh D5 trading platforms um so I I guess all the things that have happened over the past year and the sort of failure of centralized entities um kind of you know justifies the whole value proposition for for crypto and the idea that we should move to you know certainly on chain settlement um and and uh and and D5 generally so I think the appetite's definitely there um I I think certainly for some of the sort of big institutions looking to come into the space I I just think from a tech point of view it's it's just such a huge leap for them um I mean and certainly there's some some more like traditional um sort of funds and hedge funds you know that the they typically bulk things onto existing sort of risk systems um so the idea that they're going to be able to kind of manage their risk um and and you know kind of combine their their on-chain type risk into their sort of uh off-chain sort of risk models is quite difficult so I think there's a lot to work out um but I think the certainly the interest is there um and and then obviously the the other big thing I guess with D5 um is is a whole sort of kyc AML issue um which which a lot of guys are going to face problems with um so you know how to lay from a regulatory point of view sort of get over that um so yes I I think it's one of those that um you know so it will all end up um down that path and the interesting like Tom is I think um in the interim it'll be some kind of combination of both um with sort of um off-chain aspects and then that combines um with with some kind of Unchained settlement or have you all right so you were talking about like risks um that you know large institutions are wary of when when getting into D5 like Tommy maybe you could like I don't know Enlighten us onto the risks that defy and specifically like derivatives um are facing right now and like how do we overcome those risks like what needs to be built out um so that it's easier for these you know types of Institutions to jump into defy and feel comfortable with it and I think there's a there's a lot of topics that could be like that's a broadcast it's a very broad question because like there's there's like the risk aspects there like and like when I say risk I mean smart contract risk that's like one major concern there's regulatory risks that's another major concern and then there's risk-adjusted returns and whether it's worth it for them to jump in there so one thing that I noticed is there are market makers and big institutions that won't touch things for compliance reasons they're based in the U.S and they can't Touch under collateralized derivatives or things like that their compliance team won't let them do that I've talked to them many times month over month and it's still just the same thing there's just no Clarity so I think one thing is we can't really build for that right we're waiting for regulations and and Regulators to actually give some more concrete uh their stance or some precedence right then smart contract risk it's really interesting because these institutions they want to see two audits but I've noticed that like Auditors they're not gonna like give any insurance it's up to the Dow or protocol or team to give insurance so I think it's really audit Plus Insurance audits aren't a Smoking Gun to like solving these problems we've seen Auditors that miss things we've seen audited protocols still get hacked and there's no there's no real harm there for the auditor so there's they have no skin in the game right so how good is that piece of paper but that's what institutions really want to see right now anyways to mitigate smart contract risk and then I think this goes more into a deeper topic of like the macro environment depending on where these institutions are where they're based what like domicile and what access to other Financial infrastructure and traditional Finance they have begs the question of why should they be there like why are you gonna put your assets into an under or over collateralized borrow lending protocol to earn two percent yield if you're a us-based institution that can get 4.7 percent on treasuries right now on short-term treasuries so the landscape right now is just very interesting because the high interest rate environment changes the way you look like institutions are looking at everything yeah for sure actually David that would be that's a great question for you like where what do you think about all that what do you think about um you know interest rates over the next year and if that changes um anything when it comes to like D5 or Lending um yeah I mean obviously a lot of the a lot of defied like opportunities that were attractive in a zero rate world are no longer that attractive um I mean we've spoke before on here right um I'm still of the view I mean you know rates aren't getting cut immediately but I think we'll be ex but that's that's the story for another day and that's certainly not one to play out this year so yeah I I think um I I definitely think um you know the the risk rewards not there at the moment to be playing in D5 um and and yeah why not just sit there and and parked in in treasuries um so the the hurdle rate um to to be be a part of some of these yield pools um is obviously much much higher um and that and that's probably actually we talk about um you know some of the some of the counterparty risks and stuff like that um but actually these these sort of sort of macro risks if you like or or you know the the sort of um risk reward um is probably one of the things that set there's lots of ways to kind of make money in the space um that that's not just sat there just you know earning yield in a pool or in a in a farm so um yeah I think I I think it just kind of you know creates a sort of a larger barrier and and to Tommy's Point um that the the hurdle rate to make a decision to to sort of invest in the infrastructure to start sort of playing about indeed fire has now got a lot higher um and I guess it's going to be a lot for a lot of tech businesses in a higher rate World um that that opportunity cost and a misreward equation um looks a lot more sort of difficult now um yeah yeah I I was looking at the dot chart yesterday though um I think I don't remember who posted it but they were saying that the Market's predicting 125 bit cut in 2024. is that did you see that yeah yeah I mean that's that's where the markets pricing where um yeah interest rate Futures are pricing yeah so that would be interesting and um oh I remember who posted it yeah so he was saying that there's 125 bibs coming uh cut you know being predicted for 2024 but also 2024 is the year of the having the Bitcoin having if you believe in that significant effects on price um yeah anyway so I thought that was cool um the other question I was going to ask was and maybe this is this is for both of you but like where where do you think defy and specifically like um option protocols go in the next like you know couple years like what what gets built out because Tommy like you mentioned that you know you can use options for other things um so maybe you could speak to that a little bit yeah I mean one thing we're we're starting to focus on is those other use cases I mean so one thing we're doing is physically settled options for contributors or building out our project Fusion is what we're calling it right now but the ability to airdrop physically settled options to wallets instead of having to just drop spot tokens I mean we see that the best thing to do if you get an airdrop to sell it immediately maybe Bonk is uh you know hot right now and and throwing that off so you just held it for a day or two and then sold it um but so that's that's one use case that we're really pushing and investing in and then it's really just about other structures and unique structures so with things being extremely volatile and liquidity kind of getting wiped out right now I think volatility is gonna you know come back and be high for while we're in this bear Market um and so doing less of just covered call and secured put selling and doing more vertical spreads and and other structures is is kind of where we're investing in on the option side yeah yeah that would be sweet so like when you yeah can you explain that a little bit actually because I'm I'm just curious like why would you drop an option to someone's wallet and how would that work yeah well all right first of all options are complex like financial instruments right not not everyone understands how it works and so it's really about making a simple user interface not showing any complex Greeks like Theta it's really just about we just care about intrinsic value if I were to exercise this right now what do I get and what's it worth not caring about if I were gonna actually just sell the option so let's say you take let's say size trading at two cents and you write an option for one a one cent strike price you are giving and you just give that to someone you're giving them fifty percent intrinsic value or I guess 100 intrinsic value so if you were gonna then if you exercise you are putting up one cent to then receive a token that's worth two cents so you really just have one cent of free value and so you could do if you have an at the money option where it's let's say two cents the tokens trading at two cents and the strike prices at two cents you're giving someone something that has no intrinsic value but you're giving them potential upside if it's a long tenor option and that just means the expiration date is long so if you give them one two ten year Tenors or expiration dates then the recipient is going to have upside in that project and be bought in or at least be rooting for the project to go up so what they received has some value that's cool so it's like an all it's an alternative to like just air dropping random tokens right exactly and the same thing can be done with liquidity mining rewards instead of just giving liquidity providers the token which we've seen you know the big players just ape into these things into as an LP take these rewards and then just dump it you can see that there's just insane downward pressure on those tokens and It ultimately hurts the project and the community and it's actually just terrible for retail because those are the people who are usually left holding the bag but if you give options or at the money options you're just giving them upside and so it's kind of like baking in a cost basis for those recipients if they do choose to exercise yeah that's cool um how would that how would that get hedged tell me so you're not really worried about uh light hedging it as the as the writer so the writer is essentially the the project the Dow that has this supply of tokens and was going to use it to incentivize products incentivize contributors it's almost like uh incentivized stock options or things like that right where you're you're the the organization and you're writing you know yeah you make sense yeah uh really just to incentivize your employees your community members your liquidity providers yeah that's actually pretty cool um because I have been left holding the bag on too many projects it would have been me too well I think I think what's interesting about it um you know we talk about options um like kind of being risky and saying anything that certainly if you don't understand what you're doing you shouldn't be messing about with but options can also be a really good tool for like mitigating risk or at least knowing what your risk is uh um yeah because it's always seen as you know these weapons of mass destruction um are derivatives but actually they can they can help give you leverage with with having that limited sort of risk um as well yeah someone should create like an entire educational series around options and Futures and explain it simply who should do that I feel like we should do that yes Justin you're the man for it I'm working on it we'll get we'll get that out in a couple weeks here um yeah okay so so last thing before we go um David can you I know like macro hasn't changed too much like but there were a few numbers that came out today could you just walk us through your view on those numbers yeah I mean it's funny I I tweeted earlier ahead of the IDP numbers um basically a reminder to everyone to ignore ADP but the ADP payrolls is is a kind of private employment report um anyway it came out strong today it's always a bad indicator for what non-farm payrolls is going to be like you think that you know if it's strong then we're going to get a stronger print tomorrow never works out the way sometimes does sometimes it doesn't but it's pretty useless in terms of uh trying to predict or forecast what what tomorrow's non-farm payrolls number is going to be so um kind of ignore that but I I think we're still in um you know quiet kind of holiday thin Trading people still haven't fully because we're still kind of battling this strong labor market um and and I think we're going to kind of be like that probably for a couple of months in this um you know kind of going from data point to data point um but but I say I I still think we're we're in this changing macro where we're sort of moving towards pricing the end of a Fed hike cycle I I think the big thing that has changed um is we're now moving from inflation sort of fear and pricing and trading around that to now sort of the growth for you I think most people are comfortable the idea that with past Peak inflation and now the big risk is everyone's focused on his growth and that that has sort of sort of vastly different cross asset implications name namely I think it means long duration platform um reasonably well um because crypto is is the longest sort of duration asset so I still think we're in that environment but I think it's going to be a choppy sort of few months as we kind of come into March when when the um when when the FED will actually pause um and and see how how things take effect but uh yeah so so not much has changed um we're all a bit schizophrenic around individual data points but I think the growth slowed down is what's concerning people which is why you're seeing oil sell off and bonds up after we had the bank of Japan and China reopening and some some uh fugazi around uh around Christmas period I kind of feel like we're we're resuming the the sort of bond rally um but yeah it's not gonna be a straight line I think it's gonna be a little bit bit volatile yeah I was I was interested I was watching uh bonds the other day um or I was tweeting about it so it'll be interesting to see like what those what those do over the next like two quarters but yeah like you said yeah I I I I've got to say as well I mean I feel in quite alone Camp right now with that view um which is actually from a macro where you kind of like to be but um you know it just I struggle to see why people were bearish bonds when we're talking about sort of global growth and slow down or recession um and particularly when we sort of past that Peak inflation um so yeah it's um but it's interesting and I kind of feel like this kind of volatile response we get around data at the moment is kind of what I'd expect to see when we're in in the process of kind of regime change um because there's a lot of uncertainty um once once you kind of start to move more fully into a regime then then that's when you get like the kind of bile of dip type reactions what have you but right now I don't think people are too sure what to do with things but um but you've got to say I think crypto looks looks like kind of continues just to just to bleed lower um which is not great for us but um but yeah it's quite interesting the volatility at the moment is in the tread fire space actually tell me one of the questions I want to ask you saying about um you know conversation I'm having around institutions getting into um sort of defy what's the kind of makeup of your client base uh I mean so we talk a lot with crypto native market makers but then we started branching out to more uh traditional Finance institutions that are crypto adjacent have you know done a little things have set up a firebox account something like that uh so we're not really pulling in like extremely fresh people who don't know what crypto is or aren't really like looking at it from an asset class perspective um art I think to Define like we're still focused on like early adopters I think that's the best way to put it uh and finding product Market fit in this current environment because I think like after the FTX stuff and and the current macro environment and high interest rate environment uh the products that have been built to date uh under the Dow is there's not a lot of like massive new interest in it so it's really just about building for those early adopters and then pushing that to to new partners as things settle down that's a great Point let's end this one here and um and yeah thank you for coming on Tommy thanks for having me [Music]
