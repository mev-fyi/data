trading on paradigms so this each calendar would have gotten the seller 12.8 more ethereum or equivalently roughly 20 000 more dollars uh and then for the BTC role they would have earned about a third more of a Bitcoin or roughly sixty five hundred dollars better so in terms of spread both of these are trading around two Vols two balls away from mid and we have guys come in and they'll be like I would bid this like at least a half of all tighter uh so if you're if I guess if you're the overwriter watching this come trade on us if you want the better prices
