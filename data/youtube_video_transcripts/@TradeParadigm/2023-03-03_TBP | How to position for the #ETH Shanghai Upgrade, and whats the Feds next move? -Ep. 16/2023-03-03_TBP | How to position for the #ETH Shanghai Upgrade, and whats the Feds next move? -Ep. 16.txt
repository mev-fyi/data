hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hey uh welcome to the big picture um back again my name is Joe crowey I'm a paradigm in the weeds around everything crypto ball Market I'm joined Here Again by my colleagues uh Sohan sen in Asia as well as David Brickell um our macro expert we're honored and very pleased to have Gordon Grant from Genesis back on the show Gordon what's going on hey greetings friends how are we doing it's uh what is it it's March 2nd today so let's uh let's get out there and talk about the last month of the first quarter of 2023. good to see you again Gordon good to have you back home yes and you as well sir pleasure hope you're keeping it uh shiny side up trying to try and see this Market's Tessy lights um yeah yeah interesting interesting Market at the moment for sure yeah pretty pretty cool I mean I was reflecting on on some end of month uh commentary for February and and basically realize that Bitcoin effectively went nowhere for the entire month of February even though I felt like we really had some attempts at breakout highs and some huge moves involved and um you know quite a bit of Vega trading and and um you know for us uh you know our largest month actually on Paradigm since August of last year so um it didn't feel like a month where things went nowhere but um you know I guess we'll see why the March is going to break that um spell a bit yeah it's quite it's quite interesting as well in the context of Sasha sharp rights move throughout February which has been huge uh obviously completely undoing the sort of January moves um you know you you usually expect obviously kind of exercises equities come under pressure but like they've given back obviously a lot of the gains from the year but but nothing like um given the rates move you think it'd be a lot worse and then crypto yeah crypto's just kind of drifted in a pretty truck tight range so it kind of like looks quite constructive um and we I mean we can talk about this as this goes on but like you know uh things like liquidity um China looks quite interesting as well and liquidity like we're getting from the e Spirit from China Bank of Japan um so there's a lot going on there so I'm sure um I'm sure this should be a good uh good episode to get your thoughts School done in terms of what's going on and why is uh why is crypto just just kind of drifting in this little low vial world at the moment yeah yeah um Joe I don't know if there's anything you you want to use to practice it or we could just delve into that yeah I think one of the the one of the bigger themes of the month has been this resiliency of the spot Vol correlation which I think this Amber data chart shows quite well so just for context and so this y-axis shows the d-val index which is effectively the vix equivalent of Bitcoin while the x-axis is the BTC price so what you see is the highs in implied calls are corresponding with spot at the top of the range so I.E that top right part of the chart while when Vols have gotten crushed that's been happening when spot has retraced back towards you know the 23 000 uh or towards the middle of that range and I think that ball price action was was quite evident at the end of last week so we we had that uh pretty hawkish pce data BTC sells off four percent and then fixed strike implies are getting absolutely whacked across the curve all when the absolute level of implies are quite low we're trading like below 50s here the ball risk premium was not that elevated by any means and then fast forward to a couple days later where we had we have that rally back and then that coincides with Falls moving higher so it really does seem to me like that this ball regime is quite different then in 2022 like if you told me I mean obviously I have the equity background if you told told someone six months ago you know BTC short dated implies are trading in 50s braiding realized is trailing realize is in kind of like the high 40s and spot sold off four percent did ball goes did balls go up or down I would imagine most people would say balls went up but that's actually not what happened so I'm curious uh Gordon in terms of what do you think is explaining this price action is specifically that spot fall correlation in a in a month where you know um BTC effectively did nothing yeah um it's a great observation I think um there there's there's actually a reasonable amount of alpha in in this and and it's good I mean we'd like to have some Alpha out there for for participants in the crypto Market especially those that are transacting on Paradigm but you know the reality is that um even if gamma can perform in a sell-off there's no incremental demand for optionality at lower uh Bitcoin prices you know again locally here and and I think it's instructive to understand why that is and and you know kind of ascertain is that a universal axiomatic truth or is that a state-based truth and um you know again for folks who um you know sort of follow more of a stochastic um methodology for um you know kind of distributional analytics or crypto right what we mean when we say State based is that there are certain characteristics of the distribution of asset price returns that are not constant um and and those could be you know the the formative parameters of the distribution itself or the correlative aspects of the distribution of something like the volatility of the asset um along with with the assets price and that could be implied and you know we can look at two very simple States right um uh or regimes right we've got the bull regime and the bear regime I think we can all agree we're kind of in a bull regime Now red crypto prices are threatening to break out through 25k we know that's been a huge threshold there's been a Groundswell of re-adoption of crypto as a thesis and of course we've seen a number of the more higher data less liquid alternative tokens now ones have Stellar returns you know some some of the the newer tokens like Aptos and of course uh D5 tokens like GMX something or an absolute tear so we kind of feel like we're in this bullish regime now we can say what that means and last year right particularly in Q4 it felt like a bearish regime right where persistent downward pressure on spot prices supply of um you know underlying spot or or optionality on any rally is people simply uh wanted to hedge their exposure and so you know you had some underlying uh dynamics that were completely different between the two so what does that mean in terms of population right well last year if you looked at it particularly in Q4 we had very negative spot ball correlation right so a spot drop there was demand for optionality because folks needed to protect their balance sheet they needed to have insurance against further uh realization of fear uncertainty and doubt in the market and also the looming prospect that we might break out uh to to new loads right break below 15K support we all remember you know the famous Arthur Hayes um you know Twitter uh quips or he says okay I'm loading up on you know December 15K puts and you know everybody kind of went online for that trade and um you know there was a bit of a storm in a teapot about that fast forward to where we are now we we see really quite the opposite which is after January 11th or 12th when Bitcoin had an upside breakout from 1718k and more or less teleported up to um the range that we're in now right which is you know kind of 21 and a half 22 on the low side and 25 on the high side we've only seen demand for upwards optionality as a trading desk and so when you look at that from a flow perspective what does that do well it means that you're going to see premiums expand when people get bullish about crypto prices right and that seems sort of tautological but but it's it's not really because it's entirely different from what we saw last year which is when crypto prices rallied people just sold a lot of options right in order to hedge themselves to overwrite calls they figured it was free money crypto was never going back up again and so any any bouncing spot was an opportunity to sell calls and when things felt like they were getting worse people would spend premium to hedge themselves now fast forward to to where we are now we've got a good amount of of profitability you know behind the asset classes in Industry people are feeling liquid again Point prices are higher that means you've got more dollars to spend on option premium particularly as prices rise and not surprisingly every time we Crest these key psychological thresholds be it 23 for the first time 24 or particularly 25. we see players large and small crypto native Trad fi systematic volatility driven um reaching to buy optionality right so so that is the regime that we're in now um how long could that last I I think it really depends on certain macro factors to come to where we started this conversation right and and the underlying factor I think that that's important is the inflation Factor right and to the extent that you subscribe to a factor based analytical decomposition of the principal explanatory um you know variables for asset price returns inflation is a factor seems to be coming less important uh for crypto than than it was last year right anytime we would have an upside surprise to inflation it was absolute disaster folks wanted to sell spot wanted to buy Ball wanted to prepare for crypto prices facing low because it simply meant that the Fed was going to be tightening more uh and more aggressively than in terms of a timeline than people might have expected now um that doesn't appear to be the case right we've seen ISM prices paid hot we've seen core PC continue to run hot we've seen macroeconomic numbers such as German inflation or China PMI is hot and and actually crypto know has stopped um having the same pavlovian knee-jerk response to that and if anything has kind of begun to trade a little more in its own world that's not to say that we don't um you know dip a bit when when there's a strong inflation number in the U.S or whether it's hawkish fed commentary about higher for longer but you know particularly since the last step OMC meeting where there was a 25 basis point um you know decision under prognostication if this would be the Electoral Glide path for the future and that we would no longer be in this shock and awe um that that all of a sudden people are saying okay you know what I'm I'm not so concerned about a plunge to new lows and what it really means is uh when things get buggying I want to lever up using optionality and that's really quite different than what we saw last year and to the extent that implied volatility represents uh sort of a liquidity preference to utilize options markets for leverage then then we should expect to see this and it's not really any different than when we look at let's say defy Perpetual Futures positioning indicators in markets like GMX and others that show a tendency to have asymmetrical nickname as Marcus kind of hit new highs it's just another side of the same coin if you will right so crypto's starting to kind of trade in its own world the macro picture while not great uh has I'm sure David will agree it really hasn't seemed to matter yet we've been on we've been testing this 25k level quite a bit I think you know five or six times now and I was out with somebody the other day that said like look we get to 25k as soon as we hit that level there's an offer on 200 million BTC 25k on binance that just comes in and then pushes things back down again like in in terms of would you say that it's kind of like a flows and positioning thing that that is bringing it back um down to this 25k level because we were we were talking quite a bit about like hey if we break this 25k level you know you have all this potential short game on the upside it could get pretty whippy if we could if we could break that level and obviously that would that'd be great for great for the options market and it's great for people that were generally pretty long that stuff but what's your opinion on why we haven't been able to break that level um you know look there's a bit of an aristic element to it uh which is that's where we failed over the summer and that first initial squeeze rally so we we bottomed on that um that first flush load just below 18 and then quickly push back up to 25. and every time you've had a bit more of a a slightly lower high as we pressed it there we had those uh gamma squeeze pre-cpi highs of right around 24 000 around September 13th and um you know yet again there have been a few other flirtations at that level so not surprisingly there there is an element of punters willing to take a more balanced approach to this level There's Something Magic to it as we know although periodically the the 200 um period moving average has flowed you know or or let's say coincided with that and that has also meant that you know there's probably more of a of a two-way perspective um you know at this threshold but but I also think that speaking of the volatility Dynamic and inasmuch as there's good appetite from players to leg into when your upside as we break through those levels and so when we press 24 that requires a 26 is that in in February there were buyers of let's say 30s in March and then as recently as last week there were buyers of 45s in June um you tend to get more of a local supply of gamma right which does start to cap that market and and from what we've seen flow lies overwriter activity far less this year than it was last year which is um you know one of the explainers of uh of this different ball regime that we're in um but it it also means that um you know people are more willing to shed some of that upside optionality I think from a dealer book perspective as well as from the Tactical Trader perspective and for that select set of overwriters that still have Capital that still have balance sheets still have coins to Chuck into margin either on Exchange or bilaterally that that level feels pretty good right right now particularly when Vol starts bumping 60 when you're up there and you look and say okay you know what I can get you know three to four percent for near to the money shorter dated call options um and and all of a sudden right my my breakevens are well in there for 26k and so I don't I don't mind letting some of that go and so it's a function as much of you know quantitative metrics absolute break-evens Market psychology um you know technical indicators and and then I I'm gonna think there's also a you know more of a fatigue question just to say we've had a great run up in the market this year Bitcoin is you know close to has been close to 50 off um recent loads at various points in time and um you know basis has also widened back out again and when we talk about derivatives markets we shouldn't only stay in the non-linear space and that that is of course where um you know we tend to spend most of our time folks are on Paradigm but basis has moved back up there is an ability to wob out futures um and start to earn you know sort of positive rate of return with respect to where spot markets are trading and you're out of their own actual Futures funding or fixed dated futures um and so as a result all those together seem to be providing something of natural cap at this level um does it feel like an insurmountable obstacle I would say no particularly given the macro trading tape but does it mean that we have some resistance to chew through here yeah I could certainly see that yeah yeah and you could really feel that local Supply coming in last week uh right around that end of month expiry it was it was quite strong not not only from like the typical sort of systematic sellers but but also tactically like I'm just Gordon I'm sure you remember like all those all that June Vega being sold right you you kind of have like that long ball of ball play people were long the June top side and then you saw that June all those June straddles being sold against it and then you see the steady clips of short dated strangles and straddles as well and then that combined with the fact that the upside demand was certainly not as high as what we saw back in January at the beginning of the year when everybody was kind of lifting that sort of stuff then it kind of sort of makes sense but it does it does feel to me that yes in the listed Market there is a decent amount of systematic and and selling flow that we're seeing but there have it also seems like there is some large sort of selling flow that is happening OTC that doesn't that we don't see on Paradigm maybe it's like a minor or something like this that comes in you know at the end of every month because we sold off four percent and Falls got absolutely crushed I understand that there is not really demand for optionality on that on the downside but that move just seemed really extreme they seemed like there was some sort of like big flow out there that the listed markets just aren't seeing am I am I on to something here or or is it kind of just what you see is what you get no I think that's right I mean there it doesn't take that much that's the other thing to remember I mean crypto wall markets you know let's let's appreciate the Resurgence and volumes here and not for nothing right this is a market now where you know your your top makers are now all trading well into you know the multi-billions of dollars a month on Paradigm and we're darebit volumes have begun to surpass once more um a billion dollars per day per product but that being said um and I remember uh making mention of some of these things on a prior discourse and someone kind of laughing and saying crypto oh wow it's not a real Market you know 10k of Vega is actually uh you know supposed to be a serious number but it is right I mean I think we're getting more liquid right and we have to create that and I think one of the biggest features of February training was the sheer amount of vegan that's sloshed through the markets both ways you know both ways I mean we we would see guys come and sell um you know 100K of Vega over a few Clips be it the June sellers or that that strip of Feb sales at the end of January uh and then this month it appeared to focus more on March and June but we've equally seen you know an amount of demand for that so this is getting more serious but we're still nowhere near Equity ball commodity ball crude oil Vault right where you you think about Forex fall where you think about millions of dollars in Vega right we're at a market where 100K Vega is a big number needs to be digested and can easily move the market uh particularly if it's not handled um you know with discretion it can move the market three to four you know three to five bald ones right I'm in my my general rule of thumb want to look at some of the flows that I see come through the market unless people are particularly asked um you might well expect to see shorter dated Vols back up let's say one point per 10K at Vega I don't think that's a hard and fast rule but I certainly do see that sort of tendency so so markets can only accommodate so much and and that also has to do with the winnowing of players I mean we're you know we feel very privileged to still be here and transacting and we're very proud um you know to to say that we're at the top of the leaderboard on Paradigm you know again for the month of February and we're very pleased with the kind of traction that we've gotten for client base and particularly um you know with users of the platform and large block sizes that we're trading but not for nothing there just aren't that many people out there that are still making in size you know a lot of the folks that we're more active have gotten less active um you know the volleyball has been high there are further incremental restrictions to to balance sheet that that we're seeing you know and again I don't need to decide on any particular incidents but we're just aware of of you know kind of further credit crunch potential out there in the market as um you know there are workouts and and there are kinds of things that are happening with some of the banking participants and again it's it's all public information in the news so the ramifications of that are less appetite less willingness to warehouse this kind of risk and so when it comes through particularly let's say if there's a large one-sided flow um that may be done OTC um no one's going to Warehouse that anymore right whoever takes that down is going to come to The Exchange and and is simply going to put that stuffer offer either top of book or um you know let's say through aggressive rfqs on Paradigm and in fact we've seen um what I I would consider to be relatively heavy-handed execution of Vega sales at various points in time um we saw just before the Chinese PMI numbers um you know March um you know March 25k calls were given down below 47 implied volatility um for what for why hard to say but there was 10K a vegan it was just dumped there right around you know let's say five six o'clock New York time and before you know it it was paid up at 51 within you know three to four hours is it rational no um is that the kind of Market that we're in yes absolutely and and I come back to that's only you know 10 to 20K of Vega that's traded obviously around a fairly um you know significant data event and left-click conditions but um yeah you know a an overrider or someone that chooses to generate incremental static return through the sale of options you know they're they're certainly going to have that kind of effect on the market and we should expect this and as a market maker I think you know we we tend to think about trading assets and continuous time um you know with with some um let's say relatively uh well-behaved uh distribution of prices and be those spot prices or or volatility observations but this stuff just tends to Gap too right it resets very quickly it could very well be sort of stable at 50 and then could be you know 48 given 47 given before you know at the market street price and that's because um you know again we come back to that relatively select set of makers that are able to provide and support the good interfere with this thing and and it's it's more or less where people want to be doesn't mean it'll stay there right and quite clearly sub 47 was the wrong price for those March 25s um in in that instance but it can be there and it can be very tradable for a period of time right cool uh that yeah that makes total sense uh David do you want you um give us a little bit of a macro update of what you've been seeing uh over you know the past week past couple of weeks um of course the data looks has been running pretty hot so I'm curious get your thoughts there let me stop sharing my screen yeah I mean it's interesting I mean just picking up on some of this conversation here um I mean what's actually really interesting to me is that you know I.E how well like Bitcoin and and the crypto complex has been uh supported and I mean coming back to that point about you know that that kind of resistance around 25k in Bitcoin it's funny because if you think of like January and it was all about like Peak inflation Peak fed um and that was really like a huge little macro driver for for crypto kind of pushing to the upside and and now we've kind of lost that right that's faded quite a bit um I I again I think it looks super constructive for crypto just given the the lack of pullback um and again it kind of reminds me of the flip of what we saw throughout last year when you know we had these sort of big sell-offs and then the kind of rallies were were pretty muted and then we kind of would be in a bit of a range then we'd take the next leg lower so it does actually feel to me that the the market right now just needs another kind of positive kind of drive or a macro influence to push high and take out those 25k levels to me meantime you know recency bias what have you we we kind of like trade in these nice little ranges um where people start to get comfortable like okay we pushed to 20 4K you know and above and you kind of probably want to sell out and then you sort of dip to low 23s you kind of buy that it kind of becomes a little bit self-fulfilling so yeah I kind of think like we look like a market that's again I always always sort of careful to say the lows are in and now we're just kind of waiting for that pause and that trigger to to kind of take off and then also like narratives are important as well um and kind of like golden touched upon like like the kind of Market psychology and narrative's changed like dramatically from last year um and it it now feels very much about say look looking for for the the top side complexity and as you're seeing with that kind of spot file Dynamic um that we're seeing so I I kind of feel yeah we're setting up for that asymmetric move we just kind of need the data to calm down a bit and rates to calm down but um and you know we've got the Shanghai upgrade coming up with we've got obviously as well this sort of news out of Hong Kong looks pretty big um is potentially bad right like I'd be I'd be curious to to get the views views around here I mean like Gordon I mean it doesn't really seem like much as prices but we did see there was some pretty big March April calendars that were trading yesterday you know those March the 8th March April 1800s stores what 8 000 of those that were Printing and yeah yeah that's right quite sizable yeah yeah exactly and I'm in terms of what you read around it right it's it's and when you speak to people it's quite mixed right some people like okay that's just not event like it's it's fine um but then others are like yeah like Avi Feldman uh from Golden retrieve was on Twitter being like look this is potentially attractive time to get to get along the ball it's been pretty significant Supply and as you said you know because of the ball of all it can really overshoot right and so when it does overshoot maybe potentially using that as an opportunity to get long ball um just because look there I'm not ruling out the possibility that over for the short term there is fairly significant potential selling pressure over time that could happen as people get rid of um people withdraw their Stakes I I think like my my view on it I mean we spoke about this I think last week I I actually think marginally it's it's quite bullish for for a but partly given the levels that we're at because again if you were gonna I think most people would probably have staked probably underwater right um on that now now my my view um right or wrong is that I I'd be I think it'd be greater selling pressure if if was like you know north of four thousand five thousand and there's actually money in it to to kind of realize positive p l um I think if you were willing to sort of stake and tie up your your ease for an unknown period um it's hard for me to think that as soon as that unlocks you're gonna then sell it and realize that the p l loss on it um so I kind of think there's that Dynamic and then the other side as well is that um you know you look at you look at like the staking ratios of each versus other protocols out there where you can take your money back um I I think the The increased flexibility actually you're probably going see more eth that gets tied up and and starts getting staked um versus that that comes out and just gets sold but I appreciate you know there's arguments like both ways on this yeah Gordon what's Gordon Sohan what's your guys's view on the on the on the Shanghai upgrade Trader I think for me at least it is it is um a different world to when these guys state right like so it's a completely different world they're aums are you know much lower like if they're you know if they're OG crypto guys um so I I actually think um yeah on on the margin it probably is a little bit bearish right because you know you there will be the selling pressure that comes in and you know people are going to have to you know finally have some liquidity you know which is which is available right so I actually think the the case for uh owning optionality over this is is a is a is very attractive right uh but I think I think okay going back to the previous like previous discussion right I mean there's a lot I think there's a big sign of maturity in the in the market that people are using options now rather than just yoloing Futures right so like you know like if you look at all these um course pads or you know these bullish bullish uh you know trades that are that are going through the market um I actually think it's it's a it's a great thing because these people are coming in and coming in and expressing A View using options because they're so uncertain about what the future is like they're like well I could be completely wrong you know like in 22 I could be completely wrong right so I should use options because then at least I won't I won't completely blow up right so it's like a it's like a sign of maturity right like people are coming in instead of instead of having a sizable allocation to Futures they're also having you know like using options to express their view so on the Shanghai upgrade itself um I actually think yeah you you need to you need to own some optionality over it I feel yeah it sounds right I mean I I think you to kind of come back to where we started the conversation about spot of all correlation I think you have to be mindful of what sort of optionality that you buy um and ether in particular has been you know some somewhat more uh of an anomaly in the sense that we're we're coming into in a major uh a major event and the market has had a persistently um negative put skew and that suggests to me that that there's been structural demand for puts um irrespective of the realized five ball correlation which has been quite positive even if it's been less pronounced than Bitcoin because ether has been more or less a sideshow this year in terms of volatility Dynamics and flows um compared to bitcoin but nonetheless when we trade up um you know to 1700 we've seen multiple um instances of major taker activity looking to get leveraged long upside um you know uh vis-a-vis let's say short term to kind of medium term Factor risk on a curve and and that starting to drive skus back towards flat and anytime we've sold off quite predictably as soon as we get back down towards 1600 volt just gets absolutely shellac so you know it we can kind of wind the clock back and look at the merge and think about how Vols performed after that and of course it was the case that the ball had decimated even a spot it was collapsing furiously enough uh and what might happen here well baseballs are a lot lower there about half of where they they were at the time of the merge so that does count for something um positioning is is definitely a lot cleaner I don't think there are you know huge amounts of Leverage long uh risk and eth if anything right people have started to hedge themselves um I think the stapleth question it's open right it depends on the personage of of the folks who are who are stakers right are they crypto treasuries or are they just large whales are they you know smaller scale stickers who have had these assets locked away um I could easily imagine a significant amount of diversification away from each Bitcoin and of course we've seen the BTC ratio performed in a relatively lackluster fashion this year um do I necessarily think that unstaking allows folks simply to dollarize it and kind of cut their losses well they could would they is that the nature of people who are uh hanging on to State deep that's more of an open question for me I would I would tend to think more about rotation out of eth into other crypto assets and less so um just you know pure East selling but um but I I think there there certainly could be the well hey the event is over we can unstake now and you know it's just get out of it and and we may see a sustained period of of e-funded performance but I'm I'm also open to the Viewpoint as David has said that you know kind of this is a bullish unlock sort of scenarios as people joke about tongue-in-cheek in the market which is to say you know Supply should drive prices lower but because the market has effectively preempted that right by bid inputs even though um you know puts over calls have not performed from a volatility perspective uh and people may have preemptively sold out some of that Eve or locked in those gains on a forward basis that that there there actually could be an effective okay it's finally here and it worked um and now I have the ability to take my money out and put it back and take it out again right and and isn't this a cool wonderful thing um the the main question for me is you know just how bearish or problematic or recent regulatory pronouncements in the United States about staking for a market like ether and what was does it mean for staking a main chain for reverses liquid staking derivative since this is a kind of derivative focused podcast the behavior of Lido would not suggest to me that people are done mistaking per se um they may feel differently about utilizing staking products such as those that have come into regulatory fire or those that could be subject to such regulatory censure but um it may well be the case that folks just simply say Hey listen I stayed there I wish I'd staked in a more um you know accessible product like a like a liquid staking derivative such as veto or others that are coming in the market there are some you know plenty of others that are coming online and that's new and exciting developments um and and that that may you know simply get us to the point where you know what yeah there's a bit of selling pressure but in reality we just find that people like this idea of a benchmark crypto asset that has you know five six uh seven percent or more sticking you know depending on how you stake where you stake whether you use leverage how how you compound your returns and um that it's not a bottom drops out kind of market and when we talk about the performance of of all um you know again resuming the conversation this just hasn't been a market where Vols performed the downside and you know without you know getting too much into the macro uh Voodoo I I think we can say that um there are some things that suggest that the nominal four not the real floor but the nominal floor of asset prices appears to be rising even with Rising rates I mean let's all do a quick poll here right this is a this is a uh uh not a trustless environment so we're gonna we're gonna trust a little bit of Integrity but if we asked everyone here at the beginning of 2022 and said hey look you're going to get 400 you know odd basis points of fed hikes in the next 12 months where do you think U.S equities are right would you have said 4 000 on the s p no I wouldn't I I would have said yours three thousand I I would have said 3200 right yeah yeah and exactly somewhere somewhere like there and I you know I don't know what your thoughts are but I I tend to get the same answer from people and ask you know we would have said your three thousand yours 3 500 you know maybe you would have said okay 25 35 I don't know but most people would not have expected it to be here and we've seen this in other asset classes right gold silver precious metals had quite a curious Resurgence into Q4 of last year right um whereby we saw gold pushing back towards these cyclical highs and the narrative around um Central Bank diversification um The Narrative around um you know let's say um foreign trades and a number of other considerations and can you know are we seeing that manifested itself in this slightly funky stability this this you know perplexing equilibrium of crypto at these levels even as reefs have started to bump higher and there are some signs right macroeconomically that notwithstanding the amount of fed tightening there's still a lot of cash in the economy right um the home sell numbers recently were quite curious right pending home sales very strong and and the most important component of that was that cash purchases were decade highs so even with um interest rates having gone to levels not seen in quite some time people still have ample liquidity to make major purchases um you know with uh you know with cash and not enough is somewhat curious and it seems to suggest to me as we're seeing with certain corporate activity with prices paid in the corporate sector with some of the you know um deep cyclicals and heavy machinery industrial names like John Deere and others people are saying hey you know what guys are still spending I don't know tractor prices are still at records people or showing up and you know getting that uh two hundred thousand dollar Farmall or combine that they always wanted um and and you know paying a million dollars in cash for houses in Atlanta Georgia apparently amongst other definitions that have been recipients of you know recycled funds from um you know from let's say the Northeast Rust Belt states this is all interesting to me and of course we're seeing the pboc do these cash injections you know so is the market really you know as throttled for liquidity as it seems I'm not necessarily sure I believe that and when I really come back to what is crypto after all right like why are we even here um well we're here because we've said it before crypto is this beautiful liquidity Vector right and we know that crypto has survived because of the covet era injections massive debt monetization and injections of liquidity and and I'm still not sure that there's not a stealth um you know liquefication of the financial system that's happening in ways we may not fully understand um it could be China I certainly the bank of Japan right who's maintained this bizarre yield curve control even as um real rates have started to turn sharply negative there and there's been a material weakening of the end over time um and and there is this element in the U.S of well what is really going on and I do come back to behavioral Dynamics this is not a conspiratorial approach to assessing um you know prognosis for asset prices but you have to ask yourself the question in whose interest is it for us to have a massive Equity Market correction driven by the withdrawal of policy accommodation it's not Nancy Pelosi's apparently okay the big buyer of U.S equities on public record that many other Federal Reserve and appointed officials are big buyers of U.S equities they certainly don't go short at least according to their public Financial disclosures and not only that household wealth sustenance has become centered on Equity markets and real estate markets as a linchpin so in as much as the FED has been tightening rates progressively consistently in an effort to restore credibility after having been kept you know sort of long behind the curve this is really just savings face and his still here in part because liquidity is actually far more ample than policy rates would seem to suggest and I'm I'm willing to contemplate that thesis uh and the longer asset prices sit up here and the longer we chop around s p 4000 um you know the more I'm willing to believe that there are things going on in the macro space that are going to bolster nominal asset prices of course we have to ask what's going on in the real front well on the real front is you know seven eight nine percent development Market inflation which of course is eroding these nominal asset price returns and so things are not as rich as you think right because in reality inflation has been running at this this High single digits level now for the better part of several years in the US and so what that really means is that we need to deflate these nominal asset prices to understand where things really are and and in that sense you know of course crypto has not bounced as much as we think it has if you believe that Equity markets are not um you know uh back towards the highs or within maybe even 15 or 20 percent of the highs they they may really still well be 35 to 40 percent off the highs in real terms if you think about what asset price inflation has done since Equity Market bottoms during the pandemic and so with that all being said right we you know we trade nominal prices but we can't ignore the real effects um and and is that the case here and is that one more reinforcing Dynamic for this very positive spot moral correlation that we've seen which is to say in a rising floor it's just not that interesting to be long puts for assets who would have bought puts on Equity markets in Venezuela or you know Zimbabwe um over time it probably wasn't a great trade they only ever go up um and you know we we could ask that question here you know is is that slowly not um you know kind of alarmist not kind of um you know I would say um sociopathically but is that kind of happening in developed markets where asset prices have this floor under them not because the FED is going easy on rates I mean it's it's been quite credibly lifting them and being very hawkish in its commentary and and you using rhetoric that suggests higher for longer is a new reality but there can be other things going on and I'm I I'm I'm not sure that that's not a component of what we're seeing in the markets right now both in terms of volatility and in terms of asset prices yeah I I mean that that's um I mean that's why I talk about a lot like within a macro framework like you know it's not just rates right there's rates liquidity liquidity dollars positioning flows like all these things like combined and I mean I think liquidity is huge um also as well I mean throughout my career um you know I I always think the two most important things that are fed in China um now most people typically will say yeah they're fed and focus on the FED but typically ignore what's going on in China but I don't think you can ignore what's going on in China so so if we want to talk about quantitative tightening and all these things when you're seeing China do record cash injections you know that's going to have an impact yeah and you have to look at that so I do think there's these huge like liquidity offsets um I do think as well I mean like within that liquidity scope I mean what what the I've not looked at the latest count but the FED balance sheet is not is not much much below 8 trillion still so that that actual QT process has been sort of painfully slow and obviously you've got the offsets from the sort of TGA drawdown and and what have you um so as much as rates have gone up actually the balance sheet contractions being being pretty meager pretty slow uh given when you compare it for the injections that we had throughout the whole sort of covert period and then the other thing and I guess your point Gordon is like like markets established like equilibria like and and basically what drives markets is like the marginal buyer and marginal seller at any given point so I I think we like to try and put these things in like neat little boxes and say oh well last time rates were here stocks would be down here and but uh but you know the fact the fact is you have like a big sell-off and um then like the market will find like an equilibrium where there'll be be marginal buyers that are willing to step in at those levels that don't necessarily um kind of relate to a more sort of fundamental view of you know discounting cash flows and all that sort of stuff and then the other thing I was having a chat in the office here earlier and talking about you know why would you not just hold uh like treasuries like why would you not just follow say I don't know 10-year treasury is at four percent um you know say four percent and again into and to the point on inflation okay but now when you're doing that your your real return at the moment is is pretty much zero so so now as the hurdles to to kind of beat inflation mean that you're actually kind of looking for where can I get some level of capital appreciation that's going to outpace inflation now if you'd come into this year holding Bitcoin and you've you've sort of seen like 40 like return on that within within a month or so uh equities um you know kind of flew out the blocks and outpace the returns you get started treasuries again maybe that's a factor that that kind of uh impacts the this kind of thought process in terms of your portfolio allocation yeah I mean I I get the feeling like uh yeah like I guess the three of you are much more constructive I guess than I am right in terms of um in terms of the direction right because I think after 22 I I'm just very uncertain that um you know you there can't be a curveball which is thrown in there right which is why I'm such a big advocate of like always using just um you know limited limited downside uh you know like uh interviews when you're expressing directional views so like I I think consistently buying puts in in crypto is you know as Gordon said is not a performing strategy but when there's this one risk event which might be bad but you also happen to catch all this like you know macro macro events which you know which could turn in this time I mean I I I would just spend some premium and buy buy some puts I think that's uh that's the kind of the thought I'm thinking Jason I I think that's quite interesting and I I keep thinking back to this is uh and to that point is I so whilst we kind of go okay um you know we've lost this fed put or it feels like we've lost the FED Putt and his Central Bank put um and now they're more like writing calls right um what what might be quite significant it was the bank of England funny enough uh and their uh intervention in the guild market last year uh when that started still off the lanes have been at a moment when they're they're in the midst of a rate hike cycle um but you know things got scary in the bond market started to sell off um talk about the pension fund uh the pension system was about to collapse and they stepped in again and I just wonder if that psychology of that is that that that put is still there because like look the treasury market collapses tomorrow like the FED aren't going to sit back and go well this is what it is right it's just we're in a hike cycle we need we need to get on top of inflation that's that's yours she's not right they the guys step in you've had Yellen talking about treasury BuyBacks and that already um because of bond market the lack of liquidity in treasury market so I I kind of feel like that just psychology-wise means that you kind of still feel that there's there's there is a there is a central bank put out there to the big blow up scenarios that makes it less attractive to want to own that downside optionality or or to kind of hedge yourself against that blow up risk because you still kind of feel that as when the market is kind of you know reared its teeth and kind of uh you know shown the potential for something nasty to happen then central banks seem willing to be quite creative in terms of how they'll go about addressing that are you seeing it at the bank of Japan as well right it feels crazy but they know as well if they step away from that yield curve for control all hell breaks loose and I think that is you Aida the new incoming guy actually he's been quite interesting um you know in his sort of recent remarks because everyone's saying he was more hawkish relatively he's been pretty balanced right and he gets that you know it's it's not just about economy inflation all these things it's hard to step away from the support that they've they've put in there um and if it still feels like I mean I was uh I was I was able for client um earlier this week and we were we were talking about stew Dynamics and especially in BTC where you know the downside is just not really elevated and it's not not to be cynical yeah but the guy was like look if I buy a ten thousand ten thousand strike put the thing goes in the in the money am I actually didn't get paid on this thing yes so so perhaps there there's also that element where people don't really bid those Tails because this is a new market you know counterparty rescues life like people and people just don't are a little are a little bit nervous in in that regard right so that especially in BTC because at least in each right like you're you're always going to have much more persistent demand to hedge the downside in ethereum because you have all these VCS that are involved in all these all coin projects that you know ethereum is going to be correlated too so whatever if it's okay Shanghai upgrade but there's also that dynamic as well uh especially post 2022 when we you know had those blow-ups where there is going to be you know a higher demand for for the Eve for the for the eat puts then than the BTC um but I I think it's 1102 um I think we we leave it at that [Music] thank you [Music]
