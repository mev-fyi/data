welcome to the big picture the Paradigm show where we talk about micro Market structure as well as macro markets today I have with me obviously the man the myth the legend macro Man Randy Savage David Brickell thanks for being here and thanks for being consistent our our third co-host is out again uh Joe is out but filling in for him today is Steve so Steve give us an intro about yourself yeah hi my name is Steve weingroff uh institutional coverage team Paradigm so covering institutional clients you know kind of being behind the screens and you know just watching markets and helping with liquidity sourcing axes these sorts of things and I'm since March and Steve give us a give us a fun fact about yourself and now I'm putting you on the spot but I want to hear it I'm a huge golfer uh not a lot not a lot of golfers in crypto but if anyone wants to team up let's get out there how do you feel about the whole like PJ versus live thing so from a capitalist perspective I think it's really cool and interesting right like it's been one way forever um you know the tours way or the highway right and now you sort of have this disruption from the live tour just coming in and buying the top players and like getting them to play in their tournaments um from a Fan's perspective it's pretty rough like it's I don't I watch significantly less golf right like it's basically you know because you have the same PGA Tour tournaments but like half of the field which is you know you know half of like the top players let's say aren't there so now you know it's like yeah like you know who really cares yeah and then the live tour events are kind of small on like their team events and I don't even know where you watch them so I'm not really watching that either so it's good and bad I would say yeah probably good long term I don't know how anybody watches golf to be honest with you I like playing golf but like I don't how you can watch golf no offense man It's just tough um I I much rather play Yeah I'm watching you know it has to be Tiger's got to be on yeah yeah exactly um okay so I'm so glad you went with um golf as a fun fact I was going to remind you it's a family show um all right we'll cut that there before this digresses into anything anything else um all right so we have a few things going on first we were supposed to be on with qcp today but markets are absolutely tanking right now so they're gonna push we're gonna do another one with them on um Friday so this kind of threw us off but I figured we'd talk about like some of the stuff that we had planned to talk about anyway um so let's just jump into it uh just just to set the stage right now we have rallied um like crazy and today we've you know started to Nuke just you know typical slow Wednesday for crypto um Steve can you walk us through like what you've seen on flows and balls and that type of thing I know you have some slides prepared Absolutely I'll show my screen here yeah so sort of set the table for recent flows in the market you know to kind of zoom out a bit right we had the FTX collapse um in November and then which was a really high volume event like a lot of volatility obviously just like a lot of things going on then after that um volumes really came down um and people sort of stepped away from the market whether it's all together or just for a break and then this kind of parlayed into Christmas and like New Year's and the end of the year and really no one was doing anything and realized Vol is hitting like these new lows super like crypto evolved super boring um you know no no natural no natural interests or takers buy side was really quiet and we even ran an analysis to see like how much like inner dealer flows had increased and it was it was significant I mean it was like I think almost half the flows were just Market maker versus Market maker trading um and so you know kind of into the new year we've seen like a really really solid rally on spot across BTC and eth and I think the most refreshing thing right is just the return of natural interests along you know with this rally it's really brought people back to the table um and so I know last week we spoke about all of the the large top side flows and buying and this week it's it's sort of been a continuation of that you know up here I have some like foam there's definitely some fomo buying out in the market and people saying all right you know we're we're really gonna gig a rally here and like it's time to get long so um you can see some outright call buying a BTC as well as I thought these these risk reversals were pretty interesting sell put by call um you know they noted that uh you know they think that it's just a Delta trade right like we're just gonna really continue to to Pop um so people definitely have fear of missing out see a pretty big e print there and I think this week the call the call buying has definitely continued um but we have seen some downside flows as well now someone bought a ton of puts last week around the money pre-cpi and then we we rallied um and so we saw them close some of these out last night and early this morning in the U.S um and and start to roll this downside protection these outright puts to next month Steve so long the underlying and just hedge in the downside is that is that the right way to think of it yep yep yeah it's like it's likely that they're just hedging their their like if they have uh you know VC Investments or or like direct crypto Investments it's just kind of nuke protection yeah so from realize vol realized ball right like you can kind of see in in the bulk of this chart is super super depressed um I mean it was basically a floor down here uh trading below 20 which you know record lows again super low volumes just nothing nothing happening there um and then as we kind of rallied you know things started to get really interesting and and people started chasing top side and um it is brought ball back to the market and Justin as you were saying earlier you know like this morning you know we were rallying and now we're absolutely puking it back I'm sure that Vol will kind of you know continue to to inch higher and um yeah anticipate you know thing things to stay interesting here yeah I mean at least it honestly even though it's it's volatile and and we're like I'm my portfolio is going down right now um at least it's a bit of a dopamine hit right at least it's not just going sideways I mean that's like the boringness time and it's probably great for um you know for some I mean it's good for Vault Traders right if you're a good Vault Trader you're making money right now so that's good it's good for market makers right like it's good for everyone and again it's like okay you know there's stuff going on there's things to do this brings back the takers yeah um which ultimately is is the fresh blood that this Market needed post FTX that's right that's right yeah I think I think that's been an interesting thing from my side in terms of like the flows that I've been seeing is is a much kind of better mix of of kind of clients getting involved say that that's a nice mix of take a flow directional guys as well as just sort of those sort of playing Bowl um it's definitely it's definitely um yeah definitely interest is returned um to the start yeah I mean price will do that right um but we've also got narratives as well uh which which is really really cool to see um yeah awesome cool let's move on to the next slide so I guess I can sort of lead off a little bit with with sort of what what we're thinking around the macro and sort of what's been going on with that um so yeah I mean just to jump in on the macro um obviously we we kind of had quite a timely uh recording of the big picture last week and we talked about the um like the short gamma flows that and the potential for the pump we obviously got that pump over the weekend um and then you guys in the US were taking holiday and anyway take holidays so so early in the year but there you go um but so so obviously we had the weekend pump and what's quite interesting is everyone was talking about you know um it's a short squeeze it's going to get smashed and I think everyone comes this week thinking spot was going to get smashed back down we're obviously getting hit now with this doj story um but but from from the macro side so the actual sort of macro data continues to to sort of play out um you know that this whole Peak inflation uh Peak rates narrative Peak fed um which we've been talking about it's going to sort of spark sort of the a leg higher in risk and talking about the under positioning um a few a few things are really starting to take shape so um as you see if you go uh to the the chart with uh looking at two year rates um so this chart's been on my radar uh for quite a while uh because I keep saying that we can ignore that the FED are going to keep talking about um you know keep wanting us down that hawkish note because they don't want the market to front run them and they say transition from from this hike cycle to the pause um they they want to control the narrative around that so they keep coming out sounding hawkish and uh certainly politically I think they feel the need to keep sounding the the uh the sort of hawkish alarm on inflation and also everyone's still having these sort of volca flashback mirrors um so they don't want the market kind of easing uh too early but the voices say we need to listen to is that of the bond market and particularly at the moment loads of two-year yields um so this is quite a good read in terms of where where the bond market which is which is your best Economist is looking at things and where they think rates are going and just being in kind of keeping an eye on some interesting levels that we look to be breaking down so this sort of break below sort of 4 10 4 12 410 has been quite a big support level um I noted last week that if we actually there's sort of downside to or taking some of the Shine off the the sort of positive risk moves and crypto moves um was the actual we saw two eels start to move higher on Friday uh getting caught up in the whole sort of uh sort of euphoric sort of risk move that's now started to return um I was concerned about if we'd gone above 4 30 we've now broken down sort of below 412 today um so again I think this kind of continues to play in this sort of P greats narrative which is going to ultimately support crypto and the the other thing so we had the pump over the weekend everyone was talking about um you know do we fade here and I still I still think markets are trading this sort of 2022 Playbook and the games changed right the game has changed and we are in you know completely different sort of macro environment as we come into Wars and so we had uh we had obviously the us out on holiday on Monday but the big news that overnight I think kind was keeping everyone a little bit sidelined as a bank of Japan and all the conversations I was having with sort of macro guys certainly from the sort of Trad fire world was there was a growing expectation that the boj where I've kind of widen uh the band for yield curve control or completely lose it um and uh yeah that was that was kind of a fear now we've spoken before about the bank of Japan who fled like the yield curve control go you would have seen uh Japanese government bonds get absolutely smashed treasuries get smashed and risk would have been a [ __ ] show waking up this morning um as it was they they didn't do that um they kept things as they were and I kind of think that's a big risk event off the books so I was kind of looking at it yeah we're gonna start to Rally I think that same bonds rally so bonds is kind of ticking the Box in terms of this long duration move that we've been sort of championing and thinking that we're going to see um and crypto looks set to take off and then we've just kind of been hit um on these doj headlines just to interject I was checking Twitter the doj just announced that they are take because it's it's happening right now uh they're live streaming right now but they just announced they're taking enforcement action against the Russian exchange bits lato which I've never heard of so oh man we're going to rip on that because everyone was saying Finance also that I mean I mean I don't know it I don't think it's over yet the announcement isn't over yet but yeah that's like a Russian exchange no never no one's ever heard of so just like Peak fud going around on Twitter um one of the best Traders I know trades with an absolutely massive stack and he's just Anonymous on Twitter uh just said he's buying uh eth at 1500 uh in bulk so we'll see how that plays out over the next week mine mine mine yeah no definitely I mean look I've been we looked like we were set to take off um the rape story for me is super important we've seen this breakdown on the two-year which kind of sets up um for the liftoff the the other thing as well is say markets are trading is 2022 Playbook and it's the wrong Playbook and and 2023 is not 2022 um and Market's under position for the top side um and the the interesting chart now this isn't crypto but uh Bank of America uh do a survey investor survey and um and this just come out and and you can see um so uh this chart here is looking at um from funds in terms of their being overweight underweight U.S equities and you can see right now they're massively underweight us equities um you know sort of some of the lowest levels we've seen um since well it's level since financial crisis in terms of sort of running underweights so this this goes to show you just how much how bearish this Market is and um we were looking at open interest earlier obviously we've spoken before about in crypto we had that large sort of open interest I think about basically 50 of open interest rolled off in deck um we started to see that slowly build up um over the past week as sort of uh people kind of been drawn back into the market but I think the takeaway from from this is the market is massively under position for the top side in Risk generally and certainly in crypto um I think as we break levels higher yeah people are going to be sort of drawn into sort of chasing performance already because a lot of people would have been sidelined let's let's see how things go in the first couple of weeks and the macro is kind of turned as quickly to start this year as as kind of things turn if you remember last year and last year I kind of felt that uh crypto Led Led the kind of macro shift in terms of fed hawkishness and I feel cryptos leading again in terms of this sort of change in in macros as we sort of move towards the FED pause so I think the Market's massively underpositioned I think we're going to continue to see open interest sort of um sort of grow and and we're going to sort of break some some levels on the top side um the other thing that's interesting uh to me is actually right we can't we can't have this rally um and we can't get back into a proper bull market without retail coming back in and um and I'm not one for for these [ __ ] coins to sort of pump up but it was nice to see like the lack of Doge and Shibu and we had Bonk and so the other week um you know it it's a real sign that the retail interest is coming back to life and I think that's really going to complement what we're seeing on the institutional side yeah exactly I hope you're right from my my portfolio from my family's sake sir um yeah let's let's just say let's just take the doj don't ruin the party right now because because it's getting going Stephen just got his dancing shoes on I'm still I'm still trying to keep up you got your haircut for this I got the haircut for this yeah yeah David David you're looking fresh my man looking fresh um all right so uh any I kind of want to wrap this one up as quickly as we can but um or keep it like short and succinct any last thoughts or anything else you guys want to talk about so I think uh no I think I think we covered most of it uh one other note is you know to kind of go off the flows um we've seen in the beginning of this year BTC options dominating eth just in terms of interest um as as Bitcoins rallied more than eth um and so you can kind of see it here in this in this FL in this uh chart of of terabit open interest on the left here is BTC versus eth um and it's it's pretty clear that you know it's just tremendous buying with options and with with the vast majority of these being calls so really just just highlighting like how strong the top side bit has been yeah um you know kind of to start the year here do you can you tell um excuse me ignorance but can you tell like where most of these are being bought or do you have a do you have a chart for that yeah with what Tenors so this chart shows um open interest change for the last two weeks so roughly year to date and you know you can see that it's in March it's in these sort of 10 15 to like 40 Delta calls right just you know Prime top side positioning uh going out really really to about March so people really you know playing for playing for this rally to continue um a bit of downside buying just just that one outright uh 17K put there um but yeah just I mean so much interest in calls that's what I wanted to what I wanted to know so I love looking at I don't know if I said this but this is a material scientist chart um but I love watching these charts because you can watch different wallet sizes and when they start dumping or when they start buying this this was interesting to watch uh every single wallet size just started dumping over the last like four hours basically um and then watching the market you know move in tandem with that but yeah I thought that was interesting and that was the last thing I wanted to say um I think we just wrap this one up here since the three of us we kind of covered all the topics and we reconvene in a couple days
