[Music] hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hi guys welcome to the big picture my name is Joe Crewe I'm at Paradigm in the weeds around everything crypto ball markets joined here today by my colleague David quite a regular on the Pod now these days over in London as well as Sohan sen in Asia who's becoming more and more of a regular today on the podcast we have Adam and Nathan from two prime welcome guys uh just to start would love for you guys to just give a quick introduction for our viewers on your backgrounds and what you're doing over at two prime uh I'll go ahead and just intro myself my name is Nate Cox I'm the chief investment officer at two prime I've got a history in the traditional Finance markets like a lot of fund managers I think um focused on the rib side previously was the CIO and another fund that focused on volatility and Equity derivatives and index options trades uh and brought a lot of that into the crypto space in 2020 uh which is when I joined two prime uh and we kind of focus on a lot of the quantitative side of derivatives and ball trading in the crypto space very cool and I'm Adam thank you yeah uh Adam Richard uh director of capital formation at two prime uh between the crypto space for quite a few years and I've done a lot of different entrepreneurial things in the uh in the ecosystem uh worked on an investment bank and broker dealer prior to 22 prime in 2022 and it's worked on top rates and support from uh L1 protocols and uh worked on a lot of different uh infrastructure for digital assets and uh within the ecosystem and helping them get uh institutional adoptions so throwing the team a year ago and mainly focused on making sure that our clients are getting a good service and and make sure that we're all heading in the right direction awesome well welcome guys really really appreciate having you guys on so I guess we can just jump right into it let me just share my screen quickly so a bit so a bit selfishly an area that I'm super interested in yet you can't find a ton information on is crypto derivative usage for Bitcoin Miners And anecdotally this is kind of actually how I discovered crypto derivatives even existed you know going back a few years ago I've been doing some research on crypto mining firms and naturally thought similar to a Commodities company that is say selling in forward selling forwards to lock-in delivery rates I imagined that some of these Bitcoin mining firms could be using derivatives to lock in output prices through trading at futures or perhaps they're doing caller strategies overwrites Etc and through that research and that's how I even figured out there a bit existed and but then I attended Bitcoin Miami last year and I actually had the chance to speak with some minors and mind you that a lot has kind of changed in the past year but a few of these conversations that I had I asked them like how do you got so how do you guys using crypto derivatives like how are you guys hedging your exposure or even looking to yield and they kind of looked at me a lot of them like I had two heads they're like what do you what do you mean we don't do that stuff Bitcoin only goes up and it in a way it kind of felt like Glenn like a company like glencore not having a trading desk it was just like completely insane to me and we've all seen the news of minors struggling or even closing down operations and I'm just really curious to hear like how your conversations with mining entities has evolved like especially over the past year or so with you know the lower price of block rewards higher electricity costs and higher hash rate how are these guys thinking about it yeah this is a this is a great question I'll uh I'll give my two cents and I'll let Adam chime in as well because I know we we talk about this a lot with clients but uh it's been super interesting right so I totally agree and we've written some uh some papers about this but the mining industry in crypto has come a long way especially in the last year in terms of uh maturity towards using financial instruments and Structured Products to start to hedge exposure um you know I think if you asked anybody before 2021 this show strategy was basically this retail holder strategy because everybody just thought Bitcoin only goes up and to the right and uh you know the sort of institutionalization of Mining and the industry as a whole has matured extremely quickly um but they really are playing catch-up when it comes to uh hedging any kind of kind of exposure they have because they had this let's just mind everything we can we'll hold all of the Bitcoin we won't sell any of it and we're gonna make millions or billions of dollars and that was a great strategy until 2022 and all of a sudden you had some of the largest miners in the space core scientific things I think you know major players going bankrupt and uh it turns out that they had to do some growing up and derivatives are the way to do that obviously um you know Adam you could probably speak to some of the hash rate index derivative uh products that people like Luxor have come out with but uh yeah I mean it's you know we're trying to have this conversation more with minors specifically because they've had sort of this come to Jesus moment last year and when you look at things like cash rate and hash price uh it's sort of been forced upon them but I'm glad to see it happening because again these all of these things sort of push the industry to become more uh stable and more dependable uh you know we don't want to see these miners going out of business because they forgot that you should hedge exposure um so that's that's sort of the high level view that we've taken Adam you know you might have seen more about the hash rate index stuff I'm sure yeah and also say that you know when we first started talking to minors um you know what as Nate mentioned what we found was that a lot of them weren't really looking into it they weren't prepared to do it they didn't understand how to go about it uh what we also found with that the Bitcoin miners that did have more of a kind of institutional Finance background or more educated and and we're active doing something it might not be as sophisticated as a strategy that to Prime might deploy for them but it was good to see that you do have people in this industry that uh that do have some knowledge and experience but they're very very limited so I think there's a lot of Bitcoin miners out there that um that that need this Assistance or or you know can take advantage of the expertise that that companies like art can bring um and the other thing too is that we saw that everyone is really um no two miners have the same situation they all have different amounts of debt they all have different uh you know situations where they may want to um put Bitcoin that they're holding to work they may be having they may have a cell strategy and so uh they're selling the Bitcoin that they're Mining and so these two types of minors and variations upon each one of those um all have different um ideal uh goals that they're trying to achieve and so what we can do as manager is uh build a strategy for each one of them but then it's also great to see as Nate mention that companies like Locker are launching their uh hathbreak derivative products and which is a long head on on the price of Mining and so you're actually able to hedge the half rate itself um and the other half price okay and so this is the product that I think worked for a lot of miners because it really kind of distilled down the most important um Financial component of of their business and um and so to have a product out there that's getting to Market getting adopted and it's growing it's great and I think more and more can can leverage that uh but at the same time everyone is different and so they do need a solutions that are that are created for them as well right yeah that makes sense because I mean effectively for for a minor to sleep well at night right you need to be able to hedge in the BTC price uh Power markets are robust so you can you can you can head your electricity costs but you know the big one is is Hash rate and you know as you mentioned you know this is something Luxor is doing and from what I understand about it it's effectively just a cash settled confract contract for difference around this asset that they call Hash price and they Define hash price I believe as the amount a minor can expect to earn for a specific quality of hash rate so sellers can lock in their rates uh and they're and therefore their Bitcoin mining Revenue while a buyer can speculate on to play Devil's Advocate on it and like I come from an equity derivatives background for the ability for markets to build you need the ability to replicate the derivative yeah if I'm a market maker that's facilitating a hash rate derivative transaction how do I hedge this especially because the correlation between spot prices and hash rate has broken down if if I can't hedge this as a market maker how do I provide liquidity in this market do you guys have any thoughts around that uh I mean my initial thought is yeah this is the problem with uh hash rate derivative markets right now is and and we've had this conversation with uh some of the participants because while there may be you know the Market's essentially really one-sided right market makers don't necessarily want to take the other side of this trade because there's no way for them to lay off the risk um and so it becomes this like Chicken and the Egg sort of dilemma where um miners are more than willing to to sell the whatever the the option to to hedge out some of their hash price but uh there's nowhere for the rest of that market to say trade and and sort of um and really I guess there's not a lot of uh interest in sort of speculating on the long side because um if you're long hash price you're basically you are you are a minor um so it's a it's an interesting Paradox right now and we watch this too and you know I'll say I think the Mark's still pretty Mason I mean I'm you know I'm looking at I think they launched this relatively beginning of this year so I think there's a lot of room for this thing to grow and start to to get some traction but yeah I don't I certainly don't um purport to have any kind of solution to this right now I think it's there's still a an early Market you know I think the the reality is that the majority of Miners and and we talk to a good amount of them are still playing in the uh BTC derivative Market because it's the most robust in terms of how they can provide or sort of uh utilize these liquid hedging instruments what I will say and this is you know sort of moving back into the BTC the rib side is that what we see is there's more sophistication now uh around how miners can hedge so I think the most common thing that you know everybody knows about is sort of simple call overwrite strategies that everybody was using um but now as we talk to miners we're seeing them start to explore things like synthetic uh long Delta plays where they're selling spot to buy uh either a perp or buy uh like a call option or some sort of convexity um where they can guarantee cash flow for the business but still operate with some sort of long bias in the market um so those are the types of things that you know and then you have you know structures like put colors in these things where this is what's interesting to us is just see that the market is getting more sophisticated I'm sure the hash price index will will get legs over time but um it's you know it's like we're watching teenagers grow up right now and they're going oh yeah there's a bunch of things here we need to start to figure out yeah but you know that being said and that you guys really touch on this in your report is you know it kind of feels like the crypto derivative markets right now has strong parallels to the oil and gas markets and like the old the early to mid 70s you know before they really took off right you know this Market needs to figure out yeah uh yeah I mean I think we're confident there's certainly a need in 2022 shows that that people kind of need to get their um get their together uh if this is gonna be yeah you're gonna have a long-term sustained business model right yeah I mean yeah I have a yeah I have a question for nay actually so you mentioned a few different strategies that mine is used right I mean is it could you go into a little bit more detail about each of those like you know how exactly it would work with the call override and the put the collar and things like that sure I mean these are I would say pretty standard sort of hedging structures from a like an oil and gas trading desk right these are call overrides basically a way for them to lock in some sort of yield on their BTC which um is the only way for them to really generate this I would say that's more of a treasury management sort of strategy what we are starting to see is more of a cash flow management like uh they need to cover Opex so they want to they need to sell monthly production right to guarantee cash flow into the business and this is since 2022. nobody cared about this until 2022. all of a sudden when they're looking at basically break even they had to come up with a way to get cash in the door and so um Adam and I were talking about this earlier but Bitcoin is unique in that there's still a very speculative angle where you know oil and gas prices just generally are probably limited to a range or a ball that you know keeps in between ten and a hundred dollars a barrel let's just say right but Bitcoin is you know people are still speculating that it can go to pick a price right 50 100 500 million um and so miners are uniquely sort of we've been put in this position where they have to decide do I want to hold do I want to sell do I want to speculate long um whereas oil and gas the you know the ability for them to expand was basically lock-in capital reinvested in you know their production costs um so yeah I mean it's I think the structures that we're seeing now is like sell the monthly production buy calls or hold the monthly production hedge it out long put things like put callers where they're selling calls to finance we're you know we like to offer more bespoke things where uh if you look at like a call over right strategy over a long you know long period of time on bitcoin tends to be negative in terms of the net return so it's not super attractive but if you add a simple thing like selling positive SKU the returns go way up if you're just sensitive to when you're actually selling overpriced calls right um so these are the types of things it's it's a harder conversation to have because it's uh say A versioning you know industry or sort of it's a new language for miners but right uh if we can start to add a little bit of sophistication into how miners think about hedging that's what we're trying to bring to the table right that makes sense so I'm curious to hear so when you're doing your portfolio construction like what would you say the allocation mix generally of that is would you say investors are still much more interested in kind of over overriding selling calls or now you actually actually seeing these guys buy puts because some of the conversations that I've had with the big OTC desk is these guys don't want to buy puts yeah this this changes minor to minor and day to day at the end of 2022 everybody was like we gotta you know we've gotta hedge this downtime we've got a lock in price so they wanted to sell spot you know and maybe do some sort of like long call structure I mean Adam you were talking to I think two minors last week and you know they're they're now they're wavering between their bullishness and and so we have to present these you know different strategies where it's like well if you're if you're bullish will come up with the structure where it's really it's like yeah buy a put or put spread because they don't want to give up upside and this is like now this is a q1 conversation because the Market's turned and the bottom is in and FTX was the bottom and so it's crazy but that's the mentality that you are always presented with in crypto it's like this it's hard to shake this total or this specular you know speculative kind of mindset Adam I don't know if you had other uh thoughts on this but yeah the only other problem that is that you know it it's uncommon to find Industries where the business is like really taking a of putting themselves into a position where they're saying well we're going to take a Gamble and so we're presenting solutions to minors right now where we're telling them you need to choose right now like are you Barrett or are you bullet because that determines what we do for you and so you know there aren't many Industries like this and I think that the upside miners you know can potentially have if they are able to you know mind profitably today you know you have your huddle strategy um the upside is so big that they get advantageous for them to take advantage and um and it's it's a tough decision for them because clearly they want that upside of Bitcoin going to you know six figures um and so we do the best we can to help them out but they ultimately have to make some really hard decisions right that makes sense guys on the um on the downside but from these sort of miners you speak to um is there like a common kind of break-even price of Bitcoin um that that when you sort of speak to these guys yeah Adam do you want to comment on this I mean I have a rough idea but um I don't know I don't know if there's like a common prize but I've seen all over the map but um you know it's typically ranges somewhere between 8 000 to 18 000 you know per Bitcoin that's that's their cost of production for BTC um yeah I don't know negatively anything else to add to that but that's commonly I mean it's the we always ask people if they could choose a floor where they want it um I think you know when we were at 18 000 everybody was like 15 that's that's the opposite and now and now everybody's like 22 that's the absolute bottom we can't go below 22. it's interesting the size of the minor correlates closely to the price flow that they need and the bigger they are the higher the floor which really speaks to the cost of capital that they've taken on right these guys have debt obligations that yeah what we're seeing now is we're working with newer miners these guys are picking up machines on the cheap they're buying you know these collapsed guy you know they're taking in these machines at which is half price and they don't have these big debt obligations or at least that's it's not coming due so they're mining at yeah eight something like I mean they're mining at super cheap prices and then we were talking about this yesterday but you know everybody knows this but like Bitcoin is the natural solution for finding the cheapest power in the world so we were talking to guys in Texas but now we're talking to guys in Paraguay you know it's like it just finds the lowest common denominator of power price and all of a sudden the guy that was mining for eight cents is losing out to the guys that are mining for four and that's a hard thing you know it's a it's an interesting Market the other thing that you know we always sort of find out is that these guys are hedging against sort of nuanced power of generation models where I had never thought about this but like in the U.S depending on snowpack in Colorado depends on how much Hydro flows depends on how much power they get and so they're literally monitoring weather patterns and trying to hedge against the amount of snowfall they're getting so right now there's a bunch of snowfall on the west coast and they're like oh it's going to be a great year for power in America because there's been a lot of snow I mean and I'm like I can't believe we're basically trying to hedge the weather here but that's really how I mean it's crazy the guys the way they model this stuff it's like you're basically buying a call option because there's a whole lot of snow in Colorado this year on the energy side are they are they looking at hedging out some of the the sort of energy price risks as well yeah I mean they they definitely are and that's something that they try and um monitor pretty closely depending on how they're getting their power you know Adam you could probably speak to this better than I can but the sources of Power are so diverse that some guys are actively hedging and other guys are they get these really consistent flows Adam I don't know if you have other sort of insights there yeah not a whole lot I just I'm aware that there are quite a few minors that are hedging you know different energy source uh you know Futures uh so that it plays to their advantage yeah usually it depends on the construct of the pal like if they're getting coal versus if they're getting renewable renewable of such a uh uh inconsistent source that they tend to hedge more because they have to buy that power um right yeah interesting going back to the the Bitcoin derivative Market I would kind of elephant in the room and especially you know we're a paradigm all our volumes are there a bit right you know it kind of feels like a big inhibitor of minor derivative volumes is this you know inability to access you know these more liquid offshore exchanges where the vast majority of the volumes occur and I mean given the direction to travel this year it doesn't look like derivative access in the U.S is going to get any easier unless you stick with CME and the CME Futures data through like their commitment of Traders reports do show that miners are becoming more active there do you think this is going to continue to be the venue of choice where you know okay so the future is liquidity and CME is building the options liquidity is not yet there and we actually talked about this on a previous uh podcast but you know it's definitely could be the case that once you have the Futures liquidity in CME that that's going to trickle into the options liquidity on CME do you think that is going to be the venue of choice or do you think most are just going to choose to remain OTC because we know there's a massive flows there going up OTC as well yeah great question that's like the billion dollar trillion dollar question right it's I mean I would love to think that it's going to move to yeah OTC and CME I I see what you're seeing like it's trickling in but it's certainly not flowing in at the rate that it needs to and it's certainly not enough to hedge the exposure of U.S miners uh we have conversations with a lot of these guys uh you know not to there's the ability to set up offshore entities that can trade in you know on derabit I have my own concerns with the longevity of that type of structure especially given the whatever Fallout with uh Finance right now and the way that cftc is sort of cracking down on these offshore entities um you know I think over the long Arc I I have to believe that it's gonna you know come to these more say legitimate venues and certainly OTC desks are probably reaping the majority of the benefits right now but I'd like to think that you know in a matter of say two years or three years we're going to see the CME be the main venue for some sort of liquid um centralized Central limit order book for listed to Ritz because you know it's just sort of the necessary uh exchange for these guys to to Really operate and to grow and to do it sound and and successfully it's the same thing it's sort of the analogy we made with with oil and gas it's like oil and gas's ability to grow was based on their ability to hedge you know because it creates sustainable Financial models that they can depend on year after year the problem that we all saw last year is that guys that were flush disappeared in months I mean days whatever you know and things that happened that never would have thought would be possible um it basically just crushed these guys that they didn't have a plan I mean and that's you know we're dealing with the Fallout of that right now and and it'll sort of Splinter the uh the mining markets all over the world but ideally we have these sound sort of financial markets that can support mining in the US because and this is me being you know sort of uh maybe whatever essential to to pushing for U.S um uh normalization for mining but I want to see that happen I mean it's just imperative for sort of the security of the network and and things um you know continuing to grow and that up into the right price trajectory that's the kind of stuff we want to see cool uh David so on any any final thoughts around the ash rate to rib stuff if not we can kind of move in briefly to I think Shanghai merged slated for for April 12th so if you guys don't have any comments yeah brother Thomas we can go into that not now good enough is really interesting guys hearing about that thank you cool okay uh so so very briefly uh so I've read your February digital asset digest and I think I read you guys saying that you like being long into the eve Shanghai upgrade on April 12th and I think we can all agree that you know while this is good in the long term as the ability to actually withdraw your state Thief is is massively important into growing the staking ecosystem but in the short term there are arguments that it could lead to some pressure as well and there's there's more and more chat chatter about this I'm curious to hear what your thesis is around this sure um I mean I could tell you my my thesis and then the trade structure that we like and and Adam you may agree or disagree but I tend to think that what comes out of eth will be replaced by what goes in uh I think that you know institutions like us if we had Solutions where we could stake and then use staked collateral to trade uh that would be huge so if you have institutions with thousands or tens of thousands of these sitting on the sideline because I can't put it in because there's a liquidity mandate that I have but now it becomes liquid I think there's a huge supply that would be able to come into the ecosystem for steak teeth um so yeah I guess the trade I like would be long Delta short Vega which is I think it's uh basically a non-event from the vaal side I think it's like a sell the April 14 Vault and and maybe belong the back end ball are back in Delta but uh that's the structure that I like to trade in right interesting Adam I don't know if you have thoughts on on just sort of what's going to change when it when it goes live but uh yeah no no no I'm I'm in line with your thinking on this one yeah I mean I mean just even speak what about you guys we we've seen very little uh interest in like okay like oh need to get we've seen a lot of trade pitches on it it's kind of floating around yeah in the market of oh okay like this guy let's get long get long eat fall but there certainly hasn't been a lot of you know action and there there certainly isn't really like even a term structure Kink going on I mean just look at the eth BTC spreads yeah right how much that is compressed yeah you know the fundamental thesis everybody is following is is much more Bitcoin and that digital gold narrative and you know all these Banks blowing up I think people are looking at that um much more than they are eth we have been seeing some eth upside being bought lately yeah this is this is people covering short the short BTC spread like this is like Risk reducing sort of flow rather than people actually adding adding risk but like I don't know it's like this is where like having a PhD in like behavioral fine Finance would pay out right like you need to have like the reality is so like at current spot levels and this is this so patuta these guys do some pretty good research around around this stuff and at current prices you know roughly half of the liquid state to eat right now not not stuff that was in Lido is up money while the other half has lost one and out of the losers a large percent of these people were staking at you know prices of 2400 and above and you could make this argument that people that stake there are going to be more likely to be paper hands and have a higher marginal propensity to sell than somebody who staked that 500 and is in it for the long term right you need to have like these assumpt these assumptions and strong beliefs where like okay you need to believe this is the amount of outflows that I think that are going to come as a result of this and and selling and then you also need to have this view of if there's going to be enough inflows to really catch that sustained selling pressure over the long term um for me I don't have a PhD in behavioral Finance so I don't know but the reality is at least what we're seeing on on Paradigm is like people really don't care uh at this point you know this is kind of a non-event yeah right yeah I mean we spoke about this before on this show and like I'm I'm kind of with you guys in that I I actually see it as being probably like a more positive event um because all of a sudden it frees up people to actually stake um because they're not losing liquidity um in return and then I'm I'm kind of of the view that um the risk of sort of selling I think would be higher if if spot prices were higher um I kind of think if you were willing to sort of lock up your wreath uh for kind of an unknown amount of time um You probably you probably are a hodler um and yeah yeah and like if if I think with my own sort of State these um when I when I was staking that uh the consideration I had or the concern I had was what if we get some kind of City move you know sort of post merge where Heath goes on a massive tear and and actually I'm like I want to sell some of this like and lock in some of this money um obviously we're not we're not there and and so now you go okay you know you kind of leave it so yeah I think if you're a hodler with a long-term View and we're probably nowhere near those levels where you would have thought maybe that's the levels I'd start maybe sort of locking some of this this p l in um yeah I kind of feel that that you're gonna the the cell the sort of sale pressure is not going to be so huge um and then on the on the flip side I think there's going to be sort of more institutional money we'll start to stake um and certainly offset and he said in pressure the the other thing is looking to jump in the the other thing um that that I've sort of been thinking about is if you were concerned if you were staking and obviously you know price goes up then we're all happy but if you're concerned about the downside um and you've got your sort of eth locked up then potentially you're going to be buying sort of puts as your hedge to that so I actually wonder whether Len like through the event you start then to take off those Hedges so you see a lot of selling of puts and um and that in itself might actually kind of be a positive sort of uh driving force behind each um but yeah just I don't have any thoughts on that but just uh yeah I mean not just puts I mean also just you know basis plays right you know selling your blood a lot of things yeah selling the perps or the fixed fixed stated uh maturity I think I think it's a potential Catalyst for that basis to continue to go negative um yeah I mean I I think I think for me I think we like we this is this is like a big risk event right I mean one one side is right one side is wrong or um you know like uh it could go in either way I just don't understand how that spread can be that tight the ETC beats uh PGC spread right because I mean if you if you really look at it you're paying a two-ball premium uh for ease uh for a month I mean it just doesn't seem like that's the right price right because I mean everyone is focused on the digital gold um you know angle but like for that two balls you're buying you know the ability to you know some some disaster happens or some very bullish event happens like over over the merge I I just don't see how that cannot be a good trade I mean that's that that's basically the option premium that you're spending right two balls dude it was trade Ethan was trading two balls under like it was like insane how cheap this stuff was yeah yeah you know it's crazy I mean it happens in all markets um and like you know if you think of of options premium as being Insurance you know and you don't buy insurance when your house is burning down and then we we see like time and time again where you know nothing happens and then we'll be like a week away from the event and then everyone's scrambling to to buy that premium and you're like like guys you know the time to do it was was actually when it's pretty cheap yeah right and there's like like throughout my career there's like countless examples like where I'm speaking to guys saying you know we've got this big risk event coming up should we not be buying some some optionality on this oh yeah and then you know a week later everything's blowing up and bowls are blowing up and everyone's and this is big scramble then to to kind of um sort of by the vole but the problem is the Woodstone performed because we we've been in this positive spot vile correlation and dealers are long to the hill to put right they're the long all this put in just um put inventory and then as as we go lower the Vols come off right so you can have these moves where like you have a three or four percent move lower then your puts are lower in value so that that's a like that we've been seeing that yeah I think as a vol play um I could definitely see that going you know going uh you know like they could there could be downside right uh on on these on these traits but like I think it's not like that spread right like there is a chance that this just blows up to like 50 volts right like that spread just goes 50 volts right so you're paying a two volt premium right I mean that's that's kind of the way I'm thinking about it right how much can you potentially lose on this right well dude if another bank if I don't know another bank goes under we have all this short gamma to the upside in BTC right like all these you know 32 to 35k strikes that have been lifted and by take your wallets that are massive and if we start to Rally we'll come back and try to push it higher right I could see how it can get a squeeze could get pretty nasty in BTC pretty quickly I see so so I guess the the worry here is that you you get squeezed on this particular strike right on this particular strike risk right my point is I would not sell I would not sell BTC ball against it like sure if you if you if you believe like okay yeah like you want to be long ball into the event yeah you're gonna have to carry that I would not touch short BTC at the moment especially the upside stuff yeah well I mean I think quite a quite a yeah it's a I mean this is clearly why it is where it is yeah right I mean just um I mean yeah I'm just I'm not really thinking about Strikers I'm not thinking about dealer hedging I'm just saying like you know if I wanted to if I just wanted to hold if I wanted a cheap trade into into the into them into the upgrade right I mean to me this seems this seems like a beautiful trade um you know to put on um I think you can also construct it and like because I was thinking about it like how exactly to play it right I mean I was thinking like maybe like put versus put um and just take like a a directional uh directional view like as when you buy the E uh you buy the eat put and then Finance it by selling a uh uh like a PTC put then you kind of get out of this whole like you know negative gamma thing that you're yeah you know what's going to happen right like I mean really you know if you're really buying the Hedge I mean it's the that everyone sells right the moment it becomes uh uh what when you can uh when you're on Clan stake uh and then that's going to be a move to the downside right so I mean I I I was thinking that but um yeah look I mean I I also recognize that um there is some risk here um maybe it's worth yeah going into the chart uh you know on this cool well we'll price it out yeah we'll price this one up after we get out I'm like yeah we could go to short BTC puts long eight foot yeah yeah it is it is like yeah yeah I like that as well so it makes a lot of sense um I think as well it is super interesting just the the lack of um conversation or interest from clients around it um and I know like we say this Bitcoin gold narrative um is just captured everyone's attention also as well I think the other thing is is right now is is Bitcoin it's just the cleaner play on everything right like you know get gen's the one in a label everything the security about Bitcoin so you've got kind of got the risk around that and I just kind of think it's yeah the focus it just feels an easier trade right now to be playing sort of Bitcoin Vol I guess um and then there's lots of complexities around the different outcomes wreath and you like you know Traders generally without offending any any of them are pretty kind of simple characters right um and think in terms of risk reward and it kind of just feels an easier play to be sort of playing about in Bitcoin involved right now but then often that's where where opportunity lies if people's eyes are elsewhere yeah it's interesting Bitcoin has become like the it's like it's got multiple narratives now where you have the sort of macro narrative with um you know it's the Bitcoins gold you know it's a It's like a downside hedge against Fiat right but then it's also got uh it's the you see all these alts that are basically underperforming flat not they're just not doing anything which you know what we're talking about is you know you see in liquidity come out of alts for a number of reasons but almost like a it's like a regulatory hedge right where if you have coinbase getting a Wells notice Finance getting sued by cftc and people are speculating whether or not these are going to be like good places to keep their money cracking cool and everybody's like you know something facing all of these guys well cool I want to consolidate and where they go BTC and then you know you sort of put the the market structure angle on top of it where you've got this like short gamut trade and the whole thing just it just keeps building like these multiple narratives that it makes it dangerous to try and solve all I mean uh I was so on would you take the other side where you would be long BTC calls short eth calls on the on the flip side of that trade yeah look uh I mean uh I I I I I always like these kind of correct no directional of all trades right I mean I I I I I I just just seems always like uh yeah you can always spin a story on them um but honestly I know the eth downside was the was the right trade the upside I mean I I mean it sounds like this is a very scary position um you know which uh you know which everyone's talking about so yeah I'm I'm I'm not I'm not sure I would do that on on the top side either because um yeah yeah I mean it's easy to see the the top side being capped sort of like that you know big 2.0 merge was kind of a non-event or at least all of the Delta was into the to the event and then after that it was just sort of it was dead um but I agree I probably wouldn't I wouldn't trade the top side I'm a little bit scared about selling uh you know like that leg uh because I I you know like I always think like these these stories right I mean just because we had one eat event which like the merge which was a non-event yeah right like I kind of think people are just like kind of forgotten about these things and they think it's all going to be irrelevant I mean yeah one bad story and like some something fails you know like uh you forget the unstaking like maybe it's delayed or like you know I don't know yeah yeah so how you sound traumatized by 2022 still I am I am just like oh yeah 2022 all these stories like that's lurking around the corner now yeah yeah it's crazy how it's changed now too it's like uh these stories you know the things that would have just crushed the market three four months ago it's like BTC is bulletproof now I'm almost like Finance getting oh that was the biggest it was just like oh my God it was amazing yeah I thought that was going to be a yeah right like and then yeah yeah on straight back right yes yeah people are just warming up to the reality like this isn't anything new of the US cracking down on crypto it the the center of gravity is just gonna move East yeah you know Dubai Hong Kong Singapore and either at this point us doesn't want to play ball so other people will and I think other regulatory bodies kind of smell the blood in the water if you will right China sold the highs with the with the Bitcoin mining and then now they're buying it now they're buying the loan they're buying the lows great trade on China's part yeah I mean it is it is super interesting like like the the yeah the lack of sensitivity now to these headlines out in the US I think Market's just kind of numb to it um and yeah we sort of move on move on pretty quickly I think we're all kind of comfortable with the idea that okay fine you know if the US doesn't want to play ball then crypto is going to like probably build outside of the US and like you say Jay you know um you know we've seen Hong Kong actively engaging with banks around crypto um certainly in in Europe and here in London you know you're seeing governments and Regulators take quite a consultative approach and they're quite open in kind of trying to sort of draw up a regulatory framework so so yeah I I think there's there's a lot of positive offsets to what the US are doing um which is interesting one thing I I was watching that I think is going to be really interesting obviously we've seen um like like Ripple the last couple of days has sort of outperformed and can you imagine if if they if they sort of win that case against the SEC I mean that's going to be a real kind of positive um development for this space and it I mean it yeah it sounds like it's been going pretty well so yeah I mean yeah I think there's like binary risk for you know Regulators right now that if it's almost like the loss is is priced in but the win is the surprise to the upside so if yeah uh Ripple or I mean I know coinbase hasn't even gotten started but you know from what I've been reading it's like they've got a pretty good case um to to fight but uh yeah it's just super interesting it's like man these These are catalysts to the upside um I am curious I mean as a you know as a US citizen I'm like I I don't want to see everything leave because then that means I gotta go somewhere too probably but uh but yeah it's uh it's crazy to think that we would regulate uh crypto out of the states but but yeah I mean who knows anything can happen you know like Finance they have one of their market makers like 12 and a half percent of their you know daily volumes or something like that and like you'd think that would be a pretty crippling blow to somebody like binance but I'm sure I guess at this point they can just get that flow from uh you know Hospital market makers now right yeah and and look I mean we'll still a bit away we'll see what happens in 2024 right I mean the santhis is the leading yeah a GOP candidate right now and you know he's Adam you're from Miami right right and he's he's the leading candidate and he's certainly more more Pro crypto right so these things can also just change Administration Administration I mean that's true now Biden and uh this Administration is just playing defense you know yeah but Money Money Talks at the end of the day like yeah what's what's the saying about politicians like they they'll they'll get the right answer once they've exhausted everything else or have you like I think they'll get on the end and once once they see like other jurisdictions kind of making Fortunes in the space um the the pressure will come from Banks as well because they'll they'll want to play in it um and yeah money talks and you know yeah it's kind of laughable when you know you've got the second that sort of you know parading as on this kind of moral Crusade like I think once the um yeah once once they see others making money the the sort of green eye Envy will be there and things will change quite quickly yeah you know about what this you know whole consultant consultancy like uh way that uh Eastern Regulators are going right so in uh so there's a conference in Hong Kong right now um and uh the regulator actually reached out to a bunch of banks to uh Banks and you know crypto players to you know basically say how should we regulate into uh into the uh into you know to have a digital asset license right and it was a it was a literal call out and it's like a round table where people are like what what would you suggest is your best way to regulate right so um you know which is which is a very very different approach right which is you know it's much more like a collaborative uh you know uh you know way of uh you know dealing which yeah I think it's like uh you know as David was saying it's like a real stark contrast to the to the US um yeah and uh yeah people literally were like well we should put in place something stringent so that we don't have another FDX happening because I mean that that kind of you know that that was I mean FTX you know like was for the longest time in Hong Kong right so um yeah it's it yeah I I thought it was a great uh a great uh you know like headline uh to hear that all right cool I think this is a a good place to end it it's been it's been about 45 minutes uh I think it was a very very thoughtful and productive conversation so really appreciate uh Adam and Nathan hopping on uh and maybe we'll do it together soon
