everyone welcome to the big picture the podcast where we talk about micro Market structure as well as macro markets and today we have our third co-host back Joe welcome back to the show we missed you on the last one and we also are joined by um GSR Trader Chris Newhouse Chris thanks for coming on man thanks for having me appreciate it um so before we like dive into all this like Chris like why don't you just give us a background so people know who you are and like what you do sure sure so I'm a Trader at GSR we're in OTC trading platform as well as ecosystem partner token Market maker we really specialize in altcoin ball um a little bit about me so I was previously at Genesis trading for a year as a sales and trading guy and then hopped on their research team to finish up uh joined GSR back in May and then I'm writing some educational articles for Paradigm and then uh also writing some weekend insights for a dare bit nice nice perfect cool man well let's I mean we got a ton to talk about today I think so we might as well not be around the bush and just jump right in Joe you were saying beforehand before we jumped on this podcast there were some interesting uh flows that are happening I am probably around the CPR current that just came out so why don't you take us through those yeah absolutely I got a couple slides for us too we can kind of talk about let me just share that quickly all right cool well Chris thanks for joining um like we said a lot a lot to talk about over this past week uh I think we'd both agree that you know I mean despite looking at this picture and seeing how lethargic the balls look you know the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life uh especially this week a lot of positioning and trading you know around the CPI prints and you know the front end Vol is the beginning of the week we're trading in the 30s I mean Jesus like really really really low uh and what we've been seeing on Paradigm in terms of flow is you know significant you know Vol buying you know just given the absolute level of alls but you know the set the sad part is right like yeah they're really low but like you can't say they're they're exactly cheap when you know the seven day realized when I looked on Tuesday and you know before the big rally that we saw ahead of the cpis was like 16 right yeah it was less than a one percent move per day like we've kind of been joking you know like it kind of feels like crypto ball is like having its like 2017 moment you know similar to when SPX realized was you know trading in an eight handle for most of the year and you know the market would move one percent and everybody would be like oh my God this is great like Market's moving again like I'm curious just what your opinion is like you look at this chart right like what's hap what's gonna happen in crypto walls this year like generally I know I know it's a loaded question and it's difficult like are we gonna pick up from here like are these the lows like are we gonna kind of chop around a little bit I'm just curious to hear your your Trader opinion on it yeah yeah no I think you're definitely right there was some interesting flow that came into the markets this week as well as last week I mean this week I can tell it was a little bit probably more so CPI positioning just looking at the x-rays right so we saw the January 27th expert in Bitcoin had some decent like upside call Flow 18 19 K range just people just straight up buying it um the other interesting flow I saw that was a little bit more long term and also had me kind of interested in what the market positioning was and kind of like the thought process behind it was this massive block of 400 youth puts for like the June expert that was something that I was also very interested in as well and like as as we know options are a very multi-faceted tool they might not just be betting that each nukes to 400 um there's a lot of different ways they can profit off of a situation like that in terms of like yeah yeah exactly you read a lot of Twitter chat around flow like that it's just like oh my well like you know they they think it's going they bought these so they think it's going to 400 like it's it's very especially when you get like to the wings there right it's very much like a ball and skew trade and so many other ways in which this trade can make money and you know kind of like from the seat when you don't actually know who like the end user is and kind of what his intentions are sure you can you can speculate so many things but like a lot of the times it's more complicated than just oh you know we need spot to go down yeah yeah exactly actually can uh can one of you just kind of dive into how someone would profit off a trade like that is it just like a televian uh tail buying type thing or was it something else well Chris put out a really good thread on it so I'll let I'll let him yeah yeah so it was there's kind of a bunch of different ways to profit on that so first of all like you've got the very obvious one is like okay if the market start starts dropping and nuking and it starts going like starting it could be like just a Delta BET right so hey maybe and it's long term enough that maybe that's maybe what it is um but then there's also a bunch of different ways to profit in terms of like you were talking about like these skew and buying Tails historically right now let's just you know take a look at skew and what's what's going on in that market for eth we're kind of starting to Pivot a little bit more towards the call range in terms of calls maybe almost flipping to calls at the 25 Delta level you know trading at a premium um but now uh so like historically uh you know you could say that kind of puts a relatively cheap and this environment and like one of the big things is like you don't buy protection when you need it in the markets you buy it whenever you can and like liquidity is definitely a factor because if we start nuking like as you saw with FTX liquidity can kind of dries up especially in the options market so hey maybe this was a skew trade maybe it was a directional bet but if he was interested or if uh whoever that was was interested in buying kind of protection maybe this was a decent Point historically to start buying it in terms of like callsky's pretty elevated um so that's definitely something I was thinking about whenever I saw that trade so I guess ways to profit could be adults a bet could be someone just betting like hey I think that the market probability is going to increase in terms of like maybe we have more of a likelihood to hit a downside move in the next couple of months and I could prop it off that um but yeah that's kind of what I was thinking whenever I saw that yeah and going back to your point on like the 25 Delta skew like of course like you know the you know the given the lack of realize and movement in the market you know it's in given you know the skew is coming off of you know being completely jacked up after the FTX event but like you know there's a pretty big overhang in the market right now that like you know maybe we won't like get into too deeply here right like the fact that like the SKU is going like towards the calls and you have this from like massive overhang with like dcg like is this a sign that like okay even if this you know does kind of happen to be like one of the like a worst case scenario they go under you know it's the Market's belief that like you know this really hasn't even gonna be like too much of a spot event for this of course there's a lot of implications here with what happens with the gray sales sake and and things like that and pressure on on BTC but it's just surprising to me that like the market like as this bankruptcy has kind of seemed to get priced in a little bit more and like all this Twitter chatter with you know the Winklevoss letters that you know the SKU is going towards the cause and continues to do so like what's your view on that yeah no I feel like this is definitely something Market microstructure wise in crypto and I feel like the in the crypto of all it seems like people are really quick to get over like these very big tail risk events like FDA X luna 3ac I mean you can look at it here like it was a massive spike in front of like uh the at the money weekly balls that kind of just corrected pretty quickly and then we trended into like a very low ball environment um so that's definitely something like I feel is just a crypto thing in terms of like we have these massive events and people are really quick to forget them like yeah I can't really Goldfish Memory yeah I mean it's like the ball of all is just completely nuts right like I was on the the equity options desk uh an equity options tax when March 2020 happened right and like you know we went to pretty deep and quick recession as as we all know s p moving 15 a day but like the the extent of the Vol mean reversion you know s p you know Vols were still trading in like the you know mid-20s you know high 20s for quite some time and then in crypto like as you mentioned you have like Luna Luna happens three Arrow happens FTX happens and then you have this big spike but then the the degree in which the implies reset is just crazy to me I think that as well was spoken about before right um I think a lot of deleveraging happened post Luna um so I don't think there's so much leverage in the system and trading's always about like the marginal trade the marginal Trader um at I still say um you know the Market's sort of skewed quite bearishly at the moment so when we have these events it's kind of well if we've we've taken out a lot of Leverage um that skews that kind of way then where's the kind of marginal trade to to give that another leg or to give that trade another leg which is why I actually think you know we're in this we're kind of in this weird world now where you know we we actually see fold pick up when when markets are moving higher which you kind of tend to think you know Vols typically sell off when you when you climb and and pick up because the skew is always we sell off harder and you tend to rally um so yeah I think there's an element of of that leverage already coming out of the system and um and we're just a lot cleaner now yeah no that's a that's a fair point um you know you kind of tend to see that in equities as well where you know you you get the sell-off and sure floating Strike balls are you know going higher but you know it's more so just spot you know moving down the skew but then like the fixed strikes don't move because you know you have all these Pension funds and things like that you know that basically already long a bunch of these you know downside you know put trades right and then as the market sells off they're actually selling both right and then that ends up you know moving the ball lower so you know there is definitely an element of that but I I guess just moving moving on you know Chris kind of touched on this you know the the big prince in terms of like what what are we seeing this week you know it's it's definitely apparent to us that taker interest is starting to increase a little bit and look Let's cross our fingers that it's just not all trading you know ahead of like the CPI and then things are quiet for another you know another few weeks and until you know the next CPI print let's hope that's not the case but I would definitely the Marquee prints in the market on Tuesday you know this BTC Jan 27th well this 18K and 19k call Chris what was really surprising to me was how well the market absorbed these trades right like in terms of Delta it was like 900 BTC to buy it and like these things were bought pretty quickly you know it was basically kind of lifting the first offer it could find and you know it didn't really seem the market move really moved on you know the dealers need to dealt the Hedge you know and then additionally I mean you look at the fixed right Vols right didn't seem like they had too much of a strong reaction either it was just a little bit surprising to me yeah and that's why I specifically think that the person who put this trade on in terms of this gamma buying for maybe the CPI move I think they put it on in the January 27th expiry specifically because there was a lot of liquidity there that's like the big X3 in terms of what's going to happen this month looking at open interest and seeing what kind of option flows out there otherwise like I feel like if they wanted to get like direct exposure to CPI maybe they would have taken the you know January 13th or January 14th expiry but like what I noticed in these this kind of like strike range and open interest is the January 27th open interest was greater than or like very close to being greater than the January 13th January 14th and the February 24th expres all combined so I think that yeah the re I feel like this was definitely like a factor of liquidity in terms of why they chose this kind of strike in expiry yeah yeah absolutely and and for our viewers so in in terms of what tends to be the most um active and in terms of OI the largest in terms of in crypto options it tends to be the end of month expertise so even despite the fact that sure like you're paying time value Beyond you know the event which occurred this morning on January 12th you know given the fact that you're getting better liquidity out in Jan 27th you know you have guys you know potentially looking at that bucket as well and willing to pay for that time value uh despite the fact that the event is happening you know two weeks prior to the expiry because they're also missing the fomc with this this expert right like they're they're gonna miss that event so that and I feel like that's a pretty big event that's gonna like have a big impact on the market and they completely miss out by getting this expert yeah but so in terms of the most interesting trade of the week so like sure like like these Jan 27 big but four P so at 4 pm so look at this tray on Wednesday this BTC Jan 12 18 000 call so it was like 4 P.M eastern time we just started seeing you know somebody come in and lifting clips of like 70 to 100 of these Jan 12 18 000 calls and keep in mind so the expiries on derabit actually happen occur overnight so this is this experience of January 12th didn't even capture you know the CPI print right and we saw these things getting lifted for like seven to eight basis points and we're like despite the fact that you know it doesn't capture CPI you know we had a lot of questions being like who which makers are like willing to sell this thing right at seven to eight basis points and then lo and behold lo and behold after these go up you know two hours later the market rips to 18 200 Market rips 400 points this trade was a 20 bagger it went from seven basic points it was about seven to eight basis points and then eight hours later at expiry they were worth like 240 dollars yeah that's crazy I remember looking at my phone too I was like dude what just happened like it's just rallied Bitcoin just rallied I completely missed that trade actually the uh the 18K calls coming through so that is that's crazy to see that for sure it's almost like it's it's like kind of like there's there's a lot of this from crypto drives where it's just kind of like self-fulfilling trades right where it's you know January 12th off expiry right lift the you lift a bunch of these these things were a five Delta when they were bought and then the market starts to Rally right and I think the the mar the market starts to Rally you know dealers are just getting increasingly short gamma they need a hedge and then it basically just Engineers this uh you know feedback loop where the market G just keeps going and going so yeah interesting trade that that we saw ahead of the ahead of the cpis but again as we said you know the trade the trade didn't even capture the expiry um but and then just this morning so this was a big one not I didn't really see anybody talking about this on Twitter um actually sorry about that so it looks like the sizes are wrong uh but it's 20 000 of the Jan 27 1300 puts then 10 000 of the 1350 and then ten thousand twelve fifty so these printed at 7am this morning so like I mean we talk about like the eth 400 June 400 puts like being a big trade this is like multiple times bigger right like because this is hand 27 like close to the at the moment closer yeah so a lot more risk on this one that's interesting so what do you so what do you think you're you think that this person is just expecting us to come back down off this rally they're just fading I think it's more of a portfolio hedge if I'm but interesting yeah I I don't I don't think it's necessarily you know a tactical play um you know because you know they're buying across strikes right you know they're they're putting some of their hedge allocation into you know the 50s some into the 1300s some into the 1250s um no it kind of just seems more just more so like portfolio hedging flow but you know it's tough to know right yeah yep that's yeah that that's um that's really it for me I Chris I saw you put out a Twitter piece or like literally like 30 minutes ago about how like the gamma is going to be expiring you know after Friday and then the market might be in the kind of like a short you know more probably flattish to Shorter shorter gamma pocket you want you want to talk a little bit about that one yeah yeah sure so that's something I noticed is kind of like how much gamma is going to be expiring um so like right now if you take a look at it on like uh amber date or whatever the around the 18K strike for Bitcoin like pre- January 13th expert it looks relatively neutral like there's a decent bit of like short game a decent bit of long gamma but after this X3 that happens on Friday heading into next week we're going to be short gamma Pockets like throughout the entire range of 16 to 18K so in terms of like what I'm seeing happening right now is we have a lot of stability in the market right now on this X3 with this like single dated short-term gamma expiring on Friday and I'm thinking that there's definitely going to be a lot more volatility in the market next week hopefully uh you know after the CPI it seems pretty it seems pretty like you know you call them now that the CPI has happened and we're kind of just trading where we were before the CPI in terms of like day to day or I guess like like right before the CPI to right now um but I'm very interested to see how it kind of plays out next week because also what we're seeing in terms of the liquidation so I just use like coin glass for liquidations the past couple of days just shorts have been getting liquidated shorts have been getting liquidated shorts have been getting liquidated like I'm wondering like where's the next trigger for these shorts to get liquidated or how much is left in the market because I feel like there's maybe just a pocket of air between like 18 5 and 20K before that next like 20K resistance is kind of where people are targeting so I'm interested to see where we're going to play out next week after this expert being Shore gamma um especially like if we make any slight moves higher yeah yeah and and just speaking about you know that short gamma trade so up on the screen here there was somebody that that traded this one day calendar around the CPI you know they bought the Jan 12 and sold the Jan 13. right so a thousand of um of that one printed certainly adding to that Dynamic of of dealers being long that 13 Jan gamma right yeah yeah it was 13 Jan um eighteen thousands that dealers are long then the same thing happened to Ethan about 15 000 contracts but you know once that rolls off the board as Chris said you know hopefully that positions us for a rally you know especially kind of looking at the short liquidations as well but it's kind of all for me cool man all right well um why don't we get into some some macro stuff then and then we can all get out here and get on with our day okay so before we get into macro stuff I have some charts to share because I have an interesting conversation with uh Material Science say so this is this will lead into like what what uh I have some questions for you David basically okay so basically like real time but by the way just we need to get Material Science on here and uh I know it's interesting as well I like I like his I like his uh heat map charts and they're pretty cool he's he's like a wizard with with data stuff like he's he's amazing um so so here's my thought real time unemployment is lagging like material and I were talking about this over the weekend actually um and what we were kind of discussing was that we believe that unemployment is actually already up um and it's up by a lot so we were polling charge actually he was pulling a bunch of data I don't know if you guys can see this but um he was pulling a bunch of data from Twitter so like anecdotal data so we were we um he used chat gbt to find out what someone would type in and into Twitter if they were unemployed um and it came up with all these ideas like this is what this is the Tweet you would put out and so we started um finding this data on Twitter itself so we use like keywords like can't afford right and these are all tweets that came up um with can't afford in them and he marked off like okay this was Christmas 2020 this was Christmas 2022 and this is right before 2023 or whatever so you can see that people were tweeting I can't afford things like they couldn't afford Christmas presents and the spike is massive so it's not just the Christmas thing it was a specifically this year thing that there was a massive spike in people talking about not being able to afford you know Christmas presents basically are you sure you're not just filtering for um crypto Twitter post FTS is that the anomaly that's what I asked him too I was like are you sure this isn't we're all just poor after FTA I don't know maybe maybe too soon but yeah yeah you should you should overlay that chart with searches on wrecked yes exactly just chat gbt didn't come up with the keyword wrecked though I don't think it knows that one yet I mean actually I'm sure it does actually but this no this is across all of Twitter right and this is just a sample um that Twitter pulls because you can't get access to all the data there's like I can't remember like he was saying there's 400 million tweets that go out every day or whatever um but this is like what Twitter will pull for for you say unemployment does come back and it's way higher than we thought CPI continues to decline what happens well I I do I agree um I agree with the idea that firstly obviously unemployment probably is higher than what we think certainly as well there's been this disconnect between what the official um non-farm payroll survey has been saying and then what we've been seeing in the household survey and um I forget one of the FED boards like massively revised their numbers uh just before Christmas like and basically turned out there's about a million jobs less created than what they initially thought um and it's always a funny thing with data as well this this is why this is why um often like the data doesn't quite necessarily resonate with what the experience is when you go out there and talk to people so I like what you're doing there with looking at you know some of those searches because all of a sudden you get like six months down the line a backward revision to data that go oh [ __ ] we were we were in recession or unemployment was massively climate it just you know the the actual methodology with how we calculate these things um was wrong and certainly if like the the BLS staff and non-farm payrolls you know there's a lot of uh adjustments they make for like um births and deaths and all this stuff which is a little bit of guesswork um so I kind of agree your point um that probably unemployment's higher um and and also I I think that was probably the fact that we actually saw quite a strong on Fame for non-farm payroll print um last Friday yeah earnings uh came lower so you kind of think how how are we getting a stronger headline print and yeah you know you think wages should be be going up with that or the wage inflation should I say should be going up um so I actually as well I've got lots of thoughts around that um which I think is like a whole a whole nother Topic in terms of you know where is the clear in wage so have we got all these sort of job openings that the FED keep talking about but the the clearing wage flows are out wages that aren't you know people aren't willing to accept so I'm happy to I need to hire someone but my my price to hire them is is this level um not not that level so the fair to look in that game there's all this slack and it's not all this not because I'm I'm either going to hire you there or I'm not you know so yeah I agree I think unemployment goes up um I I think the feder kind of I say we're in this transition phase where the FED are waiting for um inflation to you know to be confident that inflation is coming lower I think they secretly probably are um and then unemployment going up will give them the reason to start being a bit more dovish because that's obviously they've got a dual mandate um and I think in some discussions I'm having with people get another inflation inflation I'm like yeah the game changes when unemployment starts to tick up and politically as much as anything right um it's going to be very difficult to keep sounding that hulky snow on inflation uh when unemployment sticks up so I agree um I I think that's the thing to watch um I mean there might be a Goldilocks scenario where it doesn't materially tick up and inflation Falls much quicker than everyone's expecting that's actually certainly something I am I'm quite you know kind of every chart I look at suggests that we could be sub 2 inflation by the you know going into Q4 and the pushback I get from that is people saying oh you know inflation yeah granted his Peaks but it's not going back to like two percent anytime soon it's like well you know perhaps it does the other thing that's in my mind as well is and there's all these comparisons between you know like you said about 1950 and since 1950 you know markets haven't bottomed until unemployment starts to go up because that's the trigger length for the FED to to start getting involved and start cutting rates I think we have to be conscious of um and a little bit humble I guess about the idea that these last two years haven't been normal markets at all um you know we had obviously lockdowns the biggest kind of fiscal stimulus that that you know but probably sort of post-war I guess um that we've seen and I still think we've been working off a lot of that in balance and trying to find an equilibrium around that um so I'm always sort of conscious of drawing too many parallels from from history when um you know when we've just been through what we've been through but yeah look I I think um I think unemployment is going to start ticking up it feels to me that um it's tough times out there for a lot of people I think inflation as a result of that I think the demand destruction is probably pretty high um inflation comes lower and we probably I think the Bond Market's probably right in terms of forecasting rate cuts by the end of this year um and and I I actually think you know we'll start to sniff that out quite early um so my my time frame would probably be earlier than yours in terms of when we well I I think we may be sort of beginning that rally now um and that will actually uh we'll we'll kind of get way ahead of that so you don't think that if like if earnings come back and we and they're terrible that we don't have like a a dip on that or in or what no and and I I guess this is controversial right but I I'm like I I think we're a function of um rates and liquidity so and you know people hate me saying that like I can't look at this way if earnings come out terrible and The feder Cutting rates or you know talking davisly we're gonna we're gonna rip we're gonna rally so I I don't I don't kind of subscribe to that idea that I mean the earnings have been pretty good right for the last year and yet we've sold off 20 30 because because the FED were hiking um and taking liquidity out um to your point about liquidity um I don't think I don't think that the FED are gonna go back to QE anytime soon um unless there's some kind of Market disruption that forces them into that um but that I could see them hoarding the the sort of um balance sheet reduction in the QT um quite quite quickly um and and you know I've seen lots of things saying they're kind of doing that by stealth in a way um they've not actually been that aggressive um and you've also got big offsets to the QT as well like you've got a lot of money parked in the reserve repo facility overnight um you know sort of North for two trillion so that that money starts to come back into the market so yeah I think liquidity will look better but not not because the FED are engaged in QE this year I don't see that right now unless something badly goes wrong but I think there's that liquidity to come out of the the RRP Amazon and yell and Yellen talks a lot about um you know the potential um to do some kind of bond buyback program if markets got disorderly and that would look and feel a lot like a QE in a way I think cool all right well thank you for your thoughts Joe closing thoughts what do you think one more question a question for you because obviously you know CPI everybody's been looking at it you know fairly dovish number I mean I haven't looked too too deep in like into the actual you know underlying numbers of that but pretty muted Market reaction today right you surprised yeah um yes and no I mean I I think um so obviously the kind of big sort of macro thematic we've been sort of tracing out here for the last um like few weeks and before Christmas is this kind of macro shift from a world of fed tightening rates um tightening liquidity to now starting to position full of pause and then eventually the cuts and what have you so I think this is a completely different macro regime um we saw to start the year um obviously inflation numbers in Europe were a lot weaker um and that started to spark this rally I think we've seen and then you've got the weak earnings number that really kicked things off combined with the weak ISM number and so I think I think certainly short-term guys have started to sort of play in position for um kind of this this softer fed if you like in the pause um but I I still think we're early markets I I I tweeted earlier that I I kind of feel that um people are still playing the 2022 handbook uh Playbook and they're playing the basically you sell on rallies um and the feder hiking and that's the kind of thing um I I think we're gonna transition from that that moment of okay we now need a new playbook and actually the FED are pausing and what's the trades on that um so I I think we're going to see over the next few weeks towels be thrown in a little bit on some of those bearish trades and that's where I can actually see us getting more upside um right now I I still think um and as we've been talking about I still think um you know their commitment to risk is still quite light there's still a lot of people out slowly returning slowly trying to work out what the strategy is so I think you've just saw um some short-term Traders kind of get along into the event and as we saw on on Paradigm and some of the trades probably now taking a little bit of profit into that so then we pull back but I think over the coming days you'll actually start to see that flow pick up so I'm expecting actually the breakout to happen over the next few days um people just let things simmer digest and then go right let's let's get the trades on um I don't know you could argue against that that fomc you know end of Jan interfere keeps everyone sidelined again but I I feel I feel people are picking up on things have changed and and want to get some risk on and um they're going to start having to look to the top side I think yeah well Chris yeah what would be your your implementation here like call spreads you know you said that upsides yep no that's kind of exactly what I was talking about is call spreads like if I'm buying a little bit you know more expensive call ball I want to be selling some on the upside as well so like for me stuff that I'm looking at would be like an at the money buying and then selling you know maybe like a 21 22 23. I've been looking at kind of the liquidity and open interest through those strikes and I think that's a good implementation of like a short-term bullish directional view without getting you know paying too much premium on a ball side of things one more thing um question I wanted we not discussed this on um yeah but the um the Shanghai um upgrade um I was wondering if anyone's really talking about that um that that could be a next thematic right um obviously you think about the excitement we had uh into the merge yeah is anyone talking about that and what are your thoughts around that yeah I haven't really been looking too much at it um I just know that whenever like the the last youth Bridge event like that was a massive kind of uh narrative for trading but I think it was just uh like sell the event news like right after it happened in terms of like the the best trade for that actually I think was like selling the upside calls and then hedging with long perps because the funding rates blew out and you were kind of winning on both ends of the trade so I know that like these ethereum based event trades are definitely there and definitely prevalent but personally I haven't really been looking too much at it I've been focusing especially now in Bitcoin now that we've finally gotten out of this range that we've been trading in I'm kind of looking at that in the macro as well for more of the the big narrative driven trades yeah we're and we're still we're still decently far away uh from the Shanghai upgrade as well like in terms of like how people look at things in terms of like when I put on option positions right it's like look this thing isn't gonna happen for another like two months and I don't think they have an exact date for it yet right so it's like okay why am I gonna pay the time value for that now yeah and I think with the merge too it was like uh people knew about the merge and when it was happening but all the options flow started to pick up in like August July like a couple months before and that's whenever the liquidity really started to build up and the open Ninja started increasing that like September expiry yeah sure yeah that's right the trade should have been uh over these last couple weeks was Bonk you should have been trading block man the uh too bad there wasn't options on that because that yeah like you know I was maybe Chris is making them OTC yeah not yet not yet dude I wish I wish I got some Bach but all my salons right yeah yeah do you know do you know what like uh just it's a good point and actually again something that's interested me at the start of this year was was the Bonk um you know kind of people open into that um also like uh Lido and and on the back of Shanghai and potential for that it felt this Market is dead and um for a long time and it was kind of the first signs I've seen a while of retail and guys aping into stuff and going yeah we're kind of back a little bit I thought that was that was interesting actually yeah I think the the the djns are getting antsy right they need that job and being hit so once things start ripping you know they they can't help but jump in that I I checked my wallet I I Santa came with a little extra cash you throw it into bunk he makes sense I saw someone go from like uh they said at some point they put in like a grand into Bonk like right at the beginning and in like a week or two it was worth a couple hundred grand well I don't know if that's true someone posted on Twitter the other day and I read it I was like is that I didn't do the math or anything but that sounds insane but it does sound plausible I mean it's happened before I checked my wallet and I had like a few grand worth of Bonk in there like just randomly I was like I don't I don't know how I got this but I'm gonna sell it immediately [Laughter] it's like it's come off yeah I wonder like going back to your chat GPT thing and uh the searches on for for unemployment I wonder if we kind of going full circle so you had sort of d-gens or quitting their jobs they've gone back into McDonald's now they're losing the jobs at McDonald's I got to do Jennings and stuff again all right do you you guys have anything else or should we just end it here yeah all good I guess the main takeaway uh on our side definitely feels like you know the taker interest is starting to return to the market a little bit after a very quiet December holidays aftermath of FTX what have you you know albeit you know the the overall volumes are certainly um certainly a bit lower and you know potentially a lot of these trades were kind of just around CPI so we kind of have to wait and see if this continues to to hold up but you know there's a lot of at least upside and uh big upside trades have been going up on Paradigm lately and that coupled with Chris's view of you know potentially some long gamma expiring you know hopefully that leads to a rally and uh kind of a self-fulfilling thing where people jump back in the market so that's it for me yeah and just to add to that it will be interesting right um over the next days actually and next week or so um to see whether it was just a CPI sort of quick quick um sort of gamma play around that or or is it the start of a new trend and something more sustainable so yeah I think it's gonna be interesting to track that over the next um sort of days and weeks actually cool all right let's end it here thanks guys all right awesome guys thanks
