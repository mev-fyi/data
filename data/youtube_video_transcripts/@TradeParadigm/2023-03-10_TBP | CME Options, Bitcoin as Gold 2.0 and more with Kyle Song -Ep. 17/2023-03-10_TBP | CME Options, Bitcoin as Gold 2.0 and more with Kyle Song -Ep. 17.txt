hi I'm Dave Brickell director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about is an expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hi guys welcome to the big picture my name is Joe Crewe I'm at Paradigm in the weeds around everything crypto ball markets joined here today again by Sohan and David uh my colleagues and today we also have Kyle's song on from Albatross Labs before we begin if you like this content so far hit the like And subscribe button really helps us as we continue to grow this channel appreciate all the support that we've gotten so far to uh to jump right into it Kyle you're Kyle you're new to the channel want to give us a little bit of a background on yourself for our viewers tell us a little bit about what you're doing at Albatross what you were doing beforehand and why you got into cryptovall yeah thanks for uh having me here guys um my name is Kyle I currently at uh at Albatross slabs uh I come from more chat by background in options Market making and uh fall relative value trades as well as hft trades in option space uh or I worked at Hakuna and our research mostly in traffic space um dealt mostly on the commodity FX side so I created created a vibrant range of products there uh and most relative stuff to crypto uh I will bring the gold and FX test at um and early on I saw a lot of like similarities and uh crypto and gold market actually so it kind of like made a lot of sense uh and we're kind of seeing the institutionalization in crypto and uh see a lot of like similarities uh what I saw from like gold market in like what's building up in uh FX um and for Albatross Labs we started about a year and a half ago we actually started more on the uh latency stud ARB with trades and uh using a Perpetual features and variety of exchanges so you are doing more of a high frequency stuff early on and then kind of built uh kind of expanded out to options as it is like my main interest I would say um and we currently are building up our options desk uh trying to increase like presence in Paradigm as well as all the other options uh venues yeah no that's that's cool and uh we we really appreciate all you've been doing for Paradigm and we've we've seen that firsthand you see you guys kind of right when you kind of started to really ramping up to you know top 10 top 10 Market maker on us so kudos to you and looking forward to keeping that going uh I'd like to go back I've just got to jump in before Joe before Joe carries on yeah um is it just interesting you saying um you trade these sort of gold options and stuff before um so I've got to ask you is Bitcoin digital gold uh I actually initially like that was that kind of uh obvious to me like early on like for me at least um I like I always thought it was going to be like like alternative to Gold uh I made like a lot of all the narratives made sense and that was like when Bitcoin was like around like 3000 maybe back in 2017 yeah the thing the thing that's funny about it though is like especially in the fall world and this has been a common theme we've discussed on this podcast it really feels like the regimes you know can change quite a bit like when I came into this Market I was like oh damn like it kind of feels like Bitcoin in ethereum especially ethereum just kind of Trades like like a single stock like NASDAQ you know this NASDAQ stock just everything was so correlated you know each NASDAQ Corel realized Corel was like 80 right and everything kind of moved together you know the Vols kind of kind of seemed to move in similar Fashions too and then you kind of fast forward to like the beginning of this year and it's just like wow now it does not feel like that so like what what are the things for you where gold and the gold options Market feels a lot like BTC in the eth option Market I think uh eth might be a little different uh but before Bitcoin yeah uh I guess like fundamentally uh like yeah I guess it is like an alternative assets to hedging against like other assets uh type of uh narrative as well as like just like also on like more on a micro levels side of things like how things move um in like like skew and complexity Dynamics ball Dynamics like it feels like very similar to uh at least like I haven't looked at Gold options for a few years now but like I'm referring to like yeah back in like early 2010s yeah yeah I'm guessing there's like a positive spot Vault correlation with gold right because giving us a risk-off time passes yeah so yeah so which yeah which now we obviously strangely have like with with um with Bitcoin uh and Neath um so I mean I guess that's quite good I mean like so we'll see I mean now now that the macro is deteriorating that we're at we're at 22 000 like I don't know like I'm not I'm not gonna throw in the towel yet but like it kind of it kind of feels like that you know um spot up follow-up sort of euphoria uh seems a little bit less likely now uh but hopefully I'm wrong there yeah well you know crypto there's such um convexity in in the moves I guess both ways um so so yeah like we you know at the moment we're gonna break out of a range uh the spot yeah I mean the the skew will completely flip right I mean that's the that's the thing it's wherever there's danger right so uh to the top side but uh I mean really speaking I mean everyone's still worried about the bags on the downside right like um if uh you know if the spot hits like 15K or something I mean uh we're gonna have another another Long Winter yeah well I like at Paradigm I'm selfishly more worried about the range the Range band where we just shop between 22 and 25 because nobody's in a trade right like everybody's gonna lose interest at least we go lower people need to trade right um anyhow that was kind of a selfish comment but uh I guess uh uh let's jump into uh the BTC Vol spread here let me let me just share share my screen quickly when you guys uh you guys see that okay yeah all right cool so the the BTC fall spread it's been it's been a kind of an interesting one you know it's been it's been a one-way train lower uh and now is kind of at five five balls over for at the monies I mean is it quote-unquote cheap I mean no ish I mean it's kind of right in line with with the trailing realized spreads that we've had but that being said it has continued to Trend lower and on an absolute level it's the lowest since May of 2022 and then this the chart on the right what that is doing is that's normalizing the spread for the absolute level of implied Vols like I.E you would expect spreads to be tighter if you're in a lower Vol regime and you'd expect those that ball spread to be wider and a higher of all regime so that's something that we normalize and even when you do that it is still quite low right it's trading at you know the lows over in the past year and there was this research piece that came out I think it was by matrix Port yesterday and I was saying that when the eth BTC realized spread kind of compresses to the levels that were around right now this is the time to really like jump in and buy the spread which is it's certainly a fair argument looking historically you know especially ahead of things like the Shanghai upgrade and you know if you make this argument that ethereum is going to be more correlated to risk and risk is rolling over then there is arguments to be made there that that spread will perform but I I have some thoughts on what's leading to the spread compression but but Kyle I I would like to to kind of hear what you think around this um I think it's a mixture of uh variety of things but uh uh I I would say like I'm not like like we're not like uh making out like we're not trying to make a hero call on like where the future will be but like trying to like more of trying to explain like where it built this way uh obviously like realized Wall's been super suppressed um uh whatever the reason is um and yeah she said he's how I realize has been like much lower than the it's at like historical loads basically so it kind of makes sense to like kind of converge like unplayables conversion to realized um and yeah I think like it's pretty interesting uh but like yeah we're not really like trying to predict the future um but like trying to make sense of the situations and uh yeah I think it all makes sense like well like as like uh nature of uh yeah uh crypto um Bitcoin ether we usually see like yeah very like no move or large move type of like very like uh uh like Paul like very like polarized uh distribution of uh movements um that kind of creates Dynamics on yeah uh yeah bottle sellers uh like basically like realize has like imply has to like converge to realize that's been a lot of like flow we've seen uh in the you know past and these days as well whereas like like cheaper wings are like more attracted to oh yeah which kind of creates that like complexity Dynamics uh right so so the implies the implies are converging to the realized you're seeing that Supply there's certainly kind of I mean just looking at the flows Dynamics definitely feels like there's less demand for the for the eve top side just Vega demand in general for eth I think I mean bitcoin's kind of been the big story on the Vega demand side um to start the year but I also think like there is a lot more each Supply now than there was a few months ago so let me go to this next slide here so the eve Vol in flow Dynamics I feel like they've changed quite a bit since the merge and yes the implies are going going to converge to the real lives for sure but like I I also think that there are flows as well that is driving you know these implied and realized fall spread compressions uh like even just this week right on Monday the largest trade that was like half of like all the ethereum that traded on the entire day in terms of contracts was this first line so this was 28k eth March 1700 May 1800 call calendar supplying 35k of Vega into the market 35k big and when you think about an equity or FX land like doesn't seem that big but like in crypto it's not in ethereum that is a lot of Vega that is a lot of Vega for for the market to consume especially when like after FDX there's not I mean as Kyle knows there's not as many market market makers as there used to be right there's not this ability to be able to absorb this flow as much anymore um and so people so we saw these these trades go up and I was looking on Twitter and you know you you have a lot of like crypto Vol Twitter personalities and whatever like oh yeah like Shanghai upgrade like term structure play it's like the the reality is this that's my opinion it's not correct this is a systematic role of an existing call override position and for avoidance for that we we at Paradigm we don't actually know where this flow is coming from like Kyle this does not print on paradigm the so which is kind of kind of shocking that's a that's a different different conversation but it's the largest trade that is going up in the listed Market that is not printing on us and this feels like some sort of overright mandate that is perhaps a combination of you know some eth treasury you know maybe like a former minor you know High net worth but the the execution style is much more sophisticated than just being like Oh I'm just going to do this like 28k roll there's a lot of stuff like that's trading on screens around this as well that you just are not looking at uh in terms of just the general block Market but we saw a similar call calendar Vega selling flows earlier this year an even larger size I mean look at that middle one that's 12 90k that's 125k Vega that was the largest trade of 2022. as the largest Vega trade of 2022 and all none of these trades were occurring before the ethereum merch this program we were only really starting to notice these after the ethereum merge happened and maybe there's something to be said there around you know the whole proof of work to proof of stake which is which is why people are looking to get this yield now but the fact of the matter is there's now a massive amount of Vegas applying the market in ethereum that was not there before and again on the Vega demand side there's not very much in ethereum and there's a lot less liquidity in ethereum versus Bitcoin as well so we don't know the market maker who's putting this up but whoever it is is likely just warehousing this entire thing right they have very little Avenues to recycle it and then it just weighs on the entire curve especially in the midterm buckets leading to this spread compression but you know clearly there's a huge yield play that's going up in the market you know in ethereum that was just not really there before like when you look at these numbers Kyle like are these numbers in ethereum where it's like it's like oh that is a lot of Vega that's trading or is it like uh like I don't know like or am I kind of like BS here where it's just like you know like the market can actually take that down uh that is a pretty big Trace uh yeah um I think you'll definitely have a trickle-down effect on everywhere um for sure uh yeah that that kind of explains why like front walls are suppressed uh and yeah it is a pretty big trade yeah in terms of you know so so on David I'd like to get your opinions on this because like we've been going back and forth internally like who is doing this trade like is this it's just like is this minor overrides like what are the what what are the conversations that you've been having you know kind of like on like the Vault so on the ball selling side like who are the type of guys that are looking to do that like our you know miners still really involved um in these sort of like override trades or um is it something else yeah I mean to me it uh I mean of course it could be a minor right like I mean that that definitely could make sense um but it could easily be and I I think this is what it is which is a systematic uh CFI uh like um option Vault right like so C5 option ball is is like basically um you know like we talk about dovs a lot right that we talk about ribbon uh Etc uh but then there's now a growing Universe of people who are managing uh money for other people uh they get they get uh you know like um yeah like a deposit and then they sell a covered call and then after a while they saw another colored Call Etc right and it's it's somewhat actively managed more than uh the dobs um so I I think that could be a very legitimate um you know form of uh yield enhancement which could lead to these kind of uh these kind of flows um we're still I would say we're still we're still guessing but the underlying reason is the same right which is hilden Huntsville yeah and if you look at the time of the trades it's definitely happening unless it's happening through some overnight Trader or whatever um it does seem like this is like an Asia based sort of thing like I can't think of any like really large sort of us you know sort of you know sort of like I guess Private Bank in a sense you know selling selling programs over here you know it kind of feels like it's this is like you know some yield enhancement program but that that is a combination between like high net worth and potential minor money but like at this point it's it's pure speculation so we'll see yeah I mean like just on sohan's point is I mean that there are like increasingly a larger number of these sort of systematic guys from the Trad fire world coming into the space and you know their bread and butter is doing these sort of systematic sort of old cell strategies um so yeah it can make a lot of sense um that it could just be someone like that it's interesting how they're executing it um because it's always interestingly if when someone's doing that size and they're not doing it through us um particularly when it's listed um because you've got to kind of think about potentially spread so that they'd be paying away on that um yeah that's actually a really good point that's that's a really good point so again so there was this this is a little bit of a paradigm shell if you if you will but like you know these Point these prints have been you know a point of contention you know they I mentioned yeah they don't they don't occur on us and whenever they do print we have market makers that are immediately blasting us asking like what what is this trade like I would have shown a better price like what's going on who's doing this like we saw literally this morning we saw a similar overwrite role in in Bitcoin so that was in a thousand contracts likely from the same counterparty it's in smaller size the B the BTC program seems a bit smaller but like the first reaction from all our all our Market maker guys are like oh my God I would definitely do that trade like they would definitely get tighter tighter prices if they quoted on Paradigm so we asked this morning we asked one of our top market makers who does not trade this flow doesn't know where it comes from where he would have put up you know this week's trades and looking at the chart trading on paradigms so this eth calendar would have gotten the seller 12.8 more ethereum or equivalently roughly 20 000 more dollars uh and then for the PTC role they would have earned about a third more of a Bitcoin or roughly sixty five hundred dollars better so in terms of spread both of these are trading around two Vols two balls away from mid and we have guys come in and they'll be like I would bid this like at least a half of all tighter uh so if you're if I guess if you're the overrider watching this come trade on us if you want the better prices laughs but it's true but I mean that that was that leads me to thinking that if this was like a kind of Trad fire systematic like vault guy who's come into crypto um they probably wouldn't be executing it this way um so which makes me think you're probably right thinking along the lines of it maybe a minor or something like that um yeah that's interesting um all right cool uh I think this is a good segue into some of the CME stuff and Kyle I think this is something that you and I like previously discussed like I think towards the beginning of the year and it's it's a conversation that myself so Han and David I think have had quite a lot especially you know since FTX and there was there was this whole view that since FTX in the exchanges insolvency this is going to drive this very large flight to Quality to more regulated exchanges like the CME and we've been receiving a lot of questions from customers on hey has this capitulation actually started to occur in the option space and additionally we also see more and more press around it so there's this article that I screenshotted at the top of the slide and specifically so that second bullet point says the CME benefited from the FTX collapse with institutional investors looking towards regulated venues I I'm not gonna I'm not gonna mention where the article is from and it is factual that CME Bitcoin volumes in open interest has increased since FPS that is a fact however I would argue that the relative volume growth thus far has not actually been that impressive and I understand these things take time it's not just like a flip of a switch and okay I'm going to move everything to CME and trade like I understand that but let's let's look at just look let's look at the data here so in in on that chart on the right in Feb 2022 CME BTC option volumes were 3.5 of Darby Farms a year later in February 2023 CME is 5.1 percent of derabits volumes so over the course of the year that's really only 1.5 percent growth and it's not like the trend really significantly picked up um since aptx so like I put the put those arrows there you know the pre FTX post FTX there was this jump higher in January uh to seven and a half percent but when I look at it in the context of like the rest of the trend it doesn't look like there's been this massive significant increase and then in in February it's dropped back down to five percent you know which is actually lower than where it was in October before ftis and if you look at the the yellow line the yellow line is ethereum and I from what I understand ethereum is more of a new product for Samia I think they launched this we'll launched it in August and that that's only about you know one percent above derivative volume uh one percent of derabit volumes in the relative growth of CME versus therapy it is trending higher it is I mean you look at the chart it's going up but we're still kind of in a reality that a big day on derabit and Bitcoin options is larger than cme's volume over the entire month like Bitcoin options like on a big day we'll do like 1.2 billion right and if you look at the chart there's not one month where CME is doing 1.2 billion um so my whole point is like and it's might be contentious it just kind of feels like it's a little bit overblown to me where it's like that you have this confirmation bias where it's like oh it's very logical that you're gonna see this flight to Quality towards towards more regulated exchanges that is a very logical Common Sense spot considering what happened but as of now and I understand it takes time it's not really happening yet there's been a lot of questions on our side not a lot of actions and this isn't this isn't me being like Oh like don't try to see me like you want to come straight out there a bit like things are a lot better like don't don't get me wrong the CME volumes are trending in the right directions just not as quickly as a lot of news articles would suggest and I pers I would love to CME volumes to pick up like that would be a really good sign that'd be a really good sign that institutional players are coming in coming into the market but at least in the options I'm just not seeing it yet but I I want to get I kind of want to open it up and get everybody's thoughts around this um yeah so I actually had I thought about this since like back in like 2018 uh I I thought like when like like why wouldn't like like see me capture all this like like as soon as like very open type of question but like they're a bit I actually like in the middle like as we you know enter like 2013 now like they're a bit very dominant uh in the market share um so yeah like my takeaway like very similar to you on that like it takes time um I I think like yeah U.S institutional volume will eventually order CME but uh on the other notes uh for every product I've seen in CME uh there's always like it could be like uh could could have some like correlation to like how like CME incentivized like market makers are to like grow the markets and like how they like uh maneuver on on this um as well usually there's like like four like I can't think of like yeah for for pretty much like all those products and stuff one there's always been like like jumping like future girls first preceding options growth and right that is something we're seeing uh I believe like last time I checked like CME volume and open interest on like features relative to like Finance or the entire like Perpetual Market has like has been like pretty significantly increasing so I think it's fine but like that I think that that's like a sign that like options will like follow at some point but like I think they also probably want to like grow sick like future volume first like for options to be sustainable because like yeah without like like yeah if there's like no Delta liquidity like options markets are like hard to build up on like so I think like it's taking time right right I I think I mean the fact that we go for it David yeah I I mean I I think um just a couple of thoughts for me I first is expensive right uh custom margin is is um makes it more expensive I also think it speaks a little bit to the still fragmented sort of Market um and Regulatory environment um in crypto and particularly at the US that that just you know is really feels like it's kind of falling behind the curve on the regulatory side the the problem with that is if you're going to open a crypto fund and you're going to want to trade some options you're going to want to trade some sports and some parts and Futures and whatever you're trading um you want access to as many kind of source of liquidity as you can get right now it still feels like the route that people will go down is setting up an offshore entity so that they can then have access to the offshore exchanges and and access deeper liquidity um and yeah like you've got to pay up for it if you want to go on the CME and then also I just feel you know from a portfolio point of view whether you're kind of just a little bit limited um so therefore you know is the route that people go down and certainly conversations I've had when when I'm seeing funds actually set up and they're trying to work out the best way to do things and often they lean to right we need to set up an offshore entity and and uh be trading through there a bit and and the other exchange is that we can't otherwise access um so I I still think that that that kind of fragmentation with with the regulatory environments is is causing issues as well yeah I mean I I can give somebody so it was actually exactly the margin point so the most common pushback is I would love to but it's just too expensive um but and then if you're if you're if you have no mandate to trade on you know one of the offshore exchanges and you have to trade on CME um then actually the response is I would rather go OTC and trade against uh you know somebody direct you know with a CSA and is there right which is which is a shocking thing right because you know you always get netting and everything in in you know in in CME but it just it just tells you that you know that there are certain things that you know CME could you know do better to you know to kind of pull that flow away right because if you have the choice between CME OTC or derivat like if they're equal to you then you would of course go dare a bit right but then if you're mandated then um yeah it's shocking that people would choose a bilateral Avenue rather than uh that exchange just because of margin right especially in an environment where nobody trusts each other and I imagine the OTC margins are gonna get pretty nuts too so um but cool no that was a that was a good discussion on on the CME I think we can leave it there uh David you want to get into a little bit of the macro yeah I mean interesting week I guess to be talking macro um especially Hadley NFP on on Friday and and CPI on um on the 14th come on I want predictive predictions I want you to put your foot in your mouth yeah I've been pretty bullish risk as we know coming into this year um we put out on the newsletter um earlier in the week um that rate is the missing piece of puzzle uh one one of the things I think is really interesting to me is is the lower sensitivity of risk to rates so we had power obviously speaking over the last two days um and sort of talking about the fact that he's prepared to go a quicker pace of hikes we've seen the market pricing basically 50 points for March now is is pretty much um it is I think about 70 priced in um and also with price a higher terminal rate again in a really short space of time we're now pricing like like five and three quarters of a terminal rate from five and a half just just last week so we're having some really big big moves in in the front end of the rates Market but we're not actually seeing risk materially get hit and everyone's kind of waiting for risk to get here and it's not happening I think one of the reasons for that is people were saying um after power yesterday that are the markets starting to listen to the higher for longer scenario but actually I think the Market's listening to the higher for longer higher scenario but still not buying into the higher for longer and one one of the things that I was looking at is if you look at um the interest rate Futures so if you look at the September contracts um against the March contracts so whilst we're pricing at a higher terminal rate we've actually over the course of this week started to price in more cuts into March of next year so we're pricing about 50 bips of cuts if I share my screen I'll show you what I mean yeah so so this chart here so you're looking at the uh September 23 uh contracts versus the March 24 contracts and what you'll see is actually since um since like the end of Jan when we started to get this stronger data throughout February so markets have certainly priced in a higher and sort of steeper rate path um but since uh if we look at the last couple of days and since last week we've actually started to see that reverse now again you've got a higher Peak coming in September where we're now pricing five and three quarters rates but we're actually then starting to price sort of cuts into March next year a little bit more aggressively so I I think what's interesting from a risk perspective is the more the more that power hooks things up the we're pricing in this higher Peak rate but then subsequently uh we're pricing quicker Cuts so again this idea that the FED are going to have to just front load it but actually the bigger concerns are around around growth and that eventually we're going to see this this start to hit and come through so yeah so I I think that's quite interesting um just how how kind of insensitive risk is to these these big moves in rates um so it kind of makes me feel that risk there's still an asymmetry and risk in that as soon as those rates start to turn lower then we can start to see actually sort of risks start to fly and and obviously risk and crypto are going to go hand in hand with that so on the one hand you're kind of looking at rate sinking you know things there's reason to be nervous on the other hand we're really not reacting or responding to these big moves in the front end of rates and I think that's because the more we're pricing in the front then we're also um we're also sort of pricing in the cuts at the back end and hence you've actually started to see sort of 10-year come a bit lower this week 30 year come a bit lower so durations actually starting to rally on these steeper steeper hike um sort of pricing and and then obviously sort of crypto is the longest duration asset so I'm kind of of the view that actually again it feels like the downside it feels limited for for duration feels limited for Nasdaq it feels limited for crypto um and I think as soon as we start to see that those rates reverse at the front end we get some weaker data on Friday with non-farm we could we could CPI then I actually I actually still feel that the biases that we're going to push to the top side even though it just feels sediment feels awful out there and everyone's waiting for things to collapse the other thing within that is again just looking at other risk metrics fix is sat below 20. we've had this huge huge rates move and yet the vix is still set below 20 looks pretty comfortable um liquidity's still higher and actually if you look at the Bloomberg Financial conditions index we're actually sort of lower year on year than where we were this time last year despite this massive hike cycle so Financial conditions are easing so so actually like Risk risk actually looks quite supportive if you took away this kind of rates move that that is is causing I guess concern um and then the other things that's still interesting to me in terms of where a lot of liquidity is coming from it's been coming from the East um we've seen pboc Bank of Japan I think since about October of last year they've injected about a trillion dollars in into markets so they've been a huge offset to what the FED have been doing and what the ECB have been doing um I think China disappointed a little bit in the week by saying that they're only uh going to sort of Target five percent growth so that's reduced um the optimism that they're going to come out with some sort of power stimulus and then we've also got the new Bank of Japan Governor uaida um sort of going in I think it's the correct Corona's last outing on on Friday now your Aid has actually been kind of making some dovish noises um so I I think that's interesting to watch if you still see China and Japan keeping the foot on the on the uh on the liquidity pedal then again I I think we're setting up for still a a decent Rarity in Risk so interesting into the into non-farm and CPI power actually today I think rode back on his comments a little bit and and essentially sounds like wherever he goes 50 or 25 is going to be dependent on whether we get a strong non-farm and uh CPI um so but it feels given that that reaction to to rates at the front end it feels like there's an asymmetry for me lining up for risk that that basically if we do get strong prints well the 50 is kind of priced if we get weaker prints and we go back to pricing 25 then all of a sudden I I think you're going to see stocks and risks sort of take off and then everyone unwinding the flows we've seen this week they've been putting on the downside and go back to scrambling for the top side in crypto uh David when someone the non-farms on Friday right non-farm Friday CPI is the 14th which is what Tuesday yeah it's it's interesting where like I'm surprised I'm just looking at where the where the um at the money balls are for March 10th it's 41. right like it doesn't seem like anybody cares like it's surprised like obviously it's really important but like and I feel like in crypto you've seen you've tended to see pretty um steep term structure and version around like cpis and things like that I'm pretty sure I'm pretty surprised maybe you have to give it a couple days or whatever and you get a little bit closer to it but it's that's pretty shocking to me that the lowest point basically on the curve is is Friday given the fact that we have nfps yeah I mean you might just not go for it yeah I mean I was going to say it's possibly the timing of when the expiries are and I think right yeah yeah it's just before in in fact so it's just a few hours before that's that's kind of why it's it never it never shows in derivative right like yeah we'll come we'll cut that yeah but but I I I I I think what is interesting Joe is is because we're still in this positive spot Vault uh correlation world so if you think if if you're if your sentiment is pretty bearish then you're going to kind of want a price for lower Vols right because you think well spot's going to come off and vol's going to come off with it um if you're starting to get a little bit balled up then then you think you know you want to start positioning for a higher Vol regime um with higher spot so I actually think the lack of reaction involved is kind of maybe alluding to some sort of short-term bearish sentiment which again makes me think there's an asymmetry into this data that if it's soft and we we can all chill out a little bit on on the FED uh rates come lower then I kind of think we're going to see a Scramble for people to buy back that vole and again buy put back these convexity trades and start sort of grabbing um some of the top side um oh yeah I mean I mean Kyle we see we see it all the time as as soon as you kind of have like a little bit of uh you know a sharp candle higher you see everybody start to come in oh 25 2 500 up like ethereum one month calls and things like that just trying to like kind of perpetuate those moves um as we've discussed it's such a reflexive space uh in that regard yeah yeah yeah sweet that's been what we're seeing right um and and it's strange to get your head around that to think that if if Bitcoin sells off you know on Friday um you know it's a thing that actually evolves just gonna come lower but that's kind of the regime we've been in right uh whereas if Bitcoin we get a really soft print Brakes come lower and then all of a sudden Bitcoin starts sort of pushing back through 23k again then vol's gonna go bid right the problem is though like I understand that when you have Bitcoin at like 24 25 and the Vols are kind of already pretty elevated like in the 60s now we're talking like okay now we're talking the front end like in the mid 40s I I think down here especially at the bottom of the range I don't I think that Dynamic like I I just can't see a world where like we have a hawkish print and then BTC is off like three percent from here and Vols are lower I mean maybe they can be like I mean at best like unchanged but like the absolute level of implies now are like pretty damn low where like maybe that maybe that correlation is starting to break down a little bit yeah I think on yeah I think Dynamics has shifted a lot versus when we're like around 25k like yeah definitely like we like see more like good bidding um I think convexity should should be higher on lower ball uh as well uh compared to Google flatten out on as like calendars get offered so like friends get bit on down takes like most likely facts will like somewhat like it's hard to like predict what like flow will be on in the back like back once Vega and on down texting might get paid or offered but like fronts I think will like definitely like appears to the downside at the moment in the market I think it's very interesting like like we have like this like very like sophistic conversation in the macro level like in back in like like three years ago like it didn't like it definitely didn't have as much uh in crypto options uh everyone's like talking about markets uh macro or like pricing like events and it's pretty pretty Boomers like like David coming to the space sure and but you're saying it with the sort of client base right you've got so many of the sort of tread fight guys I mean Carl former FX gold guy you know there's so much Trad Fire coming in and and kind of realize the importance of that and then that that then becomes you know if that's where the flow's at that becomes a driver and particularly this year I mean we've spoken about this before um it feels like a lot of the move has been driven by institution and institutional flow it doesn't really feel like the retail markets like really being open into stuff and um sort of driving things and in fact I kind of feel like if we're really going to sort of push on that might be where where we need to actually um to start breaking higher levels and ramping higher you're going to really need retail to come in and get involved but um we're not seeing at the moment so yes the the institutions the the Boomers maybe are dominating things at the moment and I think I I think it's kind of like self-fulfilling prophecy in a way um yeah it doesn't have to be that way but like a lot of people think that way so it becomes that way um and yeah there are a lot of players like uh doing like like obviously like analyzing correlation between like Bitcoin and uh equities like it like there were regimes like where like there's no correlation like there has been like correlation like last like uh like probably like good like period of time like it's also like breaking down a little bit but like there's something like I think there's like interesting Dynamics there I do think it's a it could be like a little like over pushed in a way um like I think there will be regimes like like it doesn't have to be correlated like I I think I I think there are players like who like basically like do like correlation plays including Bitcoin versus which is probably like makes sense like trade like goes with like in line with like how East trades like uh NASDAQ stocks I think that narrative makes sense uh which is why like it should have like naturally put natural foot skew like like like probability options Traders like we all think like very like probabilistic Manner and like there's like like it's very unlikely at this point but but there's like non-zero probably leads can like go down to like zero like it's like non-zero um so yeah like the point I feel like it like at this point like I I think like it kind of explains like the whole Dynamics but like Bitcoin not uh yeah I think running a little like more positive calls Q then it makes sense on Optics like yeah I don't think it's like unreasonable like excuse can't get bit to the calls like I've seen call skin gold multiple times very similar Dynamics yeah so something else someone else I think is interesting and I guess this kind of ties like some of the macro to the flow sort of dynamics that that we've discussed is I always say that uh narratives ultimately Drive markets and I I think if we look at how we came into this year that the narrative for Out jam was this peak inflation Peak rates narrative the data was kind of supporting that rates were coming lower um risk was rallying on on the back of that and you had this really nice narrative that we approaching the pause and the FED pause and the rate hike cycle now that narrative say if not completely disappeared but it's a lot more complex than it was given the strong data now now there's no clear narrative and I think we're all struggling for that uh clear narrative to actually sort of really commit risk so in the absence of that narrative and commitment to risk on the back of that then you're left with what I'd call that the mechanical flows and those mechanical flows are these these uh these these called overrides um and these structures sort of all selling so therefore in the absence of a narrative to start sort of building up for and putting on top side you end up with these kind of mechanical structured flow that's not trading The Narrative not trading the macro in any way and then then we just kind of drift lower um in vaal and I kind of think that's what we're seeing and this Market needs one way or the other needs a new narrative to really start sparking uh sparking bow and and hopefully our volume's in tandem um throughout March yeah actually I have a question for Carl actually I mean um it's a it's a it's a a bit of a a move on topic but um like you know like one of the one of the big issues I think all of our Prop Shops and uh you know like uh Mark can make his face is that um there is too much like uh after FCX there's too much focus on having single C5 risk right so you know everyone wants to diversify everyone wants to like move out um of uh you know of of the main exchanges in despite you know preferential like uh pricing or margin you know margin Etc so we saw that with with CME a little bit um but you know as as we know it's not like grown that much but like what about there a bit I mean like like durability has been dominant for almost like I guess three years now and um that you know there are many up and comers in the crypto options exchange space uh but they haven't really managed to get any of the volume what do you think about that space and um you know are you are you active in any of the in any of the other exchanges uh for specific or options right yeah uh yeah we trade on other exchanges as well uh their venues as well uh but yeah I guess we as a more creating perspective we have to follow the volume to make money uh like yeah it's fair assessment yeah I think yeah uh their exchange like level risk that's something we're aware of uh but like it's I think it's just a service we have to take uh being in this space and like as long as the volumes there like as a market maker we have to like kind of Chase the volume I see and and in terms of like um like let's say uh you have obviously C flat right but what about what about the D5 space I mean are you active in like Ribbon or all of these um you know like uh you know dob type uh you know spaces we we are but not Super Active um it's for for like it's more just operational like uh annoyance I would say and like they are risk as well but like we I don't I think like it's more like there it's not that like big enough at 35 space like we are like actively looking at D5 but like the volume like notional volume there versus like C5 is like so small I think what's interesting to us is like more like cool developments in the space uh they're like cool products coming out I would say um yeah I mean like I think Perpetual is like one of the greatest emissions that crypto created oh it's it's a great product it makes a lot of sense uh no need to like roll um all that and yeah there are like interesting projects like the squeeze uh pretty type of uh products that kind of does that on like fixed feature level like so like I I think like all these like like trials like on uh like product level uh using crypto is like a super interesting uh but yeah there's like not much volume uh it's probably like like little here and there but like it's like for for our size it's hard to justify like spending too much time like trying to make those kind of Trades work at this point sorry the one one point you mentioned um which is which I guess you were referring to the the upcoming Divo Devo future right um I think I think that that to me looks extremely exciting right because instead of now referencing the vix on every single uh you know like uh you know goal like we just say oh the vix is here um we can actually have our own you know crypto you know Market where we can trade it uh so aggressively right like as a market makers can now use that as a hedge as well as hedge with vanillas on the you know on the the future with with vanilla's um like I expect that to be a fairly big Market um going forward I hope so yeah what's what's your view on that um I've heard mixed opinions I've heard mixed opinions that like this is a great thing and I've also heard opinions that the Market's not ready for it I think it'll take time to develop it's not gonna like like uh get traction too soon uh given also like David like even like future volume is a little like meager um I don't see like how like uh yeah the ball features uh we'll get traction soon uh I think like I think like I'm more like interested in product design perspective I love to see the ball and like perpetuals I think that's not like um that's coming out on day one yeah uh is that more so around like the expiry management um yeah sort of deal because I mean inequities fix expertise uh is a big deal and in crypto I mean I never I never really touched fix too too much but my understanding was to to hedge some of the stuff you would you would trade two strips of options in a calendar so let's say like I buy like a diva future I would trade this calendar strip as a hedge and you know when expert comes my my front leg is not going to expire as the same at the same time as the d-ball x-grade right because we're talking about a Wednesday expert versus a Friday expert and when I see this reality I'm like okay we're not at a point where liquidity and dailies is not that high yet so everybody's gonna have the same position on let's say this Market was baby everybody has the same position on and you're gonna see this Scramble for options where liquidity is going to be poor like in on s p you actually have a fairly liquid Wednesday expert where you can actually you know trade you can easily hedge it but like in BTC when you know are you going to have the liquidity into dailies when all the market makers are gonna you know potentially have the same position um but I I can't be sure of that like that that's just kind of like my initial intuition speaking I think the um the exciting thing from my point of view again it's just it's just another step in the evolution and maturity of this market and you know if you look at the derivative space it's super important in terms of Institutions being able to come and play in this space in terms of how to kind of hedge risk um and it's just another product that's gonna allow that um and it's just it just keeps amazing me how quickly this this Market uh is evolving this asset class evolves and despite you know all all the that's gone on over the last year a bit of FTX and Celsius and all the other things like yeah here we are still still seeing new product launches still seeing the space evolve in quite a positive way um so yeah I I think it's super exciting um yeah it'll take time to build I'm sure and and to provide liquidity but again it's everything's going in the right direction and we're seeing again I've said it before we see an evolution of the sort of Trad fire world that went on over decades in such a short sort of sped up time in crypto it's pretty phenomenal to watch and be a part of as well I think that's like that's a great way to cap it off David that was beautiful [Laughter] bro crypto Pro risk love it uh Kyle thanks thanks for joining man um always happy to have you [Music]
