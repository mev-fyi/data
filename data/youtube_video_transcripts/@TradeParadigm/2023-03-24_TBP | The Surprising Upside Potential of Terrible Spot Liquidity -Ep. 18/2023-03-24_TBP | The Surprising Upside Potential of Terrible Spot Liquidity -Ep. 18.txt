[Music] hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of life hey guys welcome to the my name is Joe Crewe here and I'm in the weeds around everything crypto ball markets I'm joined here by my colleagues David Brickell in London and today we have Chris Newhouse from GSR back on the channel to discuss crypto ball markets over these crazy crazy past two weeks and before we begin if you like this content so far please hit that like And subscribe button really helps us as we continue to grow the channel uh and Chris I believe you were across ever guest on this podcast you could quickly reintroduce yourself for our new reviewers we think that would be really helpful yeah sure so a little bit of background about myself so I joined GSR May 2022 and I'm on our OTC trading team focusing on spot and options markets um in my free time I write educational content for you guys over at Paradigm and then I also write a weekend recap on the ball markets for dare bit as well so very very focused on Crypt of all and you're absolutely right it's been a very chaotic past couple of weeks but that's probably going to make for some good content so yeah yeah but I kind of feel I kind of feel bad bored last week you know given uh not the guilt trip you I knew I know you were skiing uh but uh but I mean a lot has happened these past couple weeks and yeah we do we definitely we definitely missed one here but we're gonna make up for it today yeah we signed just before we come on it is unbelievable I went away skiing on the Friday um landed in Bulgaria and the world had blown up and typically the week you're away that everything's going on um but you know it's it's cool like uh we'll get into this um but you know I think it's super exciting um you know I I well we certainly at that Paradigm like the volatility and B um you know this for me is certainly the kind of long-term macro thesis playing out um for crypto um what we're seeing and um and yeah it's kind of fitting nicely into some of the themes we had coming into the year yeah yeah absolutely let me share my screen I got a couple of Indie slides for us well it's only been as we kind of said you know it's been two weeks since we last filmed the big picture and but in that and it kind of feels like we are on a lifetime in a sense and I think it'd be interesting to kind of just set the stage you know since we last filmed on March uh 7th or March 8th I think it was since then BTC is up 26 has a year-to-date sharp ratio of 275. which is the best risk adjuster performance out of all global everything and then the PC gold 30-day realize correlation has increased from zero from zero not correlated at all to 50. while the BTC s p 30-day correlation has decreased from positive positive 30 to now like a negative 20. and in terms of what happened involved you know the entire you know BTC at the money term structure you know trades above 60 Vol it's it's fairly inverted and a couple even a couple times over the past um past few weeks uh you know you you had it reaching 100 volt you know you had the short date implies uh hitting 100 volts and then also you know that you look at the BTC eth implied spreads uh you know some of those are now negative now until the March and April buckets so and then in terms of volume you know the 24-hour derabit volume I think reached like two and a half billion you know which is the highest like in two years so so Chris let's get into it like I'm curious to hear like your thoughts around what you've seen over the past two weeks in the crypto ball markets as as I think we'd all agree that this like digital gold narrative is is starting to take hold a little bit yeah yeah no definitely I I really think that the digital gold narrative people bring up they brought it up occasionally but I think it's really starting to pop back up right like you have on here correlation to Gold's increasing Bitcoin spy decoupling I also think that there's true big Believers in crypto right some of the niche funds with capital are even more interested in Bitcoin now given the banking situation so the reason Bitcoin was created the whole ethos of it is to have a transparent trustless and decentralized monetary system and I think with the events going on now it seems like it's more in demand than ever so it's very crazy to me though the the Bitcoin eth kind of decoupling in the ball sense in terms of Bitcoin trading at premiums to eat right like there's the the whole Shanghai narrative coming up and I I always thought it was I personally always thought like the Shanghai narrative might be kind of a a non-event uh but maybe that's a great opportunity for a relative value trade here um I do think however though like this really shows I mean with the monetary policy going on and the the emphasis on the banking system I do think it makes sense that Bitcoin is in the Forefront of everyone's kind of view right now right like the upcoming fed meeting is coming up um but it's mainly going to be based on the projections that come out of this uh and I think that bitcoin's narrative and kind of quintessential ethos of that decentralized monetary system is kind of what's kept in the driver's seat in the spotlight right now yeah um no I think I think that's totally right and I I mean we've heard a lot we've seen a lot of research and uh around you know the Shanghai merge and I think Chris and you and I had had discussed in DM a little bit around hey yeah like nobody's really focusing on this like if you just look at the flows lead time right like you could bid for the Youth fall these days it does really really difficult to bid for ethal out there right there there's been so much demand for BTC especially on the upside we have very very rarely seen that come into play you know in eth and I would say more of the flows have tend to tended to skew on the side of of selling you some maybe there's even something to be like hell like like this narrative I need to own the Bitcoin ups and because of that I kind of need something to sell against it if I don't want to just you know potentially ride these things especially as uh you know we've been experiencing the spot spot up volup and now that being realizing but like I don't know yeah you know just owning out right out upside without you know you know something against it you know potentially uh has some implications around Carrie where it's just like yeah I don't know you can potentially bleed a little bit yeah I think as well like like Traders God I'm opening myself up here but Traders are pretty simple animals right in many ways and um you want to keep these things as simple as you can and like Bitcoin right now is the cleanest trade um because not only have you got with ethereum you've got a Shanghai upgrade and I mean God we've we've had kind of discussions on here about what we think that means um but also if you've got um you know Gensler and you know labeling everything about Bitcoin and security so you've got all these things that muddy the waters if you want to play this kind of monetary uh you know Fiat system blow up trade um and all the issues that are going on with the US military policy uh Bitcoins just just to clean this shirt to stick on yep it feels like Bitcoin and as you guys were saying too is you have the main game in town and we had mentioned on a previous the big picture in January that you know Bitcoin option volumes were starting to outpace ethereum and that narrative has only really continued to progress with you know BTC volumes 70 of the total volume so far in March so 70 Bitcoin 30 ethereum and that top chart you can see it as the last bar on the right and remember back in August last year you know this relationship was flipped and you know we heard this term being coined around you know the each volume flipping and oh this is ethereum's moment you know this is where the volumes come to the Forefront but it really has done a complete 180. the Bitcoins back in that driver's seat where really the only flippingings that we're actually talking about now are each Vols trading under Bitcoin because there's just so little demand to own if optionality these days and ethereum it's been a complete nothing Burger in comparison to bitcoin this year and you know no one really cares about the Shanghai event and kind of kind of rightfully so right um you know just giving given the macro setup right um like do do you guys think that ethereum is going to continue to be over showered overshadowed by Bitcoin or is it kind of just like a a function of the narrative where you know it kind of is this perfect storm for you know Bitcoin to Rally as of now so you know that's kind of what we're seeing but you do you guys think the ethereum volumes are going to come back or you know Bitcoin is just going to be the main show yeah I mean my view Joe definitely is that yeah I I always say like markets markets are driven by narratives um always um and it's so important nothing overlooked and not like you say right now the narrative for Bitcoin is super super strong um that will fade you know as things settle down um in in certain in the banking system um I think then we see a rotation and then and then you start to sort of focus on some sort of crypto idiosyncratic uh stories and narratives and and then maybe the Shanghai um upgrade becomes the focus um so I do I do think that'll fade and um and we'll kind of uh switch but right now it's just it's again it's just it's kind of the easier trade and and um and the cleanest one I think for people to focus on right now yeah yeah exactly it's just you know I guess that's just the perfect recipe to to own upside and that's certainly the flows that that we've been seeing uh you know the money printer uh quote unquote starting to unwind a little bit you know you're seeing BTC act as this you know hedge to monetary incompetence I think I think qcp put that in their Channel that's a that's a quote from them uh you know the increasing monetary debasement risks and then you have you know the short we'll get into this later Chris but like the short gamma above current spot levels and and last week I mean obviously the Vols are higher now but last week you know the implies were trading like in the high 50s you know versus seven day trailing realize of you know 85 balls like I don't want to be you know Captain hindsight over here but like it kind of seemed like it was you know the no no-brainer sort of trade and that was certainly the trades that we were seeing I mean if you just look on the screen you know all those outright calls and call spreads trading on us and you know the only large downside side prints that we've been seeing on Paradigm have been selling puts selling out of puts that you know guys you know puts that were being bought you know as the Silicon Valley Bank news was really starting to pick up and you did see that reach for protection but you know given that is not really uh you know a risk uh as much anymore you know we saw guys kind of selling out of that stuff and I think the most meaningful print that we saw last week was the one that I highlighted in green so we saw 900 Saturday x-ray Saturday expert 25 5K calls these were bought on Thursday right so somebody is effectively buying these to kind of like engineer like a sort of squeeze that's that's kind of how I look out that is like massive size and short dated options we saw this exact same narrative back in January where people I think it was like the Jan 26 like 18K calls or something somebody bought these things that they were expiring like in four hours somebody bought like a thousand yeah I think they were expiring before the CPI print too so they were yeah that's the biggest thing I saw that as well I was at like a basketball game and I'm looking at the some of these flows pop up and I'm like wait a second this isn't actually going to cover CPI because of the derivative expert so yeah yeah and because they didn't capture the CPI I mean they got they got a better entry point because the implies weren't attacked but like yeah we've seen all these massive upside flows and then you see like this one where it kind of just feels like this is like the neat this is like the what do they call it like the piece of hay to break the camel's back you know in a sense right somebody buying these Saturday options and then you know we put it in our commentary as well we saw this and we're like we're about to go right we're not about to run uh and that's exactly that's exactly what happens um you know not to Pat ourselves on the back here but uh I I guess you know given that the balls are higher we have rallied a bit now like what what is your implementation of choice uh you know if you're trying to get upside in this market yep so for me specifically and this is literally what you're seeing on the flows as well is these outright call bias have transitioned into call spreads right so with implies trading and massive premiums compared to a few weeks ago exactly as you're talking about I think in the previous slide we're like oh you could sell youth against it things like what we're actually seeing is people taking advantage of this massive call skew as well they're just turning them into call spreads right so whenever we're at these highly elevated levels of implied balls tall spreads are kind of negating the impacts of theta kind of the Vega exposure as well so I think it makes absolute complete sense that a lot of these outright call buying the flows have turned into these massive call spreads and the biggest thing for me is like there's decent size coming in for these call spreads obviously and then it's the strike ranges that they're choosing so I think even yesterday it's not as big as some of these call spreads I think but there's some interest in the 42-55k call spreads for later dated X-rays I was like okay wow if people are starting to get that bullish like you know you obviously don't have to hit those strikes to get into profit but with people kind of taking on these positions right now I'm like okay there's some bullish thought process going through these buyers right now people have transitioned from out of the outright calls directly into call spreads and I think it makes a lot of sense right now so if I wanted to kind of take this directional upside I'd probably be putting on call spreads right now um if I wanted to bet for further upside yeah no I think that I think that makes a total total sense um but yeah but you know it's kind of one of these risk reward things right like you're not going to have especially with like these Junes 40ks 45ks you're not really not gonna have that convexity really kick in yet yeah and look I mean we moved 25 in like two weeks you know this is a June expiry you know 45k ain't that ain't so far away but like as you said you know these are the reasons why you can are able to extract these amazing payouts and you know the the Vol of all that we've seen has just been so dramatic Chris like dude we were like we were talking like uh literally like as the Silicon Valley Bank news was going out the the puts were trading like 20 look at like 25 Delta skew and then you have like puts eight balls over calls and then you walk like two or three days later you see this complete reversal and it's moved like 16 points in like the opposite direction it's absolutely crazy this Market yeah I literally I went to like Amber data's like what some of their charts and I was looking at regarding the SKU it was like one of the quickest flips I've seen and it was also in longer dated Tenors as well so I was looking at like six months out right it was wild um I think we're like puts trading seven points over calls for six months expiry um I think the only notable times I've seen such a quick flip in SKU was the week of FTX and then the week like we were talking about of the January CPI print to take us back above 20K but I really don't think that there's been a magnitude of that level in terms of flipping for skew in quite some time in terms of like the short datedness of it yeah I know that uh go on David yeah yeah Oscar Ross just something on that um because obviously we talk a lot about positioning and flows and one of the things that struck me given the moves over the past week uh I mean and particularly cross asset I mean you know we're talking about this in crypto some of the moving rates have been like just equally sort of mind-blowing um and probably perhaps more so well one of the things I was interested Chris from a trading point of view and from the on the trading desk like obviously we're witnessing a big sort of vile shock um and I know back from my days everyone wants to start strapping on risk and then you get the tap on the shoulder to say varshock we've all got a gross down risk um even if it's stuff you've got on that you like everyone needs to reduce positioning um are you kind of seeing any of that or are you even experiencing any kind of pressure just to generally kind of gross down on risk or or how's that how's that working for you it's mainly been from what we've seen um in terms of flows it's mainly a lot of these kind of out of the money calls and I think we'll probably talk about in this gamma exposure there's a lot of demand for out of the money calls and now the money upside last week a lot of people put these on 25 26 28k strikes those immediately get hit in the money and those people are kind of short gamer either forced to cover or you know forced to cover or forced to go through like being able to monetize it through Delta hedging um so we've kind of seen like some people literally just outright close some of these and cross the spread on either Paradigm or Dare a bit and kind of downsize some of their risk exposure for some of these short you know short data gamma positions expiring in March 31st 24th Tenors and things like that so that's kind of what I'd say in terms of we've seen a lot of closures of some of these like all positions that were opened a while back yeah that makes that makes total sense I mean the Vol has has been absolutely crazy and I I think part of this is also just driven by the fact that we're we're also to seeing larger clips than like previously right it kind of It kind of felt like okay like you know if you're looking at if you want to get like a decent clip off in your BTC upside you know you see like 250 contracts but as soon as we really started to go through like 2016 I think this is indicative of of the um crypto option volumes also picking up dramatically like now those clip sizes go from 250 to like 500. right so dealers are getting shorter upside um you know shorter gamma uh because you know that 25 Delta call that they sell like immediately becomes like a 50 Delta and then as you can see on the chart on the right management of Delta Hedges has been it's been a complete nightmare hey we are carrying it constantly from market makers where this like dude like we can't put it up at this level because like as soon as we go executing our Deltas this is gonna go 400 like 300 points in our face right and so this is a good good uh chart by kaiko I really recommend these guys if you're looking for um no not a promotion or anything from that but if you're if you're looking for you know research on you know bid offer and spread liquidities especially in the spot markets it's it's really really good stuff but you look especially since silver I mean obviously it took a dive after FDA FTX but then you have silvergate svb going offline you know these are very important on off ramps for crypto right so you have that happen and then liquidity Dives even further and you know this has been in indicative in The Wider bid offer spreads that we've seen in the option prices yet people don't really care you know they'll really lift this stuff you know we're seeing markets that are trading like five Vols wide and people the demand for this upside has been quite insatiable whether you know that is just through like genuine take or interest or quite frankly some dealers you know covering offside positions we've seen some of that too uh and then also just a fair amount of rolling activity uh you know out the curve of upside that has performed well but I mean Chris if you look if you look at this chart on the left it kind of seems you know assuming that you believe you have this assumption that you know the G of all gax is correct yeah and I think I think in general it does it does quite a quite a good job obviously it doesn't it doesn't take it into account you know the OTC OTC flows where I would imagine most of that is Supply and I know there's a big Bitcoin miner out there you know that you know sold a lot of like 25k strike you know last month when we're I know we're away from that now but the point is you know there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff that gex isn't really able to capture but like kind of what's your view are we kind of like Peak short gamma like this chart is suggesting yeah yeah so I I love the chart in combination with the spot liquidity right because I think the reason gamma exposure is so important in crypto is you know you've nailed it on the head here spot liquidity isn't as deep as it is in FX or traditional markets so whatever kind of people go to execute these Delta Hedges they really have to be cognizant of the size they're putting onto the options market right because these quick systematic spot buys and t-wops actually can have an impact on price right and if that price just so happens to be at like a level causing Liquidations in the derivatives Market you can kind of get one of those tail wags of the dog moment between derivatives and spot and boom you see some explosive price action so I think that gamma exposure when combined with looking at spot liquidity looking at liquidations and then like you said not just taking it you know surface level there's definitely OTC flows and things going on like that I think it does you know make a pretty interesting kind of chart to look at um you know I think in terms of what we're seeing here um anyone who went shortfall that weekend you know a weekend ago or over right over Road calls you know got absolutely blown out and kind of as you pointed spot liquid he's at all times lows and as we've kind of seen outright closure of some of these upside calls even though there's a massive ball spread has definitely started to kind of pop up and happen uh most of these short most of these calls were like very short dated two week calls like March 31st March 24th we even saw that March 18th thing that you you kind of highlighted in the last chart as well so very very heavy exposure to gamma and with gamma performing and a squeeze coming up you definitely start to get scared whenever you approach these short strikes right the 25 26 28 and it just causes this massive move that's kind of popped up over the past week yeah yeah I mean it's marketing it's just like it's just like the most reflexive Market that that I've ever seen and I know we're focused a lot on microstructure uh on the big picture but you know if you you really have this like in crypto ball this maker taker um Supply demand and balance because like compare like David compared to like traditional FX who are all the big makers you know all the big makers right are like for example the big banks that have these massive balance sheets it feels like a lot of the time the bigger quote-unquote balance sheets are on the taker side you know in crypto right it's it's not like you have these guys that have these massive wallets whether these are high net worth individuals you know guys that got into crypto like in 2009 2010 accumulated all this massive size and then on the other other side you have market makers that are not necessarily bad right that are kind of just market makers that are funded by you know like BC investors and and things like this so because of this nature you have these massive wallets that are able to just basically like assert their dominance effectively like on makers and really just you know move things very quickly if it feels it feels very um very much like the old old kind of macro World um like really before kind of volatility got killed in the rates and FX base um sort of in the QE world and those old days like you know some of the big funds move you know once they see a narrative a theme um they press hard and yeah they you know they because they know they're playing for these big moves um and and this is certainly if you're a hedge fund right this is It's these moments where you make your money most of the time you kind of just Treading Water um and hoping that you don't kind of bleed too much during those Quiet Moments so when the moment comes um when the lights come on you've really really gotta gotta sort of push push the uh push the pedal um and I think that's what you're seeing right and it yeah it feels very kind of almost like old school macro but but you know the way markets used to trade um you know in the Heyday when when hedge funds really sort of sprung to prominence you see it you're seeing those opportunities and markets trade that way now um yeah the opportunity comes up and guys are guys are just really hammering it and um and yeah sort of going relentlessly after it yeah it completely makes sense especially with kind of what you're saying you know Joe you just talked about it like these clips have gone from okay you know 250 a couple of Clips there now they're like 500 clips and you're getting done with 2 000 Bitcoin in a couple hours so it definitely makes sense these as well like like I mean it'd be interesting to get um you know get one of the hedge fund clients so on here but like you know when you've got a mandate um that's sort of focused on assess your Bitcoin certainly if it's more directional in nature um you know you can't not be involved in this move you know you're particularly when when most most kind of prospectus is going to be around like you know for the you know digital goals you know uh kind of ideology um you know the sort of blow up the Fiat system if when that system starts to fall apart and Creak you've not got sufficient risk on and exposure to it then why the hell am I I sort of paying you as a fund um to sort of manage my I I just buy a whole Bitcoin myself but you know if you're paying a fund to sort of you two and twenty or whatever to manage that you've got to strap it on when things start to move and you've got to have the exposure and I think that's kind of what we're seeing yeah I think that's I think you're hitting the nail completely on the head here right like Bitcoin is finally performing as a diversity diversification Hedge it was designed as right not like performing with like a correlation of you know ethereum NASDAQ of like 80 or Bitcoin s p of like 50 right and a sustained significant outperformance like we're seeing now is only going to strengthen the case for those to gain exposure to this asset class as long as they can become comfortable around you know custody in the asset and these sort of things and and it ties back nicely into the previous Point like with liquidity in its current state it doesn't take a lot of it does not take a lot of belief to get this thing moving when you see order when you see two percent Market depth in that right chart where it is right now all you all you don't need a lot of demand for this stuff to really really get this Market going and I think something on the Delta one side that's pretty interesting is like you know the future is open interest it's increasing yes but it's not like significantly increasing you know when at least when compared to like previous rallies and the funding levels like are not blown out right it kind of suggests that this rally is spot trip right this isn't people like reaching for futures and like okay have you seem to get leverage to this no this is like people like actually buying Bitcoin and spot and you see this through the address data right like you you see this through um you know there's an increasing number of addresses with non-zero balances um that that number has continued to go up and long-term holders are holding for longer like do I think that we're going to be at a million I I forget that guy's Twitter handle well you know I think we're gonna be at a million in three months no like I hope we're not because that's gonna like that infers this mad Maxine like existence like we better be reaching for our shotguns if Bitcoin is a million dollars in three months but like it does feel like this upside is quite asymmetric especially now that you have these new narratives emerging around like global banking vulnerabilities uh and I think this is a good segue into you know David's macro macro here like what's what's your view uh I I know that fed is going to be done by the time we uh we put this thing out but like kind of what's your view from here yeah I mean yeah I mean we'll see what the FED do a little bit later but look I think fundamentally the problem with the banking sector is that fed rates are too high right period um and certainly given the combination with inverted yield curves so banks are unable to hike deposit rates right so uh otherwise they'll they'll lose profitability so deposits are flooding out of banks in search for a higher um uh money market yields so because front-end rates are just simply sort of too high and the banks can't handle it so to kind of meet that deposit outflow banks are having to sell assets to basically meet their liquidity needs now the problem is a lot of those assets they're holding around the water and you know partly through regulatory reasons these these Banks were all forced to hold load of treasuries and then the FED hikes like they've hiked and now now this stuff's underwater now because this sort of BS Accounting um you know practice we have where if they're deemed held to maturity Banks don't have to Mark Mark them to Market they can hold them on the balance yet par everything was fine until they needed to start selling some of these assets that are underwater to to uh to meet the the liquidity outflows all the deposit outflows and that and and all of a sudden they've got a solvency issue which is exactly what we saw with svb so consequently the FED of the ones now again half into Supply and liquidity otherwise the whole system blows up um and we we never really got away from that um and this is again being part of my sort of bigger picture thesis for for crypto that will be forever needing Central Bank liquidity uh to to to kind of keep these markets alive so in terms of where I think it goes from here I I kind of feel like that that front end rates is too high so whoever it looks like power is probably going to go 25 tonight because the Market's allowing him to do so I think he should pause because again the issue the cause here is that front-end rates are too high and then the liquidity sort of measures that the btfp and what have you they're addressing the symptoms but they're not addressing the cause and those symptoms are going to grow and and the need to address symptoms is going to get even bigger the more they hike rates so front end rates simply need to come down um I think fed hikes today uh 25 just because Market is kind of allowing them and they're a little bit confused what do we do about inflation we still want to sound incredible on that front but that lows to those two levers for me are are are kind of competing against one another the the idea that the FED can simply hike crates to address inflation but then pump the market full of liquidity um I just don't think it can happen because what you're going to see the more they hike rates the more you're going to see the the sort of deposit outflows accelerate which means the more there's going to be Banks tapping these liquidity tools that the FED are offering them so what you're going to see is the the banks uh the central bank and the fed's balance sheet is going to explode um and and it's going to explode higher the more they they carry on with rate hikes and there's a central bank balance sheet explodes you're going to see Bitcoin explode so I mean how how I see this plays out from here is ultimately the FED are going to have to pause I I think they probably hike today and then that's that's one last hike um and then the end of that cycle but even if they pause today you know ultimately the only way this reverses is if they cut rates and cut get them down pretty quickly now obviously they they kind of can't do that right now because inflation that was for a lot of panic like even your point around like oh they they keep interest rates flat today well I think that would tell the market oh  maybe maybe there's something that they know that we don't know and things are actually a lot worse than appears on the tin and things on the 10 appear pretty freaking bad right now yeah I mean I mean it's funny because like you start going through all these iterations and then it's kind of like um you know but then if if we know that they know that like you know and and it all gets it all gets a little bit silly um I mean because equally then like if your hiking rates because we know your hiking rates because you don't want us to know that there's a problem then that becomes a problem um I I can't I kind of think at this at this stage it doesn't matter um and I know it's controversial to say a head of a fed and I could end up looking very stupid but I I think what they do tonight actually doesn't really matter and I don't think what pal says actually really matters because I think he's lost control and narrative and he's lost control of policy um you know the the market is now firmly in control um I say I think if he hikes and he tries to sound a little bit too aggressive on inflation or what have you then banks are going to get absolutely smashed and then we're gonna see the next um sort of reading for the best balance sheet and it's going to increase another 300 billion and all of a sudden pretty quickly we've wiped out an entire Year's worth of quantitative tightening so I I don't think it matters and given given my view that you know rates and liquidity um are what Drive markets um the liquidity tap is on now and I don't think they can turn that off and the only way it potentially gets turned off is if I was you know very very quickly get front and rates down slash rates which you're not going to be able to do so I think whatever he does tonight pause hike 25 maybe even height 50. aside from like the knee-jerk reactions I think quite quickly markets are going to settle back into right this just means more and more liquidities coming back into the market um to essentially effectively bail out the banks and address those liquidity issues and liquidity we all know that that Bitcoin and crypto's liquidity junkie so I kind of actually still see an asymmetry for for Bitcoin um and crypto to trade higher uh whatever whatever he does at this point um and again whatever he says like if he's really aggressive um I actually think markets then are going to price in a bigger policy mistake and we're going to see rates um at the back end start to come much sharply lower um so I I kind of think he's lost control of the narrative at this point um and sometimes the best thing is is do nothing um which is probably not going to do but eventually you'll have to but yeah for in terms of crypto look the liquidity Taps on um they're not going to be able to turn it off anytime soon I I came into into this year bullish crypto on the back of um you know this peak inflation Peak rate narrative and and yeah well well I I was going to say right so I I was bullish on crypto on just that narrative basically lefed pausing I didn't actually think there'd be cutting rates this year but I thought we'll hit the pause I I felt liquidity was at its tightest levels um so liquidity would just ease ease marginally um and that QT would probably end up stopping at some point um and we've seen the offsets as well pboc boj expanding their balance sheet which is offset what the FED had been doing um so I came in bullish on that narrative now we've got a narrative that not only are the FED gonna have to pause uh but potentially cut quite aggressively towards the back end of the year we've now got a full unwind pretty much of of the Banshee contraction and the quantitative tightening and now potentially we have an explosive expansion of that balance sheet so if I came in sort of quite bullish for crypto at the style this year not for seeing some of these banking issues um I mean now now this is that on this is that on steroids for me so so yeah I I think we're just getting going I still don't think the position is there um in crypto um and I and I think you see that it's very grabby right how how people are trying to chase these moves as they come um markets came into year under positioned you're seeing that inequities as well markets are under positioned equities I'm actually relatively bullish on equities as well again functional rates and liquidity so liquidity Taps on um yeah I I think we're just getting going yeah and not not to get existential here but like what's been happening with these bank bailouts you think this is just going to perpetuate this whole moral hazard problem that we have where it's like oh I don't need to I don't need to actually really care too much around edging my duration risk because at the end of the day there's just going to be a lot of money you've thrown out of a helicopter at me anyways for owning crypto right yeah yeah look at the end of the day the 2008 the system the Fiat system reached its own endpoint um its natural endpoint and it should have reset and that but that obviously which I get is a very difficult decision for anyone in a position of power to sit back and let happen and we would have maybe been looking at depression and all those things um so they kicked the can down the road they flooded they flooded everything with liquidity they artificially inflated asset prices because that was the collateral underpinning the entire Financial system and once you open that door you can never fully shut it and we go through these little periods where okay things look pretty calm um they think they can start hiking rates withdrawing liquidity and pretty quickly it doesn't take long before things blow up now we saw that in in 2019 uh if you remember we had the repo blow up um and and that's when they lended not QE QE but basically it was QE um and they again the market cannot get themselves off of the FED liquidity and the ultimate byproduct of that is the currency the basement and Sophia currency is gonna essentially be the Escape valve um which means Bitcoin is well all kind of assets I think are going to go up I think nasdaq's going to go up Gold's gonna go up but then Bitcoin obviously is the is the kind of the exponential um asset with the high beta asset that that's going to absolutely fly on this so I think we've reached the limits of what the FED can do in terms of trying to address inflation they now they now hope and pray that um that inflation comes down I actually do think it will come down um because there's nothing more deflationary than a banking crisis lending is going to freeze at this point um you know you're talking about a full-on credit crunch um so so quite quickly you'll see growth come down pretty rapidly um and inflation with it ever I'd be amazed if Powell has to allude to that tonight in my view like that your outlook your outlook from this point must be different to everything it was two weeks ago because you've got to kind of see the transmission from what's going on in the banking system um into the real economy um and you know I I I know they're going to have these style kind of forecasts um where they were going to ratchet up expectations for inflation and everything based on two weeks ago but but they kind of be relevant now because you're probably looking at a much more quickly disinflationary regime than what we had and certainly you know hopes of avoiding a hard Landing look look pretty pretty slim at this point and for a Fed that had already acknowledged that things were coming a little bit more two-way in terms of the balance of risks well guess what the balance of risks have now skewed massively to the downside so um I I think power needs to be cautious otherwise it's just going to sound a little bit stupid right okay awesome I think that is a great place to leave it we cover crypto ball microstructure and David you crushed it on the macro as always and and Chris that thanks so much for joining us crypto ball Market it's super interesting always loved
