[Music] hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hi guys welcome back to our recurring segment of the big picture with our partner analyst Greg from Amber data so Greg's been on the channel now what like four four times I I feel I think so yeah three or four yeah yeah and it's it's been sick it's been it's been some of like the best analysis that we've done you know on this show and it's really become a favorite for our viewers uh so definitely want to keep doing it we we love it and as a reminder so Greg founded Genesis volatility designed specifically for the sort of analysis that he'll take you through today and then subsequently merge with Amber data and continuing to build out the platform there it's really awesome stuff stay tuned and before we begin if you haven't already smash that like smash that subscribe Button as we continue to deliver you some of the best content in crypto derivatives so that being said Greg let's let's dive into it man yeah absolutely so I just want to start off with sort of a recent quarterly report we just launched in the middle of this month uh in mid-july so one of the things that we've been analyzing is essentially how Q2 performed and some of the deviations that we saw in Q2 versus the rest of the year and and versus 2022 so really kind of the big theme just to recap here is we after the svb banking crisis if you see this chart here we're comparing the performance of ether and Bitcoin year to date Bitcoin is an orange so you can see in mid-march after SVP banking crisis that's really when Bitcoin had this outperformance and it's been able to essentially hold on to this out performance ever since then and if you look here spot file Dynamics again last year uh Bitcoin and ether had very identical relationships in terms of spot ball Dynamics very negatively correlated and here I mean they're both hovering around zero but you can see there's a slight positive spot ball Dynamic for Bitcoin and a slight negative uh spot Vol Dynamic for ether so that's something that was kind of interesting especially considering the correlation of these assets historically speaking you have two really correlated assets with Divergent spot ball Dynamics even though it's by a small margin so that's kind of something that's interesting and a good potential opportunity press cooldown a little bit more here one of the things we wanted to highlight was the beta of eth versus Bitcoin so if we look at beta of eth in Bitcoin terms uh when we're above 1.0 essentially there's more beta to eth when we're below 1.0 there's more beta to bitcoin and so if we look at this chart going back to January 2021 we can really see that most of the time ether has a higher beta moves more it's been as high as 1.6 but really starting in March of this year we can sort of see that we're hovering below the 1.0 Mark and this is really what's leading to the sort of convergence of volatility between Bitcoin and eth and so that's that's a theme we've talked about a lot so I don't want to I don't want to hammer it but it's just kind of a kind of something to throw in there to show you what's kind of going on and if you look at a dval index you can see the Bitcoin D Vol in Orange the eat the ball in blue you can really see two things here one is a structural downward Trend and then the other thing is sort of the convergence between the two so those are kind of interesting data points on a relative wall basis I'm going to skip through a lot of this report you guys can download it and get it for free we'll we'll set I'll send a link to Joe after this yeah we'll link it in the subscription in the description of the video so really what's interesting right now especially because we're we're at these extreme low-ball environments and I'll touch on where we're currently at right now but one of the main things I want to highlight here is the variance risk premium so basically what we did here is we looked at the Bitcoin D Vol and then we looked at 30 day realized we shift them to align them since implied is a is a best estimate a future realized so we want to really see how close that estimate was well the main thing that we see here besides sort of the structural downtrend is that typically Bitcoin options have just been overpriced so the variance risk premium had you can see it it Peaks out as high as 50 points so that's 50 ball points on a 30-day so expiration that's that's a lot of you know essentially overpriced Vega sort of something to be done there and the other thing that really stands out is for the exception of May 2021 when you're wrong when options are underpriced it's by a short it's a shallow amount and it's very short-lived so that that kind of intuits are essentially our base assumption for for crypto options trading and I think there's a logical explanation I mean this Market is still nascent uh market makers only have so much capacity to essentially sell options that the inventory gets tapped out pretty quickly the traditional flows that you would see where people you know buy equities and sell covered calls and stuff like that that that hasn't really translated into crypto in full swing yet we're seeing a little bit of that in each but it hasn't translated in full swing and then lastly crypto is the kind of this fomo Market when crypto's rallying everyone feels like they're missing out and everyone wants to get long and so we have these periods where people will pay up for ball and oftentimes you know judging by this data it looks like they're overpaying for that fall and so just to compare in essentially the SPX space you know if we look at the variance first premium for for vix versus SP xpx you can see it's pretty shallow it's either up five points or down five points but it's a it's a very tight clustered range compared to what we just showed in the Bitcoin variance risk premium and um you can see that here when we did this back test strategy back test of just selling the straddle with you know basic uh Delta hedging rules you know how well that outperformed so that's something that's that's really interesting as well happy just kind of pause it there and I'm happy to kind of jump into uh what what I'm seeing right now in the space uh yeah I mean it's it's pretty um this is the sort of structural decline that we've been seeing um in cryptovall has been you know you know very very apparent um but it's kind of interesting we're we're now kind of starting to see a shift I guess in sentiment from some of the big takers on Paradigm I could even see it today you know December 36 000 calls you know bought one thousand or 500 times sept 32k calls bought around 700 times and you know even just like speaking you know a quote that I heard today if I die owning Bitcoin one month fall at 35 then so be it you know so like do you think we're gonna get to the point where like I mean of course we've kind of had the structural decline in realize and implies are going to follow that but like you think we kind of get to this point where you know the Vol is going to kind of be floored you know obviously above zero but like you really think it's gonna keep going lower so here yeah here's what's interesting let me share my screen here I think there's a a really good argument to be made that we will see Ball come back at some point for sure um one of the things and I was talking to Gordon over at Genesis about this you know he he mentioned a really interesting mental framework where it's like uh you get this rumor such as like the Bitcoin ETF and you get all these applications you trade that ball event then you have the application period which you know a lot of time goes by just dead silence and then you actually get the news of you know let's I'm assuming it's going to get uh approved but who knows you know didn't you trade the the actual event as well so I think right now especially considering uh in mid-march Bitcoin is really moving on sort of macro news now it feels like the shift is more trading on industry news so we had a big trading period around the xrp uh judgment that was that was a big deal uh SEC going after binance and coinbase that was a tradable event the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF application that was a tradable event and so we had all these industry specific news events and now I think we're just in that digestion period And so there's kind of a couple things here let me just start on the realized space under realize space realized ball is still insanely low so this is 12 years of data I'm sorry 11 years of data of Bitcoin realized volatility and so we can see the minimum uh or let's just look at the the minimum is this pink line over at the bottom the green line is where we currently are for all these measurement periods and then the blue lines are the lower 25th percentage tile the upper 75th and then the median is that yellow and that took out the maximum because the maximum range can go pretty nuts um so it squished this chart but basically what we can see here is that realize fall is basically at you know decade lows um so there's a good argument to say to be made at oh you know realize while we'll come back because it's going to go back to the median at some point even if the median shifts down a couple points um it's still going to mean reverse at some point now until we mean revert and this is something I've talked about here before and and uh David has pointed out me saying this when fall is low it becomes really expensive to hold and so what we're seeing here is if I'm looking at seven day realize versus seven day implied well we can see that the difference in the variance first premium or the carry you can look at that in the the blue chart here at the bottom the histogram part I mean it's almost 10 points of carry so assuming there's no ball pickup and realize just stays here implied is still price over 10 points over realized so there's a there's a big sort of a premium that you're paying to be long ball here and then another thing to look at is this term structure steepness so not only are you paying a big premium over realized but then you're going to roll down that term structure as well and so what we're seeing here the term structure steepness this is the past this is going back to 2019 I believe so this is going to show us sort of the the the net uh discount or premium the net backwardation or contango and so we can see a reading of 1.0 which is the upper orange line is a flat term structure and then the lower orange line is sort of peak steepness in the term structure and we're kind of just hanging out there which makes sense because ball is cheap right now or realize this low right now so implied as we kind of approach expiration it's going to drag down to where realize is right now and then longer dated options are gonna uh implicitly priced in some of that mean reversion so unless your timing is right uh just being long Vault here is going to have a lot of negative carry to it so the way that I would structure it in my mind is that I would sort of align my long ball bet to sort of coincide nicely with a potential ETF uh spot application sort of decision time because I think that will be a catalyst to bring ball back I think until then you're essentially just kind of relying on the macro and we might get some macro event I mean it looks like long long dated bonds are moving so maybe something will happen there um but that being said if we're looking at Equity Vol we're kind of in these new post-pandemic lows we've had the vix as low as the 12th handle and so typically ball as Asic fastball is somewhat correlated so like if things are going crazy in one part of the world they're typically going crazy in other parts of the world and so we're kind of seeing Vol come down everywhere so to me crypto is not out of line here and so I think long ball play has to coincide with it with a potential Catalyst which I think yeah and I think we're I mean we've kind of been seeing this uh you know on Paradigm in terms of kind of where the big open interest lies on Paradigm on the upside it's really December right I was I was looking at it um you know Paradigm so Paradigm specific open interest and December is by far you know the biggest maturity and it's really these December 40 000 calls you know it's this December 35 000 calls and then the 36 000 today I mean so the biggest uh Paradigm open interest position is the DS 40K is at like 9 000. and the second biggest the second biggest BTC open interest position on Paradigm is like less than half that size right so it kind of speaks to like people having this sort of upside View and of course as you mentioned term structure is steep and you know roll down can start to get pretty nasty there but it kind of speaks to this I guess lack of certainty for you know when these ETF narratives or like this halfing narrative is going to kind of start to really come into focus and intensify yeah that's awesome yeah in my mind end of the year would be sort of the more interesting place to be long long ball yeah right uh and you know perhaps that kind of speaks maybe a little bit to the steepness of the curve where it's you know people kind of selling the front end of the curve that you know obviously isn't realizing you can kind of capture that very into risk premium but then using that to kind of fund the longer dated positions out there yeah that's a nice way to sort of I mean selling ball is an open-ended risk so that's a nice way to sort of cap that risk and essentially balance out sort of that strategy yeah I like that a lot and one of the things that I like about shortfall in these types of environments is cut is like you can intuitively understand why people would be long ball in this environment and so um low Vol isn't a reason for something to happen um and so what happens is you know people want to buy it because it's cheap so you could sell it to them because it's it's cheap on an absolute level basis but maybe expensive on a relative basis and then we have a reason to involve potentially going into the end of the year uh yep and then you can combine that with sort of long dated long stuff yeah it's it's pretty funny watching the flow Dynamics on Paradigm where it's you know in these sort of markets where Vol is low volumes volumes are down but then as kind of somebody kind of comes in and you know shows some interest to kind of get along some of this stuff you know it all it takes is kind of one and then you just kind of see this big sort of dog fight you know to kind of you know really just try to pick up uh you know really scoop these upside calls on the lows but you know to your point that doesn't necessarily mean you know some something is going to happen and in terms of like Catalyst you know for a higher of all regime like of course we've been talking about you know the ETF deadlines of course you have the SCC hearing verdicts around you know grayscale what have you but I think an interesting stat is so August the month of August in Pre having years has historically returned 18 down in the month of August you know I think it doesn't necessarily mean that we need to return that this month but I kind of find that I find that a bit interesting especially when you kind of look at the timing of what's going on you know in traditional assets I mean we just had a debt downgrade remember in 2011 you know the nasty price action that we had following the the 2011 debt downgrade where I think we returned you know we had a 18 correction so like in terms of like Catalyst I mean obviously it's very difficult and it doesn't I mean Vol can kind of go up on the downside too if we yeah especially at these levels of all right we've kind of seen that positive spot fall correlation but if we break lower at these absolute levels I would imagine ball is going to go up right 100 but in terms of like what you see that like a potential Catalyst there obviously we have the macro we have the crypto idiosyncratic how about like more like on the structural side like how do you how are you looking at like gamma positioning and these sort of things right now yeah so we actually um we so we we follow gamma positioning pretty closely and so going into June exploration we saw sort of the the biggest negative gamma positioning that dealers had sort of on record and then once that kind of got cleared off with the expiration we've kind of normalized back to traditional levels so we're kind of hovering around Net Zero gamma exposure dealers are pretty well balanced here they're not loading loaded up any direction so it gives them the capability to sort of react they're not sitting on a bunch of inventory to have to manage and deal with at least by our estimation in our calculations so I think that the way that I mean dealers are kind of in a healthy spot here so they can they can essentially react to the market in an appropriate fashion they're not squeezed on either end so to me this would lead to more of an efficient market uh I don't think there's there's nothing to to be squeezed in terms of positioning as of right now how about if we move higher because I mean obviously I kind of mentions you know all the all the interests that we're kind of seeing in the you know 31k to 33k buckets if we move a little bit higher is it going to start to look a little bit shorter you think or yep so if you look at the the dispersion of like in terms of strikes so on a net basis they're sort of net flat gamma but if you look at like where's that gamma located so above 30k they're a little bit short and then below 30k they're a little bit long so um we'd have to see if like the positioning would get worse as of right now it's still pretty light positioning um but I would imagine if we got above 30k we'd probably see similar dynamics that we saw going into the June expiration where people were essentially buying a lot of call options the street was buying call options and uh dealers were essentially short with stuck with a lot of short inventory um of my opinion though that 30k is kind of a clear level for people in terms of you know trading on a Delta basis and so my thinking is is like if we're going to go to the upside I think 30k is probably something that people are looking at and training around um the downside Catalyst that to me is the open-ended question on a fall basis even though dealers are long downside gamma I could see something happening in the macro macro world that people are just kind of blindsided by causes a downside move I think that would be the potential for a vol pickup I think and that's something you pointed out I think that makes a lot of sense upside ball I think it's kind of more clear if we get above 30k everyone kind of understands that okay 40K is sort of the next level or whatever it is um and so no one's going to step in front of that train or get blindsided by it right yeah I mean look at Paradigm whether we get you know volatility because of a downside move or volatility because of an upside mood uh I think we'd we'd take it either way honestly I mean as you can imagine as we talked about it on the the big picture last week with GSR our volumes are extremely tightly correlated with the level of default hmm as you'd expect I mean kind of kind of the same deal in other asset classes as well but uh okay awesome so we are at the right around the 20 minute Mark we always kind of like to leave these sort of segments a little bit shorter you know very digestible uh because we kind of throw a lot right at you in in these 20 minutes so Greg thanks a lot man this was absolutely awesome I think I would love to keep doing this I think our viewers would love to keep doing this on a periodic basis where you kind of go through these charts when when things look interesting absolutely would love to thanks Joe foreign [Music]
