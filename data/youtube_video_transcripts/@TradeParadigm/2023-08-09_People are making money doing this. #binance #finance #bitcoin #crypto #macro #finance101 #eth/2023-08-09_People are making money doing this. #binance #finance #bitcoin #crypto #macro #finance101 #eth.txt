and one of the things that I like about shortfall in these types of environments is cut is like you can intuitively understand why people would be long ball in this environment and so um low Vol isn't a reason for something to happen um and so what happens is you know people want to buy it because it's cheap so you could sell it to them because it's it's cheap on an absolute level basis but maybe expensive on a relative basis and then we have a reason to own ball potentially going into the end of the year uh yep and then you can combine that with sort of long dated long stuff
