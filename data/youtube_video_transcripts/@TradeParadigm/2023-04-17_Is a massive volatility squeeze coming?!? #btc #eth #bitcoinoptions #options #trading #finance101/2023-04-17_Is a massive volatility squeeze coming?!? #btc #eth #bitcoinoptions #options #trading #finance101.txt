everybody remembers the Q3 2021 volatility squeeze that was at least in part catalyzed by some of the comments of a well-known Twitter proponent you know who suggested that the best trait for folks to do was go out and buy 10 000 plus strike calls further out the curve to gain what we would consider to be an upside convex exposure to eat and that drove Falls from let's say the the upper double digits well into the triple digits from the strikes we saw a similar activity again around the merge to a lesser extent but we still saw ethos well into the triple digits and and of course volatility simply did not perform on an implied basis post merge it was some of the sharpest IV deflation I've seen in my lifetime with IVs dropping quickly across the curve from you know the the low to mid triple digits all the way down to about where they are today right from 90 to 80 to 70 to 16 very short succession so yes if you're a risk manager or a risk taker if you are a portfolio manager an asset allocator
