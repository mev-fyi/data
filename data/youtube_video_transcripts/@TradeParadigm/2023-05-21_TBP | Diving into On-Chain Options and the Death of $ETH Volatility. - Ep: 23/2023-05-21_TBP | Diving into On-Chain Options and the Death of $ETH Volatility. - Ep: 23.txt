[Music] hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hi guys welcome to the big picture my name is Joe Crue I'm at Paradigm in the weeds around everything crypto ball markets joined here by my colleague David Brickell as well as Greg mandini from Amber data who has been on the podcast a couple times now before we begin if you could just smash that subscribe hit that like button really helps us promote our Channel as we strive to become one of the go-to shows in crypto derivatives so just jumping right in last week so we had Kyle Doane from arc on and one of the things that we discussed was this convergence of eth Falls relative to BTC and you know how this convergence drove some pretty sizable outright upside interests given the low level of implies and you know the busy macro calendar that we had I think one of the reasons for this Eep conversions is this presence of this large sort of overrider in the market and it's quite topical because this guy was actually active earlier this week starting on Monday and then half the size also printed on Tuesday so over the pass over this past week so 63 000. of the June September 2200 call calendar was sold like in ethereum that is it's just massive right so that's a total of 100 years now 150k like net Vega that was sold into the market through this structure and there was also some activity as well that was happening on screen and just like the sap outrights so we think honestly the Vega that was sold net Vega that was sold was probably closer to like 200k right and like in equity land that would be like a decent clip and like we're talking we're talking about the ethereum ball world and something that we mentioned on this podcast previously it's you know these quarterly roles uh seem to be the largest trade so back in December these guys also did a role and it was from March to June and that was around 120k Vega so this is the biggest one that we've seen you know potentially suggesting that this overripe program is also scaling inside and size and we expect this to be potentially way on the curve and you know talking to you know it they size like this it's just tough for makers to absorb you know it kind of speaks to disability and we've spoken this to this previously on the podcast of of large cakers in this market to be able to just like dwarf the collective balance sheet of even like some of the biggest makers in crypto derivatives I did this is like a phenomenon that doesn't really exist too much in any other asset class kind of this except for cryptic crypto and you know given um the term structure that I'm sure Greg will will go into it in a little bit you know it kind of seemed like this was like an opportunistic sort of trade we're not even close to really June expert yet but they decided to roll this trade now and you know taking a look at the 8th BTC implied Vol spreads and kind of what these things have done these are kind of back to Flat slash negative territory and they've kind of only really just been tracking lower but you know that being said they're really tracking lower in live with the realized ball so in in that right chart is the eth BTC realized ball spread and that has basically just been going on a one-way downtrend since the since the start of the year like at one point you know the 30-day eat realized Vault was trading up to five Vols under BTC about a month ago but that has since recovered so I mean Greg I'm just curious kind of what what are your views on what's going on in like the eat fall complex in you know potentially you got you just run with it you know potential opportunities to potentially even take advantage with it yeah totally so uh first thing I want to say it's uh Greg magadini top mandini I just want to correct that never hurt mandini but so Aiden it's all good for everything I always take Jim Croce that's it I'm just glad you don't say Greg mankini oh man you should have seen how I grew up they like they love to make fun of that name for sure all right let's but basically looking on the implied side if we're looking at a default index to DARE bit vix for Bitcoin here on the left and ethereum here on the right and then right below we have sort of the ratio between the two so we can see that the ratio near 1.0 so Ethan and Bitcoin Vol uh implied Vol is about the same uh that's kind of interesting and you know this is a rare event so to speak and if we look at the realized side so here's real live small going back to May 2016. so we're looking about seven years of realized wall and so if I look at the the sort of the quartile Distribution on bitcoin here to the left so we can see the interquartile 75th to 25th range is 57 involved with 90 volt for the 90-day window right uh right now we're below the 25th percentage child but we're not quite at the minimum that we've seen we've seen lower all for Bitcoin but if we're looking at eth we're kind of touching that edge of the lower Bound for the past seven years so that's kind of interesting to me of showing us that you know of how much farther does realize have to go I mean realize can do anything but it's just kind of one of those things you know I'll just keep medium version in mind and then right below we can see the spread between realized walls so this is just 30 day uh measurement realizable between Bitcoin and Eve we can see that typically eth and orange this trades above Bitcoin ball um has nice episodes of you know easily 30 points 40 points spread uh at extremes like like here in July 21 stuff like that so that's kind of interesting to me but what's really interesting is the term structure so typically when we're in a low ball regime you have a lot of contango in the term structure because ball is low right now but theoretically going forward in the future it should go back towards the median and right now there's an opportunity here where the front end of the curve even though overall Wall levels are are low the front end of the curve could theoretically steepen so like if we're thinking in the short term Market still leads to consolidate whether we're talking about Bitcoin or eth things still need to kind of process out we could see that the front end steeping more so there's something there if you want to be long uh locks and fall you can Finance it by selling some short end stuff so there's a little bit of that opportunity here so we can see episodes like going into the end of the year last year let me just jump back to realize real quick so we can see going into the end of the year last year January 2023 December January we're a little bit lower than we were than where we are now on the realized side but on the term structure I mean look how steep that was we're like trading in the 70 handle and right now we're more in sort of the 90 handle in terms of term structure richness or discount so there's room for the term structure to steep in so if you want to play the shortfall side or something there um but then on the Long Haul side basically the back end seems kind of relatively interesting so I just want to jump I don't know if you guys wanna before I move on if there's anything you guys want to say about that otherwise I'll sort of jump into the dealer positioning just um just Greg just for listeners who may or may not know um what what do you how do you define um in terms of period wise like the front Handler curve versus the back end how do you think about them yeah in terms of like steepness as well right like what is the front end what is the back end like what is the proxy that you're using to determine like the steepness yep that's a that's a great question thanks for for asking so we look at seven day at the Money Ball 30 day 60 90 180 and so what we're doing here is we're quantifying the net difference in in ratio not in spread but in ratio uh seven day versus 30 day seven day versus 60 7 Day versus 90 7 Day versus 180 so there's kind of five measurement four measurements there uh then we do 30 versus 60 30 versus 90 30 versus 180. so on so forth all the way up the curve and then we take the average and so we could see the average there's a discount or an average if it's uh a premium and so that's kind of the way that we Define it so we kind of quantify the net difference across those measurements got it so you're basically just looking at the difference in the Vols between the short end and the long end at different points on the curve and then just taking an average at it are you taking a weighted average or are you just taking at arithmetic mean just a just a straight average yep and we're averaging the ratio so if we're in a high ball regime uh you know if we're looking at a spread it'll be different but if we look at the ratio it sort of normalizes for different vault regimes right so cool cool yeah so one of the things that's interesting so I mean we just talked about that big trade that sort of that role we had that um buying back the the June 22 100 call and then selling uh September 2200 call and so you're seeing like a lot of that cover call selling in in if and so what's what we're seeing here is net dealers are just lawn a lot of lot long a lot of gamma essentially long ball uh this is the bottom chart here and then if we look at Bitcoin dealers are still kind of net short slash net flat so there's a lot of supply of people willing to solve all and eat and I mean obviously come to that same conclusion by looking at that covered call trade but it's interesting to see how dealers are positioned I mean this is essentially you know kind of the the highest point in nearly in the past nine months that we've seen so it's kind of like a interesting uh phenomenon that we're seeing sort of market makers have to deal with um so there's just confidence driving me these potential ball Dynamics where we've most of the demand for Vol has really existed in in BTC this year but there hasn't been too too much demand for ethal at least from our big taker clients and that combined with the large overriding Supply that we see here and there's also a massive flow that is the second biggest uh flow in the eat marker that is occurring OTC and uh obviously we can't say who that is um but you know it is a very similar you know fall Supply sort of program that is being rolled every month and delivering a ton of gamma and a lot of a lot of all to the market so you think it's those sort of supply and demand dynamics that are kind of leading to this overall conversion yep for sure that that's how I see it in in my mind and the way I think about it is kind of like cyclical so like I still think that there's a time where enthusia enthusiasm comes back into eth and we go back towards more uh typical relationships between Bitcoin wall and ethal but right now we're not in that cycle yet so this is kind of where the opportunity Brews so to speak in my mind and in terms of like what like the opportunity you know you you put out a a pretty good Twitter thread uh a couple I think it was a week ago kind of just talking about the cheapness of eat Falls and I think you especially looked at the downside of the eatfall I think you you have a nice Char where you were looking at the ratio of eth D Vol as a ratio to at the monies and because the devil's waiting is a similar methodology to the vix you know downside Vols are going to be weighted more heavily in that Devol calculation so by comparing that dival versus the at the money you get this sort of like convect downside convexity proxy in a way do you want to go into a little bit of that Yeah Yeah so basically Vic's methodology essentially targets constant Vega so like an at the money option on a hundred dollar stock has basically 10 times more Vega than an at the money option on a 10 stock so if you're if you're waiting for cost and Vega exposure lower strikes have sort of more weight more weight to them in this calculation higher the money strikes will have less weight and so when you're looking at the d-ball index and then you take out the belly by dividing by at the money ball um kind of puts have like an oversized effect here and if we look at this chart here it's this is true for both Bitcoin and eth but basically we're looking at the lower 10th percentage tile of since default Inception and call it April 2021 and we can see that right now the the wing component especially because of the put weighting is kind of at the lower test percentage tile uh that we've seen it since Inception so that's that's a little bit guiding uh my hand there in terms of you know what's what's cheap right now relatively speaking right yeah and I think that kind of speaks to the flows that we we've seen uh on Paradigm in in 2023 even versus 2022 like in 2022 there was like a fair amount of eat downside flows because the world was blowing up VCS needed to you know buy 10 Delta puts and and things like this to be to be able to hedge their their Treasury and their their VC Investments and to be honest Greg we haven't really seen like any of that like maybe it's it's all OTC now or or what have you but on Paradigm you rarely see like oh somebody just came in and bought like a ton of like each downside convexity and you know this this uh counterparty doing this is clearly just like a natural hedger that is that that is trying to hedge their treasure you just don't see that stuff anymore so perhaps that's you know also a potential driver of of why it looks so cheap because there's just nobody really doing the trade yeah yeah interesting point about the world blowing up uh kind of last year and you're seeing a lot of demand uh comfort for each downside back then one of the things that's cool to keep in mind is like the Bitcoin dominance normally Bitcoin dominance increases in Bear markets and decreases in Bull markets and so what that translates to is that all coins have like more beta uh when we're rallying and have more beta when we're falling so theoretically there's like extra of all there's like an extra move from the altcoin space no matter what direction we go and so to me that's another reason that relatively speaking that you fall is cheap one of the things just kind of jumping here though one of the things I find really interesting so now you can stake eth and earn a yield and if you're if you have like a big position of of ether you're staking and you're earning a passive yield and then you can sell covered calls against it obviously there's collateral management issues but let's set those aside for a second essentially eth becomes a yield machine because you're getting yield on your underlying asset you're getting a dividend and then you're selling a covered call and so theoretically you're kind of making double income now one of the things that's really interesting is the Ford so we were talking about people are talking about this in the Paradigm G Vol or paranymber data ball pit you know why is the the eth Ford trading at similar levels as to bitcoin forward when eth is now a yielding asset so traditionally in traditional markets if something has a yield the four trades cheaper because you know you're going to synthetically earn that yield from a cheaper Ford we're not seeing this in Bitcoin right now and I think this is part of the the interesting thing so this means so real quick I don't want to show up ahead too fast but if we look at uh the September merge of last year the Ford was pricing in sort of that passive yield and so the Ford was trading at a discount of call it two percent uh while the Bitcoin Ford is trading at a one percent premium so there's a three percent spread and that kind of sustained until we had the FTX scenario then everything kind of converged and then that's that relationship just like disappeared like people just stop pricing that in and now we see Bitcoin Fords and E4 it's just really trading in lockstep I think that's an opportunity to me the Ford is the eth Ward's a little overpriced it's not pricing in that that yield and so that means the calls are too expensive the calls are over priced because the forward on that call is overpriced and the puts are underpriced so it's really interesting to be someone who either holds big holds eth and sells covered calls against it or the the fully collateralized way to do it which to me is a simple way you don't have to deal with collateral management is that you have a chunk of eat that you're staking you sell two percent of that send it to darebit and buy a ton of puts to cover that position now there's no hot lateral management issues at all and so you're earning a passive yield you're buying undervalued puts a undervalued in terms of all which that's just kind of more of a bias of mine yeah but B undervalued because the Ford is overvalued which is kind of more of a technical you know statistical ARB so to speak uh and so to me that becomes like a really interesting position and that's kind of how I'm thinking about it that is super super interesting I had not I had not thought about that in the context of of the eighth forward and yo I think so in terms of staking yields uh apologies for not knowing this in for Eve what are they around like five or six percent right now uh yeah I think yeah four percent according to Ultrasound money okay right and then if you do let's say you in this case you did the you did the covered call um on top of that what sort of yields uh if you've looked like what what are we looking at here right if I'm like selling kind of like one month you know say one month like 15 20 Delta calls you know against this position like roughly uh in terms of yield what do you think I'm looking at yeah we have this chart let me just share it real quick let's get out of this so we do have this um here so cover call let's say I'm doing a cupboard call for that September let's say we're selling that this is going to be the analyzed oops here's the absolute yield for the covered call so if I'm selling like the 2500 for September set another three percent so call that you know three plus four so seven if I'm looking at that in annualized terms that's like 15 8 plus or sorry 12 a plus four that's that's kind of interesting in analyze terms uh yeah that and yeah that's what you're saying yep obviously if you're selling at 2200 which is what we're seeing that flow that's a 14 plus four so 18 plus the option do you think it's do you think it's reasonable to say then that given that opportunity now um and now you know you're you're sort of stake teeth is liquid so you can truly kind of write a covered call on it um in terms of future if you did get called on it um you can actually um you know take take your stake teeth out do do you think it's reasonable to suggest that that ability to do that and earn the extra yield is a big factor in what's it's in what's compressing that eighth Bitcoin yield um to the levels that we've seen and even even driving it under in parts and there's um sorry in terms of evolves I was curious how I think about it let me just go to this chart real quick so this is going to be a long-winded answer to your question but when we looked at sort of the outstanding open interest and option activity in each sort of the peak amount of open interest on the air bit was during that September merge and a big narrative big narrative driver at the time was like okay now that eth is a yielding asset for sort of traditional players it kind of looks more interesting uh to buy and hold and earn a dividend than to speculate in crypto for capital gains that was a little bit of the narrative I mean you guys probably have a better idea that than me on that but typically institutional investors buy assets and sell cover calls like that's the traditional flow you see that in SPX they buy puts they sell calls and so if that Narrative of like now be eth is a yielding asset so it should attract institutional Capital then theoretically institutional players will do institutional strategies and selling the covered call is like the most basic institutional strategy that that we know to be persistent in the space so assuming that narrative is true I do think that is a driver yeah yeah yeah I think you know why aligns well with what we're seeing in terms of clients that are trying to come in onto Paradigm you know there's there's a lot of customers that kind of in our pipeline that are kind of just looking at eat the ball selling strategies and I think I think this kind of just hits the the nail right on the head uh kind of what we're discussing here why we're seeing that it's like this opportunity to be able to you know stake my teeth and be able to take it out if I get assigned assigned on these calls um I think as well um another I mean something that's made me sort of relatively more bullish eat um for the last well for the last year or so um it was not just a you a you had obviously moved to proof stake and and the opportunity to unyield and what have you um and the idea the supply impact that that will that will um you know have um alongside the fact that we're also sort of deflationary the other thing and when we talk about institutional adoption is that it's always in the back of my mind is when you look at some of the sort of more institutional custody Solutions out there they all started with Bitcoin right and then like East being the the kind of second coin that that they've started to custody and offer a fuller service around and again I I wonder now are those Solutions and now I sort of and there's various um custodians that have now included Heath so now it's just more uh viable for institutions to to buy and hold eth before it was always Bitcoin now it's Bitcoin underneath and obviously over time we'll sort of move out into so many other alts but yeah I just wonder if if now it's it's more viable from a custody point of view to start looking at at buying Ethan then you're going to want to sort of overwrite some calls on that um as well as the whole staking thing and liquidity that you're getting and then this yield potential it just yeah kind of when you put all those things together what we're seeing I guess makes a lot of sense yeah right yeah go along right oh I was gonna Echo that yeah the like the infrastructure for investing is and eat this sort of the pipelines are built yeah right and you don't as well now kind of you know last year or 18 months ago had this sort of opportunity cost of like the yield farming where people are like oh I can I can make 20 you know on you know my my Terra Luna exposure and these sort of things like I think people now are looking for like actual real sources of yield not just yield that is being defined and driven by inflationary tokenomics and I it selling selling Vol has been a form of yield that has existed since the late 1970s right it is a proven form of yield and I think yeah institutional investors now and you know even even retail investors are like okay let me let me shift if I'm looking for yield let me shift my allocation to false selling rather than you know looking for these sort of you know ponzi-esque yield farming opportunity so I think that's part of it as well yeah totally so I think here's like where the true opportunity lies so let's say we all agree that maybe the four is overpriced and so the calls are overpriced it puts her under price then it's like okay what's our opinion on on Vol itself so when we look at the relationship between ethal realized ball and Bitcoin realize fall you know theoretically an asset with a smaller market cap should have more ball to it because it takes just less money to move it around so that's one component the second component is we're seeing a lot of we're seeing growth in sort of the staking on the beacon chain well if that state is is non-tradable eth essentially it's out of the the tradable float so we have about 21 million uh eth on the beacon chain we have about 120 million total Supply so you know 16 of the E is outside of the the trading float so that that means that the market cap which is you know called Bitcoin 500 million 200 million well now the tradable market cap is a little bit lower so call it 170. uh so theoretically it takes takes more money to move Bitcoin than it does to move eth so now this is like to me the opportunities here where like maybe there's institutional investors are selling covered calls uh and that affects the implied space but the opportunity is that well if we have like a bull cycle or a major market crash the realized space should theoretically go back to traditional relationships and this is where if I'm gonna trade the under underpriced calls sorry underpriced puts or overpriced calls like to me buying the underpriced puts getting long eth and then staking that eth that's to me that's the more interesting trade here and I think that's where there's opportunity or sort of taking the other side of the flow and I don't know like I mean if I'm an Institutional Institutional Investor and I'm selling covered calls like I'm not a vault Trader I'm trading Ball but I'm not a ball Trader there's a difference there I don't know if you guys think about yourself yeah I'm just trying to get my head around and think if you're in that scenario I I kind of get um I kind of get the the idea that the calls are overpriced the puts are underpriced um so yeah you sort of body stake it by the puts um just that how that performs in a bull market um when the Quebec City and everything's going higher and you're yeah are you just sat there on this you know wasting sort of Premium if you like um I don't know if I'm thinking about that in the wrong way but yeah I just think of it as a synthetic straddle so like it's still a straddle but I'm I'm long half of it I have the synthetic straddle and then I got you yeah got you yeah yeah that makes sense I would buy extra puts is basically what I would do so if I'm buying half how many inputs yeah I buy twice as many as how much ether's taking well I'll tell you what market makers on Paradigm are stuffed with long downside puts so if you if you want to come if you want to come buy them yeah but that's that's the thing I mean it's what you've been noticing like honestly like you have these sell-offs you have market makers that are just getting longer Vega and and logger gamma as they're approaching these downside strikes and they're just hammering this stuff selling it out on Paradigm and if you find somebody that's looking to buy the puts then absolutely fantastic but like you're not really seeing that as sort of natural demand for it so it kind of just asked your argument this is something that you do believe in well you're gonna get a good price as well just due to due to the dealer position and looking at the shed some of this stuff and I think that positioning is you know one of the one of the kind of drivers if you will for kind of the spot down ball down it kind of just feels like dealers are kind of you know long this sort of like buy put cell call so it's sort of resin reversal so yeah that spot goes lower they're getting they're getting longer Vega and they need to they need to shed some of that because the downside for fixed Strike balls just haven't really performed did Joe I've got to say and it's perhaps more spidey sense than based on anything more more sort of fundamental than that but it does it does I wrote my macro pulse newsletter on the weekends um I called it the Calm before the Vol stall and it just feels that I mean you see it in all markets in in traditional markets when you get this level of apathy um despite there being so many risks out there right now obviously we've got like the debt seating risk um we've still got you know uncertainties around what the um what the FED are doing in terms of uh hiking or pausing um you know there's a lot going on um you know set risks all this stuff and yet we've got this malaise and this apathy in markets which are kind of lacking a narrative but um it kind of just feels like something's gonna Something's Gonna sort of break and blow up um I'll just I just feel we might be at that point of apathy where it's go time yeah I mean it kind of reminds me pretty similar to kind of what was happening in December when you know the re the implies and realize I think I think they're like the BTC implies were like in the low 30s like around like right after like Christmas time or or something like this and you know of of course you always have like you know the pundits out there haters be like oh yeah but realized to 17 go lower it could go lower realize the 17 but like there's a point where it just gets so low where it's just like look I'm I'm willing to kind of like bleed Theta here because if it does go the thing is it's going to completely explode yeah I mean what I will say great to like your trade idea I mean as you know I've been pretty bullish this year on crypto um for the sort of macrodynamics um I tweeted out earlier like what we're seeing in markets today and this week um obviously the the debt ceiling uh the barcode is kind of mudding the waters quite a bit um and we we've kind of got this relief rally in in stocks um which is on on the idea that you know it looks like we come into to maybe some deal and I completely think obviously we will see that debt ceiling lifted um so stocks are up but also sort of bonds are selling off yours are going higher um the the Dollar's getting stronger you've got concerning Dynamic for me um in China with dollar China um trading above seven dollars um and and signs a capital outflow which in some ways actually that the capital outflow store is good for Bitcoin but um typically as well um the pboc will look to sort of squash any any uh flows into that are leaving um so you've got like dollar dollar c h looking a little bit unstable and and sort of feeding broader draw the strength you've got yields going higher I mean anticipation of um the issuance that's going to come um from the debt ceiling lift um and then when the debt ceiling does get lifted and from that issuance you're going to have a huge liquidity drain and I'm talking like short term but I I think short term um I think we're going to be under quite a bit of pressure so you might you might be thankful if you're holding some of those puts and actually you might start to see that Vault pick up to the downside yeah totally and and one of the things so so we know our dealers are positioned Joe you kind of mentioned uh you know if you want to buy puts you could you can you can buy some inventory from dealers David you made a good argument for like you know potentially we could see a lot of downside and so there's this there's this kind of thinking when you're new to the market you go well isn't the market efficient like is it all those things all these things priced in and the way that I think about it is that the markets I kind of I said this earlier but the Market's sickly full so it's like uh value investors you know win in certain types of markets there's there's a market when you know 2008 is a great time where like the value investor who's done all this fundamental analysis and knows this company is going to survive blah blah that's their moment to shine and so this is kind of how I think about it as well like right now we have some players out there who are selling covered calls and creating a supply of all and stuff like that and there's this a little bit of a malaise in terms of the real life small and there's this cycle right now where we're seeing if fall super low uh realize ball for both Bitcoin and eth very low and so you can make the argument that this is just cyclical but it brings me back to this idea in the term structure if you still think that you know you don't necessarily want to buy ball or you're unsure or something like that like to me given where we are the term structure is still uh still kind of too flat or I mean it's a little bit containable but it's not contained enough and so again this is another way that you could headshot out so let's say you want to be long to synthetic straddle by buying either puts um and then uh um uh buying Ethan staking it you can you can Finance some of those long-term puts by selling from short-term puts against it as well so let's say you know you own 50 actual eth you own 100 eth puts you can sell another 50 uh in the shorter end of the curve to sort of Finance it because the term structure given were realized is is still kind of flat in my opinion we've seen it much slower at higher realized wall regimes and so that's another sort of distortion and essentially when you're training ball you're just looking for things that are relatively cheap and relatively expensive and so this is this is kind of where I'm seeing it and if we do get that downside move just from the macro space theoretically eth should have more downside to it and if we get the traditional bull market each should have more upside to it so kind of hops and everything yeah super interesting and you think that that term structure steepness is going to be mostly driven by the front end is coming lower do you think yeah typically that's how it works that's typically how it gets priced in because like things are not moving right now so like yeah right now options will be cheap yeah yep no that makes that makes total sense I'd agree with that um so one thing that I wanted to segue into uh G A lot of times you don't really get a lot of like crypto options like current event news you know it doesn't it doesn't really like exist too too much right and there was some pretty big news that that came out earlier this week and that news was so Galaxy digital you know obviously big player in in the crypto derivatives World executed against coin fund likely the world's first OTC bilateral option contract on chain yeah to reduce credit risk and in improve transparency it's an on-chain trading and it involves the use of smart contracts to manage the collateral which ensures the payment is going to happen even if the counterparty defaults so as we as we all know you know margining as of now is done off chain you know that's that's certainly the case in tradify assets and it's even the case in in in crypto the crypto OTC world right so crypto motc options look a lot like an OTC option in equities except your underlying is crypto all right so this ability now to be able to you know execute margin and settle this this trade and this trustless environment you know it it's kind of like it sounds like to me a lot like just like a multi-sig sort of wallet right you know two counterparties set up a shared smart contract wallet they jointly own and you know no party has you know unilateral control of this thing and both parties need to approve a transfer of collateral a transfer of settlement before it can happen and I think it's just super super topical right now and I think the move makes a lot of sense especially due to this collapse in counterparty trusts post FTX you know I think the reality is we kind of still live in a world where it's difficult to trust the the solvency of a counterpart and we use like this this um this example earlier of the episode where it's like oh if I want to buy a 10 Delta eat put well like how do I know that the person I'm gonna buy it from is going to be able to make do on that obligation right odds are after that 10 Delta put actually goes into the money I mean I wouldn't really be too comfortable odds I mean given what happened last year they could have things on their balance sheet that are extremely extremely correlated you have to that Eve put going into the money and reduce their ability to fulfill that obligation on the put so I think it's just a really interesting idea like actually using crypto for what it's designed for but in the practice of being able to settle OTC trades I'm curious to hear what you guys think about it yeah I mean I mean my my point of view you know it's I think particularly for those of us who have come from like Trad fire and into crypto for all the exciting reasons about seeing you know the the kind of future of Finance um uh you know evolving through the sort of blockchain space I kind of think it's where we want to be right um ultimately we want to be like decentralized Finance now I say that as someone who you know Works in a company that to begin with you know we've kind of built on the centralized rails and facilitating access to that But ultimately I think you know we all want to see it go sort of decentralized and and everything go on chain um and to have on chain settlement and to really kind of fulfill um the core kind of ethos of why why are we here um I think about I think about crypto I mean I I was quick to say after FTX you know to people like look this isn't crypto this is the failure of another failure of a centralized actor in the space which actually goes to reinforce the value proposition for Bitcoin and the idea of having uh decentralized trustless forms of value exchange and it's kind of yeah yeah that's great that's great but but actually a lot of the trading business um around it is still very centralized relying on centralized actors and you're like yeah that's step one step two eventually we start to we start to sort out some of the kyc and AML issues that that come hand in hand with how do we take things on chain but yeah to see to see this happen like is is pretty awesome I think um and again it's like it might be one of those things that we look back on and go wow that was quite a pivotal moment and we spoke about it on the big picture um and maybe didn't give it enough hype but actually that's a pretty big big deal and I think it is right I agree with that Joe was it fully collateralized um so the collateral is determined by the Avo so the trade was executed on a contract on Evo which is oh cool right um the option decks of ribbon Finance I actually haven't looked at the collateral terms um with within that smart contract um but it's whatever it's whatever those terms are Evo is is awesome I I actually just traded some eth options for the first time on it yesterday uh oh no kidding it's it's yeah it's cool I I really like it it's really interesting the other one I'm really kind of big big on is Lyra I think one of the things with on chain I mean I definitely like decentralized and I think there's a lot of things that are instantly solved by decentralization so like for example fraud or like accountability of where funds are going uh which is a great example that would fix FTX because obviously they're taking customer deposits and going and trading those on a lever basis yep good job Sam um so that fixes that the issue of like um training options on a partially collateralized basis I don't know that blockchain fixes that it fixes the transparency component but the blow up risk like by definition kind of always exists there just like any insurance company uh you know if you if you're one Insurance Company selling earthquake insurance on in California and the whole state moves around and houses break like I don't think that problem can ever be fully fixed and if it is fully fixed and it's fully collateralized and it's inefficient so I don't know that I think we always kind of navigate we'll always navigate that issue right yeah absolutely I'm not saying that like this is kind of like the the end-all be-all solution we're we're here but you know I think it's I think it's certainly a step in in the right direction where it's like look through this smart contract I have this ability to potentially to automate collateral transfer monitor a mark the market in real time with the inputs that are driving that in this open source nature right and if and the liquidation is automated like the amount of case like even when like so March 2020 when I when I was working um when I was working on JP Morgan like when the world was blowing up we had these all these customers that were doing all these shortfall convexity trades like being able to like get some money it was like pretty it was like to get something was like impossible and like insane like legal headaches that were going on and was opposed to well if this stuff is kind of like there in the smart contract and get liquidated at least you got something right so it kind of solves for that and then I also think it's interesting like it's asset class agnostic right you have the ability to take these you know smart contract rails and bring it to any other asset class right you have this ability to you know maximize speed of settlement you don't need and you have this ability to lower costs right like when I when I was in the when I was on the desk like 20 to 30 percent of the people that were sitting on the trading floor where was basically handling collateral managements and settlements 20 to 30 percent right that is a lot of salaries that you need to pay to basically just have money you know going back and forth between counterparties on bilateral TC transactions and it all it always got  up too right like there would always be like a case where like oh like I don't see you guys posted margin right like oh hey we margin we margin called you like three times like where's the margin right like there's just so much like headaches that were caused by this where like now you have you're we're kind of working towards the solution to kind of be able to solve for all these frictions that it also exist in traffic yeah for sure like operation costs legal costs like if it's all automated that's that's huge for sure that's huge savings yeah it still amazes me like obviously you haven't spent 18 years working on sort of trading desks in Banks like yeah like you would literally get someone from back office would would call you and say look we've you know we rode uh some margin um on this trade we're not hearing anything back it's been five days now can you kind of reach out to your contacts and just say what's going on you're like right yeah I'm here I'm hearing about this it's five days right you know but being age typically like again it's like all these things right most of the time it's okay and it's all okay until it's not um so you kind of okay yeah we know them their credit is fine um and there is usually a reason you know um some kind of admin error or you know oh sorry yeah we missed that and there you go and it's all done it's not an issue time waster right it's a big time I say yeah and then you and then you need to I mean sorry if I'm I'm being blunt but like you you European people they're like do these things right as opposed to your if you're able to automate all these kind of functions away you know video like just multi-state wallets and your bilateral OTC trades well like I think that's a huge step yeah I mean it it reminds me of um like some of the some of the older guys uh I used to work with you know who who go back to you know when they are manually writing tickets and all this stuff all the all these cool stories and they look back and go it just seems crazy it seems crazy now you know to think that we were doing that you know in a world where computers and what have you come into it um I I we will be looking at that in in the next 10 years going it was Matt do you remember like the US had to wait two days to sell on the trade two three days to sell a trade that was crazy right well I thought why would it take that long um right and we cut yeah we're moving we're moving into that well and it's I mean it's exciting it's it's gonna unlock so much like economic value in the world um it's going to create a lot of issues in terms of you know thinking about the the number of jobs that will disappear because of it but equally you know I think people threat on that it probably ramps up productivity and um you know we kind of just evolved in to different everyone's going to be coding and programming or have you to kind of take advantage of that but um man it's super exciting and we're at the Forefront of it right it's um it's amazing to to see it so so yeah kind of looping back to to the original kind of question I think it's pretty exciting what we what we're witnessing here yeah definitely go go on Greg sorry cut you off real quick you were mentioning about like unlocking economic values like a great example is back in the day when people were like running tickets and trading on the floors and before you know the internet bubble and or the internet Innovation and online brokerages you know spreads between stocks were like 25 cents minimum tick size now we now we're sub Penny and like that translates directly into making it cheaper for everyone to transact transact in the market not to mention like The Brokerage cost to transact in the market have come down a lot and what does that translate to well that translates to a more efficient market because more people can participate in it and basically Express their opinions and I'm a strong believer that financial markets are the biggest information processing engine that we have this is the biggest Society information processing engine and if you look at sort of economics is a social science and if you look at social sciences well economics is the most legit social science out of all the social sciences because it has measured periodic very robust data sets that people can essentially study and even given all that data you have phds with billion dollars uh funds under asset you know under management and you could take two billion dollar funds with teams of phds and they're looking at the same data set and having 180 degree opinion on the implications and so to me like all that stuff leads to more efficiency and so that efficiency leads to Collective you know price decreases and and Capital allocation stuff like that so it's useful yeah no it makes sense since you know you've been just kind of just speaking to some dealers about this news they're like we kind of went there like we went from a world where it was like if you were doing like an inner dealer like bilateral OTC trade like off of derabit like back in 2022 like there wasn't really much margin at all like I would like I would have conversations with these guys I'm like I'm like how does like your IA and variation margin work they're they're like yeah we weren't really doing it kind of just like trusted people we're gonna be able to make up on their obligations and now the pendulum has completely gone the other way where everything is just like fully collateralized OTC and and yeah speaking to some dealers they think like this on-chain sort of settlement um or you know bilateral OTC trades is going to be very very good thing you know for the inner dealer OTC market as well so that's just some some customer feedback um from Paradigm but uh we're coming up on the 51 minute Mark guys uh have anything else any any closing thoughts or good to end it from here I guess um I guess just for me um just on the macro um and again I'll repeat as someone who's been pretty and and remain like bullish over the course of the year and the medium term or crypto I just think we're in for a difficult period um I think we all need to be conscious of the fact that what's going on in China and dollar China sort of breaking above um above seven uh just uh I think that's potentially problematic um I think this debt ceiling lift we've got this kind of euphoric sort of feeling in certainly in in other risk markets at the moment um as as we kind of it looks like we're approaching that um agreement to lift the debt ceiling it's gonna be a huge huge liquidity drain um on markets which I think is gonna create some problems in the short term I think for crypto so um a little bit of caution here um I'm tempted to kind of fade some of this sort of euphoria and think I think we'll will test a little bit lower yeah damn it I always thought you were a permeable besides the fact that you're getting bearish here yeah you know I I I never I've never in my whole career I've never understood the the Perma anything tags it's like how can you how can you be how can you have a framework and look at things objectively and only ever land on one side of the coin you know like I I've never got that I mean yeah anyone who since we've started doing this I've been super balled up um on on crypto because of that change in Dynamic um I'll be quick to flip when um you know when when the macros or the Dynamics change and and even if there's some like idiosyncratic reasons to be bearish crypto um say not not super bearish right now I think and there's there's other offsetting things to this liquidity drain um I'm also by the way I'm a pretty day trader so um yeah I don't mess around with things sort of too much um because I I'm never gonna be willing to call the top and buy the buying the lows but but typically I like seeing quite good in terms of you know positioning for these kind of mediums to longer term sort of macro thematics and so from that point of view I'd still kind of stay long and I think we end a year higher in in Bitcoin and eth I just think short term if I was going to have caution I think it's the first point this year that I felt a little bit more cautious on this Market just because I think liquidity has been such a Tailwind uh throughout the first few months of the year and we're about to see someone that Gets Zapped out um as we as we uh as we raise that debt ceiling so just a little bit more caution which given where Vols are creates probably some really decent opportunities to start trying to pick up some cheap vol yeah definitely I think that that cheap fall narrative for eth will make sense to me it either either on the downside or the upside so well awesome guys that was that was fantastic episodes we really really covered a lot there uh so Greg love having you on thanks again for joining well we'll get you we'll certainly get you back on in the within the next couple months so thank you everyone and we'll see you next time cheers guys thanks everyone foreign
