one one important point to note here is that the blue line is the block percentage of the total premium right so it's very easy to say like blocks as a percentage of total notional because but that notionals may be relevant right I mean it might be a super one Delta option or like like a 50 Delta option which is real right and you can see this is this is 60 of BTC blocks um you know in by total premium so that means it's real real options that people are buying It's Not Just Wings you know lottery tickets that are people buying again pointing to the fact that it's real you know real players who are coming in and you know trading this so it's usually yes explain what's what's so hard saying so when you calculate like the notional of an option trade effectively you're just taking the number of contracts times the current you know Bitcoin or ethereum reference price it doesn't account for you know the money-ness of the option or the amount of Premium that's being paid
