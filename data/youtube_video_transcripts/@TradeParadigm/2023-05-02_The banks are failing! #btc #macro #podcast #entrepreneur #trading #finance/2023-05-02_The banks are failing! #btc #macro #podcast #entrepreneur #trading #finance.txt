last week to see the bank term funding program the btfp getting tapped again um and and some of these other sort of measures getting tapped so it's just a little sign that banking stress hasn't gone away and the um the regional Banks index as well continues to trade heavy and Under Pressure so it's just something I'm conscious of the reasons that we had these issues are still there and in fact they've got worse and whilst things have be calmed at the moment um yeah there's signs that maybe there's still elements of stress in the system
