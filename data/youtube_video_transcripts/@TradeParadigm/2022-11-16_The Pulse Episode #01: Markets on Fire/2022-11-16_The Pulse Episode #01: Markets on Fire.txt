[Music] foreign [Music] welcome to the first edition of the pulse brought to you by Paradigm by way of introduction my name is Joe crewing I work in institutional coverage at paradigm previously I was out vice president at JP Morgan on their Equity derivative desk in London and before that I was working in derivatives at Deutsche Bank in New York before we begin our hearts go out to everyone personally affected by the events this week without a doubt a large setback for the space but we'll keep moving forward and get through this difficult time together so what is the pulse the pulse will be a concise segment a few minutes each week around major flows in the crypto derivatives markets we understand that the main value add of Paradigm from a Content perspective is we see the largest blocks going up in the crypto ball space so we will discuss the largest blocks that we're seeing in themes around these flows that being said this is not going to be a discussion in depth around fall parameters that already exists on Twitter and you know some of some of our partners do a great job with rather how do these metrics relate to the block flows that we see in both options and future but this will be a flow Centric segment lastly this is very much a work in progress we want to hear what you the viewer wants to see as an example eventually we might look to have some market makers on Paradigm join us to discuss their views on the market but jumping right in starting in on bitcoin blocks and here are the largest Bitcoin option trades on Paradigm since Monday really no surprise here given the turmoil in the market that the majority of the taker interest that we have seen has been buying of downside there's nothing to talk about around how Vol parameters are driving the flow no it's rather just a sense of panic around the potential Fallout that might come in the major Prince that we saw you know being the November 18 000 puts in 1200 times the D's 10K 15K put spread in a thousand times and then the November 18 000 puts there were about 1100 times earlier in the week but were actually sold to close today after the CPI rally we did see some interest in outright outside but the majority of the large blocks have definitely focused on the downside what has been interesting to see you know as these flows have been going through is that some dealers earlier in the week were actually quite asked to sell the downside as we sense a few of these big market makers got quite long fall when BTC Vols were trading in the 50s and they finally had an opportunity to monetize these positions after bleeding away due to the poor realized the charts here show the strike in maturity distribution of block trades over Paradigm and settled on derabit so this is not including all of the derabit flows that go up on screens rather only includes prints that just hit paradigm and as alluded to on the last side the largest block interest definitely occurred on the downside and in November and December expiries to protect from a continued sell-off moving on to the ethereum side of things the top three blocks on Paradigm over the week also occurred on the downside via outright puts in a bearish risk reversal this is actually quite rare in ethereum options but certainly not something that we're surprised about you know given the circumstances of the market like we remember the pre-merge days when all the major interests all the largest blocks that we were seeing were actually occurring in strikes 100 higher than spot you might recall all those December and March call flies that were trading centered around the 3000 strikes as well as uh one by two call ratios well certainly those days look like they're gone now and similarly here is the strike in maturity distribution for ethereum while some decent activity in upside strikes a significant amount also trading below 1250 now as well is similar to bitcoin the most active maturities were on the front end of the curve you know like I said you compare that to the pre-merge days when all the major blocks were occurring six months to nine months at the Curve and just finishing up with Solana quite light activity outside some rolls and in cleaning up at some exposure take note that derabit uh tweeted a couple days ago that they're not going to be listing new Solana options or Futures until further notice given the recent spot action that concludes the first segment of the pulse thanks for watching and stay safe out there [Music]
