going to point out a couple really interesting things I just want to share as well so when we're talking about sort of the the price of convexity so this bottom chart butterfly index for people who don't know it is basically the default index or the Dare Big Fix uh the Bitcoin fix divided by at the money 30. so we'll really look at relationship of wings versus the belly and so we can see here during sort of that huge liquidation Wings just got freezy expensive and if I'm looking over sort of back to January 1st 2022 we can compare that to three arrows slash Terra Luna FTX so those are the other sort of events that we saw it's pretty interesting that we had sort of this craziness happen but there's not that same Catalyst that we had with FTX or 383 AC or Terra Luna this is more like a liquidity Catalyst it looks like me
