[Music] hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of life hi guys welcome back to the big picture I'm Joe Crewe here at Paradigm and back here again with my co-host David Brickell today very excited to have simran and Matt for on from gsrs I'm so excited that even I even wore my GSR t-shirt today I think I got this down in um what was that consensus of in Austin last year done it kind of right before like all the lending stuff you know blew up so I think that was might have been like the last time I wore this thing so hopefully hopefully this isn't like a precursor boom and what what's the coming crypto again um but yeah you know love you guys love what you guys are doing you know at GSR we used to have uh you know back in the day Chris Newhouse on the Pod and before he went back to grad school and always represented you guys very well so looking forward to continuing to work with you guys and you know partner around content so kind of just to get started get started if you guys can you know please just give a quick background on you know your Journeys into the crypto world you know what you guys are doing at GSR uh simran if you want to go first sure yeah so I've been with GSR for just over a year and a half uh background international finance this is often the case um and so I was on the oil options let's get Goldman for a few years and GSR having been founded by uh to moto D Street or some Goldman you know the the legacy of the client service franchise risk management all of those things were very prevalent so when I eventually made my decision to go down the rabbit hole after reading numerous defy articles um and getting a sense of you know what is it about they said subtracting so much talent and not just money I decided to join TSR and so over the past few years that about a post year and a half rather I've been focusing on our product and Business Development teams namely looking at our suite of OTC services on spot programmatic execution and derivatives awesome yeah I I similarly excuse me I similarly have a traditional Finance background uh the majority of my career is at JP Morgan I covered alternative investment strategies so like the broad Suite of hedge fund allocations for our broad uh Global Private Bank wealth management client base uh towards the end of that I actually helped the process of sort of onboarding the first Bitcoin hedge fund for those clients and started moving a little more in that direction uh left to a different asset manager to lead up crypto research at a firm called Global x uh actually went through the process there of filing for spot Bitcoin ETFs Bitcoin features ETFs was the portfolio manager on a Bitcoin future gtf there uh that was a pretty brief tenure uh when I got the opportunity to jump fully into crypto a more crypto data firm like GSR uh and I've been here ever since been here just about as long as some ran about 18 months uh and I spend the vast majority of my day just writing crypto content daily Market updates monthly Market Recaps uh and research pieces pretty broadly in crypto awesome well thanks guys for sharing so I I guess like let's just jump right into it you know it certainly feels a little bit like crypto of all markets are kind of stuck in the the dog days of summer here I mean before we even hit record Cimarron is like you know realizing all is kind of is like in the 0.5 fifth percentile over the last you know couple years or or what have you so I mean Vols across the curve absolutely smashed you know pretty non-eventful day you know for coins post fomc I mean the amount of conversations that I've had with people were just like guys we we are we are just bleeding we need these goddamn coins to move I mean implies implies are in the 30s realized ball in the mid-20s and if you look at you know the Paradigm flows the Market's certainly gone you know a bit quiet outside of some of these headline flows you know generally volumes are kind of down you know across markets given the lack and volatility I mean kind of like the headline print in BTC you know is the sep 2635 bull risk reversal but I mean you look at these contract sizes versus you know some of the flows that we were talking about you know back in March like this number one print of 825 contracts wouldn't even make the top five right and and in ethereum you know we have some this March 1900 2800 call spread you know being bought you know at the money lower strike but you know this is kind of I want to say like systematic flow but you know kind of systematic flow to be honest um you know so I mean quiet markets when when Vol craters is I mean you guys have backgrounds and other asset classes this is not a pattern that is unique to crypto Vol it happens in equities happens in other markets as well so I mean I guess it gets to start I mean what what have you guys been seeing you know in terms of your your OTC franchise you know you kind of would you Echo kind of a similar sort of pattern where there's kind of a bit of apathy in markets yeah I would say a lot of it's driven by you know as you mentioned the summer low and lack of that in general um and then also just realized I'll failing to perform I think has just gotten people uh in a sense of build runs and asking the question you know where do we go from here and there's a bunch of competing narratives that are kind of guiding that discussion right one of those is obviously the news around the stock ETF and what does this mean for the Builder macro system um one of those narratives is the Ripple lawsuit casing where the implications for altcoins insecurities and I'll definitely defer them that on on both of those in terms of the nuances in particulars but just from a pure flows perspective I mean there's certainly been some speculative upside um I think even you know last week or earlier this week I saw uh the 100K strike fade in in March 2024 and install size and so you know even if people are taking smaller puns I think they are still taking some cuts um and I was actually talking to everybody do you think videos earlier where you know the the June for example 100K digital uh we could probably offer that like three three and a half percent and so risking 30k to make a million dollars in South quick trade uh the question is what is the path from here to so year from now really look like right um what are the implications of the slow ETFs and then you know as I think you guys have covered quite well over the past few episodes the uh call overrider within uh in terms of ethereum call overriding was really the major uh ball flow that we've seen in the market over the past few months and then having to buy all of that bigger back I think it was around 300 or 400k Vega that was bought that got a you know loss of like either of syllables you know that much bigger entering the market and leaving the market that's the question well are there any other flows that are really going to happen over the next you know few weeks to a few months so I think list books are just key to sit on the sideline see what Market microstructures evolve um and once they have a little bit more certainty with regards to start the implications on altcoins and then also a little bit of the buy-in flat that still exists after uh the FCC options I think that's when you're going to see more of a revitalization in terms of volumes actual Expressions yeah it makes sense and before we bring Matt in uh I want to show just some of this you know some of this work we've we've put together to you know effectively you know quantify you know the relationship between you know crypto option block volumes and and volatility because it's certainly something that people talk about a lot and um but we kind of wanted to you know quantify this relationship because we kind of have access to this sort of proprietary data so what we did is we looked at the relationship between Paradigm crypto option block volumes and USD notional so that's on um you know that's on the y-axis versus the changes in volatility on the x-axis and we proxy this through this through Amber data's default index where if you guys don't um your viewers don't know it's kind of just kind of looking at it similar to like a vix for for Bitcoin your methodology is a little bit different but it kind of consider it that for for these prop for this process and you know given the noisiness of you know Paradigm volumes versus daily changes in d-val we we kind of realized we needed to smooth out this data a little bit so we we took the seven day moving average of Paradigm option volumes as well as the seven day moving average of the default index level and then in step two we calculated the daily changes of both of these seven day moving averages so the daily change of the seven day moving average of the Paradigm option volumes and the seven and the daily change of the seven day moving average of the d-val index level a little bit of a mouthful but those daily changes and then we um we regress them uh against one another in just a simple OLS regression uh Universe univariate regression and do you know the relationship error is pretty evident you know it's not surprising but it is interesting to kind of see these numbers where you know uptrends in implied volatility as proxied by you know these this default index is leading to uptrends and Paradigm volumes and and vice versa like what we're seeing now downtrends in in uh implied volatility like we're seeing now is leading to significant downtrend Trends and Paradigm volumes in Paradigm and you know crypto option volumes you know holistically and kind of just looking at some of the stats from the regressions or we have an r squared of you know 0.35 and you know so 35 of the the variation in the para in the daily change of the seven dma of Paradigm volumes is is explained by this change in the default level but the t score here is quite significant right so there seems to be the statistically significant relationship here between Paradigm ball changes and default changes and you know we include all the stats here uh you know for you know for you for you math and Stat nerds you know if you guys if you guys are curious if you guys want to screenshot that but you know it kind of just seems like until the volume until the balls go up you know volumes are not going to be a good place according to this analysis kind of you know irrespective of some of this like overright covering that we've talked about so uh I guess Matt like wait if you could speak a little bit more you know to these catalysts that are going to lead to this higher volume environment because I feel like every week now I'm seeing all these you know new price targets coming out where it's like oh okay you know BT senior 150k before the having and ETF things like that yet we can we can barely even move 300 a day yeah I mean I think I think a lot of the narratives actually kind of do remind me of 2020 again though when you think about from like the institutional side and when you think about the ETF side a lot of that narrative that took Bitcoin from say um high or like low low ten thousands in that Rally from late 2020 through 2021 to the high 60 000 was a lot around height around Bitcoin ETFs um the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF kind of uh whittled by the wayside pretty quickly but then Gary Gensler started talking about Bitcoin Futures ETFs institutions started getting involved um at that time I was still at JP Morgan and you were hearing from my other side of the job of all these Tech hedge funds starting to buy Bitcoin and the regular hedge slot not in any sort of crypto related vehicle and I think I think that narrative is somewhat coming back with just the prospect of a ever Bitcoin ETF um and if if that is something that eventually can go Um can become approved and happy to spend more on the details there and go into that I think it's just a narrative for you know the entire Ria Community a lot of communities that really don't have access to a great spot that going to TF vehicle um to access this market and that's a in my mind at least a substantially a larger thing uh particularly when you're thinking about like BlackRock and the big name traditional investment manager Brands like BlackRock um that's substantially bigger than say an RA having access to a pro shares Bitcoin future CTF for example it's just a night and day difference um so I really do think to the extent I don't want to you know forecast uh probabilities of the grayscale lawsuit and probabilities of Gary gensler's uh decision making um but I I really do think that's a substantially larger thing than almost everyone believes um it just also a lot of these a lot of these uh wealth management firms right like they function on like passive approvals for these types of products on like a name brand basis where uh if you already are approved to offer I shares products to your clients you're going to be approved to offer other eye shares brought to your clients and that's not a universal thing but I know it exists in certain places and maybe even make slightly different rules for crypto but it's just substantially easier for people to put uh client assets in a product that comes from my shares Matt Matt would you have any kind of feel for the the kind of potential time frames we'd be working with or looking at for a BlackRock ETF to be approved yeah so it's there's a lot of moving Parts here because the grayscale lawsuit's a big component here um the last I've heard there's not any particular deadline uh a decision in the Appellate Court is expected in Q3 so people were saying it could be any week it could be any day it also might be a couple months um and then from there that is something that then could be uh put up to the Supreme Court by either side to the extent this Supreme Court uh accepts that case um but that also is not even even if they think it's even more complicated um let's say grayscale wins and the SEC doesn't appeal that does not give a blanket approval for grayscale to transition into an ETF what it does is it basically just takes away the uh the sec's prior prior rejection so what would happen from there is effectively the FCC would have three paths they could try to re-nag on their past Bitcoin Futures ETFs which I think is pretty unlikely considering the disapproved a 2X leverage product um they could um they could approve the product that's another one or they could try to um reject the product on some other grounds in the current grounds that they've been rejecting products on for you know roughly the last 10 years um so that means there's kind of a very uncertain timeline there with uh like does the SEC when do they lose do they appeal um what do they decide if they lose there's that set of timelines and then there's an entirely different set of timelines related to um the ETF filings that was you know it was catalyzed by BlackRock and that was a really big deal because they had never filed before there was very little information leakage that they intended to file um and then all these other asset managers that had filed previously in 2021 followed on uh and filed behind them and that's more a function of trying to get in the snc's review queue um so effectively once all all these all these filings got recognized by the SEC in the past week um they have at most 240 days uh to reject them they have to go through a series of extensions to get it to that 240-day window but effectively let's say there's a Max 240 day window from but that timeline can be pulled far forward depending on how the SEC uh grayscale case goes and I know sorry I apologize that was a very long-winded answer but there's I guess two very googly components here and it's kind of hard to kind of hard to forecast an actual date but it could be soon and it really couldn't be later than 240 days I'd say that yeah well I mean you kind of just look taking this back to the Vault pricing right I mean I mean simran you look at this and you know that that bottom chart is to 25 Delta skew and I I look at where that SKU is trading you know around the dates of that potential approval you know and we're in a place where the the BTC calls are trading you know six Falls you know over the puts so it certainly seems like you know the pricing is there for you know a potential rally at least this is what the Vol markets are pricing not saying that we need to have one you know where even across the curve we're at the low low point of the range you could make an argument that we are breaking lower I mean we did have it we did close a candle last week before below 30k yet we're kind of in a place where it definitely seems where you know the pricing is you know the pain is kind of you know to the upside and at least that's what the at least that's kind of what what the Vols are are pricing there but kind of just relating the crypto derivative volumes to this ETF let's say this ETF gets approved right what does this actually do to crypto derivative volumes outside of you know options on this ETF and I'm sure I understand it brings Clarity but like when I think about like an exchange like derivat where it's just like okay yeah as soon as this ETF gets approved there's going to be options that get listed onto this ETF in what like a month or so or whatever that you know minimum window is is required wouldn't just all the volumes that go into options onto this thing like I guess what is your like longer term sort of view to some of these crypto native you know sort of exchanges if you do get this ETF sure so I think I mean I would be very surprised if you don't see a flood uh interest in adopting from your traditional players and treating to the crypto derivative space I think that that's kind of going to be the inevitable Trend and to your point one of the trends that I expect to see off the back of that is probably applied to liquidity on venues like CME right there but can speak crypto native and that's where most of the predominant volumes are but for example if I only need to put 35 uh margin to have adverse positions you need and I can get paid four and a half percent five percent on my collateral um and I can trade with the likes uh Citadel or Cumberland or any of your traditional crowdfight institutions that are entering into space I would be very surprised if the the Natural Evolution of the space doesn't bring about a flood of volume uh introduce the news and then also I think you would just expect to see more overall volume on entrepreneurial institutions untraditional exchange just like Durban as well I think that's kind of it's going to be the old blocks around as for what the timeline of that looks like again I think about point the the actual specifics of that might be uncertain but within a year from now if you can make some relatively cheap puns and some of those to your point are pretty soon um and it's quite interesting right because typically I would say the the predominant flow in crypto distance to the old capture and selling covered calls so whenever you see this upside coming back to the uh and calls trading overput it's like oh it's quite eye-opening in the sense of like oh people are actually willing to take a speculative View and do so in size to uh invert what is the normal uh SKU that you've normally see in your Market yeah uh I think that makes sense and I I think for uh David do you have anything to say or it looked like you're about to say something no no yeah yeah just um yeah just agree with that I mean we've spoken before right about this this idea that in in the absence of any conviction um certainly to the upside um then the more sort of programmatic type flows is these these overriding flows and uh involved setting strategies are just kind of constantly kind of way so it's in a market that's not doing anything um you know and and spots be very rangey voles keep grinding lower the two things that have stood out to me number one the pattern of our flows that we're seeing on Paradigm haven't really changed right we're still seeing you know people wanting to sort of buy a top side um and sort of make that play albeit and not huge volume anymore it's kind of patchy um but then also it is quite interesting that um as as we're saying that that you're seeing um you know the skew in favor of calls and which kind of speaks to actually probably better underlying sentiment um for this space than than what if you're just looking at pure a volatility or B looking at where the spot Market's trading um you kind of think well no no one's got any conviction but actually that those kind of underlying measures maybe speak to something a little bit more positive yeah and and David I I partially agree with you kind of on the flows I I think from like a directional standpoint yes we are still kind of seeing more of the same where you know people want to own these upside wings I mean I'm I'm just staring the sap 26 35k bull riskies we've been seeing bull rescues trade you know pretty much the entire year uh as well as you know one to three month 25 Delta outright calls more so in BTC than ethereum but moving back to ethereum and what kind of simran was alluding to around this overrider I would argue that that the flows that we are seeing from market makers in ethereum have changed dramatically over the past month absolutely dramatically and we call this slide so the great reversal of paradigms eat the Vega flows so even though the the recent Market flows have been generally quiet we have seen this pretty considerable shift in ethereum volatility Dynamics over the past couple months and this shift really occurred primarily due to this imbalance on Paradigm between Vegas Supply and Vega demand and this is primarily driven by what simran mentioned this massive ethereum overrider was significantly loaded up on risk then subsequently covered a ton of their positions so to be clear this overrider does not trade on Paradigm which is why we we feel you know we can talk about these sort of flows but let's look at the transformation of the data and the amount of ethereum Vega that's being traded on Paradigm by strike so that as the overrider added positions with market makers off of Paradigm market makers came in and hedged this risk by selling at the monies with a preference for this 1900 strike so that left charge shows the ethereum strike distribution of net taker Vega that is being traded between the dates of April 30th and June 20th and this is primarily the range where a lot of these positions were being added right so we see that you know as the overrider was adding their short call positions market makers were then subsequently selling at the monies against this position right you know on the upside you know sell the at the monies against it mostly in the September and December experts where a lot of this flow was concentrated uh you know there was a fair amount of flow in March as well but kind of just for liquidity reasons we saw most of the hedging in September and December so then what happened so spot rallies on the xrp news this entity starts covering all their risk and we even saw today I mean you see all these December 2300s you know going up today before we started filming and you know rather aggressively these guys are covering now take a look at the same Vega chart over the past month as the market maker Unwound their risk well now all these short at the money Hedges that these market makers are putting on are now being closed out simultaneously as the overwriter is covering out their their longer dated risk so in terms of ethereum flows especially in the longer dated space the flows on Paradigm are pretty much exactly mirroring what we're seeing from this overrider so kind of like getting a sense of what this overrider is doing is literally at the top of Mind of all our marketing you know what is this guy going to do because if you know what this guy is going to do right well you know you kind of have a sense of what the Vols are going to do I mean I just kind of look at the the December 2300 I looked at that big strike move today they covered like 25 000 of these things right so we see a lot of our clients trying to form you know a strong view around this and you know that's part of the reason why we talk about it so much it kind of seems like we're beating it over the head with a dead horse but like it literally has to pop a mind of kind of like you know all these guys that are trying to manage these books um yeah I was just going to say this very much reminds me of when oil producers are beginning to hatch right when the country of Mexico is hedging pretty much all the banks will know because puts Q becomes well-bit right people are either building in Victoria or they need to hide and so having a sense of this predominant flow in the market and the fact that it can move in plotted balls for E to trade at a discount or you can clip 30 to BTC seeing smog boggling when you look at it over the past you know year and a half or two years it's like yeah it should always trade at a premium to BTC right yeah unless someone is selling 400 500 uh K Vega into the market and that is really the only flow going through because there's no other broader narrative in someone just wants your generation yeah to your point I think like how they can sense of what this silver writer is doing I think uh and it really being the only predominant flow outside of any speculative website buying in BTC is really what causes historically to happen and kind of drives um what makes the most sense right and you know it's it's been pretty interesting to kind of see some of this action that's that's been occurring on screen right because you know we have they obviously loaded up all on all the risk in Q2 we have this move long dated Vols kind of Jack you know and it's not everything Deltas right I mean just the long date they were selling long dated Vols at the lows right they were selling long data balls at like 44 and these things ratcheted up to you know 50 51 and you know there was kind of this sense of kind of panic covering that was going on whether I mean I don't I don't know maybe it was a margin issue like maybe it was terrible telling them to cover like I have absolutely no idea right um but what it's kind of interesting is yes they're covering a lot of the decent March flow but it kind of seems like there's some program restructuring going on because we're actually seeing and you know it's it's not confirmed it's you know it's tough to really confirm this stuff but it seems like they're buying back the August and then selling September so it seems like they're actually putting you know fresh positions on so when we saw this flow a couple weeks ago we were like all right this program's over these guys kind of blew up but then at the same time like I don't know like overwriter programs tend to be you know pretty sticky and like on the on the other side of this you know they they are kind of making money on on the coin right I don't know how much ethereum is up here to date but like they are making money on their coin and these programs just don't go away like if you say if you're selling Vol like on the lows of spot involved like yes you you could get whacked um for sure especially when you're crystallizing losses like this but like when I used to see this flow in equities and other asset classes it's not like you take a bad hit and you just the thing just completely disappears um I don't know that's just my thoughts on it those people also just tend to have very short memories into your point people will continue to solve all uh pretty much in both three games you know we saw this in oil in 2020 where a lot of all selling strategies blew out and then you wait a year and a half and then people assume um and I think memories in crypto tend to be a little bit shorter uh than even that because the the scale and pace of things just to start faster for them right um okay David so let's let's shift over to the macro obviously a big week in terms of macro right fomc what have you kind of but at the same time it kind of seems like Equity earnings you know are mattering a little bit more than you know than what's going on in the macro landscape between all these Central Bank Phoenix yeah I mean I mean I think we spoke before we came on uh became came on air you know Marky expected fed to height 25 they've hiked 25 Mark you expect the ECB they've done it um and like all these things as well you know you might have this little flurry of volatility pricing or into the events and then as soon as the event passes then then you know foul sells off and then we're back into this drift I think at the moment I mean I mean from the FED there was nothing really new um you know sort of keeping this data dependency I actually thought there was some some sort of dovish elements to it particularly uh pal classifying current policy as um as being sort of tight um so I I that he was never gonna he was never gonna kind of lay a pause on the table um he needs to keep optionality to keep hiking and I kind of think we got that but it puts us in this um what I described in in the macro pulse uh this week has this kind of macro Purgatory where we kind of come in towards the end of this hike cycle both with the FED I think the ECB and the nearing the end of theirs as well but yeah we've got this kind of data resiliency that's not allowing you know central banks to really sort of kind of ease up and relax so we can't fully Embrace this changing macro cycle as we move from the hikes to the pores and the cuts so we're kind of in this state of of purgatory where we're waiting to embrace new regime but yet we the the resilience of the data the lack of central banks to be able to to really kind of pivot if you like um is just keeping us stuck so we're we've been we started the year kind of pricing the the I guess the slowdown in the hikes towards the pause and we've kind of seen that play out um but yeah we're now in this this sort of period where we're transferring from one regime to the other and I kind of think that's why it is this sense of apathy because it's really difficult right now to pick up on on a solid narrative to really to really kind of strap on risk with any conviction so hence we're in this kind of ranging Market waiting for that Newcastle list now you know what will that Catalyst be I guess the material downshifting the data that that starts to put um you know rate Cuts back on on the agenda which we've obviously been kind of you know we had rate Cuts priced in for for this this part of the year um earlier on we now obviously sort of taking those out and that they've been pushed into early next year um so if we start to see that downturn in the data um then things pick up again but we're back to data watching the central banks attend you they're looking at the data so yeah it's just really um I think everyone's frustrated at the moment because it's just not uh there's not enough to to Really hold on to um to to to Really sort of put some conviction on for the top side at the same time I don't think there's anything out there that's making anyone worried about the downside and and certainly we're not seeing that if we look at our Frozen Paradigm you know there's no particular sort of rush to put on any bearish trades um so yeah it's just a little bit frustrating um other things that I've really got my eye on I still think China is a potential um you know potential Catalyst for for a little bit more volatility um you know you're seeing quite a deep slow down there and you're actually seeing quite a deflationary um backdrop and and I always say you know China world's biggest exporter when they're in this disinflationary world that they start to emit that Across the Western World so I'm still kind of feel pretty confident in this peak inflation Peak rates narrative I think that's why equities keep kind of grinding higher as well because that's a pretty supportive backdrop for equities um it's a little bit frustrating that that crypto is not not joining that party but um one of the interesting things that we've spoken about um is this idea as well that China China want to ease but they're also they seemed happy to let the currency weaken and then they've kind of Hit the point where okay enough's enough and they don't want to lose control of that um some guys I'm speaking to we're discussing this idea that maybe China are trying to sit on bitcoin um because they're trying to manage the capital outflow situation and and the one thing you can't have is you know Bitcoin and actually we've seen it over the last couple of weeks with um with with some of the bus they've made and people trying to uh fraudulently you know sort of get money out of the country um via crypto but yeah the idea that maybe China's sitting on bitcoin um because there certainly seems like it just doesn't want to break higher um and it would make sense if you think that they're always worried about Capital outflows they've made noises around Bitcoin in the past um so yeah I I think China's interesting I actually think if you see um if you see the pressure on the currency just start to fade away I'd be interested to see how Bitcoin reacts around that and will that validate the idea that maybe China have actually been behind um one of the the things that's kind of putting a lid on on bitcoin um but yeah um we've learned I'd say nothing new this week from from the FED um Bank of Japan yeah I'm not expecting anything new from them uh tomorrow um so yeah and then unfortunately we're back to data watching so then we're gonna have these little flurries of volatility around the key data releases inflation non-form payrolls and we're just waiting for a little bit more momentum on this macro regime shift and until then it's we're probably still in this range bound yeah yeah David you kind of touched a little bit around kind of positioning where it's like you don't have you know that next impulse yet to kind of kind of take us higher but you know a lot of now but the people that remain are pretty much all you know Diamond hands I mean Matt do you guys do any work uh on your research around like positioning and and things like this like do you have a sense of like obviously as we discussed you know this ETF gets approved You're Gonna Get You Know potentially this new wave of like fresh Capital but like in terms of like existing or crypto allocation um from that existing sort of Base I I guess where is your sense of where that positioning lies um it's it's certainly not data we have great granularity into um so yeah there's not really a ton I can say in terms of like what what the Mac like trying to quantify the magnitude of upflows from sort of the traditional Finance ecosystem into a product like this I guess you could say um like bito you know it raised 1.5 billion on I think day one when it launched I I do think you'd see something substantially substantially larger than that um but yeah it's hard to speak with any real Precision there um you can look at sort of uh you can look at sort of like the gold ETF which is yeah one of the largest ETFs in the world and that was sort of the first time to make it really uh easy for the average retail investor to own physical um that is something that you know it grew very it was one of the largest releases ever but then it's continued to grow for the first uh for a really long time actually and so I think it could be something like that where you get you know a few billion dollars in a product immediately and then you you still have sort of a a lag phase for you know uh investors to actually like you do diligence on the space because it could be the case that you know they just look at we have grayscale grayscale already has all these problems we can't touch it uh we hear about all the problems with Bitcoin Futures with uh you know the pretty persistent negative carry um and maybe they haven't done any due diligence yet for that reason um but yeah I'd say that that's unfortunately not like a great granular answer into the numbers but you can get like I I would say a little bit of precedent from glb and Vito right no that that totally makes sense uh yeah sorry sorry for putting you on on the spot there if you know if you don't if you don't have the natives I was just honestly honestly curious I'd imagine that Joe like very difficult to come by yeah um I mean guys I spent years on uh foreign exchange desks and go we used to fill out so many of these positioning reports and and everyone was trying to like measure positioning everyone looks at cftc which is kind of a bit of after the fact and only really tells you about um how the momentum guys are positioned um so it's difficult in a way and and I think it's it's particularly um uh difficult within crypto that perhaps doesn't have such a broad range of of measures of these things um so yeah we're all kind of going off of anecdotes from from the people we speak to the things we see um and and you tend to find out once you see a massive move you go oh people were positioned to talk exactly uh simran so I mean GSR obviously a big shop in all coins uh Paradigm not a big sharp in all coins as we do Bitcoin and ethereum you know crypto derivatives but there's not really at least enlisted markets outside side of you know Delta one products of course on more on the options side there's not really you know anything at least listed so I'm curious kind of like what you're seeing on on the OT side OTC side or you know kind of just within your franchise generally around you know interest in all coins sure so I think a lot of it's typically driven by whatever idiosyncratic theme is going on whether it was uh the Litecoin having people trying to stack based on that um obviously a lot of interest close triple announcement I think most recently uh there was some increasing uh upside for maker so it really is driven by whatever idiosyncratic narrative is driving a particular ecosystem um but yeah I mean a lot of the predominant flow typically again tends to be yield generation and call over already which is kind of the present uh bread and butter and most crypto uh narratives for for lack of a better word I think most retail though is still a factor groups and so that's where a lot of publicity is concentrated but even with altcoins uh you know not moving around a lot similar to Makers the law still feels relatively cheap so if someone's willing to pay 90 100 ball for you know three six month option it's not impossible to get some liquidity around it but I would say volumes are generally muted similar to some other Majors right and that yeah that that makes sense in terms of even how I don't even know how you begin to even price these things you know kind of just do of All Ships it's diversion versus the theory view right uh I'm curious where you see kind of like the next big opportunity and like the evolution of crypto derivatives you know where you know kind of just like how any other asset class you know derivative markets start and you start in the Delta one products and then maybe you have vanilla options and then things start to expand out there as you know new players come in and you kind of get some decent two-way flow and from there things go to Structured Products and potentially Exotics I mean I guess like kind of where do you see kind of like the next big opportunity for the space sure so I think the the two major drivers when I take a step back and look at a bigger picture are probably just going to be broader traditional institutional adopting just bringing more flow into the Matrix um and that you know driving adoption on CME and other centralized enemies like that and then I think on-chain developments that are more Capital efficient are probably going to be the the bigger drivers right you have Innovations like David and evid which are similar to I think the debug index settlement to replicate uh the decks for Bitcoin ethereum and you can build all the structural products you want but when there's not sufficient liquidity in the underlying uh tokens that you're trading or even sufficient liquidity in in the layer space right the fact that we don't even have an active dated forward market for altcoins uh it's kind of a shocking thing right so to to try and trade derivatives around those when you don't even have a proper linear Market it feels like putting the cart before the horse so I think it's really going to be broader traditional institutional adopting and simply more convenient and capital efficient ways for on same lives but she's in fact some of you are probably going to be the biggest titleists that drive uh both retail and just broader probably use this but I think the the evolution of you know you hear this all the time about real world apps and close organization I wouldn't be surprised if you begin to see drove this feeling on real world assets and tokenization on chain is just an extension of if people want to take a punt on Tesla on Robin but there's no reason why they may not want to do it on chain if they can get similar uh I would say convenience you can do it in stable land rather than grabbing to set up a brokerage account for example now that that makes sense that makes sense okay awesome I mean I'm just looking at the time here we're kind of at that 40 minute Mark so I mean guys that was a that was a great conversation uh really really enjoyed it foreign [Music]
