hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hi guys welcome to the big picture my name is Joe Crue at Paradigm in the weeds around everything crypto ball markets joined here today by my colleague David Brickell as well as Gordon Grant head of derivatives at Genesis who is becoming quite the regular on our Channel before we begin please hit that like And subscribe button really helps us as we continue to build this channel to become the go-to source for insights around crypto derivatives Gordon man really excited to have you on today thanks I think it's uh yeah I think it's it's gonna be a big show you know just despite despite the fact that the markets have been relatively quiet I do feel like you know there's there's a good amount to talk about here and you know I guess I'll just start like the amount of conversations that I've had over the past two to three weeks of dealers just being like I'm bleeding long Vol you know especially in ethereum it's like it's pretty crazy you know the sort of like once one-way conversations I've been having around this and you know we know that this eth overwriter that we've mentioned many times before was active again last week you know 120k of dies Vegas was being sold during this role and you know to be honest guys I mean there was like a part of me that didn't want to talk about this override again but you know like it but at the same time it doesn't like feel to me like we're really beating a dead horse here considering this program it feels like it's only getting bigger and it's just having such a significant impact on the market you know in interestingly so if you just look at the prince here it also seems like this counterparty you know also bought the DS 3000 calls last Tuesday against these overrides you know potentially as a way to you know reduce margin burden on a rally and so we kind of have all all the big trades there on the screen but like uh Gordon I guess just like just jump right in like kind of seems like there's a pretty significant you know supply and demand imbalance in the eat fall market I'm just curious to hear your thoughts on that yeah uh you know was was talking to some other folks in the industry about this recently and and and even folks that have kind of been more kind of defy Centered for for a period of time and sort of understanding wow what's up with you all and why it's the spread all of a sudden now flat to negative versus Bitcoin and what's going on there it's important to to take a look at the history of each options and the volumes that they had historically seen relative to bitcoin ethereum ether options Market always smaller than Bitcoin as you guys know even some of the top market makers don't really spend as much time pricing or quoting ether historically there have just been the pure Bitcoin guys there have been many you know shops that have traded only Bitcoin options so so ether options Market as a sort of legitimate serious institutional grade concern has only come into its own I would say probably from my perspective within the last two years right 2021 was when the ether options Market really started to scale and we saw takers that were doing chunky volumes that would be the equivalent of Bitcoin right whereas if you had a taker who was doing um you know a thousand units of Bitcoin options you would start to see guys that were doing you know 20 000 plus units of let's say eth calls when you know and when you had each BTC closer to to like 0.08 um and and so now right when we start to see these overrides we're seeing the same effect that we saw in the great ball expansions of yor and eth right and those were the the Raul Paul um you know kind of wing call convexity play uh Skyrocket moves where Heath Falls went from 80 to 120 in a short period of time we've seen that exact kind of mirror image now where each balls have just gone from you know literally 80 to 40 um in in a relatively compact span of time and that's a reflection of this Market's inability to sustain or Warehouse the kind of risk that's being granted right where does this Vega find at home um that that's really the question there's no cross asset ball product for ink there's no um offsetting Beto coinbase or nstr were Riot or Mara kind of easy proxy for people to take a look at um of course there is a high degree of beta um and and correlation between Bitcoin but really at the end of the day it's just still to a certain extent idiosyncratic risk that people have to take down and digest and ever since we saw this overriding flow pick up at the end of last year and gradually accelerate it's always been a my God they're doing more now at this level right and and of course to an overrider it's a different mentality than a ball Trader has there's never really a bad level of all to sell as an overwriter because your program is I just need to keep taking in premium options that I don't sell is an opportunity that I lose and and we've seen this right the the first sales of the June 1800 calls occurred at a time where the taker could have sold um you know let's say April or mayville's at the time or just ahead of the shapella um you know upgrade could have earned I think it was a three ball premium or maybe five for selling the shorter dated strikes but instead they choose to sell the longer dated um lower IV strike that was less liquid give up more of a concession both an IV and spread just to get those premiums in the door and and that was you know at that time let's say again 100K kind of a Vega this this D sale that's happening now right down into the mid 40s it's yet more of the same thought process which is to say I just want to keep extending this program out because it's working I believe it will continue to work and there's no reason for me to wait to hope for better IVs because they don't think about it in Vega terms they just think about it as premium in the door to day a Decay to zero over time and if there's a Delta view I that I have that overlays with this well then I really need to take advantage of it and you know ethos kind of how it in well right it's up here at um you know 1900 odd bucks when they were doing these these overrights it's had a decent balance and and not surprisingly the gamma and the market from those June 1800 strikes starting to have that magnetic effect if you're if you're a you know a taker who's running this program you're just saying you know what I don't care about the Vol um and I think that that's very important right and it's very important to understand that it you kind of have this Unstoppable force and dealer balance sheets are not the immovable object that sometimes people think that they are nor are um or even other taker balance sheets right we don't have big spec hedge funds out there saying hey you know what I'll pick this all down at 45 all because um it's not an s p index uh volatility that you really can see it brought interest in it's ether Vol and especially for December um you know so that's that's a long duration in terms of venue risk versus whatever exchange you choose to put those on notwithstanding right the Sterling reputation that darabit has within our industry it's um contains a number of things that are also unhedgeable as well right you take down that risk and then you've got to hedge out your spot these spaces good luck trying to do um you know 30 40 50 bucks of that stuff so it really comes to the territory that we've continued to see this compression I think it's been interesting to note that there's been very little in the way of flow suggesting that the taker wants to take this off maybe a little bit of a tendency right we've seen nascent interest to cover some June wingier calls just to spread against this and it's not even clear that it's necessarily this taker but yeah really I kind of think of this as Unstoppable force and there's no there's no movable object at this point right down here even at 45 volt no no one's got the balance sheet or the cojones to be able to stand up to this guy right yeah no I think I think that's that's totally right and but also you know outside of just the inability to kind of warehouse this I do think the timing of when we're starting to really see you know this increasing Narrative of the significant Supply demand and balance in the ethal market I think chappella is a big reason for that right you know so since the Shanghai Fork you know you now have this increased withdrawal flexibility and Eve has seen a significant increase in the percentage of state eth which is now 18.75 percent of total Supply to capture this roughly six percent apy from staking with a validator so just looking at these charts you know each staking has seen significant net inflow since the Shanghai Fork I remember remember all the fud that we were hearing you know once that withdrawal flexibility was allowed if we're going to see a lot of people rushing to the exit and you know we really haven't seen that and on a cumulative basis you know the amount of ethereum staked and the amount of validators has just gone parabolic right so my opinion as well is like the inability to wear House of stuff is if is increasingly becoming this yield asset which I think is increasing the marginal propensity to sell Vol against one staked eth and perhaps explaining why you know the e-fall supply that we've seen on Paradigm whether it's through this program or another other users or you know David's pipeline of clients around each overriders that you know are continually looking to come into this Market has been taking up you know so you have this withdrawal flexibility that I think is increasing East propensity uh use takers propensity to solve all and you know additionally I mean if you just look at the eth forward prices on uh you know on Paradigm you know that's something that doesn't really make sense to me I mean it's effectively you know a six percent dividend and the eve forwards are trading at a premium to spot and then Additionally you have this sort of range-bound Market that's kind of operating this sort of Lindy effect it kind of feels like the longer we stay here the more likely we are going to stay here we which just invites more overriders into this market and you know you kind of just get this self-fulfilling prophecy right you know so if at the monies are trading flat to BTC across most of the curve I think you know Ethan December last week was under was under BTC and and to to your point on the demand side Gordon right like it does feel that the eth ball Market is pretty devoid of natural demand except for you know the occasional tactical call buyer you know and leaning into you know my past tradfi experiences you know like for example in equity derivatives you always had this sort of natural demand whether that was you know from some sort of hedging program or uh you know or the structured product landscape and Equity derivatives you'd have insurance variable annuity issuers who needed to hedge their optionality you know baked into their insurance offerings you know and then crypto Vault you know the natural demand just doesn't really seem seem there and you know combined with the fact that you know you just have low realized and you know it's just causing this bleed lower and continued paying I think I think that's also a big part of it yeah definitely and there is that war tax effect or limit effect as you say and the closer we get to these strikes you know the June case is somewhat interesting because we typically haven't seen a pin at an overrider strike um throughout the life of this program this is the first time that we are seeing the market creeping up uh on a quarterly expiry with the bulk of that original oi still out there right um June 1800 oi has come down from when it was well over uh 100 000 units but it's still um you know 90 92 000 units of the um of the calls right and it's about 40 some thousand units of the put so you know there there's still a significant chunk out there and and what's there to pull us out of this Vortex it's very hard right I mean that that degree of gamma for the Youth Market people are right now getting excited about this uh Celsius or I guess it's now Fahrenheit on behalf of Celsius or vice versa making a significant um move to to lock what 700 million of value in state Heath um that's a pretty good chunk but um you know 140 odd thousand uh units of eth with one strike coming up for June um this is this is an entirely different um proposition right I mean you're you're talking hundreds of you know millions of dollars just of risk at one particular point and as we say when you take the whole Market in its entirety say okay you know eat a couple hundred billion dollar asset you've got you know close to a billion let's say being staked or unstaked or restaked or rewards associated with that being moved and how much gets sold or bought over a 24-hour period okay and that can influence the market but when you talk options options are this Market where you you have this kind of tying compartmentalization that that happens one in terms of Vega bucketing right and and the other in terms of this this gamma effect um you know December Vega and eth not really like any other Vega right it's not particularly fungible even for Seth at this point March is to a liquid so you have these effects where just as with the June strikes stuff kind of trades in its own universe and it can have these these perversive facts that you you wouldn't really expect so we don't even know what's going to happen with this degree of OI at one strike I mean this is a big big number on a quarterly expiry here we could see eth gradually just get marched down to 1800 and die and I think some people uh it's going to go negative right yeah exactly that's right you know where your transaction costs of dynamically hedging your Gamma or more than you know than than the uh than the actual realized imaginary number yeah that's it right and it's uh it's not a surprise here that we're starting to see a relatively steep smile um you know to the put side around this and we're starting to see calls really flatten out right where we've got um you know maybe maybe just just a couple of balls of wing premium um for for out of the money calls and we've developed this this kind of you know sort of tilted um you know J type of smirk on the e-smile because local Vault No One Believes this can perform yeah I mean that was actually I was looking at the stat this morning I was like how many of the June 1800 calls have been have been sold on Paradigm in the last like you know six to eight weeks and the number was like a hundred thousand yep right and it's just like all it's just all taker natural Sally flow you I mean coming from you know dealers putting this stuff down yeah yes yeah I mean he didn't get sold dude what happens um so obviously the idea that that you've got this open interest or convalescing around this 1800 strike kind of understand how that becomes a magnet and we we kind of get pinned around there um once we get the expiry done um what happens then because there's always a lot of um you know a lot of hike around on these big expiries and particularly when they're all centered around a particular strike and then expiry kind of comes and goes and then you know we just move on to the next thing yeah what's what's your view around that yeah what happens as soon as that 1800 expiry is gone in June but then what yeah um it's quite gang theoretic uh I find when I look at a market like um like ease especially we have seen the tendency after major quarterlies for Vols to go lower um you know based on the premise that well folks were short they had to have collateral tied up the options expire they have free collateral and the first thing people want to do is kind of reload on ball shorts but we haven't as I said seeing an expiry where it's the dealers who are sitting long all this risk um and we've got the taker who um you know has has effectively continued to extend the sales program based on the fact that we saw extension preemptively into accept maybe two to three months ago and then we've seen a new extension into December I kind of look at it two ways one if this taker wants to continue the program they've got a bunch of free margin all of a sudden that they could just go and ape right into uh March of next year and just Hammer this thing right all the way down to to a completely flat curve I don't know you know 35 or 40. um the other is that the market is out of this gamma vortex at 1800 and it doesn't have a natural supplier of eth gamma at 35 percent there's no there's nobody who wants to sell gamma down at this level as a vrp trade um that it just feels disgusting right to get paid for for volunte at these levels because we all know what it can do I mean it's it's had you know 100 days even recently you know which is a five plus percent move at these levels so there could also be the effect where maybe the taker decides to to have a pause and Market doesn't find a natural supplier or gamma at this level it's really only September and then all of a sudden you get a move right because there's no longer that pin effect there and then you you sort of see the front end Jack higher into that move because you you have to get to the price that clears game theoretically right and if and if people knew this they would say okay so I'll sell June I'll buy July I'll sell Juno by August and I think that there has been some of that kind of gain theoretically smart um calendar spread trading going on you just don't want to bicep right because everyone knows that sep 1900s and 2000s are also a dog and the same thing will happen to them and those are really non-fungible risks like any other strike except it's not normal um you know you can't compare it I don't mean normal in a statistical sense but it's abnormal to think that you know the 1900 or 2000 is completely non-fungible for these other strikes but for me the key thing is okay so there's extension of the current program smash the whole curve down extend it out but still in that case the market doesn't get back gamma right they they don't get given gamma by this Taker and you've got to wait three months to really Decay into a meaningful amount of gamma uh or right the the taker does nothing um and and the market has a move and we see more of a pronounced effect so um my view would be to say we see a little bit of relief from this tremendous uh downward pressure at the front of the curve and tend to see a little bit of normalization probably see a little bit of a pickup in realized volatility we know that eth has had a few of these wild summer moves in the past for different reasons um the lift off the bottom in 2021 was was pretty ferocious the um the move in 2022 after after the three arrows debacle and before the merge you know is it possible that there could be another uh bit of a squeezy um you know rip in into July for each yeah sure and and the market is also telling you interestingly it's not as worried about calls which I find interesting right and that suggests also perhaps there's more take a flow there's driving skus in favor of puts in order to hedge some of this yield play right because you don't mind having a high put skew when the asset itself is a good static Yoder and that's something you often see in Emerging Market currencies and and other kinds of things but the key for me is the only thing we're asking here is nothing fundamental about eth nothing about macro nothing about monetary policy we're all asking what's the take we're doing and that tells us everything we need to know one taker overriding clips of a hundred thousand units of eat is dominating this market and I don't think we've really ever seen anything like this in crypto right we know that there are some overwrite programs in Bitcoin that are big and there are takers that come in and whack out a few thousand units but it's Bitcoin Market can handle like that and if we just haven't seen it and it it keeps going yeah and I think that's a good segue to kind of just talk about this interesting volume Trend in you know BTC versus eth you know since the start of the year you know just like taking a step back here right um you know in q1 you know the big theme was this you know Resurgence and BTC upside interests mostly you know this outright call format that you know we've we've talked about extensively on other big picture episodes earlier this year and you know the volume picture has has completely shifted since May and you know this chart shows that Trend well so this chart shows the seven day moving average of the ratio of BTC to eth volume which is that blue line as well as the BTC to eth open interest which is that orange line so just looking at that blue volume line it took off at the start of the year you know indicating This Much Greater interest in you know BTC optionality which peaked at over three to one as as we saw that BTC driven rally and it kind of felt like every time we came on the big picture we were talking about BTC out right calls right but since bot has stars get those days back yeah yeah exactly right since spot is stalled out that blue line has completely retraced you know almost back to pre-rally levels you know so in other words in March the BTC option volumes were 200 bigger than eth and now they're only 50 bigger than Eve right like that's that's quite a quite a big retracement there and of course the open interest line is going to follow a similar Trend but naturally is going to operate on a lag relative to the trend of the volume and if you look at the culprit of that declining ratio in volume you know it's BTC you know eth volumes have been largely flat and that's been driven by you know the big culprit out there that that overright relativity and you know no surprise and it's no certainly no surprise that volumes across all crypto products are trending lower and not just in options you know it's happening in spot it's happening in perps so you know it's notable certainly you know the eth volumes are hanging in there you know albeit volumes are certainly on a lower base you know rather than you know coming off the highs uh in an asset like BTC right so you know it kind of does seem we're kind of moving you know towards this ethcentric derivative Market at least for the short term but like I guess I guess Gordon and and David like what's kind of the base case here we like do we see this like sort of like B Etc volumes are sucking wind and until we actually see a rally and if we do see a rally what is the driver of that I mean we have CPI and nfomc in 13th and 14th yeah Dave if you want to take a crack at it first I certainly have my thoughts as well yeah I I mean I I guess um you know I'm still in the view that we we lack in any kind of macro narrative um certainly as it uh applies to crypto at the moment um I think again we're in this from certainly from a macro side we're in this kind of transition from the that sharp fed Titan cycle to now the end of that and and then transitioning towards the pause and and the what will eventually be the cutting cycle the issue we've got right now is that we can't fully Embrace that and the data is still pretty resilient um at least it's mixed I would say so we can't fully Embrace this this pause that we can then start so we're knowing okay we've moved into this new new regime so there's still you know just as we start to to even price the cuts in then then we we're back to pricing uh hikes again so I think at the moment without uh having without having a sort of real sort of macro narrative that's clear and gives us a clear clear Direction on where we're going and then we can start to play things around that um and then then I think you know you end up just being faced with like these mechanical flows like just dominate everything um the other thing at the moment as well is I actually think I mean if you look at what's going on in NASDAQ and um and in stocks you know we are we are seeing a good sort of bid and interest returns to the market now yes there's a little bit of a AI hype around that I'm driving but also I think in Market that's under positioned and being sort of forced to chase um and and crypto is just not not sort of jumping in with that and playing catch up with that um I think actually for once crypto's being the grown-up in the room a little bit and and kind of is cognizant of this liquidity uh drain that we've potentially got coming uh posted that ceiling lift um and I think everyone's kind of sort of waving on sort of baited breath in terms of how that's going to play out now there's offsets to it right we know you know I think JP Morgan are talking about a one trillion dollar liquidity drain now how are they rebuild the TGA um an issue um will be Paramount in terms of how impactful that liquidity is if if it's all sort of mainly some tea bills and it starts to get funded essentially through through the RRP coming out um then actually we might not have this big liquidity event that everyone's everyone's kind of holding back for so I think it's going to be interesting over the next few weeks to see if if that negative liquidity event doesn't happen in a way we're all fearful of then all of a sudden you might see uh crypto look at what's going on in in in equities and I think right yeah we we can join that party now and then all of a sudden you know it's like price price breeds um prizes price and interest and all of a sudden everyone's rushing back in and trying to put on top side and chasing and and then you get this um virtuous circle where we're all kind of chasing higher and and that higher spot higher collateral more leverage and all that sort of move so I I just think we're waiting for the spark actually from from the macro or albeit something else to really it's really get us there I think that's fair um crypto certainly has been more stayed in terms of moderating the what appears to be kind of a euphoric um you know boost in equity that is somewhat lacking in deference to liquidity withdrawal resulting from the bills issue and um it hasn't been falling out of bed for the reason that um the saint narrative that brought crypto off the bottom and caused that scorching 40 14 day rally and Bitcoin is still kind of here right I think people are um you know who pay attention to macro space and are listening to folks like Jim Grant's interest rate Observer no relation uh whatsoever um and others that's Muhammad al-air and he does wear a nice bow tie though I'll give him that um ellerian and other folks right they've said hey look there there are serious structural problems here um you know the UK and the EU continue to acknowledge that inflation is running hot and there are geopolitical concerns there are thoughts about dolorization as a secular Trend it's all that stuff potentially is keeping a floor under under crypto and there is this overall Tech narrative and AI narrative right now and that's probably potentially as on a factor basis working in crypto's favor but Market certainly hasn't lost its head it hasn't um conflated uh crypto with AI in any kind of wild way at a benchmark level and so we're just sort of sitting here treading water and um there there's definitely potential for I I would say the market to kind of digest this liquidity the interesting thing is you know we've spoken about this before we've already done a lot of the the um damage of removing liquidity from the crypto Market by taking away these Fiat on-ramps and off-ramps um this bills issuance won't hurt crypto prospectively in the way it would of in times past because the mechanisms by which you would pull dollars out of liquidity let's say as an institution and go buy a bunch of bills that are getting issued those linkages actually they're just not there right in the way up um I'm not you know Genesis is not a precious metal dealer for instance that says hey you know what I don't want to hold gold as a tier one asset on my balance sheet like some precious metal dealers do I actually need to step up and read a play capital and buy a bunch of bills and so let me take a couple hundred bucks off the balance sheet out of gold you know uh do do some kind of you know efp key WAP out of um out of physical in the Futures and now use that access cash go by bills that's just not a game crypto dealers are in right people are not being asked they're not primary dealers they're not folks that have a balance sheet that that is substantively dependent on dollars in the way that traditional financial institutions are so that that's another kind of thought to me is what what if we because of what's happened with the banking system disconnect this year what what if we um you know sort of jumped the shark on that and find ourselves kind of looking around and saying okay so the bills issue has happened and crypto's not you know 20 lower um then then does the market kind of say you know well I guess we can kind of get along now and move move forward that's a that's an interesting proposition and crypto to me feels less correlated um than other uh times right we're not necessarily seeing that sympathetic same day Relentless correlative influence of a tech driven move and NASDAQ driven move um for crypto some you know detractors might argue that eat at close to 2K even with what's going on in the world where we don't know whether it's a security or a commodity and there's been some of this hawkish commentary from folks like Dan Berkowitz that have suggested that chains can be both um subject to cftc and SEC uh regulation at the same time maybe the tech rally is keeping youth up here but I'm more of a view that crypto is just slowly getting you know kind of untwisted unplugged from from the traditional Financial system uh in the ways that we understand and know and so you know that that could explain you know what's in store for this asset class perhaps of the next order to come especially once we get past some of the more technical factors like this huge amount of gamma that's sitting in the market um to answer your question Joe about well what do we think would bring volumes back into the crypto Market um into the Bitcoin Market in particular I tend to view um on renewed rallies as being something of a sufficient condition for that we've seen the gearing effect that volumes and prices and volatility and therefore options volumes uh and flows have on on each other in this virtuous circle um with a degree of apathy that we're seeing now which is not just a function of ball selling but just sort of lacking a general Catalyst I tend to say that even if we were to drift lower down to 25 000 let's say in Bitcoin it doesn't feel like a moment where we're going to see people grabbing puppies now and because there's a trend break there would need to be I think a list or something for the downside to really lead the way higher in any meaningful uh fashion for implied volatility and volumes otherwise it's likely to be a spot up ball up volume also as well I mean I think this will add to that um like when I think of certainly from the macro side of things right now um you know rates of repriced higher over the last sort of month or so dollars dollars kind of move higher over that time so actually you've had quite a negative Dynamic that's formed against sort of Bitcoin and crypto and I actually think it's quite interesting that we've not actually made more progress to the downside which again tells me there's not a lot of Leverage um it's also because of some of the banking issues it's not as easy to get to get short now and and um and short crypto so you kind of just left with the hodlers who are you know they've ridden that's not a huge move over the last sort of year or so um probably aren't going to be puking out that anytime soon the only other kind of like negative flow Dynamics you get from a spot point of view I guess would be which we saw obviously post FTX where you got um you know false liquidations and bankruptcies and what have you in the absence of that it doesn't feel there's any kind of natural sellers um or anyone trying to short this there's not a huge amount of Leverage in the system that could potentially get washed out so actually we were kind of working against quite a negative Dynamic from macro with higher rates higher dollar and none of this upcoming um potential liquidity drain lotusing starts to reverse you know we we had a weaker ISM earlier and we've sort of priced um you know we're pretty much priced out June now um and and I think we almost just just above 50 50 for a July hike all of a sudden you start seeing the rate Dynamic come a lot lower again if dollar starts to come off again and the Tailwinds start to pick up then and then we're back into a regime which is called I completely agree with you price starts to go up and price drives narrative and all of a sudden people are trying to rape in and and um we're in this positive spot Bowl correlation volumes are out prices up and um the world seems a better place yeah and kind of just outside of macro narrative let's talk more about you know a medium-term crypto idiosyncratic one and there's certainly certainly a lot of hype uh you know all over Twitter and my abundance around you know the June on June 1st you know Hong Kong green lighting retail uh our green lighting retail trading of of some major crypto tokens like BTC and Ethan I think hash key and OSL have approved applications while okx buy bit bitmex to name a few still have applications that are waiting approval but what I find the most interesting was on the day of the announcement was this news on this FD USD stable coin you know announced on the same day of this regime change that a Hong Kong regulated stablecoin backed by high quality reserves issued by a Trust Company under Hong Kong's trust ordinance like to me like that's even bigger news you know like all other hunk all other stable coins in Hong Kong are currently illegal so a Hong Kong regulated stablecoin announcing it's going to hit the market seems like a pretty big deal in terms of a medium I mean medium term sort of you know crypto Tailwind I do think it's going to be a slow burn but I think you know it is certainly a positive development for Chinese crypto adoption uh you know and I think you know looking at this fdusd stablecoin and tracking that market cap I think is going to be a pretty strong indicator to gauge this this sense of Hong Kong retail impulse yeah definitely I mean the north Asia pivot in crypto has been one of the more meaningful trends of the last six months it's happened at a time where the US has become afarer on a far more unfriendly jurisdiction than in the recent past and relationship for a little bit do you want to can you repeat that yep oh apologies yeah there was just an incoming call I was just saying that you know that the north Asian pivot to crypto significant um and and this kind of um you know relatively Innovative development occurring at a time that the US is getting incrementally less friendly uh with cryptos is one to watch right undoubtedly and we'll we'll see to the extent that this is just more of a tactical by the authorities there or whether this is one that's going to lead to a more sustained sticky participation um you know by retail in that region in a way that you know was previously the case has not been the case in a while cool well I think we um I think we leave this one here I mean we certainly touched on a lot I think 35 minutes is a is a good line for this one foreign
