look what Gordon from Genesis said about the relationship between volumes and coin prices when you talk about coin denominated derivatives markets which is derivative which is what we're all trading people's ability to have Deployable collateral or assets to spend premium on is oftentimes a function of How High those coin prices are and and so when we found ourselves down at 15 16k Bitcoin and East kind of languishing around 12 1300 people just didn't have a lot of Firepower right to make bets and and no willingness to do it but yet as soon as prices ramp up you have higher coin prices greater ability to play Capital greater ability to margin positions or take bets plus that sort of psychological self-fulfilling prophecy of higher Vol higher volumes um higher prices and that kind of virtuous feedback
