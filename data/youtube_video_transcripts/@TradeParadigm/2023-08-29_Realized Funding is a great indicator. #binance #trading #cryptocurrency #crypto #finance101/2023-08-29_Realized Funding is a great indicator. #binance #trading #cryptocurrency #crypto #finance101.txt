let me just look at the realized funding cumulative realized funding over time going back year-to date so in Orange we have e in blue we have Bitcoin so we can see during sort of the svb banking crisis uh when we had that sort of rally back in Bitcoin um Bitcoin funding was more expensive uh than e funding and it's just as of recent where people are paying more to be long e they're paying more e funding in the per starting essentially the beginning of this month and we're having a little bit of a flipping there in E versus uh Bitcoin cumulative funding that's that's just something that's interesting I don't know what to make of that yet it's just an interesting data point
