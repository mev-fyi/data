hi guys uh just as we all thought we could kick back and relax for Christmas just as Joe Cruz getting a little bit too comfortable in his Christmas jumper uh Bank of Japan going surprise markets um with a hawkish shift to policy by tweaking the yield curve control uh Target from the previous 25 basis points to to Now 50 basis points knee-jerk reaction to markets was initially Global equities um sold off bond market sold off in sympathy U.S treasury yields went higher reason for that is because Japan is one of the largest Capital exporters to the world so when Japan adjusts policy back home there's a potential for a change in portfolio allocation and particularly with high heels back home to to move some of those assets sell foreign assets and move that back home um initial thoughts um the treasury move um I'm inclined to fade here I know I've held a billion bias and treasuries for the last few weeks but I don't think this changed that changes that too much a couple of reasons being number one for Japanese investors to hold hedge treasuries hedge back to Japanese Yen it was nailed in uh yet it was yielding negative in a way um and as a consequence of that throughout the course of the year on on net uh Japanese investors have been net sellers of treasuries so I don't think that overly changes the um the portfolio flow from that perspective and won't lead to sort of aggressive selling of treasuries um in terms of what I think is actually driving sort of treasuries higher is the three things we've spoken about before I think we're Peak CPI we're Peak fed in terms of we're coming towards the end of a Fed hike cycle and also now the third thing is is obviously we're growing more concerned about recession in the US so I think those three factors will keep um yields coming lower just to quickly look at some charts and some levels to look at 10-year yields so we kind of faded out above levels around 372 which is um a bit of a level some sort of previous lows and and also previous highs 380 is a bigger level to watch it was the highest at the end of November so kind of watching those levels but I'm expecting those to break down the biggest moves that we're seeing today has been in Dottie Yen so Dottie Yen has fallen around just over four percent uh Market's still very short Yen and I think the interesting thing for me is um this kind of feeds the narrative post-dcb as well that other central banks are playing catch up with the FED which should ultimately lead to a weaker dollar we've spoken before about the importance of of dollar for Global liquidity and financial conditions and and that strong dollar was the dollar wrecking ball well that's reversing and it continues to reverse um we kind of bounce off some levels and and we're now coming back lower reversing the moves we saw post-fed so if I look at the world and I think okay if I'm right on news being capped out um and actually reverse lower um USU is coming lower dollar coming lower um I think generally that's going to be quite good for risk um so equities I think remain supported I think effects is a Moraine is supported uh crypto remainsupported all things are equal if nothing else Mrs Watanabe has got a stronger yen to go aping into some Bitcoin with [Music]
