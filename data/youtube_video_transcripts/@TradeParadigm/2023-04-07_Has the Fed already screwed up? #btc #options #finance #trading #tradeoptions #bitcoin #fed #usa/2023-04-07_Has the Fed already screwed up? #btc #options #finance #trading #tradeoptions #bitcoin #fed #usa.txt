so do you think that the FED has already overdone it yeah 100 100 I have um I said it's that we we monetary policy tends to act with like a 12-month lag and if you think 12 months ago they'd only just done the first hike they'd hike 25 bips um and they just ndqes they hadn't even started QT so if you think and you started to see this week the data uh fall pretty sharply so certainly in the ism Services which which obviously is about 80 of the US economy um you've started to see that now it wasn't quite in contraction territory but it fell pretty sharply uh manufacturing looks like it's in a recession um so yeah you're just starting to see the lagged impacts of of past hikes um feeding through now and I expect that will really sort of pick up pace over over the coming sort of weeks and months um on top of that you've got this sort of banking stress um which is going to really sort of tighten credit as well
