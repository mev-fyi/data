all right hello everyone uh welcome to the big picture my name is Joe Crue I'm on the institutional coverage team at Paradigm in the weeds around everything crypto Vol Market and I'm joined here by my co-host David Brickell who's on our sales team and is our resident macro expert and today we have a featured guest uh Sean McNulty from coinhako over in Singapore a former colleague of mine from our JP Morgan days so very excited about that welcome Sean really glad to have you cheers yes thank you for uh thank you for having me yeah for sure and Justin Bieber yeah we'd love to hear about your background uh you know what brought you to coin heyco and why you decided to jump into the crypto Vall space yeah most definitely so uh as you uh mentioned uh former uh was an fx auctions Trader JP Morgan former colleagues uh uh in the same sort of uh realm but as we were discussing earlier equities ethics options you end up pretty siled but uh but yeah so um my journey um it was I guess I mean I couldn't trace it all the way back to Toronto when I was an fx spot Trader at CIBC in terms of my crypto Journey where uh I used to have an Airbnb side business um which is kind of a uh it was it was it was an interesting experience anyway because it was like lots of guests and all these other sorts of things and there was a cryptocurrency conference in Toronto and some of my guests were there and in fact I looked them I've looked them up and they're still in crypto but uh this was back in 2014 and so it's very early days and it was the first I kind of heard of it and these guys were like obviously super Enthusiast uh enthusiastic about it and they tipped me in Bitcoin right so they gave me a Bitcoin tip like forced me to set up all and everything because I guess that was their thing these days it was like a 10 or 20 dollar tip that when I went because then I forgot about it and then Bitcoin ripped one of them one of the rips higher and I ended up being like 100. markets is like all of a sudden that perks you're interested when you get something like 20 accidents you're like oh this is an asset class I should be paying attention to um and so yeah I'm originally from Canada I'd um I did an undergrad at the University of British Columbia MBA National University of Singapore in between the undergrad and the mbas of my time when I had my time in Toronto as an epic spot Trader I'll post my MBA I joined the FX option invest in JP Morgan out here in Singapore um and was there for about seven years trading everything from like Cube 10 to em to like Exotics and things I think about the seven year mark uh you kind of um uh you start to contemplate if you want to continue on sort of the corporate path or like look into something else and uh a friend of mine had introduced me to derivative uh kind of relates uh like I guess sort of an early 2021 and you know I had no idea there was even a cryptocurrency options Market I'd been following cryptocurrency because of that whole uh Airbnb uh experience and it's something I've been interested in and Jamie Diamond's not the most supportive guy yeah I know that well he was basically showing me out the door when uh we were like I could get 50 times by doing the spot if I can do crypto options then I can make that a thousand well then like it was just it was like the the volatility of the asset class and as a ball Trader and everything everything like wow and you're used to like when I was in like FX is a bit more interesting now but uh for a good portion of my uh seven years certain FX options like Euro was on like a four handle and like nothing's moving right like there's no interest rate differentials across FX and so you were like it was a very uh like also you see like Bitcoin underneath was like yeah at that time their ball bases are like 80 and 100-ish sort of thing and it's like okay this is this is looking pretty interesting and yeah so then my my friend kind of told me about it I started sort of uh I first of course checked with compliance that you're going to see if it was something I could do and they didn't know about cryptocurrency options either side and so they said go for it right like there's no sort of uh well Jamie Diamond he talked specifically about trading spot he never said anything about trading derivatives I was like all right so uh so I got into it that way kind of this pa uh you know exploring the marketplace it's just like they really enjoyed it and then uh quite happy here in Singapore it's the largest uh exchange here and uh they were essentially looking to expand their trading operations I think a lot of cryptocurrency firms are looking to kind of move from just sort of the linear products these essentially offer more products and services but in our case like institutional and high net worth sort of clients who have crypto Holdings and maybe want to generate some yield on them um and so they had become aware of this and we're exploring you know there's lending and borrowing side of the business we're going because it was a trickier in 2022 and then right and then another way you can generate yields is through uh volatility which is kind of a more time tested one versus like the tokenomics or or into lending bowling could just be a little bit trickier with title party risk not exactly as easy to decide for as it is like compared to Banks and things like that where you have a bit better idea uh so I I learned and then sort of expanding the trading desk uh and uh got in touch with some people there Kelvin is like the head of the desk we ended up doing a I'm interviewing and just discussing and really hit it off well and so uh I ended up leaving JP Morgan and joining the desk because it was quite a big jump in the sense that uh so Kelvin was started about a month before me quite happy to head up to sort of trading desk guy and build it out essentially um and uh you go from a setup at a bank that's been trading obviously for years and then that's like uh you know hundreds of millions in technology every year and you know has a team of like 30 phds worldwide working on like you know all the different applications and software and tools and things which it was a very sort of computationally intense and mathematically intensive when it comes to derivatives and then at Point hacker we had to set that all up from scratch because it hasn't been around that long which is exciting and also challenging at the same time right so it's like our whole entire low like I guess they seem to be compared to one right and then you have the because it's such a new evolving aspect class you have these Dynamics changes so I remember when like dovs became huge and all of a sudden you had this like like as they grew and they like the uh like uh the assets under management grew and everything like that it started to really impact you know the skew the curve and after Friday sewing and everything like that and then you've seen that sort of uh dissipated after 2022 where you don't have the same sort of Apple bag the same sort of AUM and and uh and so it's like even if you were to pull out past data you're in a lot of cases talking about a completely different marketplace with like different Dynamics and so it's not bad useful if you're trying to like identify relative value or opportunities on a ball surface so it yeah so that's going from that to like something where you have FX ball you can kind of you get a much more richer data set to something where like your data is very limited and you're trying to just kind of uh build something from scratch it was it was it was a challenge but it was a ton of fun and you were I guess a year into it now and uh and as you guys know kind of the winning more market share and things like that and so it's uh it's been it's been an exciting year for sure do you think um obviously I'm from an fx background as well um and FX options low not trading there anymore do you think given that Journey that you've been through um and obviously you were setting a lot of stuff up would it be more Plug and Play If an fx option Trader from JP was to join you now or is it still you know just getting to learn completely kind of different relationships and and what have you I mean it's quite a different Beast if you like to what you'd be trading in FX options uh I think it's much more pleasant playing out for us because we just spent so much time building tools and so like the fact that we have like we now have like sort of our own internal wall surface uh our great sea spots uh like a much more sort of like before we didn't even have like a proper Greek spot sort of metrics which just to be really tough because you're looking for like you know like how your you know your grandma holes and your and like where you where you exactly you get your long Vega delivery and you know your risky spot and all these sorts of things that uh especially in crypto where the ball service can move so violently where like riskies will go from like eight balls for calls to like 10 balls to put in like like it's always amazing when I first get up and I read like uh the Paradigm commentary of the overnight price action and it's just like it's like so one way or the other way and like you know the most is going to buy there's something to be quite aggressive so it's like you've really got to uh you know you get delivered into like longer sort of riskies and the market moves against you you're gonna be super painful so he really has to be aware of all that the spot exposure there's some sales guys right now at JP Morgan listens list going you spent all that time complaining about lack of volatility [Laughter] right is that with traders in general and like sales as well where it's like no matter what people complain I think it's probably a human trait across everything because like yeah when balls nothing's moving it's like you can't make any money nothing's moving and then when it stops moving it's moving too much you can't make any money because it's too volatile it's like you know people are always trying to make excuses yeah I mean that's the story of crypto ball over the past what like you know six to nine months right I mean we went from like I mean no pun intended lunacy right like back when uh you know tarot Luna imploded into like FTX and then Q4 and then you look at the Vols front end balls and BTC are trading like 20 handles right crazy yeah and then you had to rip back up and then my point is like in crypto like the Vol regimes just just seemed to change so so quickly and can be very very dramatic in which in the way that they change yeah well especially Q4 of last year that was I was amazed by like our realized ball was lower than Equity most right like it was it was amazing at some points yeah and like it was it was pretty it was pretty remarkable in that like you know just the fact that the amount that it came off and especially given like all the stuff that was happening at crypto I mean you had some pretty like Monumental sort of developments in the the crypto sort of specific space and uh yeah and it was it was just amazing how little things did move and then obviously you get the January and all of a sudden everything's back on and I think uh like especially you can really sense like what in terms of regime shifts and uh I guess the the interest out there in the markets and uh with the move higher and in combination with the or the less amount of money in the dobs because I just don't think the market has the same sort of long gamma top side that it once did and it's like amazing how it just tastes the lid off of things right because like before you get these Puffs and it's like every you know there's just so much long gamma up there they just got stuck mud rather easily and then you can see as soon as that sort of supplied to that sort of dynamic changes all of a sudden the move's higher like you just don't have that same sort of uh they don't run into that same sort of like uh wall of sellers or people taking profit or not that's right and it's not it's something that yeah I think it caught a lot of people by surprise and then all of a sudden I think now you're seeing what the subsequent moves that people are covered quite a bit but it's like you know it's like if you were to take data from last year and try to like model like the surface even now it's like it's one of the things and the challenges we've been working on this year is that the dynamic just from Q4 of last year this first quarter kicked me off it's like any sort of z-score metrics or like historical levels like on our own sort of ball servers like oh this trade makes sense like you can't really have a ton of confidence in that anymore no anything that you're doing in crypto ball basis based off of a normal distribution is going to get yourself exactly it's like the distribution is and I get and then even like the risk is skew I thought Greg actually on the on the last uh episode I made a really good point when you look at like Bitcoin riskies versus equity riskies in the beta between the two and things like that and I think that like those sorts of Dynamics especially as uh it starts to get more intertwined with like traditional finance and things it'll be interesting once they start to get involved and start looking at opportunities like the one that Greg was probably there with the equity protocol skew versus the Bitcoin vocal scale yeah and we've I mean we had that big move where we just saw the Very extreme spot ball correlation and when we saw all that upside being being bought and to your point uh hold on this is actually a really good opportunity for me to share my screen around what we're talking sweet oh wow okay very cool yeah okay so Justin just in terms of like the dealer gamma exposure right like just recapping what you said like the Dov total value locked is a lot smaller a lot of like the fall sellers in overriders sure there there definitely is still some that are there but it is not to the same extent as what it was right you're not running into this wall of calls on the upside anymore and I think that is really you know shown well here by just looking at the dealer gamma exposure right like you know like you look at the g-ball of Bitcoin decks here right so this is Amber data's uh basically dealer gamma exposure index and look at look at that look at the exposure on the upside here right so the red means dealers are short because all the flows that we've been seeing since the beginning of the year have been all this crazy outright call by or like we're not even just necessarily outright College there's a lot of like sell one buy twos as well and it's kind of weird because like locally eels like we're you know we're kind of stuck right we're kind of stuck in this like 23 24K range and you know this chart does a good job you know perhaps explaining that because you can see the the green bar there right around our current levels but as soon as we start rallying my view is you know that's that positive spot ball correlation is going to come back and perhaps that big move in that you know in the risk reversal that you're talking about is just going to start reverting the other way again because you know yeah has been reverted back to kind of like that 2022 regime you know over the past couple weeks yeah I think that that's like such a tell too because uh like the the I think I forget there was some sort of high ticket like the one month risky is like approximately one month riskies where I think it was like 20 balls or something but you can see the scramble on that initial move and how quickly the risky spot reprices as soon as you go I think you say like 25k or something you see that sort of adapts for top side and it's like uh you know because not everyone's like kind of you know when things aren't moving people aren't as worried about it and then also sets going out there and like as uh as the aberdata shows like there's obviously that gamma pocket there and you'll just see those riskies just like all of a sudden swing massively right and uh and uh and all of a sudden you end up like you know 10 like a 10 volt risky skew repricing is like something you would almost never see it qcp guys on um a few weeks ago talking about this like the demand in which people want to trade and you know do these sizes are not enough for the market to be able to reasonably observe it right so you have these like crazy moves the volleyball is just extremely high and then as as soon as you kind of see them you start having this move number one you know some of our big taker fights will kind of see the spot move and then they're like oh boom Here Comes an RFQ on like 250 like Bitcoin one of these calls right yeah ratchets right uh yeah calls us like it's interesting too it seems like the notionals are jumping up a little bit as well in the sense that like they'll be like 500 a thousand like you know like big big Clips like compared to what we were seeing uh last year essentially yeah I mean I think but also like clips that are you know actually meaningful risks like not just we're seeing like actual like you know 25 to 35 Delta stuff like in the one week to one month buckets right so yeah I think as well if it fades um I think that phase what golden was saying he had the weight crime yeah David Price goes up then everyone's got a lot more collateral to play with yeah I did or Sean am I back here what David said did you lose them that's it yeah I was just saying um it kind of ties in as well that you know with what uh Gordon was saying the other week talking about you know when spot prices are higher then uh you know there's this convexity where spot prices are higher and then you've got more collaterals to play with so therefore you can take more leverage more risk so you kind of start to see that increased size come back to the market and we're definitely seeing that right yeah yeah but but now we're kind of like stuck you know you know what I mean like maybe David this is like a good uh transition point and we were talking about it like you know we had the rally then it kind of felt like this NFP data you know kind of just took the wind out of the sails a little bit in terms of the spot rallies and then we and then from there we should we started to see a bit more ball Supply come in and again you kind of like that engineering sort of process of you know self-fulfillment and crypto ball where it just kind of feels stuck I mean kind of what's your view on the macro here I mean I know you have been quite bullish but it'd be good to hear kind of your view as as well as Sean's View and in terms of where we go from here because I mean I don't know the conversations that we have is like look if we kind of break break higher another a thousand two thousand points in BTC maybe that's the Catalyst to really kind of Ratchet this up to 27 28. yeah it's funny just looking at like the charts the um the eighth chart like we we're kind of in the the negative gamma zone right for for eighth yeah and you've seen that and realized you know yeah yeah a little bit more gappy yeah but but I think um so we started writing the uh Paradigm newsletter um and and I wrote the one on the weekend and I called it a pause for full uh for thoughts um and I know kind of two reasons behind that I thought firstly you know we had a lot of central banks last week uh the FED Bank of England ECB and I I called it course of thought because you know we we saw uh central banks last week kind of you know start teeing up the pause um I think the FED particularly caught everyone a little bit by surprise who was expecting power to push back on like the hulkier shredderick um or the the you know it's been a lot a lot more hawkish and pushed back on this like easing of financial conditions um that that we've seen But actually he was pretty relaxed about it he kind of phrased that within the context of the past year in which case in which um you know fed uh Financial conditions patterns so obviously Market ran with that bank of England kind of teed up a pause um and then even the ECB sort of hike 50 confirmed they're going to go 50 in March but then they they referred to a data dependency so we kind of we kind of have this which we've been talking about for a while sort of moving into this this pause which is a vastly different macro regime from last year where we were you know in this aggressive hiking cycle um and then obviously uh Friday came along and and an absolute blowout non-farm payroll number which there there are there are some uh January um sort of issues in terms of adjustments that get made to that data but there's no there's no getting away from the fact that the labor market is pretty strong um and this is something the fed's looking at the flip to that was the actual earnings data continues soft and both um you've seen uh Jay Powell and and Brainard allude to the fact that there's no real sign of this kind of 70s uh wage inflation spiral um so I think they're a little bit relaxed about it but obviously that that data kind of made everyone go oh maybe the FED are going to be engaged in this fight cycle for longer we had a cuts from the earth um and that surprised uh so it's kind of central banks against this poor but it kind of felt like it just it just paused the momentum that we had uh within markets um and and then that's kind of led into we had how um at the economic Club um again I I kind of think he he seemed quite relaxed to everything um and it's kind of I I think he's trying to lead the market still into that pause and I think the key phrase for me that he said and I actually think this could turn out to be quite an important phrase because I don't think um you know central banks use words flippantly and um and he sort of repeated the phrase that he used actually last week about the the beginning we're at the beginning of the disinflationary process and it kind of reminded me November uh when he said he basically said words around the fact that you know it's no longer right to call this uh inflation tree it was kind of very um you know and I kind of felt he keeps emphasizing this disinflationary process has gone I can't still leading the sense of that in support that's so strongly I think the way the FED are looking at the world is that you know they're gonna pause and then keep rates for higher for longer and certainly longer than what the Market's pricing um so I think we just try and all digest that at the moment but I don't think it changes the the fundamental Dynamic uh we're sort of moving from positioning from this sort of sharp [ __ ] cycle to now sort of the coming pause I'm worried about how rates are trading I'm worried about how the dollar is trading um and they're two big sort of macro Factor inputs um into that kind of framework of what maybe drives crypto and broader risk however the flip side to that is is we talk about liquidity and flows um liquidity is actually getting easier um and you've got the TGA with the um with the US hitting the debt ceiling the treasury general account um which is essentially the the treasury's checking account at the FED they're having to draw that down as they hit the debt seat and they can't raise new debt so that's quite a powerful offset to quantitative tightening you've also got the pboc in China the bank of Japan that the expansion of expansion of their balance sheets outpacing that of of the contraction with the fed and the ECB so the G4 central bank balance sheets are actually expanding so liquidity is a little bit better and then there's the flows and the positioning aspects and I still feel like this Market's on position for this sort of shift in Dynamic I also think um given the underweights that people were carrying into this year we've now we're now seeing guys that happened to chase performance um obviously sort of Bitcoins what go on 40 or have you hire equities they've all come flying out the blocks so now people are chasing performance so I kind of think the flow Dynamic you're still going to see money come into this and we're also seeing money sort of coming to uh back into crypto funds right we've seen them we've seen various sort of uh examples of that so so money's flying back into the space I think the Market's still under positioned so I'm still generally constructive um but I I think it's going to be make or break I guess on the inflation data next week um so yeah more cautious here I think the Market's just going to tread water a little bit into inflation next week but generally I I think the dynamic's still there and and we'll sort of push onto the top side throughout this quarter definitely and actually I think a few things pick up on a few things you mentioned there David like the uh I think with power one of the challenges he faces he was so hawkish for so long that anything isn't this like uber haucus it comes off as like in the dovish sort of category is that he leans so hard into that sort of narrative you know I think there was one presser where he was uh he was told that the equity Market was higher when it wasn't and he like immediately started talking yeah so uh and uh and you know ultimately if if the the jobs number I mean it's it's interesting because I think it like they I guess it makes the soft Landing scenario which uh people are seeing as like I guess increasingly unlikely almost plausible like it seemed like it wasn't gonna happen it's kind of interesting like you say the average weekly wage numbers were lower yeah this massive jobs beat you're starting to see that this is inflationary he's probably like secretly hoping like if I can just steal this in it'll be go down to whatever certain figure yeah for all their talk about like we want everyone to lose their job and that gets a lot tougher when people start actually losing their job and the political pressure is coming and everything so like yeah and then the fact that he has Lane so office yeah I think it's very interesting uh those Dynamics working together and then I also tend to agree that I don't think a lot of people are participating at this point a lot of people miss that initial move so I mean even like the NASDAQ something like 15 or 20 or something like that you don't see that on the Bitcoin rallies all these influences all these short liquidations and it's not like and it's you still hear a lot of people talking about another like lower 15K and it's like to me that gives me confidence that the move uh like if I had to do it on a probability weighted basis it is probably going to still still has room to go higher because it's just uh it's when people start to get more euphoric about it that it tends to dissipate and there's still quite a bit of negativity it seems out there uh yeah dude you're saying this CPI coming up there's I guess you got the two prints Before The Next Step but you get like another sort of soft CPI and uh uh and uh and then all of a sudden I'm like you get up to that sort of start down bucket of BTC you see more sort of influence chasing the move I think you can really see us extend it and that's another Point um I thought was a really good one uh the Andrew king and the Twitter profile I guess I guess it sounds like he's like a venture capitalist but I think he's also a prepared for client to uh I think he's actually a paradox shareholder but I'm not mistaken but uh uh he's uh he made a really good point about anyone who is going to sell crypto uh like who is going to tap out of the market or didn't believe in it anymore um like all the weak hands had kind of washed out so anyone who's wrong who's was long altered 2022 probably like the three of us right or like some logs anyway I mean if you didn't sell in 2022 I mean if you're you're not probably gonna sell here and you know I think I think you've render that uh that Dynamic where you kind of run out of weekends and then like you know the people you have it now uh uh the people who own it aren't willing to sell and you have this kind of capital inflows you know and ultimately whether it's Vega or Gamma or spot it's buyers and sellers right so you know if you have more buyers and sellers prices go higher and vice versa yeah no he he certainly he certainly loves shelling he's showing that uh that narrative but you know in in terms of you know you just look at like the the Futures position as well it kind of like feels like there's like this bid underneath the market right we felt it back when it came forward was like you know it was like around like that 16 000 level right you know low 16 000 whenever we get down there you know the perfect open interest would increase and then you know then somebody would be kind of building it up in this very similar things actually happening now I'll share my screen one more time yeah actually one other Dynamic that I think is also worth noting just in terms of uh the perks uh funding versus uh uh versus like one of these spot moves and things is that you'll end up with like the the purpose funding like not again like it's too much is the technical things but like it really starts to blow out right in terms of where spot is and where the derivative perks are and like it kind of speaks to the option positioning as well uh and so it's just that scramble higher uh and you know last year was the the first funding was reversed because you end up with a lot of people end up having to be sorts of features or whatever like that right to get ahead of business so that Dynamics really flips as well where on these moves higher you're also uh like you've got to also keep in mind that you're probably gonna if you're long like the perfect reason versus whatever options that you have or whatever that you're gonna there's gonna be a carry cost associated with that um and so it's like they've really uh it's really an interesting Dynamic we've seen this year as well yeah I know that that makes total sense and just in terms of like the BTC price versus like the open interest so in this chart I mean look so the market started rolling over earlier overnight right we were rolling over to 22 800 and then look what happened to the open interest in the park s up right because you know somebody's trying to certainly trying to catch that knife right so you definitely seems like a lot of the the weak hands are out and you know when we do have these sell-offs right you know there's kind of some people out there that kind of have a pretty big war chest that are willing to step in front of this thing and keep it going yeah definitely and it also feels like two to a certain extent that a lot of the top side buying or trading at live so they're not Delta they're not doing any sort of Delta hedge versus oh yeah yeah which is a big uh uh I guess I mean it's something that really drove Equity markets last year all the uh the Reddit uh paying the market per gallon and not doing any sort of Delta hedge and then the end of like just kind of uh the gamma gamma is a powerful Greek it could really get things moving so that's right and we touched on this on on other episodes it's like crypto derivatives is still so small right like how is like gamma like actually like you know impacting spot when like people at JP Morgan don't even know what crypto ball Market exists right it's just it's just a crazy Dynamic and and to your point um in terms of none of this is going uphelp ahead like there there's a little bit but not much because the market the crypto ball Market is so nascent trading Delta hedge crypto options is kind of a big pain in the ass right you don't have in terms of like the liquidity and the number one if I'm trading on durability and I want to you know buy a call and you know sell spot against it well number one I can't sell Squad against it on Exchange because I can't do that on there a bit but so I can either sell the perk or the fixed right future right and liquidity isn't great there right so yeah like to your points like pretty much everything that we've seen from a directional standpoint has gone through live and sure there's certainly that the case that these guys are kind of doing it off off exchange and you know selling spot on the other side but like I would be I would be quite shocked if that was happening you know from the the conversations that that we've had appeared on yeah another thing as well I I just think it's interest interesting and uh maybe talking about my own book being someone who comes from the the sort of macro uh angle to crypto quite often is it felt to me like like crypto and be it because if it's higher beta bit because of the kind of pseudo play on on the Fiat monetary system it kind of felt that crypto was the first asset class to really sniff out the hike cycle um so when when Powell said back in November 2021 you know we drop in transitory um pretty much that was when when Bitcoin brought a crypto topped out and then was was the first uh someone I I saw on Twitter described you know crypto was the first one to eat [ __ ] right yeah and it ate it and it ate it hard um but but I I I kind of think and this is I mean the the thing with macro that's kind of hard is that it tends to these turns tend to play out right over uh and they tend to be sort of longer you know a bit bigger picture kind of Dynamics um that you know like even now we're now kind of in that uncertainty in terms of you know his growth and is inflation going to turn back higher and what does that mean for the FED but but ultimately we're in this term whereby we're nearing the end of that hike cycle and we're going into a different sort of monetary regime and I kind of feel that that crypto again is leading that and picking that up and starting just to sniff that out um I I used to actually think Sean I don't know I used to say that about FX actually I used to think FX was the asset class that sniffed out regime change quicker than other assets because they say say the FED say the FED pause you know the the front the front end of the rates curve isn't going to do anything you know but the dollar the dollar might start to soften and kind of just allude to the fact that things are going to get easier and maybe it cuts follow that but um it's harder to price that in in a rates curve than it is in in other asset classes that have I guess a little bit more kind of nuance to them and and no more so that than crypto so I kind of think that's interesting um I also think there's a risk reward element to all of this right um crypto say had so many black swans from the Throne of it um that you know if you're looking and if you can accept the volatility in crypto and that kind of volatility adjusted return you know you kind of probably look at things now and say let's say I know we have another down leg and there's another 30 drawdown in crypto you kind of weigh in that now against the potential you know we could have you know a 2X move in crypto and it's kind of knows that sort of risk reward um is pretty Stark that I I think there's a lot of particularly crypto Risk Managers looking at going look we got we've got to be long this because the the upside is 2x the downside is half X or yeah in that being said I mean a lot of the flows right there are going through Paradigm like there's some that smell like okay like this guy you know sort of you know formal wants to capture the upside but then there's a fair amount and like no that's kind of just like an upside hedge right like I cannot be short right yeah exactly yeah I I'll rephrase that I cannot not belong this market right like in some capacity so you do see some like the wings you know in the 30 000s that that are also trading that kind of feel you know less like oh okay yeah let's let's form a win to us like no I just need to have some exposure in here because if I don't I'm screw it I guess something that I think is on top of a lot of people's minds in the sense that yeah like you're you're downside versus your outside seems extremely cute at uh given the price action and the global macro and everything that's going on because that's even CPI does come in hot like you say you're back down to 20K or something it's like okay fine but uh let's say it comes in soft and this pivot really starts to gain momentum it's like yeah like are we back up like it's not unrealistic to be back up to you know 60 70 80k I mean everyone's price Target at the end of 2022.00 yeah exactly yeah it's one of those asset classes that can really uh move to the move to the upside so it's uh it's yeah I think that that's a huge factor and then you've also like even with those sort of wingy top sides it kind of relates back to what we're talking about in terms of the historical data set are those like five Delta calls really like uh priced properly like I don't know right like because you know it seems you have to wonder like you know if we're kind of using uh traditional Finance models to like approximate where like a 510 whatever Delta you know and one of the things I'm always impressed with in crypto ball is like it's hard to buy like a five Delta Euro auction like no one wants to sell that really right like it's one of those things that is that like you don't want to do the trader who's like got all this like really short wingy stuff you got almost no premium for that you're gonna have to explain to somebody it's not just rips right and uh but in crypto it's like um uh like you can get pretty decent liquidity in like the size like there's people who are like you know you can actually get that and then the question is is like it like it might be good value there like I don't know like it's one of those sort of interesting things where because the data sets relatively uh limited uh and we're maybe using models that aren't uh they're kind of adapted from other asset classes it does uh break some raises some interesting questions uh in terms of what are the opportunities are on the surface if you can leave it there takeaways are yeah yeah well I just really appreciate you guys inviting me on obviously uh enjoys our partnership with Paradigm uh you know we enjoyed Market making on your platforms like it's to be honest it's the best sort of uh direct uh dealing settlement through the exchange of course but it's the best platform I've seen and you know and that's actually they don't have the equivalent of Paradigm and you're still manually booking tickets and like accepting and it's like it's a it's a huge investment from even what I was dealing with on uh in the FX option side I mean you're still doing it on chats a lot of things with your pink is all in the chat and the fact that you guys have been able to set up a platform that everyone enjoys using that's an easy to use fun to use uh the apis and everything it's super impressive so we really enjoyed being a part of that and uh you know providing liquidity to the platform and and uh and uh you know look forward to a very uh you know growing things in 2023 as like on Echo expands across uh southeast Asia and you guys continue to expand your operations as well yeah I appreciate that we always uh especially to make JP Morgan buddies when I describe what I'm doing is like we're basically building trade web on steroids for crypto derivatives yeah but on that note David how are you yeah I I guess just for me um certainly on the on the macro side um I think we're in just for a little bit of a more difficult period um a little bit concerned about rates in the dollar as we're just repricing a little bit after the strong data but ultimately I think the standout thing for me is is um Powell's emphasis on this is the beginning of disinflationary process um I think we're still nearing the pause I still think that's constructive for risk I think uh liquidity and flows continue to point to more upside but obviously inflation next week's gonna be a big data point and um we'll know more from that but I'm still pretty constructive here yeah absolutely and what we've been seeing in terms of the flows definitely still skewing to the upside You know despite the less interesting spot action but if we kind of can break you know that 23 24 level you know perhaps with the CPI being let back out that Catalyst I think we could potentially see a rally from there just based off of the the dealer positioning but on that note thanks for joining and I will see you next week thank you Sean yeah cheers
