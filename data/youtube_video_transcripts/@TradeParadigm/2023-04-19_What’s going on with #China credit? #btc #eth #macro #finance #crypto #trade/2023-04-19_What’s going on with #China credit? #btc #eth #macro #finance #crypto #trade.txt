what else are you seeing like in the last macro post you talked about a few things so give me one other thing that you think is um significant coming up um I think one of the things that's significant last week we had um some really strong China Credit Data um and I talk about the Chinese credit impulse um which is kind of the growth of credit within China now again that's that's as they've uh they've come out of lockdown um the economy is still struggling so trying to do what well not just what China does that every economy does they just pump liquidity and pump credit back into the system to try and get things going when you start to see China's credit impulse start to take off is very supportive for risk domestically you tend to see Chinese equities perform well you tend to see the property sector in China which is obviously a huge concern for China that starts to get propped up and actually it correlates pretty well with Bitcoin as well
