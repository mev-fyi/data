[Music] hi I'm Dave Raquel director of sales at Paradigm welcome to the big picture policy reverting so the obvious trade is always the expensive one this whole Peak inflation a peak rates narrative Peak fed which we've been talking about some expensive place to find out and crypto ball a potentially fatal place the the crypto option markets are definitely showing some signs of Life hi guys welcome to the big picture my name is Joe Crue I'm at Paradigm in the weeds around everything crypto ball markets I'm joined Here Again by my colleague David perkel as well as Sohan sen and today we are joined by James from investify a big structured product issuer in the crypto space I think the timing of this episode is really good you know honestly I don't know about you guys I did not want to talk about range bound spot markets or Vols Automotive again and realize being lower for another week I just didn't want to do it so I think this is an episode that is a very good to help break up the pace a little bit you know learn more about the structured product world of crypto which I selfishly have a lot of interest because uh my past life in Trad 5 was doing a lot of these sort of things and frankly I'm still learning more about the products that are out there in crypto and I think in this episode you guys are going to learn a lot too before we begin if you can just hit that subscribe and like button really helps us as we continue to build the channel to the go-to source for insights around crypto derivatives so James if you could just Begin by giving us a quick background for our viewers like how did you get into crypto and ultimately how you ended up co-founding and bestify thank you um I guess I got into crypto I started looking at it seriously back in 2020 um I was asked to evaluate a potential investment in a big data Predictive Analytics company in the space called invest a bit yeah and that was at my predecessor company um where we were actually in the business of structuring um product predominantly affects the option based structured product um as well as we were deploying a lot of capital risk Capital using ML and AI based systematic models and model design so this was a really interesting opportunity for me and basically did our due diligence and um we decided to make an investment of them um and then we quickly realized that we're looking at a potentially massive opportunity I think the first thing that went through my mind was the fact that Noah was paying attention to any sort of downside protection of the space everyone thought that returns were a thousand Acts and I'm a 27 year traffic executive if you will various trading roles um I said this is this is a phenomenal opportunity for us to put together our technology combine both entities and come to Market with you know a platform that we can actually monetize these gaps if you will because there was quite a few gaps there still are quite a few gaps um and so we quickly organized um we did a capital raise in the fall of 2021 uh we've spent 2022 just building out our full stock platform the issue about 450 million um in product last year um in 2023 for us is really about scaling and growing awesome yeah it's you know super super interesting you know I I feel like crypto structure products is something that's perhaps not really like fully understood within the crypto world yet and I think it's natural that as the digital asset sector continues to evolve we're going to see more and more instruments that you know exist and are very popular and crowdfide being adapted for crypto and one such instrument as I mentioned is you know Structured Products which are investment products that are linked to underlying assets that typically use a derivative instrument to offer a return profile different from the underlying asset itself and so these structure products typically can be tailored to the need of each investor so they're an effective tool for achieving a variety of of objectives whether that is you know the risk mitigation point that James mentioned or return maximization or you know yield enhancement and these are extremely popular products within the tradify world so it's natural as crypto emerges as its own asset class that we would start to see this increasing issue and so I'm curious to hear about that evolution of Structured Products within the crypto space like have you guys steadily seen more and more demand for this as institutions have entered the space and you know what strategies have been the most popular has it been the downside protection that you have mentioned or has it been more you know perhaps you know on the yield enhancement side of it yeah great question I think I'm going to come at this a little bit differently I'm a bit of a cynic by Nature um you know I've worked for some pretty large investment Banks worked for some pretty large buy-site um organizations it gave me a really good chance to look at both sides of the fence and I know some of you here have had that same experience um most of the structured product I see in the space is garbage I think it's a bet against the house and normally when the house is aggressively pushing something you know that there's a reason for it and you know I think if there was a word that I would use to describe us as authentic right I mean when we look at designing something we're looking at actually employing our own Capital to it so with that in mind we've taken um a different path if you will which is more around managed structured product which is a bit of a newer concept we're starting to see other providers actually coming to Market with some of those albeit I think that they're pretty gimmicky and um a little light but uh um going back to your question where's the interest definitely seeing interest in guilt and um with a couple of sort of main requirements one um reduced smart contract risk um two give me something better than the risk-free rate and so it was a great opportunity for us to basically go to work and with the team basically find the model that we feel works really well that generates a very attractive um targeted apy without sort of with while I'm meeting those two objectives right no smart contract risk and and um better interest rate and so we designed this model we call it stock and our partners have basically been Distributing it since the fall last year but it's it's you know effectively harvesting premiums in the option markets as best as we can and the models are extremely defensive they they keep us out about half the time half the trades of the year that we actually do try to trade because we typically train weekly um and there's a bunch of reasons Ryan why we chose weekly we can get into it but uh at the end of the day it's been working extremely well I mean we're targeting upwards in the High Teens if we do our job correctly and um so far we've been spot on right yeah I think that makes sense I mean we've seen significant demand and you know David works on it does and Sohan do a lot of prospecting for new customers on Paradigm and it's certainly something that we've talked a lot about on the big picture is the significant demand for harvesting fall risk premium within the crypto space especially in ethereum you know as we discussed on last week's episode you know in a post uh in a um post proof of stake World especially after the Shanghai upgrade like my ability now to be able to you know stake ethereum for you know four to five percent apy and then actually sell calls against that because I have the flexibility within my staked eth you know we're seeing more and more demand for that and certainly in environments where implied realized their differentials are fairly persistently positive I mean especially the past two months where spot has kind of just been shopping in this range and sure real implied is low but you know realize this what I think like seven day ethereum realizes like a little bit above 30 right you can see why these strategies are so popular and something I saw in your guys website that was super interesting to me is like how you guys are harnessing artificial intelligence and you know machine learning through your Dora AI just to help guide some of your evolve based Structured Products like can you can you explain how you know you are using AI to be able to navigate you know range bound volatility markets or you know last year uh you know elephant in the room like the higher volatile Black Swan sort of moments that were quite common like how do you work alongside your AI to be able to navigate uh the different ball regimes within crypto to just change so dramatically and so quickly yeah for sure I mean um you know I think first of all I'm going to start off by saying that we're not chasing a hot narrative for me as I mentioned at the beginning we've been employing various predictive models to help augment our overall monthly Factor model um for you know over 15 years and um you know I think AI rate now is is pretty over hyped and pretty gimmicky I think you know anyone who tells you that they can give you a mall that's going to predict price until he is is a liar and it's a writer black bat doesn't matter what you say so what we've been focusing on with regards to AI um in machine learning is you know where can we be informed we're not looking for a final end state from our predictive models what we are looking for is what can we actually create that's going to help us inform and if we're looking at a one-week um tenor as an example what we've managed to do really well with our predictive models is predict absolute range in a week right so we have a pretty high hit rate the way we Define hit right um that basically allows us to look at Absolute range we don't know if it's higher or lower we do have some models that give us some guidance on directionality but so that's number one the second one is fall we do a pretty good job at forecasting forward volatility right and and so we have a one through four week term structure model that's quite active for us finally what I'll say with regards to our predictive is we use our predictive to be overly defensive not to be um the opposite which is highly offensive and so what we've done is we've taken a couple of these different predictive models we've merged them in with multi-factors that give us a very good success rate with regards to the overall structure of the strategy and what we're actually trying to control for um and so that's that's technically how we're doing it I mean I've had a data science and I had a quad strategy and the team behind them that's basically constantly dealing r d and it's a it's a tough it's a tough gig listen I mean it takes about six months to fully bake a really solid model and out of that six months you've probably gone down about 80 to 100 rabbit holes on potential models that you know start to show a little bit of promise but ended up getting you know scrapped at the end I mean it's just a it's a really tireless um sort of role and Analysis but one of the things I could tell you is that we've done a really good job at automating the entire life cycle of model design all the way from feature design feature analysis because the firm in its core is really a data and analytics shop right we're taking this data in this analytics that we're developing to try to identify gaps in the marketplace like I was saying put them all together or be contracted by our partners to actually control for a specific use case or specific outcome if you want right yeah so I mean could you go to a bit more detail about the um about the range uh that comes out so it is my understanding right that the model would spit out and say it's going to move two percent maximum this week and you don't know whether it's going to be to the upside or it's going to be to the downside and then you come in and sell an option structure to take advantage of that range exactly so yeah that's that's correct I mean what it does is it gives us a forward range Target in percentage and then basically what we're doing is we're constantly monitoring the error rate of that prediction so you know from our perspective we want to keep that error rate as low as possible um but that model is retrained every week dot one in isolation as an example um and then to your point about um how we actually come up with you know um what options we're going to trade the model basically sets the risk it says number one I don't like what's happening right now for the upcoming week so do nothing so we stand down right um as I mentioned earlier second one is um based on all of the factors and the Predictive Analytics here's where model wants to set its it's it strikes on the wheat and then number three it tells us whether or not it wants to solve strangle cell calls sell puts so this is our our yield model we also have a um a market neutral sort of managed program on BTC that expresses a view using condoms right so it's a little bit different and in that case it'll tell us whether or not it wants to get in a full Condor or wants us to get in a call spread or put Sprint right does that does that imply because you said the it's not really um directional just just knowing that you know the range does that not imply a level of directionality in terms of what the model is spilling out yeah I think you know you're going to have a natural tendency to want to really explore that um you know I think you just depending on how you behave we've elected to just be disciplined on utilizing that model for a very specific reason I I mean look at the end of the day if we had a really good high success rate and prediction directionality that's that's an element that we would absolutely love to pursue right but I'm just being honest there's certain things that we can do really well and there's certain things that we're still trying to do better yeah sure James you able to share um it's all what some of the inputs are to that model is that your secret sauce that no no I mean because I mean I'm going to give you a high level descriptions but I mean we're basically using Range model we're using an anomaly model that looks at a whole bunch of um blockchain metrics um we're looking at a z-score on the other line we're looking at a volatility screen Factor um and then we're also looking at technical factors so I won't get into which one specifically on that um but then what we do is we basically go through a pretty intensive um monthly Refresh on the models and and you know I think what you'll you guys have talked about before I've heard and what you know of is is there's regime shifts in this space and um it's a killer so you know your objective is to try to be at least with the Curve maybe if you can with a little bit of lock you're going to be a little bit ahead of it but we're constantly trying to evaluate the inputs of these models what it sort of inputs and factors and thresholds do we actually have to tweak in order to optimize um in order to give us you know that ongoing High degree of success right I want to ask a question um more about like the distribution uh into your end investors of these Structured Products and uh for a little bit a little bit of background so there was there was a good Anthony pompliano podcast a couple weeks ago where they get into this existential question where if is AI able to you know eventually replace acid allocators altogether or are we you know still pretty far from this point and they had on a guy named Jordy Visser who is the CIO of Weiss multistrat you know where he where he mentioned that you know leveraging AI uh is certainly helping with their investment process but kind of like similar to you at the end of the day you kind of still need a human in the seat to be able to you know inform and make those final decisions and as we've mentioned you know the crypto Vall regimes are changing very quickly but my question for you is how do you sell an investment strategy to end users that relies on machine learning like how do investors feel about placing trust in Ai and what sort of like reassurances do they need when you sell a signal based strategy around like a machine learning model yeah that is the question um I'll answer it this way I think from our perspective we're leveraging the depth and expertise and experience of the team number one number two whenever I speak about AI I talk about it in the context of augmenting I don't talk about it being the focus the nucleus of everything we do it augments and I think that to your other um your the gentleman you mentioned earlier it's exactly that it basically helps inform I think number three the other thing you know that we talked to with our partners is that we actually promote human override I mean when you have an event an idiosyncratic risk or an idiosyncratic event I mean a great example was the Russian Ukraine conflict like how can you how can you expect your model to actually understand what that means and and what that's going to look like for the market so you know we stood down for a couple weeks just to see how the things are going to shake out we also overload the models of a few occasions you know when there was so much dispersion around the fomc interest rate meetings going back about five six months ago I mean look if we're talking about this particular strategy and harvesting premium it's the last thing you want to do is you know stand in front of a freight train and get run over over some large event that has the opportunity for a huge Spike and fall so um yeah those those three qualities right augment depth of expertise and and and our management team and a team overall um and uh you know that's that's that's our narrative makes sense uh so the last the last question that I had and then we'll we'll get into a little bit more of uh the the macro stuff uh that David will speak to but so on last week's the big picture we uh we discussed you know galaxies very publicized you know on-chain option trade that occurred on Avo and I'd like to expand that discussion a little bit into this quote unquote unchain structured product world you know we know through the current offerings in D5 such as you know the ribbon you know option vaults that we you know as a plug facilitate through Paradigm you know on-chain structure products certainly democratize investment access that is normally not feasible for for most retail whether that's due to regulations or you know a non-accredited investor status and of course I think we all agree that regs need to uh to these Innovations need to adapt and in a way that doesn't like stifle the growth but at the same time protect investors from toxic products that I'll use the word James word I'll use a word that James used that could potentially steamroll an investor with an asymmetric negative payoff and but beyond this sort of democratization of access I feel like on-chain Structured Products have this significant Advantage potentially in the future I'm not saying now I don't even know if there's demand for it now but um you know I used to work on a desk that issued Structured Products in the equity ball away so it in the equity Vault world so I'm very well aware how much of an immense pain in the ass that it can be right like from from set managing settlements subscriptions redemptions and you know additionally there's certain there's certainly benefits around you know on-chain collateral management and reducing counterparty risk and you know potential contagion situations like we had last year where the default of one counterparty just triggers this chain reaction of defaults so like how do you see the world of structure products and not only just like in crypto but even just like more generally like evolving in the future to perhaps more of an on-chain world yeah has a lot to unpack there um you know I think I'd break it down this way I think you know one of the reasons why I got into this space is for the technology right not basically the hype it was really the technology and I've always been extremely curious about technology all throughout my career and when I looked at you know blockchain and Technology of what can actually help accomplish on the settlement process and the actual workflows of a structured product that becomes really exciting there's no question um you know I think that uh the whole democratizing access and running everything through vaults is where you know that that's kind of the sexy narrative in my opinion um to your point it's not there I mean I keep looking at DFI option vaults and you know I think if we were relegated to just trading there or it would be it would be value destruction to be quite succinct um there just isn't the depth and I think that the Market making community in this space you know it has some serious growing up to do I think that spreads are just way too wide and and uh we're starting to see a few more thoughtful sort of market makers coming in um which is awesome but I mean it is a great world where you know someone can connect their wallet to some particular site and actually invest in something that's a little bit more user interactive and and that you know as an example we've built the technology for for a defy um product platform um that allows users to actually subscribe and some data we haven't gone live in the in the in the sole reason is because a we need a partner to go live with um there's just way too much regulatory here like it simply stated and and um you know the one thing I'll mention is that we don't face clients directly we work with distribution Partners they're doing all the onboarding the AML kyc um you know and and um we're basically providing the technology providing the models and um we're providing the exposure for them on the underlying through a separate entity of ours um that's acting as a liquidity provider and sort of Market maker on behalf of product because at the end it's you know they can be quite tricky how is it uh James how is it actually packaged and and um distributed to an investor yeah so there's a couple different ways um there's um index products that are uh packaged up in a an investment form called a contract I guess it's akin to a certificate um in the UK and um there's several reasons why we've elected to go that route um and um the yield programs that that are being offered are structured as partnership units so limited partnership units um out of a partnered um issuer in in the US called Signature okay interested and presumably and presumably institutionally focused yes yeah you know the the whole goal to Market has to be the credit investor space just you know I mean you're not going to get this over the line from a retail perspective zero chance I mean it's hard enough to get traditional structured product over the line for retail I mean the amount of kyc obligations posed on broker dealers and you know the the gamut of of sort of regulatory here is huge just on that right aloud in cryptos it's it's tough yeah baby steps well I I think we we all hope we'll we'll certainly get there eventually and you know things certainly you know in the US are kind of going the opposite direction but there's there's certainly uh you know Tailwinds in other areas whether that's you know in the Middle East or you know big news out of Hong Kong or like you know CCTV you know talking about crypto um on you know on National Television literally yesterday right so you know that pendulum is start kind of starting to swing you know a bit more towards the east towards the east and you know if the US doesn't want it then you know the East will will kind of take advantage of that opportunity but uh yeah I think um it's a good time to kind of segue into a little bit more of like a macro discussion let me just share my screen here just while you're doing that I wouldn't want to say one thing I mean I think one of the biggest issues playing you know this segment is is the element of trust right and at the end of it all you know we talked about the very beginning of what we're trying to control for we're coming up with these these programs you know one of the biggest ones as I mentioned the smart contract risk so you know the issuer um effectively does not launch any of the collateral with any of the exchanges they're actually it's all delegated and um you know it was a decision made early on just for that fact I mean it's just there's so much angst if you will moving collateral Brown even on a defy option platform I mean there's no insurance there's no nothing and you know I think it's it's just like you so you're asking me to take a sleep of faith and just go and leave everything with you and and hold another FTX tobacco doesn't unfold or you know one of these other males if you will so that's where everything has been warehoused um on the custodial platform and you know it's it's worked well with us and and um you know we've we've used that facility to trade with Paradigm which you know has worked out extremely well and um yeah I think trust is a is a big issue right now for a more institutional adoption that's for sure oh yeah absolutely and I I will even say you know obviously the the volumes as we've we discussed kind of fell off a cliff in the aftermath of FTX you know we're kind of we're at like Peak fear in terms of leaving money on exchanges and you know certainly we saw a little bit of that institutional Interest come back you know as we have the spot rally and quite frankly we got lucky and you know like if we were living in in a world in January where we were just shopping range bound kind of like we are now then you know the momentum could have really really continued to be slow into the into the start of the year but we we still hear conversations like this all the time where it's just like look I mean a lot of these exchanges you know quite frankly are you know Financial black boxes where like you you have no ability to trust you know with a high level of certainty um or probability that your funds are going to be safe and of course you know the counter argument oh go trade on CME but I think the elephant in the room is that the CME margin requirements are pretty prohibitive you know to be able to do things like that so it's not always easy well they're prohibited and then the prime broker is basically putting a haircut on top of that as an addition right exactly um okay awesome let me share my screen let me share my screen quickly all right David your time to shine here like in terms of like the macrobium and this was a this was an interesting chart that I saw on um crypto banter uh you know very popular crypto podcast and one of the indicators that they like to really look at in terms of a long-term moving average is this 200 week you know moving average you look at this chart it doesn't look great to me dude right so kind of like in this pretty nasty like Head and Shoulders pattern we're we're right on top of like the 200 week moving average and there's a pretty substantial Gap to be filled here you know if some of uh you know these bearish sort of narratives do come to play like like the ones you've been talking about around like the debt ceiling so I'd be curious to kind of hear your view like you know is there potential we do fill this Gap lower and if so what are the drivers or do you think we you know potentially bounce off of this yeah um I mean I think I wrote in the macro pulse on the weekend and we discussed a little bit last week um about this negative Dynamic that's been forming um again kind of sort of very generic sort of framework that I look at um in terms of what drives crypto and and sort of uh rates dollar liquidity a three sort of massive parts of that framework and all of those things at the moment are working against um against crypto um now obviously at the heart of it is is this debt ceiling drama and what's going on there um and you're seeing you've seen front-end yields sort of Spike pretty aggressively um you're starting to see the dollar um sort of move higher you know we've had that nice Tailwind of the dollar sort of coming lower for for a while and and we're seeing that reverse um and then there's the anticipation of this huge liquidity drain um that's going to come when assuming when the debt ceiling gets lifted um So within the within the treasury's plans to sort of build back the uh the the the general account the treasury general account which is essentially their checking account at the FED um they're looking to rebuild that up to 500 billion um by the end of June assuming we get the debt ceiling lift so bear in mind they're kind of running it down to zero at the moment I forget where the latest number is um I think it's 70 odd 70 odd billion um and they're spending you know they're going through that like water at the moment um you know potentially they're going to come and issue 500 billion within a few weeks and that's just a suck of liquidity out of the market and um as we said before like Bitcoin is is liquidity junkie on the bottom is just going to continue moving lower you think yeah yeah so that that line there that's the global net liquidity um so obviously the the U.S liquidity and largely driven by the FED is is a huge sort of part of of global liquidity certainly given the Dollar's role in in the global economy um but that global net liquidity there is looking at essentially fed um pboc uh Bank of Japan uh ECB Bank of England so it's kind of looking at a global liquidity measure um and this offsets was going on in the US um you know you've got the pboc they've slowed down a little bit but but injecting liquidity um you got a bank of Japan still in QE mode um so so their balance sheets expanding obviously ECB type name feder tightening but actually what's quite interesting on the FED side um you've actually seen an expansion of uh US dollar liquidity over the last few weeks because it to think of U.S liquidity essentially you've got it's a function of the FED balance sheet so obviously expanding more liquidity Contracting less liquidity right now that's in contraction mode because because of this quantitative tightening we actually saw around um the blow up of SBB um and the banks we actually saw that expand like 400 billion in the space of a couple of weeks uh we're now back sort of um giving some of that back and Contracting QT however there's offsets to that liquidity and it comes in the form of the the treasury general account which I mentioned as well as the reserve repo facility at the FED um So currently the drawdown on the treasury general account where where the FED uh where the treasury are basically using the cash they've already got um at the FED to to sort of use and spend into the economy that drawdown is outpacing the the current sort of quantitative tightening so dollar liquid as he's actually been easing which I kind of think why Bitcoin still still kind of being a little bit rangey and not doing too much you can see on that chart Global liquidity is kind of rolling over the concern when you get the debt ceiling lift is that you've got quantitative tightening alongside a rebuild of the treasury general account which then actually um is going to be be working kind of alongside the QT and you're going to have this huge huge tightening of liquidity and you're going to see that that line there on the bottom bottom uh panel you got to see that start to sharply drop and you can see like just just even just eyeballing that just the correlation in terms of directionally as liquidity rolls over then bitcoin's gonna roll over so I I think I think there's a pretty sort of concern in development on the liquidity front I think we're starting to anticipate that I I actually think we're being held up a little bit by a broader risk um and you know it's like Boomers have discovered AI all of a sudden and a kind of all earnings were insane right yeah yeah I mean I mean there's there's good reasons to um you know to to kind of be bullish on certainly on tech stocks and and like the productivity gains that that AI is going to bring I mean it's just funny to me that you know this has been around for a while and it's like all of a sudden the pennies dropped um so so I kind of think actually the performance of nasdaq's probably kept us sort of pinned up you started to see that everything looked like really shaky yesterday uh before you you got those um uh video results come out um so yeah I I think we're in a really concerning Dynamic right now everything I'm looking at um that's been really positive and actually had a sort of bullish on crypto from what like end of November early December when we started to uh to sort of say the bottom was in for this Market I still I still think the bottoms in in terms of what we've seen over the past year we're not going back to that and I'm actually medium term pretty constructive um for crypto because of this changing Dynamic I still think we're sort of peak rates Peak fed Peak inflation um and that's going to be a supportive Tailwind but we are about to ride into a storm um and a liquidity storm as as that that scene gets lifted and liquidity gets sucked out of of our markets um and the other thing as well that's concerned me so a big part of kind of I guess liquidity is the dollar so um a stronger dollar we call it the dollar wrecking ball that that tends to sort of strangle assets and Global growth um as I say we're starting to see the dollar bounce um yeah I that chart there you see um that's uh Bitcoin against the the uh the dxy inverted um so actually I mean God if you looked at that it suggests we can go down to what 23k in Bitcoin um so I I kind of yeah you know see how these uh see how that Dynamic continues what's worrying for me on that is I've been writing about China and the importance of China um and and dollar China's sort of starting to to creep up um we broke through that psychological seven level um and I think we hit new hires today above 708 um the problem with that is uh the pboc will look to smooth uh currency volatility and they'll do it by selling dollar China but then they'll then recycle those dollars that they've sold um to rebalance across their FX reserves so which means buying dollars back against Euro Sterling Aussie Yen and what have you so it becomes like this constant even though they're selling dollar China they're then buying dollars across all the other currencies so actually you kind of get this Vicious Circle if you like of of sort of dollar buying that's coming out of China and then you can see you know that's typically negative for for Bitcoin um so yeah so we've got a few things that I I think look concerning at the moment um I think we're going to test lower um I actually stocks as well will be sort of more challenged because I I think they're fundamentally a liquidity play so so yeah I think we're um we're selling out for a tricky um a tricky few weeks at least now there are there are there are some offsets yeah when you're in the air how low do we go I mean obviously the technical setup's not good you know we know the deck price uh debt ceiling um thing is going to go to the 11th hour right yeah yeah given but then most likely you know they're obviously gonna they're gonna push it through and then you're gonna have all these treasuries come come to Market which is going to drain the liquidity right how how low can we potentially go here yeah like I mean by 20 25k right is gonna be like psychologically just just we you know we all kind of like roundish numbers right um yeah I think you test that and then then you'll be there'll be stops triggered through that um I mean I still don't think positioning um I mean we've seen volumes sort of decline hugely um across exchanges so I don't think positioning is particularly large to cause this huge you know liquidity Cascade and as we sort of trip levels but certainly like momentum funds will jump on those moves but yeah I I'd sort of look at you know 23k type levels um now again this is all things equal there there are some offsets to that you've got you've got uh Hong Kong's about to come live in in uh on the first of June um and obviously we mentioned earlier about um sort of sounds like China and it's sort of pivoting more towards sort of crypto so so you you've got you've got a potential wind flow sort of coming from from uh Hong Kong um and then also it I mean it could well be that we sort of go into this you know sell the rumor buying a fact type thing on on the anticipation and liquidity drain there's also offsets as well so if the feds start issuing uh tea bills we've got about two trillion dollars that gets parked at the FED every night in the RRP that potentially gets teased out and starts to go and fund that and actually then the the net impact on liquidity is minimal so there are there are sort of potential offsets the other thing as well is I I still feel um I still think we've got issues in in the bank sector um you know pacques selling selling off some of its um some of its loans um you know saw a nice bounce but but also it kind of speaks to the fact that they're still having problems um you're still seeing uh funds uh deposits leave Banks and sort of flow into money markets so I still think we're going to have some issues in the banking sector um JP Morgan can't buy everyone um so so yes Jamie Diamond saying no um but maybe that is opening opening uh Gambit um as he yeah so so James is is David um making you scared to solve all here okay what do you what do you what do you think like you do you think um um in terms of like your sort of like short term to medium-term Outlook in the space yeah I think it's a tough it's a tough market right now to solve all of it right I mean we've seen a mall crush and you know at least from my limited uh experience in in this space I would suggest that we're in uncharted waters right now in terms of where we are realized and implied so I mean what's if you're a betting person what are you going to bet lower or higher law I mean I think the money accrues to to a spike involved for sure we were you know just for contacts I mean malls kept us out this week um and sometimes you just gotta go with it you know and and um you know it's gonna end up probably being a very muted week in terms of range but you just not getting rewarded for the rest right now so it doesn't make a ton of sense yeah my main takeaway when I heard David talks just now was uh literally you should buy a one week but I mean I I think that was that was my main takeaway right because I mean that it's such a low low cost right so it might as well yeah yeah no I mean yeah we spoke about that as well last week right on on the podcast um yeah it makes sense again like timing these things is difficult the the other thing as well is like there's and certainly when I speak to clients um I think there's a huge lack of conviction out there at the moment generally I think this uncertainty around the debt ceiling people not sure how you play that um I I say I I sort of feel feel quite bearish probably for the first time this year on on crypto just given these Dynamics again just we always thought it was the permeable yeah yeah can you just crank this guy is literally always bullish but now allowed to hear that you actually are bearish is refreshing yeah I mean well no this is very scary right I mean my immediate reaction was wait David's bearish oh I should go buy something is saying to stay out of the market don't start the ball I'm like oh I'm definitely need to buy some puts now yeah well it's it I mean we write the macro pulse right to to kind of keep her a little sort of sort of finger on the macro pulse um of how things are developing and and oh yeah those things have just been been feeding beautifully right you've had dollar coming lower sort of yields drifting lower liquidity sort of improving so again like that's kind of how I look at the world um you know risk trading pretty well uh Market under positioned um so I I found it strange that you know coming into the year people were so bearish um you know when it's kind of you know what what framework do you use to to sort of support that um but yeah but now look the when the when the when the facts change uh you know I changed my opinions there um but yeah so I guess the big question now is is was this whole thing just a bear Market Rally or like where okay well we have that pull back and you are more medium-term constructive yeah yeah like I I think I think these Dynamics are short-term um like I mean I'm I'm super bullish like medium term like duration um like long duration so like I think this is all in anticipation of like increased issuance and stuff like that because actually the economic side of things um the hello hello inflation's not falling as fast as the FED would like it's certainly going that way and in fact actually true flation uh which I like to look at which is the the um sort of real-time on-chain measure of inflation uh dropped below three percent this week for the first time I think went to like to 298 so yeah uh no no we've got other problems um yeah we yeah we're we're battling our own problems but um yeah but like like I think the FED are winning that that um that fight against inflation in fact I I think um I actually think that well I think they've overdone it um I think you're going to find inflation comes much more quickly uh lower than what what people expect and what the FED expects um you know I people forget that that monetary policy the transmission of monetary policy tends to act like a 12-month lag and we we were barely into this hike cycle 12 months ago and it was it was sharp and it was aggressive so you're gonna start to see that feed through um pretty pretty uh abruptly I guess over the next few months and then on top of that they are on top of that you've had this banking crisis and and the the implied sort of credit crunch which is coming and we're seeing that which is hugely disinflationary so I I do I do think the FED will be back into easy mode probably by year end um and actually think things will look look uh sort of quite different so so that that kind of dynamic it's a completely different macro environment what we what we had to endure last year um inflation we last year we had inflation at double digits um you had the FED pursuing this we've got the sharpest tightening cycle arguably in history um now now we're kind of reaching the pause um I do think Cuts will follow I think the feds still want the optionality for their credibility to to maybe hike but I don't think we're seeing any more hikes um so we've got an easier rate environment inflation's coming coming lower um so so yeah I I still think um we're going to finish the year um significantly higher and maybe as well you know how these things work maybe this is like the the kind of final ShakeOut and dip before we then really really sort of power through and take out those highs around 31 32k um and then we have a really good run into year end awesome well I think that's uh you know on those positive notes this is a good place to kind of end it yeah I'm out a little bit depressed earlier but yeah I'm out I'm out tonight Jay with some with some crypto people say I don't want them not buying me
