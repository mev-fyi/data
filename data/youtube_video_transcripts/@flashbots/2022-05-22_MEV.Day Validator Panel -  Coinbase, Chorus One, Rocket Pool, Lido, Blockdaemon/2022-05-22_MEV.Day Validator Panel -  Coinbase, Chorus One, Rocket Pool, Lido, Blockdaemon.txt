[Music] all right so thank you everybody for coming this is the validator panel and we have an incredible group of panelists representing a huge part of the industry here so i'm super excited first we're going to have everybody introduce themselves really quickly we only have 25 minutes there's a lot of very fun and spicy questions so let's go look at the introductions my name is victor bunyan i am the protocol operations lead at coinbase cloud hey everyone my name is izzy and i'm master of validators with lido hey i'm felix sludge i'm the chief commercial officer at chorus one and i am darren langley i am the general manager of rocketpool hi i'm libati torres and i'm a research engineer at block daemon amazing thanks and could you guys tell us a little bit about your work with mev to date okay um so obviously from the perspective of lido we are a cross chain liquid sticking protocol with our headquarters on ethereum um the question of mev uh how are node operators and validators going to extract it and how will they share it with their stakers basically the the customers of lido as a protocol is one of the big questions concerning us post merge right now we're not actively doing anything with it because as far as i know at least there's no imev on the beacon chain yet um although you know who knows what's going to be going on with at the station aggregations in the future but our worries right now are figuring out like the the problem set and the full scope of what kind of mav activities might there be and how we will organize around the extraction of these uh rewards basically and redistribute them to our users so we're focusing on technical specifications right now and then also reaching out to the community uh both from a lighter perspective and a general ethereum perspective to kind of understand the bounds of what makes sense how can we do any mev extraction in an open and transparent manner and ensure that we're looking after the health of the ecosystem with whatever uh like set of actions we decide to go forward with yeah i think for power and so chorus one is a multi-chain node operator so we operate nodes on different networks and um we so far have mostly kind of taken a kind of first research approach so internally we have like a lot of discussions what should we do with mev we have also for example participate in the flashbacks working group and we are kind of spending research resources so we have a pretty big research team and are looking at you know what is actually happening on these networks first so i guess ethereum is the biggest ecosystem of mev right now and there's flashbacks there's a lot of organizations working on this but for us as we are on other chains of cosmos and solana for example we're trying to like focus our research on these chains first but also see like is there already like things happening on these chains so one one of the things we're doing is we've done some research on sandwiching on solana which we will release soon where we're basically looking at um you know has this happened on solana and how what percentage of the dex transactions are actually like surrounded basically and we have basically found that this is like very little yet because maybe also there's like missing fee mark and stuff on soda but um so that's kind of our approach research first and then figuring out where we're at what we should what's the like most best way to engage with the the topic yeah so rocketpool is a decentralized staking protocol um so we have a thousand over a thousand uh permissionless individual node operators um running on the beacon chain today um so we are very interested in pretty much the same thing as izzy um sharing that mev um with our pool so node operators actually have half of the collateral and our pool supplies the other half and so we need to make sure that that is split kind of evenly with them and making sure that our node operators obviously have a great staking experience and they get kind of get the most out of it as well from our perspective the health of ethereum is the utmost uh principle that we hold most here and so uh that is certainly something that we're very very interested in and that's why we joined the flashbox working group uh to make sure that uh the design is as decentralized as possible and fits within our kind of core tenants that's me hi so i'm one of the lead researchers assigned to mev and for those of you that don't know block damon we have a lot of responsibility right now i'm currently powering 36 000 nodes and have 11 billion staked across 50 different protocols so while this does affect our ethereum clients it also affects our clients on other chains as you're aware crosstrain mvv is a big deal that's why we have dedicated resources we've joined the flash box working group and we're really focused on transparency and ensuring fairness across trains so we're we're big on the space we're here to learn today we've got representation in the crowd as well and uh we really want to find out what the best solution is for our clients like do we do we let them choose do we just force them into this so i'm happy to talk about this today amazing amazing i also didn't realize i didn't share anything about coinbase cloud uh [Laughter] we are also uh an infrastructure operator uh typical yeah i've been around since 2018 uh run over 60 000 nodes at this point across many different protocols but um super glad to have all of you guys here i think the first question is we have like a really wide mix of you know quote unquote customers or users ranging from enterprise to at home stakers to data analytics companies and so on um we'd love to learn about like what do your customers think about me feel about meh what questions are they asking you like what positions are they taking or are asking you to take anything you share that would be amazing okay so from our perspective like the largest segment of our customers are basically like retail stakers or really large uh stakers in the form of whales um and generally their question around mev and mev rewards is how can i get a piece of that now what we need to do is like balance this desire basically in order to participate in this externality that exists on these kinds of blockchains with the possible security implications or the like negative some implications with regards to like what happens on the other end of of an mev transaction and you know like who's actually losing value when that happens um so understanding not only the desire for users of of the network like users of ethereum um to be protected against certain kinds of mav but also the desire for people who are contributing to the security of the network via liquid staking to be able to participate in those rewards yeah it's a very good question i think still for many people it's not like the core topic that they want to discuss i think many know it's coming uh and kind of expect probably us to to use some kind of software like flashbots and share the rewards obviously i think that's probably going to be the common theme i think there's also like many different kinds of customers nowadays also like for example lido is in in some way we're a customer of lydo and they contribute steak to us the dao so we're obviously also like trying to yeah align with what what do you want what the network wants what our team thinks is the right way so like there's a lot of like interaction with that and i also think yeah larger institutional clients maybe they they also have a similar kind of idea of what they want to do and then we basically just yeah provide the service to them it can take that dimension for like some others maybe we can try to like engage community that's our goal with the research also to like build a dialogue and find out what our users want i think depending on the protocol maybe there can also be like a choice that we provide to to the users or different things i think there's gonna be like a lot of innovation in the future and yeah looking forward to that uh so from rocketpool's perspective uh we have liquid stakers because we have a liquid staking token and we have node operators uh both of those are exactly the same uh they they would like their yield to go up so it is a it is definitely a balance the the good thing about i guess our community is they are very savvy they they come to rocket pool generally because they uh care about ethereum ethereum's health and so that transparency on and how we're going to support it what we will and won't accept and all that sort of thing is is very very important yeah and for us at blockchain i'd say being so large we have clients all over the spectrum so we have like our heavy hitters our giganerds who are like all for it and like yeah let's enable me boost and do all the things and then we have our clients that are like meth what like what do you pairs a side dish with that and so you know it's it's a little hard because it's our job to kind of chaperone them into this space uh in a in a fair way in a clear way and gently guide them towards the light and say okay so this is what's happening and these are the stakes and we believe that it's important to be transparent with everybody so if does everybody want a piece of this or no and we're kind of discussing internally like do we allow it by default or do we let them choose and how do we let them choose when they don't even know really what it is so yeah totally and i think it's such a running theme i mean so when i worked with um daniel and steph to start the youth to like the flashbacks e2 working group one of the core reasons behind it was the educational component which is that as infrastructure providers like we need to have an opinion first uh just because we're the ones like super in the weeds doing the research and due diligence and then as we're having these conversations with with customers of all various types it's like you know we have to be the educational resource to help them make good decisions but also we have to understand all the nuances behind all these decisions in order to make sure that the decisions that are made are something that we're comfortable with right and that don't harm the network and continue to be good actors so thank you guys so much for your insights um so post-merge when validators begin to participate in mev do you think that mev will make homestaking more or less viable and why any order yeah yeah uh so we we've got a lot of home stakers um so the majority of our node operators in fact i think well the majority of them are home stakers um uh what i'm hoping which is really the reason why it would join the flashwatch working group is um flashbot's mission to democratize mev that's the only way that this is going to work because everybody has to have access everyone has to have access to ethereum staking that's what we believe and everyone has to have access to mev to maximize those opportunities for themselves and to compete with larger operators so we are we're also doing like a med smoothing solution and so that again so that home stakers can compete with the larger operators so that they get a consistent return and they don't have to um because they're proposing less blocks it's very variable their returns and so a smoothing pool actually smooths that out and gives them a constant return so yeah we're very uh we're building out that sort of thing to make sure that mev uh isn't a centralizing factor or you know it makes them competitive anybody else want to comment and if not i have a follow up yeah so i'd also be super curious you know earlier today with with hasu and robert and other folks you know one of the topics that keeps coming up is around how there's a centralizing force for you to desire you know as a validator operator to desire to be on multiple networks and capture you know cross-chain mev and so how do you think about you know enabling um home stakers to remain competitive in a world that continues to centralize around having you know single infrastructure provider providers across multiple chains yeah i i think the the thing with mev is mev is um is bad it can be bad uh but in a centralized world it's extremely bad uh in a decentralized world it's less bad so the the idea there is to increase participation the more participation you get in uh proof of stake the the more uh the long tail then the less issues you have and so it's really important to have that operational decentralization um and control influence control as well and to make sure that that doesn't happen because mev in a centralized world is an absolutely terrible place whereas mev in a decentralized place is probably bearable yeah fair very fair um yeah please yeah so i think the other ways to do that are to try to like minimize the the problem space right so cross chain mev is currently possible because most of the transactions are like in public public mempools not encrypted et cetera so once we see the advent of things like proposal builder separation or at least relayer sending node operators fully encrypted blocks that they can't see until you know after the next block i think the incidence of crash and mav is going to go down and then the other thing that we can think about is liquid-sticking protocols and node operators that reach across multiple networks whether they can put into place like policies let's say or strategies that disincentivize this kind of behavior potentially so for example at lido like we're currently working on a way to propose a policy to the community and the dao and then the dao would basically like drive what that policy is with regards to how will node operators extract the move and then share those rewards with stakers but also if there's pieces of the policy like for example if you're operating a node for lydo you will not be building your own blocks during that proposal period you will only be obtaining blocks from an open builder marketplace and it's a lot more difficult for it's a lot easier for node operators to take advantage of the fact that they're on multiple networks and you know like have that shared information for then for a builder to do that across multiple networks super interesting that actually leads right right uh into my next question um and this predominantly for you know folks from you know izzy from lido um darren from rocketpool is when deciding how to participate in mev um how do you think about mandating all block producers in your ecosystem to adopt a single approach like flashbots versus leaving it to individual node operators so we have a probably a i guess a technical thing that we we have to go with a single approach not necessarily a single vendor so it might could be flashbacks and somebody else but we have to essentially whitelist who who they are the main thing about that is mev is quite pernicious in the sense that uh it's very difficult to track um whether somebody is getting side payments for um for it so they might produce they might produce a block um but they might have got us got an aside payment so the only way really we have we can do it is to white list block relays probably we'll see how that works but certainly relays to say did you propose that block and then we have crypto economic mechanisms to because we're commissioners um all of our node operators come to us and we can't control who they are so from our perspective we have to have crypto economic mechanisms to enforce that they do the right thing um and their incentives are aligned so in our case yeah we have to essentially ask the relayer you know did you did you propose that block if they didn't then we know we can punish them um otherwise we can't uh or whatsoever we shouldn't they we should reward them um but yeah so that's that's our approach they will be locked into particular approaches but they might not be locked into particular vendors yeah i fully agree with that it's a lot easier to verify that somebody has followed the correct approach rather than verifying that they didn't cheat um and from our perspective i i think it'll be similar there will be a couple of approaches that eventually that the dao will basically ratify that these approaches are okay um but we might be able to do like kind of experiments with regards to what approaches there are so obviously certain approaches might be like you know let's use mvv boost um let's use a certain white list of relayers that's maintained potentially by a third party or reviewed by the dao on a continuous basis um or if there's other competing solutions like maybe it's good if there's a marketplace of possible solutions but the other interesting thing is maybe we can do things where a certain percentage of validators are engaged in mbv minimization experiments so um there's a team called shutter i think that's like running an experiment on whether they can use commit reveal schemes like on gnosis chain perhaps we could run an experiment to see if that works on ethereum yeah super super interesting um i'd actually uh maybe a following question for felix you know you mentioned some of the work that you guys were doing on solana and the research around there um i'd be super curious to hear about you know what are you seeing from like the validator side around you know what other values are thinking how you know work is going in terms of mitigation in the salon ecosystem and what you guys are doing there yeah it's a very interesting topic i think um for one right the solana free market and everything's very different from the one in ethereum so it's also not that possible that easily to kind of build the same system that flashbots is building with the bundles and everything kind of even you have to build a fee mechanism first basically so right now i think there are a few teams working on this there's jito which we have been also close in touch with where they're basically trying to bring this bundles model to solana i think others are just um you know maybe not that aware of it yet too um and then there is for us it was more yeah it started coming up like later right obviously like ethereum d5 is probably like one year older and i guess it's kind of just a reflection of what happened on ethereum is probably going to have all these other chains that were like one stage earlier i would say and for us yeah it was more about like just researching first how is it actually looking right now what are the solutions and i think also solana foundation is doing a bunch of work to um yeah build like this free market out to improve the situation because obviously we know some of these the existence of mev and the non-existence of the free market have led to like kind of performance degradation aggregation on solana so i guess there is a need for a solution so obviously like there's going a lot of work going into that and we want to like contribute to that too to yeah improve the the chain in the end which is always the goal amazing amazing thanks so much for sharing and maybe lamar's if i can pass it over to you as well you guys do some great work within avalanche and other ecosystems as well as block daemon would love to hear about you know like what are you seeing from you know those ecosystems around mev either strategies or mitigations or how are people thinking about it and how is that compared to maybe some of the things you heard on stage right so i think the theme is the same across the board um we're all trying to figure that out and we're all trying to figure that out together and at block daemon you know we we understand that we're chain agnostic and so we're partnering with different foundations and different foundations do have different approaches right here we have flashbots with mev boost and that's an excellent idea but on avalanche we don't necessarily have an equivalent yet and so on other chains we're waiting on that guidance to see what is it that the foundations want first because at the end of the day it's their chains that they're building and then how can we at block daemon support that ecosystem and then think about it from a client perspective as well and then how can we provide maybe a solution for our clients if they do want to participate in meb in that specific chain so it's it's very complicated and that's why we have several engineers on meb because when you're doing this across 50 different protocols and granted it doesn't work on 50 different protocols but when we have such a large ecosystem here um there there's there's a lot of variations in how it happens across trains yeah yeah and you know we're definitely seeing that as well on the coinbase cloud side um so i you know one of the contestant themes that has been coming up is this notion of maybe like not so much that nobody wants to take the lead but people want to see what the community is rallying around around like design choices um around like how we should be implementing things like what we should be supporting um so this is maybe like a question that not everybody has a has a perfect answer to that is final but maybe you can just share how you're leaning um and so the question is how would you distribute your mev profits and so you know one of the you know is it something that's going to be kind of like pro rata so if you're charging a percentage fee let's say it's going to be the same percentage fee as well you're charging on you know the inflation rewards and transaction fees as one option or it could be something else as well yeah so at block payment sorry you guys were hogging this so i'm getting my time in while i still can um yeah so at blockchain we're discussing similar uh to the current pricing model which is we make our commission and what we'll do is we'll calculate the mav profits into our commission and we make that kind of frictionless for the customers and then they keep their rewards obviously but you know we we're operating on their behalf so it's pretty fair to the ecosystem again that is not final do not quote me ceo if you're watching i know we're we're still discussing uh so from rockable's perspective uh we're not going to do anything because we don't touch amyv but our node operators do so our node operators already um have a commission and half of their collateral is is actually so 16 eth is is their collateral for um that they use so and 16th is from our pool so essentially it's a 50 50 split but um the node operator gets a little bit more because they have um the commission so it kind of ends up being about you know 60 40 something like that um and you know that that will hold um going forward as well um so rocketpool we don't take anything but our node operators who are doing all the work they they get the commission um and the rest of it goes to our wreath holders who are liquid staking holders so it's essentially a 50-50 split yeah i guess yeah very interesting question right that's kind of the core of your business or how do you attract your delegators in the end also and i think mvv really opens up a new dimension of kind of pricing models in a way for validators or node operators which is quite interesting i think there's still a lot experimentation to do and like i think leaning towards that model yeah we share it the same way it's probably the right one but i could also see like i guess in cosmos there was a long time this like some people experimenting with zero fees first right like just go low and then later raise it and i i can see like there's going to be a lot of experimentation there maybe like some people will say you get all the mev but we charge a high commission on the inflationary rewards or like any kind of combination of that and i think that will also lead to like a more differentiated validator space which is uh then obviously also good so as for course one i guess we'll we'll figure out where we go there but probably will be like some kind of simple straightforward approach or if like a certain customer maybe wants something specific then we could accommodate that and work it out with them what they want to achieve for their users or um yeah so then we'll go with that yeah i think that makes sense um from a lighter perspective as well like this is going to be one of the things that comes out of whatever policy uh lido as a dow ends up having around mev i think the simplest approach both technically and from a ux perspective and ultimately that's what you want to do like give a simple product to the staker is pro rata fee similar to staking rewards the question is once we have permissionless node operators within lido as well what do you do when they start cheating the system um and what kind of disincentive disincentivization mechanisms will we have in place um to deal with that uh and like pernicious mev a weird mev that may be pushing reorgs and things like that so that's a separate like problem space that will probably address a bit later super interesting do uh any of you folks think about how you know mev profits that y'all so sorry we're leaning i keep we're also here um i think right now you know crevice cloud doesn't have an official policy but um you know i think the pro distribution makes the most sense you know you want to keep everybody aligned you want to continue being as fair as possible um you know one question i have for all of you is how do you think about the use of mev profits in public goods funding like is it something you folks have discussed whether it's part of your dowser communities or something like git bitcoin or something else um i think public goods funding is a fantastic idea um the problem that's holding us back is we live in a competitive landscape so uh if we if we did that um we might lose some of our competitive edge um so that is something that we have to be quite mindful of um but i i agree ideally we would put into some sort of public goods yeah i would say on a block demon's behalf we're huge on helping build the ecosystem so i'm not sure exactly what we would do for public goods but we have done stuff in the past like with the tara foundation they had given us a grant to start running some other nodes and validators and we were the you know one of the first people to help build that ecosystem and eventually we made a profit and you know we gave all the grant money back with the ethereum foundation we're giving uh cloud credits right now for them to test all of their stuff on their network and if we don't do something maybe for like a general public socioeconomic cause i'm sure that we'll still continue giving back to the different chains much in the way that we already have been doing yeah that's that's a great point um so a quick little time track we have 10 minutes left um and these next two questions are spicy so um as folks here know you know boost is going to be separating out the blog builders from blog proposers and so validators will be accepting blocks from a third party and without and proposing them without necessarily seeing the contents what are the criteria by which you're planning to select which blog builder you'd like to receive blocks from what other criteria would be going to be given by the relayers and the like whatever solution is is around at that time so like a lot of the specs aren't fully finished on this stuff right the easiest way to look at it is i guess like what's the total value of the block and what percentage of that value is going to be the mev reward attributable to it i don't think that's sustainable enough for as a long-term solution um i think especially when you consider like possible censorship attacks uh in the future even in like a post-relay model where you have pbs at the core layer um you we have to be able to ensure that somehow like these fully encrypted blocks aren't being used to either push transact transactions like later on into the future um or to censor participants and we're gonna need to have some sort of introspective ability either into the contents or have other attributes surfaced um next to the the encrypted payload to be able to make those decisions and kind of understand if the builder is being like a good builder or a bad builder yeah i think kind of similar right like in the end using this kind of tool like meth boost is kind of outsourcing that building to someone else in a way that we don't have to make the choice anymore which probably as we say like different areas of expertise maybe lay with different people or different actors so i guess in some sense that's what you're signing up for if you do that and then it's kind of on the protocol that does that building or that to figure that out in some way and i think we would obviously contribute to that if we use that and try to help them um i yeah i would guess that that is kind of where we go from because it's also very hard to judge like which is now good bad transaction if you're like trying to like build an infrastructure business so maybe that's not where you should focus on and like some other actor does that and then you kind of rely on them and you kind of support them i think that would be the the ideal model and obviously we dedicate a certain part of our research organization to also look into that but kind of it's probably not the core area i would almost say that that we have to make that call in a way yeah so i'll i'll save you here um so at blockchain our research team is trying to come up with what that criteria is going to be and we're leaning heavily on like flashbots and other foundations to kind of say what is the standard and you know look at look at what everybody else in the community is doing um it's it's difficult to in our position because we do have a lot of institutional clients and the needs not only from the chains are different but the needs from the clients are different so variables to like the nth degree and complication uh times all of these variables to like the nth degree and you know there's there's all these different variations uh that we have to consider but definitely on ethereum specifically i do like the idea of med boost and i do like where the flashbox research kind of standard is going yeah with rocketpool we're very um we're acutely aware of the health of ethereum because that's kind of where we come from and some sort of feedback loop on actions taken by builders and the ramifications on ethereum that's kind of what we need is we do we need that feedback loop we need that transparency um a categorization of of med is quite difficult because there isn't necess sometimes sometimes there's bad mev sometimes there's good mvv and but most of it sits in this kind of gray area in the middle so it's it's very difficult to kind of categorize and say this is good this is bad um but we do need some sort of feedback loop and to make sure that we are heading in the right direction and that we are not using builders that are putting putting ethereum at risk um also builder centralization is going to be a huge issue uh that that's one of our kind of top concerns builders build a centralization or how that market is built is going to be very very important going forward so how do we yeah how can we dissipate um the builder market is going to be really important i'm excited to see what's going to happen though like i feel like all of us here are speculating kind of guessing and um at the end of the day nobody really knows for sure we don't have a magic ball but i'm hoping that whatever direction we lean towards works because that's really the fundamental issue here yeah and and i think maybe that goes into um a little follow-on so lamar's i'll ask you but just as much applies probably to to felix and me um but you know you have a lot of black diamond has a lot of enterprise clients right one of them is jp morgan chase and you know kind of like what happens when jpmorgan comes along and says hi we'd like to exert control or is there some sort of censorship or you know have some kind of criteria by which we're you know participating in these ecosystems and producing blocks it's like how do you think about the trade-offs there between you know enabling some amount or potentially like considering enabling some amount of censorship versus serving your clients versus serving the protocol like it's a complicated set of trade-offs i'd love your take on it yeah so i'm gonna say that that is above my pay grade and that is definitely not a decision to make but our approach will definitely at the end of the day we only exist because of our customers right and i feel like a lot of the community here tries to make tradify the bad guy and traffic is not the bad guy you realize we literally all win like if tradfi buys millions of ethereum like we literally all win um so you know we we're going to help our clients we tradfi does have you know a little bit of friction here and i know that we like to make it degens versus chads and everything but i don't necessarily think it has to be that way i think decentralization the whole point is to make room for everybody and for you know allowing growth for all the players so while it is a worry personally that i have that all this big money is coming in and you know shout out to all the hedge funds in the crowd um bain capital i see you uh but um you know i i am worried about where this is gonna go and what direction this is gonna take us but someone internally will make that call yeah what about you at coinbase first first i'll go i'll go i'll go if you feel like you want to go first or yeah i can go coinbase last best for last um i think yeah i mean in the end i think it's a lot about educating the our clients so our approach has always been we understand these networks very well and we work with them to achieve their goal and their success and and we know what's best for the health of the network because we're so deep in that and i think if they would come and say like you know you have to like sandwich everyone obviously that makes the chain like shitty and then we would say you know like then your tokens going down you know you should probably invest in the health of that and kind of support a more sustainable like model ultimately i think i we would like advocate for that though of course there is certainly a force that would be like you know maybe you lose the client and you have to like kind of balance that but i think also in general i guess our clients would value that about us so we would like lean on that and try to like work that out so i would guess that's our approach what about you coinbase what are you telling your clients don't worry dory i'm going next um yeah you know i i do agree this is definitely like a very difficult question i think that you know one of the ways in which we see ourselves as a coinbase cloud is that like if you if you think about kind of like layers of the stack then like the higher up the stack that you go the more opinionated you become right so if you're like a social media company versus like a cloud flare right and we think of of ourselves is very very low in the sag and so we try to be unopinionated and so we essentially have a different choice around what we do for our own infrastructure right so the coinbase cloud brand and validators that we run versus you know our customers nodes where our customers have full control over what they do with them right we're like we're just providing the infrastructure and so i don't have you know a perfect answer either i don't think way above my pay grade for sure um but i think what i will say is that you know one of the things we take a lot of pride in is you know educating the people that we work that we work with and support right educating our customers and being a resource for them we have a team of protocol specialists that specialize in empowering our our customers with that information and so what we try to do is always bring it back to the holistic picture around like what is you know long-term healthy food network and it's you know as she said like if you're running you know if you have a lot of ether you're running a lot of validators or any other network you want it to be successful long-term and so we help them formulate strategies around how to ensure that yeah that's why victor and i we're friends it's community not competition we call it co-op petition yeah yeah so i think here actually like this is at all of our pay grades and by that i don't mean like us specifically that you know who work with staking or validators or node operators but every participant in the ethereum ecosystem so our job like felix said earlier is to use the deep knowledge that we have in this space to educate every current participant and future participant about the possible pernicious effects and consequences of what happens when these things centralize what happens when we open the doors to possible censorship so that all users as stewards of this network would make these kinds of choices by large investors in the network by governments an untenable proposition so we need to keep doing things like this which is talking about them in the open providing like educational efforts like mov is great yeah because rewards are going to go up but here's the other side of it um and making sure that users are making informed decisions for the long-term health of
