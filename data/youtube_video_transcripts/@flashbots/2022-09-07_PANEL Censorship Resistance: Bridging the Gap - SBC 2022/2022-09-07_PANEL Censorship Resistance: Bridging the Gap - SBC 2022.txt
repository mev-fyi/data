welcome to the censorship resistance panel we can start with some brief formalities of like a quick intro of everyone and like what are you working on these days and how do you think about censorship resistance in your daily life maybe starting from from that side of the panel hi um i'm zucky i've been working on uh proof of stake technologies and tendermint and tendermint comes up a lot in uh censorship resistance because like uh it's a toolkit for building sort of uh uh bft systems and so like if you want to do like mempool encryption you can build like a uh uh threshold decryption gadget on top of tendermint um and the tendermint core dev team of which i am sort of impart of uh we have this thing called the tendermint council now uh is working on like new features for tenement to make this stuff easier um we are also redoing atom tokenomics and including a lot of meb in that we have sort of been building out cosmos as like an mev battleground lately in general and we have been worrying a lot about the censorship resistance problem uh in in the cosmos ecosystem in addition to talking to people in like flashbacks and uh shutter who is also using tendermint for evm and eat like censorship resistance stuff so you know this is just kind of like where i exist in the ecosystem hi i'm francesco i work at the in the ethereum adidas foundation in research um at the moment i'm not really focusing so much on censorship resistance though i did at some point last year um but i'm mostly working on four choice which i mean in some sense it's really related to censorship resistance but yeah at the moment that's that's not really my focus hey everyone i'm phil i am a phd student at cornell and co-founder of flashbots and i work on mev and uh censorship resistance xmev is hopefully a spicy thing as we'll explore in this panel um so mostly concerned about the centralizing effects of med and the the resulting effects on the rest of the network i'm metallic from the ethereum project and so you know i've also done some work on censorship resistance in the context of the ethereum protocol and the application lab yeah justin from the film foundation um i've been like deep diving sensitive resistance in the last few weeks and basically you know came out extremely optimistic you know usually when when when i when i do research i i noticed this this this fat curve where you know for a long time people just ignore topic and then suddenly like suddenly very important and we it requires a lot of our attention and um you know i think if maybe a few days ago was peak fudd and now you know i'm optimistic that uh we have we have you know very good long-term fundamentals and just through education and we can just uh bring this curve down down to the fundamentals all right amazing so we can ask a bunch of like more boring questions which maybe we'll get to later if we run out of steam but maybe let's start with a spicy one um so do we want full censorship resistance in the systems we're building and if so in your opinion why or or why not yes we do [Laughter] [Applause] and i guess the reason is that if we if we don't then you know we'd be um you know under some sort of influence of a of a sensor and then the question is who who would the sensor be and it turns out that um you know because weak censorship is solved with pure technology you know we only need to focus on strong censorship and strong censorship effectively is this these 51 attacks and we need to ask ourselves who can even pull off these 51 attacks who can even do the censorship and it turns out that it is effectively just only nation states okay maybe elon musk can pull it off um but let's let's let's say it's nation states uh or elon musk um then we basically become ilan chain or we become u.s chain or we become china chain or eu chain and and and this is not what we want to what not what we want to what not it would be um you know we lose a lot of of properties like we lose permissionlessness right because now we need to ask the u.s permission or ask elon his permission um we also lose world war three resistance right because it is kind of a the fact that we're being censored is is the fact that we're being on permanently being 51 attacked and so if if robots we were to break then the the 51 attacker could do things all sorts of other things other than censorship um and you know we also lose uh you know credible we lose the ability to to gain monetary premium because now when our bill ether the asset becomes like u.s ether and you know we want to be building this this this this global settlement layer for the whole internet of value not not just u.s ether so i guess the answer is is yeah we definitely do want strong censorship resistance so i guess my take would be it's not important or it's not essential that all parts of the system be censorship resistant so like in the sort of you know multi-chain inter-chain world like you can have chains that perhaps are not censorship-resistant but are still useful um and like you can have like the usa-centered roll-up um like the ofac compliant roll-up um but like uh if for ethereum to fulfill its vision uh uh ethereum's base layer must be censorship resistance um in sort of the cosmos world we sort of think about i think a lot about how we can have some chains that are strongly censorship-resistant and other chains that are not um and we that they can interoperate and like we can accommodate that world yeah i think my take is similar like i think and not every application on the application layer like should even should be infinitely censorship resistant and i think uh you know there are some cases where like you know the the thing that sort of the uh the professional blabbers call regulation at the edges like actually can work and actually can be incentive compatible right like if someone does come up with a way to make some tornado cash-like thing that excludes billion-dollar hackers then like regular people have a greater interest in uh using it because you know they don't want to be mistaken for the billion dollar hacker right and so i think people even underestimate the extents to which that sort of stuff can happen um but the reason why it's just absolutely important to have a red line for and of the core protocol to be censorship resistant is because that is a yeah like the ability for transactions to get inc to get included just as a core property of the protocol its core so it's a credible neutrality um and the entire function of the blockchain i think is to kind of be a shared um base layer between people who do not um agree on like a lot of what those other ground groundwaters are and so like in order for that to even work at all and the kind of the technological and the social core of the base lawyer needs to be fairly simple i think i'm going to be saying this a lot but i don't think i have much to add at this point after uh all these good comments but of course i agree with this i i think the whole point of uh d theorem based later and yeah i mean it applications can be can have their own requirements they can be or not centers of resistance but the theorem-based layer should be and that's the whole point of what we're building so i'm hearing a lot about like neutrality and the effect of censorship on neutrality which i think is a good point what does mev have to do with all of this since this is the mev workshop obviously i have my own opinion on this but uh well mev is like one of those things that's like neutral in theory and not neutral in practice right it's like neutral in theory because well you know anyone can go and collect mev it's just a bunch of algorithms and you know you can go do it but in practice so there's economies of scale which basically which often lead to the outcome that like whoever happens to be the larger mov collector at a particular time could easily become even more entrenched over time there's uh latency issues which mean that you know people in a particular locations have better access to mbv than others and just to this uh long list of reasons why mev and like just like anything with economies of scale is uh not a very level playing field and and so the neutrality of uh like the not just the kind of ether like formally the ethereum protocol itself but also the kind of core critical ecosystem around the baseball areas uh something like preserving that does um i think require uh kind of taming the mev issue to some extent okay so i'll try and break down the idea a little bit more so like what does mbv have to do with this so in the proof of work world we observed economies of scale right like large mine like there was an economy of scale to cheap energy access and so block production did end up being sort of oligopolized um but that didn't seem so like that's been basically the state of play in blockchain since 2013 but it didn't seem to like undermine censorship resistance but now we're in this like you know long transition to proof of stake um and at the same time as we've transitioned to proof of stake financial applications that are natively hosted on blockchains have become uh like sort of much more widely much more mature widely adopted monetize and so like the sequencing is monetizable and then the other thing we observe in conventional financial world is that like institutionalization of like information advantage institutionalization of edge can like persist for decades that like you have hedge funds like jane street and uh you know the jane streets the jumps the renaissances of the world that have been just better at the markets than other than like competing institutions for like essentially you know two generations so like then you can imagine that in this world where you have proof of stake and like you have these auctions for buck you have sort of a marketplace for block production that like you could end up in a world where you have persist like institutions that persistently are the best block producer or a small oligopoly of the best block producers and then you run into this question of okay what is the censorship resistance of this system and does it behave differently from the economies of scale that we observed like sort of post 2013 improvement approval work i guess my take is that um you know blockchains give us these these amazing properties of credible new and clarity and whatnot because they they kind of smooth out the whole world right they kind of integrate over the whole world but in in order to get there you know there's actually when you really zoom in there's this very local process of block building where you're literally giving one guy like monopoly power over this this one block and like this this one guy is not going to be smoothed over the whole world he's going to be in a very specific jurisdiction with very specific like ideals or you know thoughts and so now suddenly you've you're losing credible neutrality because you're zooming in on this one person and this one person can like work with specific builders and and and and and whatnot and so i think part of the uh you know the the solution space is to try and um smooth things out and remove this this monopoly power that the proposal has and that's one example of literally muv's moving where you you involve the air testers and you you remove the the monopoly power that this this one proposal has you have something to add francesco i can see it [Laughter] um so we we we touched on a few things there that maybe might be worth zooming into one was the status quo and proof of work and the transition to proof-of-stake which is right around the corner what do you think i have two questions maybe answer them together what do you think in your heuristic or how would you compare the quote-unquote censorship resistance or how would you quantify i guess of let's say eth proof-of-work versus eath proof-of-stake what are the differences there and how are they relevant and also of let's say bitcoin versus like eth pow like are there any differences there or is it kind of the same story so i think one one improvement of proof of stake is that we've dramatically reduced the barrier for self-building like if you're a miner like it's extremely you know risky to be to be to be so solar mining and so with proof of stake we've now opened up the ability to be to be self-building and so in this kind of situation where let's say the top mining pools have all collectively decided that they're gonna censor um you know the it's it's much harder to to exit whereas uh in proof of stake we have the same thing there are like at least in the bitcoin world there are mining protocols right like i think stratum does this where the individual miner chooses the template and then they pull right right but i think like it's on the other side it's important to stress that like there isn't anything inherently about proof-of-stake that's uh more sensory and i think this is something that a lot of people miss because this kind of like the scare about censoring just as happens to be happening at the same time as the hemorrhaging narrative but you know there is uh one major ethereum pool uh at least right that that has uh censoring some transactions already um and i mean i don't know whether or not that's happening in the in the bitcoin world um but well the problem is that it just you know because of internal political dynamics anyone who's doing it has an incentive to do it as quietly as possible and so this is the sort of thing that needs to be kind of more actively was so blown out in it so and on that point of doing things quietly like right now these these gas markets are like very opaque and in a way like meth gaff is a reflection of that like there's a few pools that are running and we don't have much visibility but i think with proof of stake now suddenly untrusted solo validators will have the same visibility as like these really powerful pools and i think that's uh you know shedding a lot of light on on this stock forest i think one aspect maybe i don't know how important it is is that in maybe bitcoin it's easier to recall kind of heal from censorship if you're in a situation where the you know the set of money includes that you have the the hash power is kind of uh as decided uh the majority dashboard is a sensor it's something that can happen kind of naturally previously like yes it can happen but also maybe it's a much slower process but this is maybe i mean it's a parameter of the system and also i'm not sure how realistic it is to think that um the situation of adversarial uh majority in in hashrate can just be resolved by people starting all of a sudden to increase like positive hash rate in the sense uh maybe another aspect is that um mining pools are not really don't have the same um are different entities from the a lot of the entities that um we have as been like uh big big like uh staking pools in provo state centralized exchanges have this role that is very i mean they have lots of other services and lots of uh i mean i think the centralizing pressures are a bit stronger in proof of stake due to the existence of centralized exchanges and the fact that they are kind of facilitating and extracting mit so maybe this is another aspect it might be that it's like a faster path to decentralization in that sense but we also i think one really key advantage that we have in proof of stake is that i think we can really reduce the problem of fighting censorship to just secure it to uh essentially we can make sure that the only way to censor is for um the fourth choice to be censored like censorship you know essentially what justin was talking about like we we can uh utilize the fact that we have all of this kind of long tail validators to make sure that if you really want to censor you have to kind of go all out and maybe that's something that's easier to react to even in terms of social coordination and so on and even when there's this strong censorship proof of stake has this recovery process where we can do social slashing which proof of work does not well you could change the power i guess would be the rough equivalent right but right but that that kills the good guys guys and you can only do it once so yeah like imagine the body with a cancer option one you remove the cancer option two you kill the body for changing the work is like killing the body yeah okay we have an audience question which i want to get to so uh yeah go ahead i'll try to make it spicy um the strongest form of censorship resistance is first in first out ordering you're not only guaranteeing that the transaction enters the system you're guaranteeing that the transaction enters the system in the order that it was actually received we need first in first out ordering agree or disagree [Music] i think i'll probably challenge that directly i think yeah i think a transaction getting included in uh 20 seconds instead of one second there's like more than 10 times possibly more than 100 times smaller a deal than a transaction getting included in 20 seconds instead of 20 days so all i will say is that first in first out ordering uh trades like sort of like um like bidding preference like auction preference for time preference so you can invest in capital to always be first um you can also like it just becomes like i mean like z cash is you is like a perfect example of like we we've been seeing zcash has been dealing with us in practice which is like just like spamming the uh uh the shielded pool and congesting the network and not allowing uh sort of real transactions to get in taking advantage of like opaque ordering um so i think that like you know not being able to bid to get your transaction in in the time in window that you want is actually worse for censorship resistance i am i would disagree that we need to do that um because for me it seems like elite like once you protect the users you make sure maybe with encryption or other ways that their transactions cannot be abused like there's maybe we can remove remove sandwiches such things i don't really see the the benefit of like it seems like auctioning the first part of a block and getting some value out of that is preferable at least for these kind of liquidations arbitrage these things that are not really harming anyone and other than that i i guess i'm happy to be convinced otherwise but i haven't really ever understood how uh first in first out it's supposed to work in a permission permissionless network like in the the underlying ptp information list seems like really problematic in trying to do any such system just a minor follow-up what is the time scale at which censorship resistance is meaningful is it seven days is it 20 seconds is it one hour what should we aim for because this also impacts performance for example for optimistic roll-ups and all other kinds of things well i think what we should be aiming for is that you have the guarantee with 80 chance that your your transaction will get included in the next block and where does the 20 chance that it doesn't get included come in is that if the block is full because there's a spike of demand that's what we should be aiming for and i believe this is where we we we can get yeah um maybe i'll maybe i'll pop back to the first question because i think it's fun by the way i packed this panel full of first in first out minimalists and no one told you so sorry about that uh whoops um just kidding just kidding um but i think i i broadly agree with a lot of the panelists i think like if you think about like the broader economy like um even transactions that some validators might want to censor may expose mev which actually makes them more attractive for other validators to include and i think like there's two types of pressure we can exert on censorship one is like altruistic participants who just don't like censoring like pushing back on anyone who's censoring which is things we've seen like the inclusionless idea and things like that and another one is like economic pressure which is kind of what what justin was speaking to in his talk of like you'll be less profitable if you can't touch all these states and things like that is like an incentive not to censor so maybe that's an alternative um i i actually don't know to the question of like we want uh first in first out or not i think that's an open problem um i think it's interesting i think we don't exactly we're writing a post on this in flashbot's research about like the trade-offs uh i'd say with mev auctions but i think like more experimentation is good for the world and we're like very early in these systems and we don't really know what works really well i would say like if we do want to deploy a bunch of things we should like think about very carefully like what metrics do we want to optimize for and like how do we actually prove that like x is better than y so it doesn't become like some sort of weird religious war that would be like the worst case scenario which is kind of tradify today it's like is hft making the market more efficient or is it like a parasite that's like sucking the blood of america like both of these beliefs like exist at least in people i talk to and like yeah more audience questions amazing i don't think this is a very spicy one though um it's okay my question is around how ready some of these solutions are like the encrypted mempool meb smoothing um you know transaction inclusion list because the merge is like happening in a couple weeks time and i think the best solutions that are going to be working and up and ready for the merge are things like relay monitors but i haven't really heard much about like monitoring tools for monitoring block builder centralization i'm wondering if there's like any of the solutions discussed today that you guys think are more ready for implementation by like shanghai or even earlier than others and if not if there's like community tools that you'd like to see built for the merge to address this problem of block builder centralization i'd say transaction inclusion lists are like by far the most short-term viable one i would agree i think transaction inclusion lists are like potentially even on the order of like hours of engineering time away if we really need them you know like oh really uh uh you know how easy is that like have you read my proposal you haven't even read my proposal oh maybe off chain but unchained you know everything takes at least six months hunting yeah yeah yeah so we don't need an on chain patch for like i'd say enough transaction inclusion list to like handle what will probably happen like at the merge would be my rough estimate of like the status quo of research today yes things that are on chain and in consensus are probably at least six months away from the merge if not more so like we should think about it but yeah there there need to be stop gaps also uh there is a lot of conversation on the mev boost repo and probably other places like eath research and things like that where people are like looking at every possible kind of angle and thing to develop so if we do need i mean i think the community needs more resources with that um obviously ef probably and like we are all all hands on deck for the merge so we're all doing our best and yes we could use the help i don't know is that i mean i think the transaction pollution lists yeah unchained also i'm not really sure like what you would use them for if you don't have pbs it seems to me at that point if you're a validator that wants to do this altruistic kind of using this this list you might as well run do what just you're saying like maybe just make you build your own blocks or try to just use a relay which has is trying to provide you some guarantees of not censoring or something like this other than that i think both people i mean smoothing you mentioned that also is something that would come potentially with pbs and i think pbs is something that's very much you know not not ready uh it's not going to be in six months so it's yeah that's gonna take some time yeah i mean i think there's some interesting hybrid options that are even simpler than uh the yeah like the mev boost inclusion list like you could just uh run a validator that like checks whether or not it's aware of a any transactions that pay enough of a priority fee and haven't been included for one minute and if they have then it flips the switch and goes to self building and if they haven't uh then it goes to mbv boost so like there's lots of fairway sample short-term stuff that can be done but that is the mav boost inclusion proposal i think basically no i was uh no i mean i think i meant the iconic one okay okay okay yeah yeah yeah i see another just other aspect of this is that censorship resistance is fundamentally a game of deterrence um like there is like so like the sensor is basically going to threaten violence against some group of people to censor transactions and like the deterrence is that like there is some other entity that has some meaningful counter measure that will make that threat ineffective and make the threatener look stupid uh and look illegitimate and like like an idiot um which they're very which sensors seem to actually be very worried about and this is like the game of deterrence that we've been playing as long as blockchains have existed um and so you know the point of this conversation is like oh we do have credible deterrence in a post-merge world amazing thank you thank you uh next question from the audience maybe we'll go there and then there and then i will throw some bombs because i i'm ready to stir the pot a little bit uh yeah cool um so kind of a clarification question based on the previous um what does first in first out actually mean right if we're going to even consider this as an option like isn't the ordering the thing that we're coming to consensus on like how can you define uh what it means for a transaction to be first if there's not like one mempool like aren't you just cert even to sort of consider that conceptually as an option doesn't that imply that there's some other consensus of like what the stuff that we're about to come to consensus on is i mean look like your question is like equivalence to asking a panel of vegans but what do you think about factory farming but i do want to get i want to get some almond and like yeah what is what is the because yeah i would agree with italics assessment i thought the same too um first infrastructure effectively means that a transaction that is received through the majority of the network actually gets included before another if if transaction one is received in a majority of the network before transaction two then one should be ahead of two roughly what it does is it gives you first and first dot ordering at the coarseness of network latency rather than giving ordering guarantees at the scale of block time in addition to doing censorship resistance or other things first and first dot ordering also fundamentally changes the clock of the system instead of having timing resolution at block level you have timing resolution at native network ladies wow that's the best description i've ever heard at the time sorry one quick point as well you can actually parameterize the sort of granularity that you want first in first out ordering at so you can bucketize time to the granularity of fairness that you want so if you want like um no fairness up to like one second so that you have latency till that uh time but you're not reordering across that time interval you can do that as well so you can have some notion of like fuzzy first and for stat ordering as well if that's something that's more amenable just that's the point amazing so that is the definition whether it's the right definition again vegans or carnivores your choice um yeah we need metrics guys please um all right another audience question yeah i'll try a spicy one do you see any like a mainstream system of products that is doing a really good job in terms of like a censorship resistance if not why so who's doing a good job in terms of censorship resistance swift like is the classic example like swift does not censor they do not enforce sanctions at the swift level like and like basically the entire like global financial industry realized it would be very stupid to try and operate a global financial system where you tried to regulate in the swifts where you tried to enforce censorship and this was this swift system like uh that's like the classic prior art for like why blockchain should also be censorship resistant didn't they just take a country out of swift we have some dissent um so good i was just asking what was the question because i didn't hear it the question was is there a mainstream like i heard that i heard that what was it whether swift sensors or not swift doesn't censor at the message level this is true so i can show you the policy document from swift the banks do all right our first uh take it outside moment guys at least three more before the end please please um all right all right let's uh let's keep going uh so uh yeah mainstream projects swift i think is an interesting one i think there is a game theory there because like they don't censor necessarily at the message layer but they also don't not enforce any like yeah hearing or censorship requirements whatsoever get globally disconnected right they can globally disconnect yeah yeah yeah exactly yes at the bank level all right any other projects mainstream censorship resistance good iptcp voting in elections all very cool answers facebook ad auctions during elections all right uh we'll go there and then to roon yeah sorry if this is kind of a basic question but uh earlier in the panel we were talking about you know a possible oligopoly of block producers if you have a group like that and they're censoring some kind of transaction the more of that kind of transaction accumulates in the mempool the more of an advantage a block producer outside of the group has because of 1559 they can include all those take those extra fees so yeah i'm curious like how much of a problem you see it as being and like how long it's acceptable for a mempool to be stuck or a transaction to be stuck right so going back to kind of the the handicap that the censoring builders have as you said it kind of grows over time as more and more sensor transactions accumulate and then suddenly you know the sum of all these intentions is just way much larger than the edge that these censoring builders could have and so now a non-centering builder comes in and they can overwhelm uh the the censorship and one of the the really cool kind of uh observations is that if you're if you're censoring let's say one if worth of transactions then you're losing one if every single slot so um in terms of profit uh if you want to like maintain this the censorship so if you wanna censoring over let's say a thousand slots and you're willing to pay for it and it's just you're censoring one if worth of of transaction fees that's going to cost you a thousand eve well it might a thousand ethan like lost profits well you can't actually make the thousand eat though right like you can only ever make the one eat so i agree with you in the ideal if like let's say you're forced to include every transaction that pays but if you have the discretion then it seems like you really only lose the one eighth no so you you lose the you lose a thousand leaf and let's let's say that you're a really really good builder that's censoring and you have a one if edge versus a non-censoring builder so if you if you know you you should be able to capture you know one eve every single block but now you're losing that because the the non-censoring builders that this the will will be pushing up your bids yeah but even if you take it then you can only beat the non-censoring builder once with the one e boost and then like that's worth one eighth right no anyway we're bike shedding so it doesn't really matter but i'm just trolling a little bit um i do think that is a good idea of the of the system i just don't know if i buy that we have that i think we do but i'd be interested in your arguments okay yeah we should maybe we do i'm open to yeah talking about it um yeah i mean i'm uh also equally fifo minimalist i i tend to also think that there's not really a you know everything like dahlia or sriram works on they kind of forget a little bit about the information theory bounds of like what's the land hour limit for these things there is some lower bound of information processing per second that is changed by doing fair ordering so my question is what do you think the land hour limit sorry land hour limit is the minimum amount entropy you can extract uh from a single uh sort of qubit and sort of the lower bound and information theory on sort of you know the amount of energy you have to have to do a single bit flip so my question is what is the equivalent for muv because it's clear there is something right it's like it's either a temporal thing it's either a unit of information period of time it's either a notion of fees per unit time what do you think that limit looks like and what does what what you know how close will we get to approaching in practice so you're asking for like how does the activation energy work in like extracting like a single unit event yeah exactly um so yeah i mean i think this is one of the arguments and actually i have a blog post coming out that kind of will also directly address this i was hoping to pump it today but maybe later next week um so that this is like a question of like can through fair ordering maybe you also just increase the cost of let's say meb extraction if you do if you think of it in traditional economics as like okay there's a cost to extract and like a profit from extracting can you maybe increase the cost such that there's less energy being extracted just because the process to like activate it is like more complex and maybe if you have like let's say a distributed ordering protocol with some honesty mixed in you can maybe achieve something like this just through like the pressure of honesty maybe this also interfaces with censorship resistance in some ways um i think my opinion is like you also want to like energize this unit right like for the system like it's not good to have like latent energy over time that's just like not actualized for the cost so i think you actually want to make this as efficient as possible for the system itself to like you know efficiently capture the mev and use it towards whatever economic goal like it's intended for by the people who are creating it um so yeah i think there is some argument to be made that like maybe through honesty or other weird pressure valves you can like have have it kind of sit there for longer um and i don't know if that's good or not i think we both think it's not good but i don't know like open questions i i just am sort of making this claim there's some limit that is being in in sort of like time verse energy versus information process per unit time versus like fees collected per unit time right and somehow we've we haven't really defined like what the boundary surfaces of like the old that limit i'm just curious like do you think it's where do you think we're missing that like are we not looking at the information access very much are we not looking on the fee access very much i mean clearly we have tried with fees a little bit but there seems to be some correlation between if you have like more than one venue where an asset is trading it increases the amount of potentially extractable mev right well more venues is just like more particles in a physical system right there's a lower bound on entropy per unit uh per unit system right like so i i guess that that's what i'm saying like somehow we seem to be focusing on mev ignoring information process that's going on we just focus on the like temporal process which is misses like 90 of the reason like i think the auctions succeed but anyway so how do you think this impacts censorship i think the information if you understand what the lower bound information is then you can you can actually reason about like what bounds on how fast or how how much censorship resistance you can kind of possibly have in the system from a purely information theoretic standpoint not from a like oh like i i forced everyone to kind of do fifo by doing 50 rounds of communication i think fees over time is like a relevant thing there's also like some expertise like some human metric right of like you have this state space and like to efficiently like process all these things together you need some like smart heuristic to search it because there's no real fully mechanized way to do it so there's like fees time expertise maybe like are some dimensions it's like non-exhaustive i haven't really fully thought about it um but i guess this the the corollary to censorship resistance here to bring it back for people is like maybe the way to achieve censorship resistance is has to be inherently creating more of this like free energy that like is censored by some subset of the network so like starting economies that like you know are actually meaningful to like create pressure like through mev not to censor them so maybe that's the route yeah yeah all right i got a spicy one uh so flashbots has announced that like the relay and builder that they'll be operating after the merge will continue to be olfact compliant they won't include ofac transactions blocks route will also have an option that does that i'd say the most extreme stance on that has been what probably mica has expressed of he would prefer that blocks route and flash spots actually step away from even operating a relay if you feel that you're you know you don't want to go to jail which like kind of makes sense for putting ofac transactions in do you agree or disagree that actually operating the relay is harming ethereum slash if you walk away does that actually solve the problem of you know someone else can do it i'd actually i want to flip this question on the panel what do you all think should should flashbots operate relay is it harming ethereum are the questions i mean i've been in favor of flashbacks like splitting into the side that researches uh how to build the game in the side that plays the game and having like a hard wall between the two for a year before censorship stuff came about but so you know even i guess even more reason to do it so which one of these would this fall into to you um well running a relay would probably would uh fall into the water was that so being still like playing the game interesting yeah i would be inclined to saying that you know flashbot should be running some some infrastructure i think maybe having this separation and maybe incorporating in a different country or having a different team or or you know maybe having a bit more risk appetite from a legal perspective like i would to be fair i was a little surprised that that there is this there was this decision to be offered compliant um my my observation is that like there's multiple parties in the block building process and even today in the context of proof of work like these some some subset of these parties are one not uh abiding by ofac and ofac censorship has existed for for for months and years you know if you look at the actual list of there's like hundreds of of ethereum and bitcoin addresses there and to my knowledge there hasn't been any enforcement action or any any kind of guidance that the block builders should be involved in this kind of censorship um one thing that like i guess i that popped into my head and this is not a very well-formed thought but it's like uh there seems to be like a reluctance in a lot of this infrastructure to run things with like leader election protocols so it's like instead of like we have the one flashbots relayer there's like some community of flashbacks real air and some sort of leader election mechanism between them with some sort of failover we have a thing for that it's called tendermint um uh the uh uh you know there there are ways of building this stuff with existing infrastructure and maybe like there's an unwillingness it's they're sort of like a willingness to treat this as optional in the ethereum community that i kind of wish was not the case um why would that help with the with this problem since anyway i mean you would need and you need it it really has to be trusted so you can run a leader lecture protocol but you have to it has to be permission so would that really help in their decision of what to do with essential compliance because i mean a big part of the way we've done censorship resistance for things like tor and all these things is you do find physical jurisdictions that are more uh that where people are either willing to take more risk or like people are less afraid and like physically locate the infrastructure there i think so from my perspective uh geographical diversity and competitiveness are super important i think flashbots is in like kind of a unique position as an entity given like the past and future of mev um you know um i don't think flashbots like nose yet as an entity like you know exactly you know is the relay even going to exist in six months right because we may have in protocol pbs um so a lot of what flashbots thinks about in terms of running a relay is decentralizing the existing position of flashbot's power by rather than having this vertically integrated mevgeth having like many competitive parties and like open sourcing as much infrastructure as possible uh to kind of get to that path so along those axes like i hope are not hurting ethereum because flashbots itself gets like actually very little benefit from methboost as like an actor and it's mostly like supposed to be a public good to like tied us over until pbs so from that perspective like i don't know hopefully we're not hurting ethereum is my two cents but uh i'm not asking you to trust me you know time will tell i would say justin what would your estimated timeline be for pbs if we assumed that we abandoned like everything else except for uh dank sharding and like maybe single solid finality six months you want to do these two things before pbs well no well no i mean they might have to be done at the same time because like pbs is sort of inherently enmeshed with them all you have to do for some pba like some crude pbs though is like add a payment type and a transaction type right that like makes the payment unconditional to the builder you don't have to care if they choose the max one or not and that can be six months in my opinion 18 months two ethereum years i mean one of the observations is that like we're getting slower and slower and slower at shipping things and i think that's part of like partly by design right because we want this end game of ossification and so but um there is something to be said as well for just um like front loading a lot of work so like doing as much work as we can you know at the research level maybe having one of the clients implement prototypes so that um you know we're only bottlenecked by by uh by the governance if and when we we do decide to prioritize this and bring bring it on chain can we go through this like a simple pbs thing that's just one transaction type because i haven't heard this before all right let's uh let's do it after well we can do it now i guess but we all we only have eight minutes and there's some people standing but uh uh yeah yeah let's let's maybe we can have a little circle uh afterwards or a corner or something um uh and maybe it doesn't work so maybe i'm just i would love to hear your thoughts on it um so i'm curious is this like an accurate assessment because this is my read on like obviously we want to see in protocol pbs so we don't have to answer questions like oh is flashbots running in relay and is that like horrible for the system um my gut feeling was like the the pbs kind of how much that's front loaded on the road map kind of depends on like how bad the practical issues with mev boost are where like if it's a complete show it'll happen a lot faster than like if it works well then like it probably will drag on for a while and like we'll seek more perfection on the pbs research side before deployment versus like doing something quick and dirty is that like an accurate gut check i guess yeah i think so and like some people have this thesis actually that like these these quick and dirty solutions might like live much much longer than we expect and so for example uh you know like it's possible that proto dank shouting like the initial step might last you know five years and we will only do full bank shouting you know at the very end because it's just good enough uh for a very long period of time amazing trade-off calculation to have to do so envy you all right two more audience questions i'm locking in the audience since we only have six minutes but let's let's get to them yeah go ahead so i wanted to know um what is one thing that you most disagree with someone else on the panel about [Applause] i'll start uh uh and i don't think i we actually disagree anymore but vitalik your posts on like let's just have a centralized builder and maybe it's okay like triggered me for like a week [Laughter] no offense and and i work at flashbacks so yeah curious about no i mean i'm you know i'm happy that like a viable maps that you passed to decentralized builders exist cool what about you all what do you what do you really disagree with someone about so the general heuristic is that um this agreement is temporary and we reach rough consensus pretty quickly um but what i guess one thing that vizag did recently is he sets himself this challenge to give a whole talk on censorship resistance without mentioning the world censorship but you did use the word exclusion i guess and i would have just gone ahead and you know explicitly said censorship but it's just different styles i disagree with phil maybe a bit on uh movie smoothing because he's said multiple times that he doesn't there's like some side channel problem which i don't think is the problem i i've in the meantime come to think that it's not really going to work but not for that reason and i still haven't understood why he thinks that but amazing so i actually think that flashback centralization is perhaps better for ethereum than most people think because of the way it is a sort of political bulwark against actors like finance as centralized exchanges who could extract a lot of mev from like their like domains like cross-domain mep information don't spill the secret sauce jesus i'm just kidding yes i i i actually agree with that but maybe other people on the panel don't i i'm also just generally more optimistic um about the mev situation i think you know maybe you know disagreeing with phil you know maybe like this idea of building a whole business around around mev when you know maybe in in five years any of you just won't be a problem and it will be it'll be just so boring to work on the topic yeah so no that's that's a great great point i don't think we actually disagree that would be my like best case outcome then i can just like go in the mountains and meditate all day and like not have to you know come talk in front of a lot of people who want answers from me so that would be that would be incredible if you can make that happen let's do it let's do it um but i did try to also go down that path for like years and it failed so my faith is low i'm a cynic but i'm open to it v what do you disagree with before we go to the last question no i'm trying to think i mean i get well to be fair i already gave my comments that i thought like it would be better if flashbacks did not exist in its current configuration i don't know what's that big enough yeah i think that's fair i guess you and zaki are disagreeing there so it's like uh it's like a meta you know two birds with one stone situation yeah yeah um all right sriram last last audience question and then we're going to have some lunch i'll finish with a spicy question again uh proof of stake has one specific feature which proof of work does not have which is closure we know the set of participants a priori and they could commit they could make credible commitments on eigen layer or otherwise that they will censor and extort just that one each rather than 1000 each to actually credibly censor a transaction what solutions should we work towards to make sure this kind of thing does not happen one idea i have is we should have light clients actually contribute to censorship resistance sorry to make sure what does not happen what's the thing this kind of like because it's a closed system where a fixed set of stickers are known a priority they could make a credible commitment to sensor creating like an extortion market i see it and what what things can we do to actually prevent this and one thing i was saying is that maybe we have light clients actually contribute to censorship resistance and social slashing much more effectively than we've done until now but yeah like lines contributing to social swashing you mean like light clients running protocols like the sort of stuff i talked about two days ago it's a or do you mean something like light clients for example receive transactions which play pay like 10x priority fee or whatever and then they can actually uh if that transaction is not included for example then they can they all alarm goes off on every like client so that we have a much bigger monitoring base than just full notes inside the network yeah i mean i think i generally agree with like the goal of trying to like get as many people in the ecosystem as possible to independently run monitoring software i've been waiting to see someone try an on-chain extortion market for like three years like been tempted to build one myself like i think it would be a cool thing to like let the world burn and see what happens wow we're talking about some risk tolerance that was bold yeah i might just do it under an anon it might already be running you might be able to access it at www [Laughter] amazing [Music] anybody can switch on whereas to switch into stake has some frictions if proof of stake exists anywhere you can build an extortion market for proof of work but but is so is proof of work more censorship resistant than proof of state like you can build on top of like unexisting proof of stake chain a bunch of like incentives to give people to like the bad strategies of pos pow i see yeah yeah it makes sense yeah i mean i'm not sure it's impossible to build uh similar kind of credible commitment markets on on top of proof-of-work right like you can well what would you do the difference being it's an open system and anybody can switch off it's not an open system in practice like capital costs are like really high like you know it's uh supplies is quite inelastic yeah that's true the counter argument is just like most miners wanted to like it might be even easier to do like a full fork permanent censorship hard censorship whatever you called it justin in proof of work because like you can easily kind of uh 51 attack upstart actors so like once you have 51 in one jurisdiction i mean i guess it's kind of that way with proof of stake too but finality is not exactly the same right so there's like a slightly different cost curve of doing it than to like a random bitcoin block or am i wrong about that no it's i'd say the same very similar dynamics yeah um yeah and like there's there's two two aspects like one is once you do reach this threshold like all the all the solutions that i presented like just start breaking down but the other thing you know around why haven't we seen this is like there's a huge barrier to entry to getting to this 50 percent and so i guess there's two things we can do like one is we can do this deterrent work um but the other thing we can do is just raising the barrier to to to attack like super high with like very high economic security on the one hand and also like this jurisdictional diversity [Music] yeah one thing you can do is raise the um basically the amount of stake that that you need to that needs to collude to 230 um sorry closer okay uh yeah if you like let's say that you have on tendermint or if you had singles law finality you could make it so that if you want to censor the encrypted transactions assuming you have some portion that is threshold encrypted you really need at least two thirds to collude to know in advance before they finalize uh that there's something that they shouldn't finalize because otherwise at that point they can't really do anything so that's maybe a minor advantage that we have one actually get one other sort of family of censorship resistance that i think is kind of esoteric but i remember thinking about um years ago that is uh like not threshold based and not vdf based as kind of what i would call halting problem-based censorship resistance so the idea here is that like if the ethereum protocol gets extended with some kind of like delayed call feature where you can make a transaction like an evm upgrade and block n that forces a column block and plus three then like it becomes possible for people to engineer some collection of uh of uh transactions and calls in blockhands such that like any possible um transaction at some point is like what actually lead to the transaction that's being censored sort of being reconstructed and uh created um but the only way you'd be able to like properly sense censor that is to essentially like simulate all the entire blockchain kind of going uh going forward a few blocks every time you i checked for a transaction that's like a it's a backup that you could have and that's uh something like it's something that's not super easy but not super difficult to construct because all you need is like a guaranteed delayed execution op code this is like something we learned during the dow hard fork like that it was like right like it's like that but this is like a more extreme version of that yeah that ethereum was more censorship resistant than anyone realized the counter argument is if you really want to censor it you can just have like a heuristic that only allows for like templates and then you just like exclude all that and like you're done um depending on how much control you have in the protocol but there's more of a cost for sure you know i guess yeah the argument there would be that if you once you start doing that then you really do exclude enough that like after four blocks whoever the first builder is would just make a block all right folks i think we've had the clock reset on us like six times so i think we're censoring people's lunch at this point thank you
