think uh right before we start because we have um we have uh uh jason and tessa with um a robot uh sorry robert we have met over me be roast um would actually love to kind of um hear a bit on your particular research area sure i'm happy to start i'm robert miller former alberta trader now product manager at consensus focusing on some enterprise stuff uh i consider myself as someone who might be a future research fellow and i'm very interested in this space so here to learn and listen on the conversation and contribute where i can but don't have a particular area of focus to bring today great um i think we'll have there are plenty more research questions on the side but thank you for joining us okay so uh i am justin lee so i am assistant professor of finance at georgia mason university and my research covers a bunch of different areas in finance so sorry in blockchain most of them would be like the industrial organization of mining pools uh the economic value creation of uh crypto tokens in platform building and i've my name is tessa um if i was at the roost um i'm a quant trader from a high frequency prop trader um i'm kind of like robert where i'm just trying to get the lay of the land and get the research tools necessary um definitely done the research in terms of financial trading the blockchain is a little bit different and i'm just getting a handle on what's available and what needs to happen to go forward on the research so i'm glad to help out where i can but it's it's going to be a learning curve thank you all right great um so thanks for um joining and austin hi um so let uh let's start with um each of our research fellows who have submitted um the frps to um take a uh take us onto a quick dive into your rfrp we suggest that you this is casual this is not peer review don't don't worry this is um uh you know we're in the industry um but i think it's more about articulate your point and especially in light of certain addressing certain comments that has been raised by uh the frp editors um and um perhaps sorry do you want to start um feel free to share screen sorry yeah sure okay um yeah give me one second uh where the hell is okay cool can you um you can see my you can feed this i think it's good okay well yeah so um really the bottom oh wait this is the pull request yeah so the the main the main purpose of this frp really is to so first i think is to categorize sort of how the you know how how auctions in sort of this crypto space are different from auctions and literature so sort of you know like phil i think pointed out in a comment on the pr really that you know in this um in this area and in ad auctions right like the it's really easy to collude and sort of you know um um try to come up with cooperative strategies as somebody who's doing mvv auctions or even at auctions and so i think the main uh the main goal here really is to um first survey the existing auction literature um and and sort of compare that with what compare that with what exists right now in the crypto space in terms of sort of what projects have auctions you know their design choices and their reasoning behind it and sort of trying to find where literature can apply to the crypto space and where it it falls short and really where it falls short is i think the place where the major contribution will be towards this paper ins essentially categorizing you know what are the realities of auctions in in the space and where literature falls short so that's goal one goal two really is to then then given some new insight on how on how the auctions in crypto space have to be studied and modeled you know what can we borrow from existing literature um in terms of you know like um um uh current started out as well it isn't just about looking at you know the the the like the high level sort of textbooks existing and you know the essentially the old-fashioned approach to auctions that tim roof gardens algorithmic game theory paper sorry book sort of um goes through but also looking at research recent research to look at really what kind of equilibria can be achieved and um you know sort of what results can be imported into our mav options and so if you go through the sort of the research questions i think the main one i just said was you know how do crypto auctions differ from existing literature um and sort of then it comes around to categorizing these strategy space um interactions sort of what assumptions about conclusion can we make can we can we bound maybe collusions that's how how much collusion is okay this is another thing the turn also suggested and um another thing is that currently in the mbv auction maybe get design i think it only accepts for for example a single a single bundle in the block and that's that's that's what the miner chooses however the more i think like interesting problem is whether the miner can include um multiple such possibly overlapping bundles as well and how you know and how can and what is a good algorithm for selecting these bundles for maximizing you know how much value the miner can extract so i think there's some interesting questions there um along this uh along this pane of thought i think is also catherine and gathering i think more anecdotal evidence for you know for example from gnosis and other projects and other auctions on sort of how they how they sort of motivate their design choices how they take into account um you know possible conclusion and just in general have a sense of you know what are the the practical like implications of um auctions in the space and i think you know as a conclusion from all the sort of questions i think the goal in the at the end is to come up with a taxonomy for of auction that could work for mev and sort of you know have a good um have a good way of systematizing how he can think about auctions how he can choose certain mechanisms and designs and eventually how they will impact sort of this enemy uh the the move guest that that we're thinking about so in that vein there's questions for example as computational complexity which you know for example betting on permutations a lot of combinatorial options are very difficult to compute you know like an optimal strategy so there it's worth exploring you know um potentially sub-optimal strategies that are you know uh like i think karen also said that are good enough and um and yeah so uh that is essentially the the the main questions that that i'm trying to answer in this frp and not the mythology i think is uh is what i said right just do a survey of literature of of you know sort of cutting edge on computational complexity regarding auctions as well as gathering total evidence from existing projects and that's sort of a high-level view of um what this frp entails um i think there's a there might be a i should share the link for it in the chat maybe you guys don't have it and you guys can also look through the questions perhaps in more detail um okay so here's the link for that and let me go to the comments in the pr that might be more insightful as well so yeah i mean most of the comments i think came in the form of suggestions on where to look i think taran's uh comment seems quite sort of in depth i think you know i'm hoping i'm hoping you know given how helpful he's been in this sort of one commenting phase i can sort of you know uh lean on him a lot in terms of asking him questions about and sort of just you know because he seems to be a lot more um knowledgeable about this space than i am but uh yeah so i mean i think i also bought up i think a lot of his points and what i had said previously but uh yeah i think that's i think that's um that's basically it about going through what the frp is about what we're trying to answer and sort of how how i'm going to go about it in the methodology as well see i mean like i i'll also say like i also said i think in the last call that i'm not really i'm not ex very well first in auction theory so this is also somewhat a new area to me but i but i'm i'm currently going through tim gardens lectures and a few papers on ad auctions and i'm hoping from there you know it'll be it'll be smooth sailing until january oh hi turn i think he's on this call now yep thank you sarah um is there any other comments on the um frp aside from terence if not we could ask actually um turn to kind of share a bit more so we can jump to the discussion and also sarah thank you uh for um the uh putting the frp together i think um uh you know on research fellows fellowship is about exploring these uh uh open questions so um i think uh the learning process and also like kind of the collective research is an important part of it so appreciate everyone who um jointly comment and make the proposals yeah so i think harun's comments are probably the most in depth and since he's here maybe he can also sort of expand on them a bit but um the other comments were largely said suggestions i think i already covered what phil also commented on here i've added that into the frp already but yeah i think i think that's about it with regards to comments awesome um so maybe we can um ask um would you like to um just share a bit more context um um in light of the comments that you have yeah i mean i think the main thing that was trying to together is that you're never going to find a like actual thing where you can prove something very directly for i think the type of problem you have in uh mining there's just like a lot of there's a lot of like weird complexities where you're not gonna get like an exact solution so i think the i was just trying to provide some examples of like hey take traditional auction theory but remember that you kind of will eventually need to be happy with a good enough um type of solution but there are some tools from traditional algorithmic game theory that are you know uh still worth understanding um but yeah i think the the combining kind of like you know last 30 years of research is that we've kind of seen that like the formal things are much harder to actually actually get to work and practice cool yeah definitely um i think um in particular we definitely have a couple um more folks here who's also familiar with such literature maybe um we could uh um have a bit more of a discussion on just uh this particular frp um and also phil uh you have also um uh uh commented on this particular frp i would also like to hear you sharing some of the context one thing though i would like to ask a parent is just uh sort of what are the edges on this this graph represent yeah good question um 3d brower brower refers to browser's fixed point theorem which basically is one of the ways you kind of prove that there's a stationary state for a certain parts of equilibria um and basically each of these edges is some type of assumption you make that's stronger than the kind of like topological assumptions you make for brower sort of like this is a a series of yeah each edge is like you could think of as like an extra constraint or assumption um in order to get like a formal kind of like incentive compatible auction well as in like are the edge labels representing um [Music] like it seems like you think the right connection to the book okay yeah okay but i thought that i wanted to make sure yeah i took that picture more to give you an idea that yeah if stratifying the agent strategy spaces to take the set of uh to like try to say like okay assume agents are kind of like arbitrary then you kind of have like something generic like brower and then the next thing is assume the agents have preferences then you get this preference game and then the next thing is their preferences are bounded they're not like arbitrarily interacting with a bunch of different you know there's not long range interactions and you get a degree thing dot dot dot right like all of these things kind of uh this is kind of the way game theorists stratify the space of like strategies by first saying like what game can be solved for arbitrary strategy what game can be solved for somewhat constrained strategy somewhat more constrained dot dot but these maps are like a nice way to visualize like what the assumptions are yeah i like it a lot thanks for sharing that yeah i've seen similar maps in in the crypto literature also with like uh you know just various results that build on each other or models that are kind of stronger versions of other models so i think having something like that would be cool for crypto auctions and maybe it's just covered in existing literature but i think that's that's really the question that we have to answer and communicate here um so yeah other than that my specific comments i think surya already covered most of them pretty explicitly by adding them into the frp uh but they were mostly about kind of focusing on this difference as like the main contribution here um and using our crypto expertise to kind of um convey something to people who work uh more on kind of stratifying these strategies so those were kind of my comments also i know i sent my comments in very late so thank you to anyone who's actually read them as a they were like four hours old only so yeah thanks for integrating them so quickly syria let's let's move on maybe to the next frp tina sure um i just want to i want to hear if there's any uh folks who have any um questions on this particular or comments on this particular frp um if um if you do um feel free to send in the chat we can come back to it um and then uh we can discuss more um but let's uh perhaps uh move on to the next xrp i will also say sorry i just want to also add in it um that alongside if anyone here is sort of also interested in answering any of these questions in the frp i'd love to you know get as many i think heads and heads in the problem as as i could so i'll just toss that out there as well awesome thanks author yes hello uh let me send my screen quickly can you see that yep um awesome is it too big too small should i change anything anything readable maybe a little bigger would be good but it's at the limit i'd say yeah perfect okay cool awesome um so the first frp that we proposed is about moving liquidations um the main reason we find liquidations interesting is because it's quite a it's a narrow but very important use case and like like depth in general right seems to be quite an important uh um financial instrument in in traditional finance but as well as in d5 um so yeah thanks a lot to everyone for the many comments on the on the ifrp um i think we can maybe just go through it sequentially as well um so this is just an intro that this is the landing market is quite large there we observe that there are fixed spread liquidation mechanisms such as rv compound and dydx where you can liquidate based on you get a liquidation bonus which is a fixed amount depending on the on the asset that you're looking at and depending on the platform um and then there are other uh liquidation mechanisms such as makerdao which do like an auction-based system which are auction based where um i think the current time frame is like six hours uh for the auction so it's a fundamentally different um way of of performing liquidations and these these sources of liquidations are these different liquidation mechanisms they they kind of create different opportunities for mav the fixed spread liquidation ones can be done in one atomic transaction often coupled with flash loans so this is something that miners or muv traders could could easily kind of snap while maker dao auctions are probably a bit trickier except when you're reaching the end of an auction there um there might be a game depending on the price change of the of of the collateral of the of the collateral value that you would buy um yeah so that's a small intro so i think yeah there were some some there were some um attacks that we mentioned or liquidation a price articular text that we mentioned um so the goal right so the goal of this fop would be to study the past and current status of blockchain liquidations basically just getting first like a very simple overview of what the what are the what markets are we looking at i mean this is probably something that some of you have already seen on on certain blocks i'm quite aware of i think tarun did a cool paper on compound this is actually something that constantinos shared here also in the discussion actually i haven't seen this paper before yeah this is um that's great um but uh like dy2x i'm not sure if this has been analyzed in public maybe there are some charts on on dual analytics um i haven't checked uh so this is more like to get started then what are the gas price distribution that are paid for liquidation events are they actually uh competitive liquidations happening yes they are uh but this this is like it's good to analyze this uh just to get started here what are the different liquidation methods right how do they do how do they differ with respect to mav so this is something that i mentioned in the intro there's fixed spec liquidation which seems to be a bit different wires then auctions but that should be analyzed properly which mechanism avoids maybe so is there any liquidation mechanism that can that can reduce the risk of mev then how how sensitive are the current depths to liquidation so if somebody can manipulate a price oracle whether it's an on-chain price oracle or some off chain order book um how easily can we kind of trigger liquidations um because once we trigger liquidations we trigger mav and then an mav miner for instance might be interested to anticipate this up front right how can we design a possible liquidation mechanism that gets a movie so they're already the existing ones are probably different with respect to any but how can we design a new one that mitigates it overall um right um so do you want me to go into any specific questions or or yeah we we discussed quite a bit here on this on this pull request already do you have any particular questions that we should address now i think um half of the folks here are either working on an eb inspect uh or um they are very familiar with liquidations in general so i would love to open this up for the folks who are frp editors in the audience as well as uh you know who those of you who are looking at this pr this frp for the first time to raise your questions and you know just hop straight into discussion sounds great uh yeah regarding um there was actually a question regarding the like we mentioned um yeah it would be quite nice to integrate this somehow into mav inspect but then we realized we probably only need to look into events so i mean i'm not sure there's any actually infrastructure needed like the word infrastructure anyways is quite vague so i think we can just crawl events because whenever there's liquidation there's an event um and there should be quite a simple filter at least for liquidations yeah if i'm not mistaken from from events alone you might not catch the checks though right so you might have like say uh 50 transactions that go out attempting to liquidate and one will be successful and you'll get an event for that but the other 49 will perform a check to see whether or not the liquidation is available to them and and then uh fail if not and you won't you won't catch it you won't catch those uh failed attempts uh uh looking only at uh events right we only see the winners yeah great it's true the failed one might might help if you want to kind of look into how competitive it is which i mean the gas price already indicates it right you can look at the gas price how how much higher is the gas price than the average gas price of the block then you already know how much people are likely to overpay right but it's true the missing ones could help to know how many additional liquidates they are yeah and and if you could identify uh the failed ones uh then uh that you can you can also measure like um uh like what percentage of of that block was taken up by people attempting to perform this this one uh the one liquidation i think it's one of the things that maybe inspect um immediate inspect does and the in the case of of back running uh the the gas prices that you'll see on the transactions are uh they're identical to or or very close to the the price of the oracle transaction and so you you wouldn't if you were only looking at the successful transactions you wouldn't see uh the sort of uh the total amount of gas spent attempting to um to liquidate these things so you'd be a little bit limited if you only look at events but um the good news is we uh mev inspect has um a lot of tooling that you could use uh while doing this research to get um access to those other things that you can't get uh just through events right the the backgrounding right this is true the gas price has to be equal cannot be lower um i mean depends on the mining inclusion project can be higher yeah yeah it can be it can be it can be higher right um so 80 of the blocks are ordered by roughly right by by gas price so for the rest it might be a random process then yeah yeah but if you expect it to be ordered by gas price that's fine um yeah i think i think that's all the case and i think also the other place it would be useful to get failures is for the profit part of this because i think another thing that was mentioned here is getting the profitability of the bots so i guess that's kind of what austin was talking about um yeah in general i think it would be interesting to kind of see how we could uh merge this with mev inspect just so that we have like a clear path to kind of have it uh in the dashboard and as part of like the maintenance space for that code base and also i think it would be interesting to maybe start looking at these failures and seeing if some of that infrastructure could generally i don't know maybe there's some some way we can combine like the the kind of uh amm side of mev inspect plus the liquidation side or something like that um i don't know there might be other kind of research questions here i would be interested to see more i guess on that from i think one of the questions also raised uh by uh georgios um has or a couple comments in fact point two um you mentioned author that uh your team will be also collecting the data um at the same time if they're um so one of the questions from georgios was um whether it's possible to for the um for the uh for us to merge the effort of the data collection from meb inspect and um and what you guys um are setting up the infra to collect the data uh right i mean we we had planned to only look at events so far that's why i mean we basically just use a vanilla gef client there's not really any infrastructure but if we do extend it towards more towards fail attempts then probably we have to trace so in that case we would just probably be using the trace feature of of mdb inspect i suppose but i would need to check with my team yeah i think that makes sense cool should i go to the second frp or do you have any more questions on that one well open to the floor um scott um or anyone else who's more familiar with um inspect prompt if you have you guys have any questions [Applause] i think if not we can um let's move on to your second um frp all right uh so this is about quantifying the impact of mav on blockchain security like the consensus security um not the smart contract security so and we can basically i mean there was already the the flash ports paper the flash voice paper for example mentioned quite clearly that this this mav does destabilize the consensus security now we would like to answer by how much quantitatively measure or somehow resolve why by how much that would be um so i think ideally we want to find kind of a threshold right um like at which an mev miner will start to fork the blockchain so let's say there's namibi opportunity gets broadcast a miner includes this one and then there's another miner and this other miner says well i would like to claim this reward for myself because it's 10 times higher than the block reward and i have 20 percent of the hash rate so i'm fine with trying it out and my likelihood is well i either and i'm expected uh i'm expected to win no i'm actually expected to fail um so because the miners are i mean the miners typically have less than 50 percent of the hash rate so they will always take up a risk but i i think there's some kind of threshold value at which we can quantify whether given the given the mev value um what is will will a rational adversary adversary miner engage in forking the chain or not so i think we can find a binary decision here i mean i hope at least um and it would also be nice to to extend this to some kind of a multiplayer game when you have multiple mev and were miners to see how would they engage over an mvp opportunity like what would they do um what is the what is the strategy to to to maximize their their profit i'm not sure it's it's easy to find optimal strategies in a multiplayer setting but like generally what's the behavior in the multiplayer again that would be quite quite interesting to look at so we could look at quantifying kind of also how bad does it get for the chain right i mean you know that the the state block rate or the um the orphan i mean i don't like the word often because an orphan block always has a parent but often or stay blocks um kind of quantify the the the the security of a chain so the higher the state block rate gets the the more advantages the double spending or selfish miner has um so mev in a sense increases the stab rate and ideally want to quantify by how much um yeah i think they were they were as well some really nice comments i think george was mentioned what are the assumptions so i think assumptions we for example have to make some assumptions such as we know whether the adversary mayan knows an average block reward um i mean this is i think a reasonable assumption we we know what's what's the base plus the transaction fee expected transaction fees plus uncle so that's quite quite uh relevant uh i mean it's simple we have to assume that we know the potential mav reward which is also i think appropriate and we have to assume that the mine is rational so rationality assumptions are hard because they might not always be reflective of reality people are not acting rational all the time but without rationality i find it kind of i'm not really sure how to quantify security at all because then i mean anything can really happen so it's it's hard to to give any any uh yeah statements um so there was actually a good comment from judges he said that miners are structurally long on ether um which is true probably i'm i mean i'm not a minor so i don't know but i guess so right um and so if we could i'm not sure we can quantify to what degree to what degree would ether go down in value the price of a coin would go down in value if miners would start to extract maybe um if not if they're not already um and i think this is this is quite a hard question so if we if we could quantify that then it would be easy to to take this into consideration in the model because then if we know what's the impact of such like an unconventional behavior because it's a malicious behavior but it's not really i mean the protocol doesn't doesn't um prevent right so it's also a bit hard to say it's it's adversarial i would call it maybe unconventional behavior unconventional mining behavior so to what degree does it hurt a blockchain coin price and i mean we have seen other other blockchains i think it was zerocoin where they had an inflation buck which was exploited but the price didn't go down of the coin so even eve like it's really sometimes it's quite hard to to quantify what's the impact of behavior also right um right and then so another cool thing thing to include would be calculate the number of cons to consider transactions safe under some amount of med and i would like to see an mev risk metric and yes and this could be used for plug-in for clients for example this this is quite i think this is very useful for for for users and i think once we have set up this model i'm sure there would be some i mean we're more than happy to support some developers so to to build like a proper plug-in that can be used or integrated with wallets or so um so like two things i built i think here um what what we ideally can provide is a transaction value right so it's basically a threshold right it's a transaction value if the value is higher than a certain threshold then an mev miner with for example 10 hash rate will attack it this is just a rational thing to do so it's likely that this will be done so in that case it's it's insecure to to broadcast that transaction i think that's that's probably the the ultimate question should i broadcast it or not or should i privately mine it with a miner with some private agreement like one inch does so um this threshold i think would be quite key to tell a user if you if you're gonna issue this transaction it can be claimed by anyone so it's an mev uh and you're risking you're risking it getting snapped by the dark forest as some say um so i'm not exactly sure how the number of confirmations matter here because this is later on in the game um but maybe i mean yeah i mean we don't know how long so what the mine what the mav miners would do they would start to do private mining so we don't know how long this game will last right um and that's probably also hard to tell a user now you have issued a transaction that this probably be this will that which will maybe be claimed by an enemy vr miner and it will it might take this minor i don't know 10 blocks to to fork the chain so i think this i mean i'm not sure this is this is easy to to convey but just giving given the value it's probably quite easy to tell the user be careful this might get snapped yeah uh yeah cool any questions i think this is uh this is super interesting it's uh you know an area that i and a lot of people have thought about i guess but i would love to see it more formally studied and worked on um i think my main comment is that uh what i've seen in other people doing research in this game is uh just because it's so complicated and mining gets so messy and the real world kind of is so politically involved and weird at some point uh there's like a lot of papers that kind of build this very complex infrastructure and then get some results and then it gets like somehow you know invalidated by maybe a minor tweak to the model and it's not clear like which one actually reflects reality and which one is not so like selfish mining is kind of the area that i'm thinking of when i make this like meta-level commentary where like i think the fur there's a lot of insightful selfish mining work but there's not like a consensus or like a i think a cohesive uh you know effort to come up with like a result like a final understanding of selfish minding and i don't know if we'll ever achieve that so i think it would yeah i would love to hear your thoughts on like how we approach that in the long term because it's something i have thought about and not been able to answer but uh i do think it's definitely worth studying this and like there's a lot of lower hanging fruit questions that it would be great for us to answer for the community but i think it's also good to think like longer term how do we make sure this is like that we can get some fundamental results here that like uh you know really are communicatable and kind of um the way selfish mining the first attack was and maybe the follow-up work because it was more in the weeds and more kind of argumented it with each other kind of lost some of that impactfulness i think um yeah it's a very very valid point um yeah it's kind of hard to say you know this is the result and and everything that comes after is wrong or yeah i mean it's true the researchers they like to invalidate it's probably prior results right because this gives them a reason to continue working on things as a kind of a job security thing yeah we'd love to hear more comments there is there's a question from just soon in in the comments i'm sorry if i i'm not saying your name properly by the way uh i didn't see the chat clarification by consensus you specifically mean yeah nakamura that's that's actually a good question right i mean we could also look into like does this change at all for pass actually i think we mentioned this now here to what degree the results would apply to pos um i mean yeah i think this would be also super interesting to to explore i'm not sure there would be a significant difference if you just on a high level consider pause or proof of work as a leader election mechanism so i'm not sure there will be a fundamental difference here i think we discussed in like a few weeks ago in one of the calls whether there is any difference of mev on on pause and i think the idea the consensus was also more or less that there would not be any major change just because of the change of of how we reach consensus i guess the related question i would have there is if we could like unify the analysis somehow and i think this also leads into the next frp or whichever one sunnis is about proof of stake and other protocols like is there some level of abstraction in which we can view this process and like the influence points in the ordering decision in some more abstract way that would let us like kind of reason about both proof of work and proof of stake at the same time i think that would be also something worthwhile or even maybe leaderless protocols i think would be interesting to fit in there so there's probably some tight collaboration that's possible there because i assume to understand the past game you need to understand this multi-miner game at least somewhat and and vice versa uh but yeah i think that's that's a definitely something that is on the top of everyone's minds especially how does this change with youth 2 and like how does this change with sharding and roll ups um i think like a personal concern i have that's maybe more engineering eats related and less academic researchy is like with like adapt composability and interoperability across shards and uh layer twos so if you have this super heterogeneous like distribution where a few shards or a few l2s have a lot of value and everything else is like a long tail which is probably what's going to happen how does that impact like layer one security um and especially when it comes to manipulating transactions between those shards slash layer two protocols so i think that's also something that i would i would love to think about at some point cool i think that's a nice summary and also um just want to be mindful of everyone's time here we currently budgeted one hour but i would encourage us to who would like to extend the discussion um to stay on the call for a little bit longer because i think this call is particularly pre-holiday so kind of want to um um after the next frp presented um figure out kind of the meaningful way of collaboration um as well as some of the gaps in terms of um unanswered research questions that we would like recommendations or referrals from all of us here so um author sorry to this is a fascinating frp um i think related to what uh sunny um and dave who's not currently on this call would uh like to share with everyone with their frp so let's move on to the next one sunny um all right cool can people see my screen i think so yeah uh sweet um okay so yeah so my frp is mostly about um kind of like answering that last question which was um how does this work in i mean not just proof of stake but i just described more broadly as alternative chain architectures um something something different than what like you know youth 1.0 does um and so basically let's see um i wanted to base you know especially as we see like more like alternative chain architectures like 2.0 tendermint based chains avalanche um one i want to basically see two things one in what chain architectures is mev extractable and like what what what are the requirements of a chain that's needed in order to even have like some amount of like extractable value uh and then the second would be then more specific of okay in the change that mev is extractable what is needed to make the current design of the flashbox architecture uh viable um and so by like taking these like requirements of the chain in order to do these two things then we could like analyze a couple of different um models uh i think like the three that i was gonna suggest was a nakamoto style proof of stakes or something like uh heath 2.0 casper a classical bfd something more like tendermint and then a leaderless consensus some consensus something more like avalanche um and then see how the uh effects of how this stuff how how consent you know what i think one of the main side of negative side effects of mev is of high mev is consensus instability but i think that the consensus instability takes different forms when it's uh affecting like a nakamoto style chain versus like a uh finality bfd chain um you know i think in the nakamoto chain it you get these like the time-banded attacks which affect safety but like on a lot on a classical bfp chain i think the consensus instability is still there it just takes a different form usually with uh like you know negatively affecting liveness um and then um then the the last section is something sort of basically you know more related to the work that i'm uh already doing which is like so given the properties that like um are needed from a chain in order to have mev be extractable given those assuming that the these three designs mentioned here do not uh eliminate like or or minimize maybe extraction um how given those three those properties how can we design a new chain that can uh reduce the meb um and yeah so sorry i actually didn't get a chance to reply to most of these comments here on the drafts because uh it's a couple hours ago but i i i do um so i think some of the main questions here is um yeah so i i think what what uh tarun said here is actually really important i think that um most of the things i wrote actually so far were basically with regards to consensus protocol but i do actually agree that i think the um design of the mempool is actually probably one of the more interesting like uh changes across like different architectures that might might even be more important than than uh the consensus design so for example i know that right now in tendermint by default uh transactions are not reordered uh in a mempool based off of uh fees they're they basically are checked to see if they satisfy some minimum fee and then they're inserted in order um of receivable and so you know assuming that if that's the default of majority of validators then like you know how does that affect the any of the extraction process so i think so yeah i think this is something that definitely should be added like different mempool designs and also like probably problem with mental designs is that they're usually unattributable like or like they're not binding it's like you know you could say that's the default and so then this has to be analyzed in the sense of like okay you know based off like you have to like consider different classes like okay are the majority of are all validators following the default strategy for mempool or or most validators or some validators so i think yes i think this is something that should be added in more um phil mentioned that yeah you know so by the way i i i i've been in my thing i've been using the taxonomy of like mavs maximum extractable value so when i say like reduce mev i'm not saying like reduce the amount of mev that's going to minors or the proposed i just mean the amount of extractable value as a whole um and then yes this is what return mentioned here this is basically what i was saying where like you know the consensus instability in like bfd systems basically shifts from safety faults to liveness faults because you know if it a valid if you want to if you want to become the block proposer of this block um in ten in like ten minutes chain you know in proof of work one of the strategies you could do is just like put buy more hash power and like try to have a higher probability of winning in tendermint chains you could easily you know because there's no not a really good opportunity to invest resources into buying more hash power you you couldn't instead invest resources into like ddosing other proposers until you get an opportunity to be the proposer but i think the game theory of this becomes very like unstable so i think that needs some research um yeah i think that's i think those are like the two main classes of comments um i guess i'll open it up to the audience on this call if i i kind of want a little bit faster if anyone wants me to clarify anything or have any questions about this please let me know i think uh again we're super important research area and i'd love to see those insights uh i'm especially personally interested in the leaderless protocols and like how that differs like whether we need special probabilistic techniques to reason about it or how we even think about it or how how we quantify me in those systems um but i think all three categories are super interesting and yeah i think it would also be good to maybe collaborate with uh arthur if you guys end up working on these same kind of questions just to you know maybe eventually have a have a common language slash common writing interface between these uh questions i think that would be yeah we'll have to exchange more um do you think that so and one question i had was like okay if we bring in this like mempool analysis like i i'm worried it might turn into like this like n squared thing where like i wonder if like every combination of consensus protocol and mental uh strategy has to be like uh thought about independently and so i'm a little bit worried about that if you have any thoughts on how to like tackle that if that turns out to be the case it might turn out to not be the case but um yeah i know i think that's an interesting question i don't i wish i knew the answer maybe there will be like some sort of pattern of like you know back running follows the same pattern because there's some fundamental kind of uh way these things are ordered that's like the same process like the actions you have can influence your position in the process in like this way but not this way but i don't have that like taxonomy like i haven't mapped it out so i don't know so i think that's an interesting question also for the frp to just try to go through maybe a few of those combinations and see if there's anything unifying or if it's like oh crap we actually think that we need to look at all these combinations um i think that would be an interesting kind of first thing to try to answer but maybe other people have more thoughts that they thought about more on this one um another thing like you know is you know when i right now when it says like alternative chain architectures it's really focused here on like the consensus protocol and like i guess also now the mempool but i think like you know the place where mev will most be affected on alternative chain architectures is usually more state machine related stuff so if you have like a state machine that does like um you know higher has a high amount of privacy right like obviously then the amount of extractable value would be decreased um or if you had a state machine that like you know had some different form of a different execution model uh that like you know maybe it doesn't execute transactions in the order that they are in a block so is that what do you think that should be in scope for this like frp or like should i really just be focused on like these like more consensus and mempool related stuff um i think yeah i'm not sure i think that's up to you almost uh if it's too big of a problem to break off it could just generate like like a separate frp if like in doing this in trying to answer these questions like over the next you know x weeks we see that like this actually deserves its own whole area of study which i think is possible then like one of the ideal outcomes of frps for me is to generate more frps um which i think is is uh you know like good research should always generate more questions than it answers so i actually talked about alex like we should make uh talk to alex like when we started this that we should make a rule that you have to open at least one frp for every closed frp not that i think it's a good idea but uh yeah so i think i think it's totally reasonable to try to try to treat it as one but if it seems to be too much work than to be like maybe the product of this frp is just writing up another frp among all the other kind of deliverables um as a future work direction okay okay cool i think that might be what we end up doing you know yeah well um thanks for um sharing and um i think that uh just to um um i guess the next step would be try to figure out um i guess how would be a mean what would be a meaningful way for us to collaborate and help out with um the me fellows who's working on these questions i think there's a lot more clarity that perhaps needed uh from um um from from us as an organizational perspective but actually i think the more important thing is i want to hear from like kind of the uh folks here who's on the call if there are frps that you would like to join for us with or help out on and also from the research fellows who's on this call um how you would like to get support um and lastly how we from phil perhaps phil and alex um alex who's coordinating also on the research side um how do we um put these all these frps together into um a um i guess the research papers and or do we want to keep them separate open for discussion i don't think we are very fixated on any um particular solutions is practicality and what actually works do you want to mention that jasoon also has a question in the chat about the mempool versus minor perspective that i think is good to to consider for uh for sunny so i don't know if we want to go over that real quick um i missed that um jasmine yeah we'd love to address this question first so yeah i agree like you know the fact that like this is kind of what i mentioned which like mempool strategies are not like you know provable or like it's very hard to like fault someone for that um so i think like really when we say i think there's like two examples of where like mempool strategies might come into play um one is you know you you don't think of it as mental strategy you think of it more as like block execution strategy so you know maybe a mem a block doesn't actually specify ordering the ordering is it just specifies inclusion and then ordering is decided by some state machine level uh thing so that that's one option of like when i say mempool ordering strategy it's really like blocks blocks execution ordering strategy the other option is you have some system where like you know there's not a single block proposer uh for a block so you can just you can design a protocol in which like you know you need the inputs of many block proposers uh to to choose the inclusion of transactions into a single block um and if you have that now you can start to like play with like honesty or like altruism assumptions of like you know okay let's say over half the block proposer or the the uh so i call this system joint proposal so half the joint proposal uh contributors are altruistic then like how does the mev extraction like uh affect there so yeah i agree like in like the traditional like architecture of a blockchain where it's like oh one person one proposer uses their mempool to just propose that inclusion and ordering of a block yeah there's not really much like you can do there but i think it's in some of these up different chain architectures that it might be important does that answer the question i think that was pretty thorough um and i guess yeah you you guys uh should feel free to discuss more on github i think that's a that's a cool point and something that might not be obvious to people and that we should communicate um i guess tina do we want to call out the discussion real quick since we're kind of short on time of how we continue things in the next few weeks slash the holidays and then we can wrap up unless anyone else has any specific requests or comments um we can also take those i guess yeah let's move on um and uh while at the same time just leave your questions on the in the chat um and we'll address them or we can uh take your discussions uh to github async which will probably end up being more thoroughly answered um so um i guess uh it's really up to i think uh you guys uh sunny arthur and phil um also uh surya we've seen we'll sync with them uh with him afterwards um what you guys think would be the most meaningful way to move forward also on the call we have scott who's also coordinating the data collection site for mvp inspect which also may overlap a bit with a effort from author your side on liquidation frp so what would be the most meaningful way for us all to collaborate um i mean they met them many ways that lead to rome but um my students basically they they are living in a completely different time zone right that's why i think like an async communication method is probably best uh at least for them um i'm fine with this time um i think the discussions on github were very helpful like the comments were really furrow and and this is really great um but i think yeah sometimes sometimes some calls might be quite helpful too so i think tina maybe what i would propose is like if we take some discussions uh kind of async for the next week or two about specifically how to move forward with these frps i think we have like concrete suggestions here like i think some papers slash directions are taking shape and maybe we should try to see if we can kind of all agree async with the editors and like the individual frp leaders about you know how it all kind of works and then maybe we all come after the holidays and talk about uh kind of as a group how any cross frp collaboration could happen sounds good to me um i think it's uh so basically we're doing it let's say more more independently at this moment and to see how the frps shape up as folks you know take your time um to dive into some of these questions and discover more questions and then when we um and and um we will um coordinate with each of your team async uh to follow up on the specific questions and kind of the requests that you may have um and then um yeah let's reconvene after um the holidays in january um and i think that would also um i think quite a few of the questions that we get from a process standpoint is what are the actual deliverables but um since the frps include the deliverables that each of the mev fellows will propose uh have proposed so i think um the short answer to that is whatever i think i think you deem necessary as the lyric liberal including whether that to be a standalone piece of research that to ensue or um just um you know the um continued open form of questions i think at this moment we would like to keep these open-ended yeah and maybe one last thing uh before we end which is that like and maybe we weren't the best at saying this in our call to uh to frps but i wanted to kind of explicitly say it now first of all like i'm very impressed with all the quality you know submissions we got and like thank you guys for being interested in working on this kind of research um i think my priority for like deliverables for this effort it would be nice if we could kind of um communicate big questions to the community in a way that was understandable you know in good kind of academic style uh research to answer some of the important burning questions around mev or at least provide some groundwork and also it would be nice to have things that kind of contribute to these this mission that flashbots has of like reducing the information asymmetry between kind of specialized actors and everyone else so things like contributing to the dashboard um is a perfect example of that so just keeping those two goals in mind as the frps evolve i think would be great but uh i'm very happy with everything i've seen and uh yeah thank you for participating yup um thank you um and um as promised we um did mention that um at the um uh end of um this uh research workshop that cap our 2020 uh uh research workshops um we would like to um uh share send out the um thank you um mev fellowship uh rewards to um the grants to um the abi fellows for encouraging you to continue the research that you have uh proposed so we'll reach out to you separately for the details of the arrangement and for the folks here who joined and interested in opening frps or answering or joining any of the existing research fellows um reach out to them async on github i think that's probably the easiest way to do so also just open your own frp will be the easiest way to take part in our research process and so if you have any questions just um you know ask in our discord cool it's it's the pirate party online we can share a link of the pirate party it will be somewhere on a beachy side of uh the malibu uh in california one of our researcher um engine research engineers is hosting um invited us over but we shall have them more um you know over time so oh tessa i did not know you were in la well i'll uh text i'll send you dm for details then yep awesome thank you all for joining thank you guys bye everyone thanks for taking the time bye thank you guys happy holidays
