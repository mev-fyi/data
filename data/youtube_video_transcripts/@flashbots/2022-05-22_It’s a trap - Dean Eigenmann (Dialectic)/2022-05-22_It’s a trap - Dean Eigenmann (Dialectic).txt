[Music] i'm going to do a relatively short talk i prepared this this morning and was kind of stuck on trying to figure out how much i can say without saying too much obviously um i want to be able to provide you guys with a bit of alpha but i obviously can't leak too much alpha because that would uh put all my hard work to um so just to get started who am i my name's dean i've been in crypto relatively long some of you might have like worked with me before or seen some of the stuff i do um i recently co-founded a team together with edgar who you might know he was previously at flashbots was the source of a huge dilemma last year when he proposed a client where you could reorg miners that caused a a bit of a stir in crypto and i like when people cause a bit of a stir and so i reached out to him and we decided to put together a team which is now a team of four people where we mainly focus on doing mev internally yeah so all of you have probably heard of the sandwich attack what is a sandwich attack it's when you front run and background a transaction so that you can take profit before the transaction and then or before the transaction that you're squeezing and then the last one as well and so some of the traps that we're going to look at are related to this but also just arbitrage transactions in general and some of the issues that we've run into when you're doing generalized arbitrage on chains like bsc or phantom that have a lot of experimental coins a lot of ponzi schemes and just a lot of coins in general so on uh bsc currently we uh detect roughly 744 000 pairs on uni-swap-like exchanges right so we have built a tool where we index anything that looks like a uni-swap pair and automatically add it to an index so we can arbitrage really any pair automatically this obviously opens up a lot of problems because as previously said a lot of the coins that we see are low liquidity um they're random scam coins they have weird uh nuances in the transfer function so that like you can't do weird trades with them and things like that and so that means that we run into like very interesting things where we you know try to do an arbitrage and then somehow sit on millions of dollars of a token and we have to figure out why um which has led us to some very interesting uh nights of debugging one of the last ones was in switzerland where we bought a token luckily not too much i think like fifty thousand dollars and then couldn't liquidate anymore um and so we we see we see that quite often actually uh this was one of them right so we we were arbing on the way up and then suddenly the price went to zero and we were sitting on this entire token and we're like oh what the happened um and this is what happened so this token was incredibly interesting this took us a while to debug until we realized what it was how many of you are familiar with a pga a priority gas auction right so that happens when you know we see someone else arbing a trade and we get in a competition with them to get a higher gas price when we simulate a transaction or when we simulate a trade what we do is we simulate it with a default gas price and then when you get into pga you no longer simulate that transaction even though you're upping the gas price right um and in this the reason why we don't do that is because in the pga we just need to be fast it doesn't matter anymore what the computation is we just need to be fast as to ensure that our transaction gets on the network faster at a higher gas price and what this token did was kind of slimy um as you can see on line 369 um it stores what your current gas price is and then on line 372 if your gas price is higher than some default gas price variable which they had set which was i think like 80 gwai or something they put you into that random map which says is status equals to true and at one point if you're inside of that map the transaction just reverts and so that's something that we never ended up detecting because in in the simulation it looked completely fine even though uh at one point they just revert you um on line 377 in that if statement so they detect if you're doing a swap and if you're doing a swap and your gas price is over their default price they're just going to revert you and that's something that's super hard to detect in a simulation right like we've built some pretty advanced um simulators but even those can't detect those especially when we're trying to be fast right like we we have these decision trees on when we add different parameters to the simulation to try and test things out but when you're being fast in a pga you just can't do that then there's other ones which we've seen as well so this is a nice transfer function which stores the state in some random other contract and so we were able to like detect the byte code that happens in this function but it then does a call to some other random function and so you're not actually ever seeing the bytecode and it's really hard in the simulation again to be able to detect what the accounting done uh did and the accounting did something similar to the previous transaction where it like did random checks if you're doing some kind of swap um so how do we fix these things one of the things we've started doing is we avoid transactions that use certain op codes right um so we don't trade tokens where the transfer function calls a block hash op code a gas price op code or a coinbase opcode um we've seen that quite a bit on bsc there's like weird scam coins that you can only trade when some validator is the coin base gas price thing there as well that i previously mentioned and the block hash thing as well um that we've seen yeah there's a there's a bunch of really weird stuff on bsc um we've been playing around with some experiments on how to simulate these better um but the the easiest way to to avoid getting trapped right now for us is heuristics right so what does that mean we do certain things like filtering out pairs that have less than n in liquidity um and as an arbitrary number right now i think we do anything that's under a million dollars worth of liquidity on a specific exchange we're usually like that's probably a bit weird i'm not going to touch that one for a while another one that we see often is 60 of lp tokens that are owned by an eoa that's usually a little bit shady if you if you see a an lp token that's like 60 owned by by a smart contract that's usually fine that's usually like oh a lot of this is locked into some staking contract 60 locked by an eoa is usually like some weird ponzi scheme that you just don't want to be caught um with one of the other things we do now is we categorize for a lot of the arbs that we do um and so we have different limits right like if certain heuristics match we'll arb up to like fifty thousand dollars if other heuristics match will arb 50 to like 10 million and then if other heuristics match it's open-ended um and we've seen that kind of reduce the losses that we have um our bot right now we've seen to be one of the most successful so what a lot of people underestimate is how little you have to be successful on mev to make money um most bots are unsuccessful like 90 to 95 of the time we're seeing success rates now of about or we're seeing unsuccessful rates of about 80 percent um and so our bots get arbs through actually a lot more often than others it's not optimal yet it's really good i'm hoping that we can get it down to 50 but that's like more of an ego goal than it is a a goal that is ever going to come to life um that's pretty much it i'm sorry that i couldn't provide more examples but we we found another one this morning but that one we really don't want to provide because it gives searchers um another opportunity to throw us out of the game so i'm not gonna show that one but i think maybe in a couple of weeks or at the next conference i'll be able to reveal that one um but yeah happy to take any questions um how do we manage the security of our halt wallet most of our money we throw into a heart a smart contract uh gnosis safe wallet that's not in the hot wallet the hot wallet architecture is a bit weird like because it's me vm we have to be fast it's essentially going to be a private key right like there's nothing we can do about that we just limit how much is in there uh any of our most of our private keys don't hold more than i think it's 10 million dollars and the ones we most most of the money is in the arb smart contract and those are smart contracts are owned by a multi-sig as well so the amount of money that's actually in an eoa is relatively low the stuff that's in an eoa is usually to pay for the gas for the transaction to the smart contract yeah anything else end user account doesn't end user account something that's not a smart contract wallet okay perfect there's no more questions just one yeah i'm here on the left on the left um how many strategies you have like um so we have around three to six we discovered a new one this morning which requires a bit more liquidity and so we're pooling funds for that the thing is a lot of the strategies that we do we have deployed on different chains so we have around three to six but we deploy them on three chains so most of the strategies we do we can throw onto different chains and then it's just optimization from there most of the strategies we do are not that advanced they're pretty similar to everyone else's um as said on the panel it's mainly an infrastructure issue right like we don't do anything on ethereum just because it's too competitive for us um i don't like competing um and flashbots really kind of democratized um mev on ethereum a bit too far that it doesn't make sense for us to compete there i said i like to be on chains uh that i would never personally use which are chains that are centralized and and kind of but make me a lot of money anyone else yes thank you do you update the parameters for instance if 60 of liquidity tokens is owned during um the actual transaction or you update it temporarily um so because it's 444 000 pairs what we do is we generate a json file on the fly every couple of minutes that is then indexed in the code which contains a lot of information for us and we base it off of that and then we filter out but um usually you don't have to update it that much because the rate at which pair show up is maybe hourly and so like every 24 hours is usually enough because we just don't do anything that isn't new or that isn't new right so like if a new pair pops up that's a scam it's not in our index anyway so we're not looking at it yeah but so if your competitors know the heuristics they can use that to compete with you in theory but they don't know our heuristics like these are very few and they're not even accurate i was careful anyone else hi um do you have any like general tips or tricks for people starting out in my new searchers um yeah work with a friend don't burn yourself out okay that's mainly advice not a tip or a trick um if if you're if you're a small fish there's interesting things to start looking at that other people aren't looking at um there's always i think the edge of a of a small per or of a of a new person or of a a smaller fish is that you you can dig deeper um and be more in like random communities and things to find to find different opportunities there's a lot of nuanced protocols that people aren't like me aren't touching because the profit just isn't high enough but the profit for someone who's just starting out probably makes more sense than it does for me i i personally like wouldn't compete on things like uni swap like exchanges as a single person just because um as said on bsc for example where we're doing it's an infrastructure problem right everyone knows how to sandwich at this point everyone knows how to do a jet attack at this point um the problem is just um it's an infrastructure problem right and so the thing you're optimizing for is no longer your strategy it is for essentially getting a transaction out to the network and that requires a whole different skill set than it does to find uh very nuanced strategies and so it depends what you want to look at if you if you want if you think that you're you're good enough at knowing geth and working off of that then i say go ahead and do stuff like that it's just like you're now optimizing for the millisecond rather than like optimizing for finding like interesting game theoretic and financial things that you can do to to make profit thank you thanks um how quick do these opportunities on the newer chains um actually stay around how quickly these 3ds disappear uh do you mean like how quick do general strategies disappear yeah so if you you knew your strategies um what what well as the things we're doing are very basic like a lot of the stuff we're doing is arbitrage arbitrage never disappears you have it in traditional markets as well um it just like the arbitrage becomes slimmer um on something like bsc it hasn't slimmed down enough to demotivate us just because there's so many pairs there's so many liquid pairs and things like that even on ethereum arbitrage is still there we're just not doing it because there's so many other people doing it there and there's no competitive edge that you can have with flashbots except of like optimizing byte code to the to the smallest amount so that like you can get into the into the gas auction that flashbots does which isn't that fun to me cool hi dean thanks for the talk um what are some of your heuristics for identifying a new strategy as viable or do you look for things that aren't competitive or do you look for something you identify through analytics somewhere where someone is competing and think we can do that better uh yeah i'd love to hear your thoughts on that it's a bit of everything right now most of the strategies that we've had we've seen some bought do something smart and figure out a way to do it better uh though the way we were like the team is relatively new um it's been around for six months and the way we did it for the first four or five months as everyone came up with a smart idea and started building their own bot um and at one point the the people on the team converged and started working on two three ideas and realized that like a lot of the infrastructure things that we were working on one bot can be used in another bot and things like that right and so it's really just a matter of around and find out um i i don't think like i i think you can probably be very organized about it it's about like finding out where liquidity is um where volume is and then trying to see if there's strategies related to that um yeah we just we look where the money like the the smartest analytics that we can do is looking where the money is great thank you kind of a different question but i was wondering what is your preferred crypto to store wealth in for an indeterminate time horizon uh i don't give financial advice no not financial advice personal opinion i don't give financial advice all right thank you all right if there's no more questions then thank you [Music] you
