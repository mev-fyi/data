[Music] let's see how much time we have for this panel so we go until uh 15 30. perfect 25 minutes all right so it's me again stefan i'm also still the founder and steward and architect at flashbots um i'll put my other hat on which is one of trying to design a an auction system and a and uh maybe i should say a a block building system that is uh compatible with um with ethereum um and the goals that ethereum has longer term so the way i'll frame this conversation is right now we live in a paradigm where block building is happening happening at the same place as validating is happening so for for miners right now on ethereum right they have the task of collecting transactions collecting bundles from various different sources like flash bots like uh like blocks route um and and putting them together into a block and then also doing the whole thing that you know miners do where they they mine for a hash submit a proof of work and then propagate that to the network uh vitali gave a talk earlier today which was about the future of mev within the the protocol level of ethereum and one of the key objectives is separating out this role of block construction of block building from the role of validating so taking this uh this task of assembling transactions together into a block letting specialized parties um uh build on this and um and limiting the role of validators to uh to the proposal and and and voting on top of these these blocks um so i'll go one by one here and and we'll do uh name and and where you work and then also after that i'll guide i'll guide a discussion into into block building hi i'm tim i work at infira i'm an engineer there i've been there for three and a half years now so pretty long time for uh the company um i've worked on a lot of things during that time uh over the past few years i've mostly led the addition of all our new networks uh so that's been support on inferior for everything from file coin to the layer two networks now that you hear so much about and it's only growing hi can you hear me hey al malkovich co-founder and lobster uh hi i'm thomas stanczak i work as a product manager at flashbots relay and also worked on the protocol development on ethereum with another my client okay tamash i'll start with you can you talk a bit about the unique challenge of of block building and how you sort of see the block building ecosystem uh sort of evolve and what what types of players maybe will be will be doing block building in the future yeah sure i think that what we started by introducing uh flashbacks to the proof of work systems uh was because we noticed that uh there are already some problems there were already some problems with block building we needed to avoid a potential risks of um of the private arrangements between the searchers and miners we wanted to make sure that the access to mvv is democratized and now when we look at the proof of stake uh those those risks might be uh much much more serious because of leading to centralization of the of the state cash so the big operators of uh staking might be might be the ones that will simply cause all the solar miners the solar validators to to not have enough space so they this uh risk of centralization as uh i think was mentioned by vitalik many times is one of the main challenges for for ethereum after the merge and for the block builders the challenges themselves it's like to how to participate in that in the drive making everything properly decentralized how to avoid the pressure of central uh pressure of sorry pressure of censorship of the transactions uh how to collect uh all the all the mental transactions how to collect proper transactions to build valuable blocks and and really take that role and this may require a lot of specializations lots of skills of knowing how to merge different transactions how to prioritize things how to how to really simulate that in a very very fast way and that skill again there is a risk that the builder itself becomes the centralization factor that the builder requires so much skills that it is a risk by itself in the and the mev world so balancing all of those uh centralization factors the sensation requirements censorship resistances is a challenge okay yeah question for you about block building um this is not a role really that exists right now but projecting into the future what do you think are sort of the differences between a block builder that's going to be most successful and one that isn't so maybe another way to frame this question is what would make one block builder more competitive than another or or better than another so it's a great question so i think it's it's uh in a sense you have to think who's what's going to be the advantages what's what's going to be the game so obviously the first the first thing is is getting getting the information faster okay so the one that are going to optimize their infrastructure the one that are going to make sure that they hear about the about the opportunities about the transaction in general and obviously the transaction with a with mev a faster the other one who's going to get the uh the gain the advantage so that's the first thing there won't they're gonna be some some advantages in simulation so that's again a lot of it is infrastructure but a lot of it might be within the logic but for my view this is the things that if even if one block builder will have an advantage it's going to be very fast to a to him to imitate and uh and and the last thing is the is the step of the execution which in a sense i'm not that i'm not that sure that there will be a performance problem here but there might be and we can see it in a different uh in different chain where a validate or are creating a block but but they're still being ankled and they're losing temperature okay perfect thank you um tim um so one of the big i think things around block building and potentially one of the big concerns is uh censorship um so if we sort of abide to a vision of the future where we do have uh proposal builder separation there might be a lot of economies of scales involved in in block building which means that there'll be much fewer block builders than there will be uh validators in the network this is something where you can get into scenarios where the block builders get all the transactions and and can start making decisions around should we include this transaction or not include it i think infuria as being the largest aggregator of transaction um for you know as long as i can remember on on ethereum has had to like tackle a lot of these questions around you know how what does it mean to be an aggregator of transactions and and how do we deal with it so i want to hear a bit about um about your understanding within inferior and how infuriate thinks about sort of this role of being a custodian in the ecosystem of transactions and how that relates to censorship and and some of the other characteristics that are a bit more undesirable uh sure so i mean inferior's goal has always been to enable developers and enable ethereum and the ecosystem to be successful and we've had a lot of success as you said we're you know probably the biggest transaction aggregator receiving all the transactions through metamask and other sources we get a lot of them and uh mostly we just are trying to keep up uh you might think that our transaction infrastructure might have all sorts of craziness in there we might you know be doing order flow we might be selling it to whoever and of course you have to take my word on this but we're doing very very little uh we're really just trying to take your transactions and propagate them out as best as we possibly can and at the scale that we are that is actually quite a huge challenge and so we spend all our time really just trying to provide the best quality of service to users that we can and we're not always perfect at that of course um there's one interesting tidbit you might imagine that the amount of transactions that i receive is maybe somewhere on the scale that go through ethereum right you know obviously there's going to be more because there's uh ones that the gas price are too low etcetera etcetera uh but in reality we get many many orders of magnitude more transactions than that and so just dealing with that is an enormous challenge um and uh we're also just we're in a very precarious position uh in that uh we have all this data we want to be responsible with it we don't want to do anything to hurt the network to hurt our users uh and so we move slowly in that regard you know so we're hesitant to you know make any big changes to how we handle things to you know start sending transactions through some other mechanism than what we currently do which is just through the p2p network right now so so so one of the things all that you brought up right the advantage of the block builder is the speed at which it receives information so searchers today and block builders in the future would obviously be willing to pay a lot to get access to this aggregated set of transactions as quickly as possible this is a question for for the whole panel i want to hear what are your thoughts on what the future holds for ethereum with regards to things like payment for order flow or exclusive order flow and how how that could evolve well that's a big topic so i think there is um there is a massive interest from the from the industry to introduce solutions that would allow to to monetize transaction flow to uh start playing a very competitive game between the players so if we hear now that uh infuriates role now is to to really look at the network as the health of the network not not interfering with it um i think there is a lot of appetites to to change it in the future and at the same time from the car development perspective there is a push to prevent it uh as much as possible right so we can think of the split between nowadays world of mostly public mempos and and all the path towards the private members which if we compare here the builders and potentially create the ways of creating advantage as a builder and then whether it's a private order flow or payment for order flow this properly enables the the builder centralization uh so i think that's the dynamic of uh of the fight for public memphis accessible mempo uh and the private order flow payment for the flow uh will be an interesting game to look at and whether whether we'll be approaching it from the perspective of uh just economic models or or maybe some cryptographic models so introducing uh properly private encrypted transactions um i think if you if you listen to justin drake earlier today this this are some solutions towards that um and yeah probably the next two three years we'll be showing how that grows is the future of exclusive order flow and payment forward or flow a good one is it a bad one is it somewhere in between how do we assess this yeah it's myself i'm in the interesting place of just constantly looking at those two two different paths and i'm wondering uh if i look at them from the perspective of this market payment for the flow markets creation but also from the perspective of the core development uh is it good or bad um it might be unavoidable it might be something very natural and saying that this is what the open market of transactions is but if there is some very neat solution that is that is protecting everyone against this isolation separation of uh transaction pools into multiple containers that would be great to introduce it so so probably the challenges on the cryptography cryptography research um that would be better uh if the solutions are not neat and just creating a very bad user experience then probably wanted to to continue for a while to to see how it plays by itself yeah similar question around payment forwarder flow exclusive order flow maybe even preferential access maybe it's not about having exclusivity it's just about you know getting the transactions a few milliseconds before before the competition how do you think about this okay and that's my personal view first of all i don't think it's bad it's not some it's not bad in a sense that we must prevent it okay i can see use cases where it's good for example if this is benefits the user so if it's if it's for example when you use a submit a transaction that's an option that the user can pick and the user will say i don't mind sending it to a specific a few builders and giving them a few millisecond difference if they are going to pay me back this is not a bad thing for the user so i don't think that we want to treat it as something that we must find a solution and and completely avoid that's the first uh that's the first thing second thing is i view that as an infrastructure issue okay so it's kind of like uh some or at least at least some some some builder might pay and maybe blocks out will have some some some solution around it some might pay for a faster network to get some of the transaction and that's going to be a a decision that the the builder as the user may you can make a decision if they want to upgrade their network and get a transaction faster or they want to use the peer-to-peer and get it get it slower the most important thing is that we are not uh we are not delivering a some transaction just to a few uh to a few builders because they are paying for the service but everyone are getting their transaction if somebody wants to pay to get them faster that's it's kind of like why am i running with ssd and not without this because i want to pay a little bit more and get faster performance do you have any thoughts on payment for flow overflow so i'm far from qualified to really have an opinion on this matter um i really come from a web 2 infrastructure world and i do a lot of that in fiera so to be honest today for me has been learning about mev and all these things so i don't have an opinion but what i like is that this conversation is happening um i mean these are things that exist just kind of by default in trad fight um and and people just kind of accepted them but it's coming to the conversation with you know situations like robin hood and you have more people trading and then it's found out that like oh how does robin hood make their money with zero commission trades it's because they sell your order flow off to people right and so now people are starting to think about it like well maybe maybe we don't like that maybe we should come up with alternatives and i think this space just has a lot more interesting conversation in in re-evaluating what we should do which i like so there's this um this idea or this concept of decentralized block building right so we could be in the future in which um a lot of the block building a lot of transaction aggregation the exploration and searching of mev and the block construction happens in an integrated sort of vertically integrated manner and then an idea in which like maybe there's a way to decentralize that avoid a future in which a single entity is is doing this entire pipeline and says an ecosystem of of entities who who are are doing this entire pipeline so my question is like if we believe that the future it will be brighter under a decentralized block building future what are the properties of the platform or what are the properties of the of the um the system maybe you could say the the market structure what what are the characteristics that it needs to have to uh to succeed um i'll let anyone pick up on that okay i think um we should keep thinking about the the security of the network um and not not only from the decentralization perspective also also the fact that um that you have end up uh sorry you have to end up paying proper rewards to to validators miners for not so long more but validators for sure so there are many other risks of like what will happen really with the with the borrowing yields versus the securing the system yields and and whether we'll build the tools to to protect us against it and the same thing will be with uh with the block building so if all those dynamics will lead to the insecure system then we have to act very quickly we have to predict it we have to plan it and use whatever tools we can um what other properties really for block building i think we want to democratize it right so if if we think that there is some value that should always be uh that they will always be extractable right like say simply uh unavoidable uh arbitrage so misalignments of decentralized exchanges um the the positions to be liquidated and so on so all of those um natural functions of arbitrage of mev extractors that are actually desired by the markets uh should be uh should be executed as fast as possible like you don't want to wait with liquidation for two blocks just because you introduce some mechanisms that democratize it that liquidators want to want to execute fast and the protocols want liquidators to act as fast as possible because their products are at risk if not liquidated quickly so so you have to have mechanisms that that satisfies the satisfy those requirements and by democratization i mean that anyone should be able without too much of the capital allocation to to build a builder relatively efficient builder that's uh that will enable that extraction decentralized in what way uh probably through again through privacy maybe some solutions using in the very distant future the fully homomorphic encryption uh maybe in the short term some hardware solutions like like trusted execution environments yeah i can continue so i agree i think the capitalization is is key okay if we want if to make it success we don't want to end up with a with five builders we want to have thousands we want to have a hundred if we're going to end up with 10 100 we want to make sure that as i said earlier the the the simulation the process of building the or proposing the the block building the block is something that a thousand or hundred of builder can can do and the network i fear is going to become a bottleneck okay we landed we landed in ethereum and we landed well we sing it in polygon with a hundred of uh of validator and and the block block propagation started to become a become a plot a problem with seeing it in bsc that's a huge huge mess the network and if the network will become a problem guaranteed there are not going to be hundreds of uh of a block so we we need to make sure that the infrastructure supports a a scaling in in the in the block builder and that will again is going to allow us to get to where we want we want to to be the good thing is i think after the match we're not going to be in a stage where we have hundreds of uh of a builder so we can we can approach it in this two stages the first stage is let's just let's just roll it out learn from a learn what is broken and fix it quickly and i think that will allow us to get to where we want to be i have personally two questions with regards to decentralized block building which which are a topic of mine and they're the ones that keep me up at night one of them is how latency sensitive is the system like is it feasible to believe that there will be network communication in between the actors in this in this pipeline in this transaction supply chain or is the system so latency sensitive that the only way to go about it is to co-locate every single role next to each other in the same server rack um so i want to talk a bit about latency sensitivity and in these systems and the direction that we see things going uh yes i could say something on this i think in general and with the previous question too a lot of it comes down to the user experience and also educating the user um so there's always a lot of focus in crypto at the protocols and sort of the web three side uh but if you send a transaction uh your choices are send it to you know infuria.io uh run your own node send it to that directly and then it gets gossiped by the peer-to-peer network or those are basically your only choices flashboss protect rpc right right rpcs right but so exactly it's still it still is an end point and you have to provide the user with a good experience to use that endpoint and so you called out the metamask issue uh and so i believe in metamask it is possible to set a custom rpc endpoint but it's not a clear ux it's not using the main net network like you would expect and so we need to improve those user experiences so users have the options and the knowledge of how their transactions are going to be routed and we also have to do things at the boring web 2 layer to make things work better we can't necessarily rely on a peer-to-peer network which has you know indeterministic behavior to propagate out your transaction to off the block builders responsibly we maybe need to give the user in where they first interact with the network which is at the client the ability to send the direction directly over the web 2 mechanisms that we know working or secure https to multiple block builders that satisfy their their latency you know requirements their privacy requirements etc so i think i think some of these things are simpler to solve and they're really just coming down to user experience and design in that level maybe a final question as as we're running out of time um the other question i have about decentralized blog building is will there only be five block builders or will there be hundreds or will there be thousands and a big question for that in my mind is you know would it be feasible to just run an open source version of a block builder and remain competitive with with all the other block builders um i think you know as a as a as an infrastructure provider you guys have put a lot of time and investment into scaling your system to deal with just like the sheer load and you sort of mention this a bit i think block builders will have to figure out this um this like immense amount of of transaction throughput and how to deal with it is there a way to build this this highly scalable infrastructure in a way that is um that is open source in a way that many many different actors can run or is that like a fundamental constraint on block building that that will lead to centralization well okay so ignoring maybe the details of block building and assuming that uh to run a block builder it's going to be similar to running an ethereum node and having to scale that i think it's really hard i think that's why we exist i think that's why we're successful that said we've always been thinking about how to decentralize the infira experience of being able to run your own rpc in a way that is easy that can scale well uh we are working very hard still on that idea um and i think that will come into block building and just this whole ecosystem in general i think that a lot of the you know the the nodes where you actually have to interact with them are just not designed with that true intent of making them easy for many people to run and so we're trying to figure out how to do that we hope we can figure it out we hope that results in you know tens of thousands of block producers as you said block builders but we'll see yeah if i think about the the most most probable scenario um there are multiple hints that would point at maybe a few few block builders uh so rather five uh if you're saying is it five or ten or hundred uh and also like coming back to payment for order flow while we say that maybe it might be undesired again there are many hints that suggest that this is also unavoidable path until until we find some very very powerful solutions so again this would strengthen this impression that still be just a handful of blood builders but now if we say that we have this very desired property of democratized extraction of mev then the question is among those five builders will it be a builder that will be playing for a specific actor and and all the extraction will be for that actor or the builder will be actually representing uh multiple users and the access to the builder block creation will be somehow democratized for the systems like flashbacks relay and so on um and again will there be some solution like like i mean vsgx uh will mev boost support it enough for the flashbot system uh to make sure that we won't be really too worried that it's just five builders even uh vitalik's paper the end game talks about just a handful of of builders and then really tries to address it like in the in the future like this uh can we really create a system that is still uh satis satisfactory for for everyone and and there we go a bit further like it's not only one chain it's possibly a block builder it really looks at and multi-domain mev extraction and and you can already imagine the complexity of the system grows right so the builder doesn't build only one block but really looks at multiple chains together and requires to have a very good understanding of the market very good access to all the transactions that possibly are spawning across multiple bridges domains and so on um possibly we have to read all the all the research materials from flashbots on multi-domain to to get better understanding of this as well all right so we're out of time thank you so much to the panelists give a nice round of applause and uh yeah just parting word for the audience i think block building is just at the cusp and it's like a new entrant into the space i expected something that we'll hear a lot more about and talk more about in the future um so if you're interested in some of the topics that we discussed here uh there's so many open questions so thank you all for attending thank you so much [Music]
