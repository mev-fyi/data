all right shall we resume yes let's do it should we maybe start from the beginning or would you just like to continue uh i think we can go ahead great sorry for the interruption everybody uh but i hope that today's show of the dashboard is worth it so again this is the overall activity of the flashbots network um i'm going to try and go a little bit quicker to save time but we have a a little bit over 2000 unique searchers that have used flashbots um and uh these are the folks that are sending transactions to the flashbacks network we quantify someone as a unique searcher if they've sent over 20 unique bundles to the network um and this is measuring signing keys in the relay around 45 million dollars in minor profit has been made by miners that are receiving flashbacks bundles and running mevgath and that is profit after opportunity cost is taken away which amounts to about a 5.2 percent increase in minor revenue per flash watch block that a miner is running and we've had just over 90 000 about ninety one thousand different flash blocks which we call blocks included uh with flash bundles included in them we have around eighty four percent of uh hash rate that accounts for the miners which are running in evgef and receiving flashbots bundles we can see here a couple statistics on bundles submitted versus forwarded um the interesting thing about this is over time at the very beginning it seemed like the rate at which bundles are forwarded to miners was fairly high the reason why we wouldn't forward a bundle in clash box relay is if it failed a simulation if it had reverts or if it was not profitable for a miner to include it in a block and so over time this started out pretty high and then since then it's oscillated between 20 and 40 percent and it's on the uptrend over time and on a week-to-week basis we're getting a little bit over three million different bundles from clash bot searchers it's pretty cool of that 3 million a week something around 14 to 15 000 end up landing on chain and in the last 10 000 ethereum blocks we can observe roughly 35 or so of those last 10 000 blocks have flashbacks bundles included in them and we're using up just over two percent of the total ethereum block space uh in the blocks where flash floods bundles are included so if you take the gas limit of a block and you look at just particularly what part a bundle is capturing that's about two percent trending down over time but a little bit of an increase recently if we look at searchers you can see that the number of unique searchers that have landed on chain has been increasing month to month pretty drastically last month we had rapid adoption from searchers so we've gone up from 44 different unique searches in the relay to a little bit over 600 that's about a 14 or 15x increase slightly less from contracts and eoas that have landed on chain but still a pretty drastic multiplier here and these are specifically looking at searchers that have landed bundles on chain the numbers are even higher if they haven't had bundles included on chain and you can see that split over time on a week to week basis here on the right and it's interesting is it it sort of looks like the searchers who are not having bundles included on chain are getting weeded out because the percentage of searchers that are getting bundles included on chain is increasing over time so searchers seem to be getting better this also does correlate in some way with our hash rate too you can see the distribution of bundle gas prices here so this is looking at uh the gray gray line is the tail gas price of a block so the least profitable transactions within a block and then the other colored lines are green yellow blue and red are different parts of the distribution of gas prices within flash floods bundles so the very top of flashbot's bundles distribution the 75th percentile or higher is this blue line the median is the yellow line and the lower end is the red line here and the very minimum is green and you can see pretty consistently that bundles are priced way higher than the tail gas price here which ends up in profit for the miner and this is another way of looking at the distribution of gas prices instead of looking at like the variance where the 75th percentile and 25th percentile is this looks at the particular numbers um and the frequency within particular days so the the big red chunk here you see is the percentage of bundles that are over 300 gray gas price which is about 46 and then a couple of other i encourage you to go to this chart and like hover over the colors and look at it for yourself it's pretty cool and over time our average gas price of mind bundles is 671 with a median of 316. this is pretty cool uh oh i'm gonna change the date really quick we have leaderboards that look at the total amount that different searchers have paid over time to miners it's very difficult to quantify the profit that a searcher has made because that implies that you can look at many transactions in a scalable way and figure out how much they're making and then how much they're paying to a minor and this is especially difficult if there are multiple different transactions in a bundle researcher makes profit so we think that we have a scalable way to do this but it's not quite done yet and in the meantime since we don't have the searcher profit we are using the amount that a searcher has paid to miners as a proxy for that you can see here on the left the top searcher eoas measured by the usd that they paid to miners a couple eoas are getting up into the millions of dollars paid to miners and the average miner payments is on the left so some of these eoas are paying over seventy thousand dollars on average to miners to have a single bundle included which is pretty wild uh contracts the numbers are even higher which makes sense searchers will use multiple eoas for one contract and our top searcher here measured by the amount of usd they've paid to miners has paid over seven million dollars to have their bundles included over time to the miner to miners and there are i think 11 different contracts that have paid over a million dollars so pretty pretty interesting numbers um these are different graphs that show uh sort of the distribution you can look um just kind of eyeball and see out of the top 25 eoas what percentage of this pie are they capturing versus everybody else it's pretty top heavy so the best searchers are really good um disproportionately so compared to others and you can see that um compared to the minor rewards that they capture eoas cap consume relatively less gas than everybody else does so this 41 percent here is only 34 which implies that the top uas are much more gas efficient and i won't go through each of these but i do encourage you to take these transaction hashes and plug them into etherscan because they're super interesting these are the top bundles of all time measured by the payment to miners so we have a bunch of different bundles that have paid around two hundred thousand dollars uh and a bunch over a hundred thousand as well i'm getting a red screen i don't know what that is can you all see my screen still it's red for me too oh i'm gonna re-share sorry about that everybody yeah it's it's working now thanks alex and then you can also see uh bundles with the largest number of transactions in them which is pretty interesting too a couple searchers have gotten over 20 transactions included in their bundles so lastly we have some really interesting metrics on miners as well uh first looking at the total profit that miners have made from flashbots again around 45 million which you saw on the network page of which 35 million has taken place in the last 30 days and it was the most profitable day for miners on flashlights yesterday uh and miners profited 30 i'm sorry 3.3 million dollars from flashbacks bundles in the last 24 hours which is pretty insane um this works out over time to about a 5.5 increase in minor revenue you can see here we were a little bit under half a percent for a while until march with an uptick in searcher activity uh which has been steadily increasing over time and we're oscillating between six percent and uh 5.5 percent or so now it's another way to look at the profit over time but a cumulative graph the total amount that we've paid it's pretty cool seeing this the slope change and go up over time and also the average minor profit in usd per flashbots block looked at uh the daily averager last month we paid out 22 million dollars in profits to miners and already in 13 days in may there's been 20 million dollars worth of profit from flash watts to miners so obviously going to crush this number and here is the daily minor profit that miners are making from flashbots bundles you can even go so far as to dig into the individual miners so if we look at yesterday spark pool profited about a million dollars from flashbots yesterday alone and you can look at individual pools beyond that too yesterday this is again a little bit over 3.3 million dollars and digging into the distribution of usd profit of flashbots blocks so about the way that you would interpret this chart is 57 percent of blocks pay out a minor profit of between 250 and 2.5 thousand dollars to the miner and if i didn't mention it already you can click this button at the top and get all of these graphs in either eth or usd depending on your preference so we have gas prices here this looks at the gas price with the red line flat roth bundles and then the gas price of the transactions that are displaced by flashback bundles so the tail gas prices uh and it's this is a logarithmic chart and it's very clear here that the red line is much higher than the yellow line so um miners are making more profit by including these redline flashbots bundles than they are than they would be by including the least profitable transactions in their block which are being displaced to include flashbacks bundles in transactions if you smooth that out and look at the medians over time this is how that graph looks so again the purple line is is clearly dominating over the blue line blue line is the transactions that are displaced the tail gas price and then the purple is flashbacks bundles these were pretty tightly coupled until march with an uptick in searcher activity and then they diverge and over time have been diverging even more it is very interesting because we see that this purple line it reacts much more than the blue does to increases in gas price so gas prices increased yesterday and you can see that the purple line just shot up far more than the blue line did and the difference between these two um is one of the inputs into the function of minor prophets you look at our the different minors that are mining flashpool flashbots bundles today and the percentage of hash rate that they account for i won't dwell on that and then the number of blocks that individual miners have mined which is pretty cool this is per 10 000 blocks you saw this on the network page 2 but this is the percentage of 10 000 blocks that have flashbox bundles included in them so in the last 10 000 blocks there have been 33 percent of those had flash bots bundles included so about 3 300 of those last 10 000 blocks and again like many of our other charts starts pretty flat in an exponential increase around the time of march now we're sitting around 30 to 35 percent lastly you can look at the top flashbacks miners measured by the total heath that they've earned so spark pool um who has a lot of hash rate has been paid around 20.4 million dollars in many miners have made over a million over time and the average miner profit per block as well the last thing that i'll mention is if you're interested in the definitions and like uh some of the caveats in this data the data coverage or data sources that is cataloged within the data and metrics page so now i will take a second to check out the chat i don't know if we have time to take questions right now or what your schedule was tina um feel free to take the question in the chat and then we'll move on to v0.2 okay so nas writes is it possible to see what languages searches use whether it is in go yes or python or maybe something else and no not it's not possible to see this from on-chain data but i will say that the searcher's channel and our discord is very leaky people love to talk about the work that they're doing and if you just ask people will probably tell you what languages they're using so join our discord and yaz i think that's how you pronounce your name you say why do we consider a searcher account unique if it includes 20 bundles minimum the reason for that is we identify searchers using a private key that they sign their bundles with before they send them to the relay and it's very easy to generate a new private key it's trivial you could do it in moments if you wanted to so a searcher could be generating a new private key for every single bundle and signing those bundles if they wanted to but if the searcher is consistently sending bundles with the same unique key over time it's probably the same person or at least there's a higher likelihood that it is the same searcher so this 20 bundle minimum is a threshold that we set to try to get at unique searchers instead of just searchers using random signing keys for all of their bundles any other questions well maybe uh answer the question from this and then we'll move on yeah so now it says wouldn't searchers want to use the same key that way they are more likely to get included you are right in spirit we want to introduce some form of reputation to the system to encourage that kind of behavior of people using the sinki over time in practice today we don't have that implemented um so we're still working on what the right mechanisms are for reputation uh and and right now that's not in our system um yep thank you for your questions tina i will hand it back to you all right uh well thanks for everyone uh question this is v0 of the uh flashbacks transparency dashboard we hope that this will eventually phase out our transparency report which was also just released i shared a twitter thread thread and the last uh tweet is the transparency report so um feel free to ask us any questions and as you can see there are certain things such as identity center's reputation are the things that we would love to get community suggestion on what is the best approach um in digesting and in defining these metrics that can make it useful for all of us um however let's move on uh from this exciting new dashboard release to our upcoming flashbots core v0.2 release and i would like to um invite stefan to uh share a bit about the changes that has gone into this version sorry that i just clicked um yeah sure yeah happy to go over it so um b 0.2 is our latest uh release of the fatwas core infrastructure that we've been working on it aims to provide mainly bundle merging and introduce that to the system such that it increases minor profitability but also provides searchers with a higher hit rate um which allows for multiple searchers to compete for different opportunities within the same block we've been working on this for a little while now and we are nearing the completion date we decided to remove a couple features from the release which we uh received feedback from from the community on so the proxy payment contract which uh aimed to provide a more reliable accounting for um for payments as well as introduce a method for future additions to the feature set so basically allow us to modify the smart contract and introduce a way to smooth payments over time but the community felt there was still some designing and exploration that should be done so we decided to remove that from this release do you think we removed was the ability to submit full blocks from um from a relay to the miner the reason why we wanted to release this one is because of the complexity of the changes on the miners node which could cause some consensus errors and so it was sort of a high risk feature which we felt we needed more time to to test before releasing so remove that too but we're keeping bundle merging we're keeping better connections over web sockets um and and some of the other goodies in here so strict profit switching which is which is optional um and and tesla infrastructure as well as uh sharing and getting feedback on the fair market principles okay so um if we have searchers in the chat here you'll be aware that we've started the searcher upgrade phase um which is going to go on until um may 24th um and then on may 17th is when the miners will start their upgrade so on may 17th we'll code freeze the mev guff and relay code base publish a formal specification for all the miners to start to implement and then over a period of two weeks they'll sort of do a rolling upgrade the goal is to get to may 31st having upgraded all the switchers and all the miners to the v0.2 architecture so this sort of covers a bit more about the step-by-step so for for the for the searchers what you need to do to upgrade is pretty simple all you need to do is change the interface uh through which you're communicating with the relay and that can be done by upgrading your um the the library that you're using if you're using the ethers library or the web3pi library if you're just sending raw rpc calls then you'll want to look at the new rpc parameters format on on our documentation to make sure that your submission is up to date deadline for for searchers to upgrade is may 24th but we encourage you to upgrade as soon as possible since um there's no uh there's no downside to upgrading early um so yeah and then on the minor side we have a bit more of a stage release so on may 17th when we do the code freeze um this is when miners receive the code and they can start implementing it reviewing it we asked the miners to set up a parallel deployment so that they have both v0.1 and v0.2 deployed at different on different machines with different ips and to provide us with with the ips of the v0.2 nodes the reason we want to do that is have a clean way to fall back if the miner experiences any issues without uh causing downtime for the for the minor so these parallel deployments uh will start coming online from may 17th all the way to may 31st but we won't um stop we won't send v0.2 bundle flow to miners until may 24th so as a searcher um if you are sort of expecting to see your bundle start to be included um with uh with other bundles in the block or you have some conditional logic based on the pricing functions uh change you'll you'll see that those will change on may 24th is when we do the cut over and then between may 24th to may 31st it'll just be about making sure the system is running smoothly uh while still having the v 0.1 backup and then on may 31st we'll tell the miners hey you know everything's great you can now shut down your v0.1 node and just move forward with p0.2 so one of the things we've been working on is the fair market principles which are a set of guidelines and best practices for both flashbots as well as anyone participating in the flashbots infrastructure including including the miners and mining pools on how to maintain a healthy ecosystem for mev extraction and so the principles cover uh correctness of how the system is implemented fairness of treating all sort of participants equally finality so not doing some kind of funny stuff with uncles and and re-orgs to try to maximize profit but instead to maximize chain stability and privacy around making sure that the bundle content remains private and then some of the best practices are more around how do we make sure that we have high system reliability and in the case of bugs or critical failures what is the uh the response path and then penalty and remediation is basically if some of these are not being followed by the minors we may disable temporarily their bundle flow just to make sure that the system isn't compromised until we we are reasonably certain that they are back online um and implemented correctly so this is sort of our approach to maintaining a a healthy ecosystem within the early stages of our releases so as many of you are aware i'm sure um v 0.2 is still part of our alpha so the alpha is all the v 0 point series and these include incomplete trust guarantees so slowly over time we want to replace all of these guidelines with hard cryptoeconomic or cryptographic guarantees and so we are on the second step of our roadmap towards achieving um the full set of guarantees that we we've set out to achieve so there's definitely some more upgrades to be seen in the future that will iteratively improve these guarantees great thank you stefan um any questions here for um uh what we're about to release in full force um and uh and feel free to continue to uh drop your questions if they come up in the site chat uh and we should move on to um the research update alejo would you mind give as a tldr on the priorities and uh what we've been working on sure um so uh we've done a lot of work especially on if two and what then the changes that are coming uh in ethereum this was a work by alex and thomas and collaborators so the first item there was a a presentation uh thomas and alex gave in the global event so what mev looks like or will look like after after the merge and how validator rewards will be impacted by by mev extraction i encourage you to check that out um then there's a coming uh post extended post by by alex that he has been working on for some time now on on mvnf2 and this is upcoming soon to be released um where all the world the the content on that presentation is expanded upon its uh super interesting topic the ldr of that is that actually validators can expect to get much more uh rewards uh if they extract mev um the second item there is a a hackathon in which we participated as a team and thomas and edgar from flashbots people from nethermine and people from lydo working together on on liquid staking they actually won the hackathon or were among the finalists but there was some condition that meant that they won so we're super happy about that and yeah i encourage you to check the prototype demo there's a there's a video online where they they explain their their work essentially it's a the very early proof of concept of how um the mev landscape would look like and will be extracted by connecting the the nethermine and node uh with the freshwater system and and using the light of staking for eth2 so super interesting work and very impressive they put it up in no time so finally we had an mvv roast also and as you see like as i said most of the topics were around uh if two so uh this past rose we had was around scaling ethereum so not only h2 but also l2s and how what the mav landscape looks like there super interesting there were several talks there and two panels um if you if you haven't changed if you haven't participated in that roast do check the the video uh and if you're only coming to the community events i encourage you to also check our our roaster super interesting events are more technical they they go into which of uh all these problems our future challenges will face us as an organization and with the with our auction system so um uh i i now will talk a little bit about the flashback research priorities so we are undergoing a little bit of a revamp of our github research repository where we keep this uh the list of topics we we work on and we have the process for grant issuing that we that we do we should grants for external collaborators to work on on some of the topics and so some of the i won't go through the entire list here but some of the uh highlights there is uh first the auction design um so um surya an external collaborator has been working on surveying the work for around auction all the auction literature and how that would apply or not to our our uh problem so we essentially the core of flash watches is an auction system to match the researchers with the miners so there's lots of super interesting design questions there in particular what guarantees we can give to the miners what guarantees we can give to the to the searchers so there's um really really interesting problems there they're seeing problems we find so i encourage you to check the the research repo for more details on what the questions are on auction design are and second topic is cryptographic privacy and as it was mentioned before one of the the approaches to um try to deal with uh with privacy so right now you know we're running a flashwatch relay and and and so that's necessary because uh the the bundles searchers uh send are not private so so we ultimately want to remove that and and ensure a privacy property so so we have a we have issued a grant to hashcloak the hashgraph team who is working already on trying to tackle this problem right how can we provide some cryptographic uh guarantees can you go back here um some cryptographic guarantees to to to provide ensures privacy of searchers and cryptographic privacy i don't know why the mev stx is under this item so currently the way we're working towards um doing the the guaranteeing privacy is using secure hardware so that's through an implementation of the auction system that's semi-vs gx we have an eth research post coming up on describing the the the prototype system we we want to build next steps will be to start the implementation of that and check for feasibility in terms of lag and and the the the delays and the sex module inserts in the system so i want to make sure that that's not an issue and if that's not an issue we'll go ahead and start building an auction system depending on secure hardware and and so that's upcoming for people to provide more concrete feedback and but we will soon also begin with implementing that um as i said before uh there's other ways around um around this the product of privacy so mvvstx is one but we don't want to be fully reliant on secure hardware so we're also exploring crypto economic uh alternatives to it and that's a much uh much earlier question in the in the research process so again i encourage you to check the the research repo for for that if you're interested in uh in this problem in particular this interacts a lot with the e2 scenario and some ideas around whether we can use validate or keys to to ensure privacy so that bundles are sent signed with the validator key so only the validators that will propose a target blocks for the opportunities can decrypt these these bundles um so yeah there's that's one one one alternative and validators already have bonds so they will be slashed if they fail to fail to behave as expected so as many questions on how this can be how this can be done and whether like the if two um setting where we already have like a bonds i can be leveraged to actually do mv extraction and ensure privacy without the secure hardware so as i said before lots of work on l2 and if two and there's a research post coming uh coming up by alex on eth2 more work needed on l2 and finally first sequencing that's the will be the topic of our next um uh workshop or roast um as you know some people have been saying that uh flashback we're like enabling thieves by by making the the the auction more efficient uh so we we we've responded to that to those those critiques but we do think that first sequences is a valid alternative for exploration so when i do try to pursue what what the limits are of first sequencing then i encourage you to read phil phil's post on on mbb what do it's a recent password uh tackle this question the ldr it's very hard to say what's fair so whenever you say fair there's a person saying defining fair so so it's it's it's it's hard to try to build a first system if you don't have like an unbiased definition of fair so yeah that's the uh i don't know that didn't work that's the the the research update in a nutshell and more if you find more there's more there's other topics i haven't covered here but feel free to go to our research repo and check out and ask questions in our in our discord research channel as well um i don't know if there's some questions in the chat if you have any questions i always give it back to you tina thank you alejo um i think a lot of i i definitely see a quite a few researchers here um so i would be uh i would love to hear some of your questions on research and on a lot of the things that we just presented uh for every single community called it's always been such an exciting but almost felt like an information dump because so much has transpired and we just don't have enough time so um yeah any questions that particularly around our learnings a lot of learnings around east 2 um or on um essentially the uh uh the upcoming engineering updates as well as engineering roadmap or the questions around dashboard wow quiet day maybe i think let me um ask a couple questions um before we um yes it's all about the dogs um so like i think a couple of things that are very interesting we could share a bit is one is insights on prototyping the um uh me be on eth2 with uh sticking um uh essentially with uh staking contracts and second uh uh is to share uh kind of alex would you be able to share a bit of insights on our discussion um on eth2 and the second question will be uh for actually robert to share more insights on recent bot activities that you've witnessed could be fun to um kind of share with some of the searchers and researchers sure um on each two um so we we've given two presentation one with tomas who is representing nethermine but is also working closely with us um and once the week later at the mev rose that we ran at each global and so we've shared some of our initial findings there which are quite interesting especially it seems that uh running a system like flashbacks in e2 is very doable and it would rely on the same software um and by this i mean the the ethernet client would still be used and so something like mvvgaf could still be used in these two contexts so that's been quite interesting um and then further to this kind of exploratory research tomas edgar from from from from our team and uh individuals from the nether mine and lido team have um kind of prototyped at the it's global hackathon or their rayon is a hackathon on the 2 test net that was set up uh what that would look like um and so we got some some insights there that were um interesting as well a bit of the specific insights alex right so i mean while theoretically you know it's it's relatively simple there are more uh there are more players to think about when you think about how the mev uh rewards are are split as well as ultimately the the block proposal is changed from the uh the miner to the validator um and so the the the block is while it's still underneath one block it's still proposed on on east 2 and included as part of an eth2 block or beacon chain block and so there are there are complexities there in how the mechanism interacts the kind of mev flow and the tip flow mechanism works further to that i think there's a lot more interesting questions to ask around how resilient the system is and how resistant could it be to to potential collusion or like malicious behavior um and so i believe the hackathon team is presenting now at the final and their their work is is shared publicly um and then in addition alejo mentioned there will be a post soon uh outlining a lot of that research uh in more details as well as expanding on some of the interesting topics that have come up from from their research not only from the implementation side but also from from other aspects of what mev needs to might look like and how the landscape might change well thanks alex i think there's so much happened in that it's very hard to kind of uh digest all of it uh in uh you know five minutes so um i think uh you know check out our post uh when they come out um and uh continue to follow us on discord and if you're a searcher or a minor please pay close attention to our release channel um i think that's um a great way to end today's call and thanks everyone for staying with us despite the um the zoom bombing event happen thanks everyone thank you for joining thank you everyone thanks bye you
