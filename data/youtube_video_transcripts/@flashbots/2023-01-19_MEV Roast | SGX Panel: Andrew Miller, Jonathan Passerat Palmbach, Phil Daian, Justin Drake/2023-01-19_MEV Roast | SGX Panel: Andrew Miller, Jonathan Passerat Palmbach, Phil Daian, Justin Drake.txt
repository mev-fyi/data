and next we have this spicy sgx panel um with Andrew Jonathan and Phil so I guess I'll just go ahead with the the Segway so I guess the fact that we don't have this this Merkel tree kind of memory Integrity with the new versions of sgx is that kind of a deal breaker almost for survive whereby uh you know Suave is meant to be reasonably decentralized and trustless and now we're saying that the the enclaves might need to be run in Google cloud or like what what is going on here I mean even if there's no Integrity checks it's possible to do mitigations from the applications that are using it but that would require being um very careful about it um and it's not really just Integrity because if you could you know uh uh tamper with the memory while an enclave programs running you could end up tampering with um you know some access control things that it's doing so it could affect privacy as well as um Integrity in that case too um but I've been a broadly that's something that can be mitigated I mean your kind of line of defense would be to add your own Integrity you're kind of checking you know from registers that don't get paged out the the kind of related question to this I kind of most was excited to respond to is about like um the kind of difference between uh like the cloud use cases and the client use cases so like the client use cases are clearly being um uh uh deprecated no longer supported I mean the original or the origin of sgx was like for um like Blu-ray players and digital restrictions management you know anti-user technology I mean so that was the first time when everyone began hating um trusted platform modules Richard stallman would have huge rants about this so like everyone hated trusted Hardware from you know before then because of that really despicable use um so I think good riddance to the client side on you know sgx ones the cloud services though are like really getting a lot of use out of this and really want it so I don't see that going away like Xeon processors are still going to be supporting sgx of some kind they really need the Integrity checks you know too so that's not like a thing that's just not on their radar at all um and I don't think that the I think the real challenge is how the decentralized blockchain applications will be able to like blend in with the cloud use cases and act like good customers and and not do something that gets them on you know cleft out uh from uh the kind of support that the cloud services get yeah I mean I do think in terms of suave like obviously any product change to Intel sgx like affects the the plausible deployments um I will say like Suave does not require perfect privacy or Integrity necessarily the goal of using sgx and Suave is like partially as defense in depth to iterate the status quo um it's not the same as let's say using sgx for consensus or something like that in that like if you do manage to to Break sgx um and perform any of these attacks like you'll be able to kind of get an advantage in Mev which certainly might be profitable for a short term until people notice um but it's not the not really the same as having your secrets kind of permanently leaked to the world or uh uh you know your consensus protocol falling over and losing billions or something like that um I think this is like part of the loss of subtlety in like the sgx world is people love to have like very binary views on sgx like either it's broken or not either it has Integrity or it doesn't either like you can use it or you can't either it's applicable to blockchains or it isn't and to me there's like a lot more subtlety in terms of like what specifically are you using it for and does it kind of stand up to that use case um so a few things is like number one in in terms of blockchains I do think there are still blockchain use cases specifically in stopping a lot of these actors that like you know maybe are a little bit stronger than honest but curious like rational but curious actors uh from kind of uh having as much incentive to get an edge and I think for that it actually could work really well no matter even if the barrier is small even if the iterated game is messy like it's still still could work well and even if that kind of guarantee fails once in a while if like a really kind of sophisticated attack gets pulled off so that's like my general answer for Suave for like all of this um of course as Jonathan said in his talk we aren't like sgx Maxis or anything it's just part of Defense in depth would love to like explore other tees would also love to have fhe and you know um although I think you know some some separate spicy panel to be had there on like the gap between kind of where we're at today and where we need to be to like actually in my opinion be usable so maybe I ran into too much I guess one more thing Andrew's question about how blockchain slips into the cloud stream like I don't see why we wouldn't be able to do that it seems like a lot of what people are looking at sgx for is like privacy preserving machine learning um and things like that um there seems to be an analog in like this real-time Financial optimization to like Cooperative AI to like privacy preserving AI so you could possibly see all these use cases like converging in some way and also I think the nice thing about uh Mev specifically is it's like a constant real-time problem so like whereas a machine learning problem like Android key swipes or signal contacts or whatever other machine learning problems you might have you kind of like do it once or like do it a few times or once in a while here you have to be doing it constantly and the more computation you have the more you're doing it so really Intel should love that in my opinion if like their business is to sell Hardware um so maybe that's how we like slip in uh by just kind of making demand for their products real yeah that would be welcome I guess because I I think like one of the pragmatic chat and then just as well is that you know it's pretty much only Azure uh as of today that that gives you uh the the all the flavors of it that you would like uh so it's not it's not great either for for decentralization to just like take it from the ends of Intel to put in the hands up yeah you did you did lag a little uh Jonathan I don't know if it was just me but uh I think yeah yeah I I agree with the the sentiment uh um when people are lazy and love clouds but there's nothing stopping you from uh getting an Ikea rack and hosting your own Xeon Processor it's not like they're completely out of range yeah and if you're an Mev Searcher and you want to do a lot of this like local like wide scale optimization it seems reasonable to like in the long term uh you know you're basically an infrastructure provider for crypto uh so having like some server grade Hardware seems reasonable to me um again not to say it's the ideal status quo where obviously we'd have magical encryption but I think maybe this is another spicy take uh like it seems like all the alternatives to sgx introduce other gotchas for blockchains to me so like MPC being the most practical example uh MPC has like scalability issues and like the size of the committee it has like a really high bandwidth requirement and also it's like much more efficient if you have low latency or if you can like co-locate so all these to me seem to be like equally bad to like sometimes uh breaks if like Intel screws up and or someone spends like a few million for on some like really good phds uh but maybe I'm wrong that's just my spicy tape Robert covered a bunch of those on in his talk some of those challenges with it I mean the um a lot of the most optimized ones um and this is kind of the thing that we found we've been doing this retell project there's a post about it that's like our MP speeds on uniswap kind of a amm and it's an amm because that's the most complicated thing we can basically get to work that's practical with MP speed it's like a really simple operation and it was you know a challenge even to do that and you know we wanted some notion of like robustness like availability so that's just what you expect with a you know a blockchain system but that's not the most desirable operating system NPC people tend to prefer the maximum privacy and they'll have very systems that just topple over if any node fails so all of like the really hot interesting uh protocols where they're making the big speed improvements are mostly in the dishonest majority or and out of end sharing setting and then those just aren't applicable if you want something that kind of acts like a blockchain with its uh redundancy and a fault tolerance on the topic of photographs I have a question for Phil about survive like presumably there isn't like one Master T that's you know running through after this uh like some amount of redundancy and in that context um if one of the t's is is compromised and breaks privacy like how do you detect which and we observe front running happening how do we you know narrow down who took account of the the committee of of T operators yeah so this is a great question and the truthful answer is we don't know yet so we have kind of like the Privacy abstraction for Suave and like a few deployment scenarios with trade-offs I don't think we know exactly what we're going to go with so we'll probably have more kind of community conversations about what makes sense there uh you know the trade-off kind of being from like more distribution but like less attribution and like wider attack surface to like more centrality and or layering even like reputation or committees that would in my opinion be bad but you know we'll put it on the table so like these are like the ranges of like options you have on who to run it certainly one Central party is not good so like we might as well just not I mean I guess it adds a little defense and depth to trusting flashbots but we definitely want more than one and they should be like different economically uh kind of uh separate parties that that provide like competition and diversity uh so that would be like the bare minimum ideally we distribute it so like everyone's phone tons of swap node and like the whole thing is like this chaotic Global process uh same with ethright like the dream is to have that phone validator and like practically you probably land somewhere like in the middle as you like strive for that thing I would imagine okay I understood I really liked with Suave that um you know that Suave has this goal of using um uh you know enclaves for this disintermediation goal like you really want to use it like you'll run this in order to prove to all the people that are using the system that you don't have the ability to you know tamper with it um I I think that's really cool that that's kind of rare in the sgx I think kind of application where like people seem to be really satisfied with just getting their own data results back and not trying to um you know prove that they don't have these uh uh centralized controls left so um uh it's just really cool to know that that makes me think that the sgx based like blockchains and you have that as a common goal and maybe you know some progress can get done I think no one's really done this kind of end-to-end job of looking at the entire like chain of validation um you can't just say there is remote attestation you have to have some process by which people in your community are actually looking at the remote attestations uh for the sake of a spicy take here right the the same issue is like with um arbitrum and other l2s like they're built around a very complicated um you know audit protocol that handles the edge cases when something goes wrong and you need to process a fraud proof but it's hard to go find like visible you know examples of that and follow that process and see it working that's something that's not unique to the sgx space but that you know everyone should probably do a better job of you know validating their their source code and Publishing their transparency information where it's usable but it's especially needed for this use of um of sgx and maybe you'll solve these problems if you need them for Suave and everyone else can use them too I have I have a have a fun even spicier take which is which is a little bit of a troll take which is that like luckily we have no on-chain privacy in ethereum so you can also use like funds flow to do a lot of your you know statistical analysis and stuff like that like that's how you back out centralized exchange is cheating so like you would have these same Tools in Mev land like if you were getting bad execution uh you know you could see like who sandwiched you on a chain or like you know who was accessing perhaps in some cases it may be non-attributable and then like you're really screwed but uh I don't know um in many cases you may be able to to kind of divine misbehavior um foreign is around latency and I have a personal story to share so um we recently launched the ultrasound relay which is this kind of nonsensoring relay and uh they're actually another non-censoring relay which was launched at the exact same time the agnostic relay and we basically have the same setup we're running you know the the the flashbots uh code base and it turns out that for some reason that we're still investigating we're simulating blocks to roughly 200 milliseconds slower than agnostic and these 200 milliseconds mean that we have a roughly uh a 2X penalty over agnostic so we're including on chain we're winning the the auction like half the time that we should be um and so my question is you know if if latency is just so important for ibv like how can sdx win because presumably there's some amount of performance overhead like maybe you can't do all the fancy overclocking and you can't get the the latest and greatest uh CPUs and whatnot um yeah I'm curious how how do you reconcile latency with sgx yeah that's a that's a great question well first of all I'm very glad to have you in the relay game uh uh so that's like amazing thank you for running a relay and I also think like part of the challenge in the future is like co-designing the protocol parameters so you can do things that like have somewhat of a latency penalty if they're like considered qualitatively better and like maybe because of the way like the the timing is structured in the protocol or something there's like somewhat less of an impact obviously there will always be some Edge to having higher latency that's like not something we can just like magic wand away completely um but yeah so I would say like number one we should minimize the uh the the latency impact number two we can lean on uh ways in which the decentralized tech is stronger to compensate for latency so if you have uh if you have this like uh um privacy kind of edge that allows you to optimize transactions better for users and like you can attract more economic activity if you have ability to optimize cross domain Etc in a decentralized way where people actually trust you to like do this optimization then maybe like the latency penalty exists but like it's overcome by these other factors so like really look at like what is the strengths of the decentralized thing and can we like amplify those in enough of an edge to mitigate the latency penalty because the more decentralized you get also the more latency penalty so sgx actually doesn't have that bad of a latency penalty especially if you provide Witnesses you're basically just executing the evm with like you know not that not really you can provide State Witnesses so you don't even need to do any memory swaps in like some cases um and uh that can have like fairly low overhead like you said you do lose overclocking and some other Edge enhancements um I think that's within reason like there's already a lot of overhead in the building simulation process to kind of get this decentralization and get this merging of many different Searchers from around the world with different edges into the most valuable block so like we're already kind of used to paying this latency for Network effects penalty and I think sgx specifically is okay um I do worry like as we push it more towards fhe or something like that and or even if we want to do like we have some magic new NPC protocol with fairness that works like and the latency penalty becomes bigger we would still probably want to switch to that as a community and how do we make sure that those systems stay competitive I think that's like an L1 design question also yeah I think I think there's two there's two ways to see it as well like um if ever everyone has to pay the same for killing that uh creating like a an edge to to some of the users so I think the most important thing is to make sure that you know if there is such a penalty everyone should be in the same in the same setting um and in the esgx case uh to to answer your question things to be somehow uh is you know again as long as everyone uh as long as everyone is in is like in the same setting I think it's it's not such uh of a of an issue uh yeah Jonathan your audio was a little a little shaky but uh I guess I'm saying like my connection is like really bad no worries um but I guess yeah I guess what you're saying is that if everyone's paying this penalty then everyone's uh kind of equal uh but I guess what might what might happen is that we'll see maybe a a centralized private mempool and then Suave and then someone will do profit switching between the two and then the centralized one will just always win um because it has not only maybe a lower latency penalty on sgx but also it doesn't have to deal with the peer-to-peer gossip channel the blah blah is like straight you know end-to-end TCP connection from from one point to another um but yeah it will be as you said Phil you know it's a trade-off space and uh hopefully the the the forces lean towards decentralization I hope so side note little known fact this is like one of the reasons we run a centralized Builder so that like a we're forced to compete with ourselves and be that like if we do uh release something decentralized and we like shut it down it's kind of like a statement to the community on what we think uh the protocol should look like even if there is like a slight dip in profitability for a while um so that's that's like one of the reasons so I guess my next question is around memes um sgx has this this bad reputation which might be warranted or it might not be but it's kind of there like isn't isn't that a a Tailwind for for adoption um by by Edwin sorry headwind thank you curious to hear Andrew's take on this in the now yeah it is a headwind um it's it's weird I mean even in like the research publication it's a lot harder to get like a peer review paper accepted on sgx because there was a glut of papers that were really boring and just said here's existing paper we just forced it to run within sgx and didn't have so much else to say so there's even just a uh uh you know a headwind towards um you know getting past that I don't know I mean it's it just seems weird to me like clearly it seems to me that there's more gut reaction like overvaluing the uh concerns about it that it's it's far swung the other way I hope it swings even more like I don't know if we're at the bottom of sgx negative sentiment maybe we can go even further and uh catch the drop on the on the way up I mean it must be the I mean my experience is that there's still just a ton of low hanging fruit of critical stuff to look at so I get the sense that like very few people are looking at this I mean the ones who are get kind of diverted and turned off so quickly that they don't even get to the good bit so um you all are here and I'm glad to see that you're all are uh uh working on it that way so hopefully we can um uh improve that all around yeah it's absolutely like a negative a sentiment but it's an opportunity too yeah I totally agree with that and also uh Alex's points in the chat um I think the first crop of sgx companies were very much like ooh shiny new tech toy like let's just like plaster this on so like every single problem Under the Sun and like try to raise money from our VCS uh which is like a common pattern in Tech it's like okay iPhone comes out with a new notification type like what old ux patterns can we just like plaster this onto and have like a new you know fad basically it's like the same idea and I also think that turned a lot of people off plus obviously there are some fundamental issues it's the same thing as with crypto right like there's a lot of people that think crypto is a scam and like f all this like it's just like all rug pulls and like the tokens are not legit they're all Securities whatever other argument you might hear they're all kind of true to an extent right like all the arguments they wouldn't be memes if they weren't at least a little true the same way all the bad sgx takes and like all those memes they are a little true but like they both things I think lack nuance and so I'm glad yeah that we're having this conversation and that there are people working on it because I think the next generation of companies is not like the shiny thing companies it's like uh we we have an actual need and like we've gone down many paths and there's really no choice for this like weird crypto intersection that's like still better than like something that's fully trusted um and I think in that Niche like there's actually a lot of practical gains to be made um again like as a company like that is that we're being very practical about this we're not like we are an sgx company this is our long-term goal is to like sgxize the world it's just like there's not really a choice and like yes there's a major headwind that's also an opportunity because it means like everyone else has the same headwind and if you're truly convinced that it's the right thing to do and you're correct and you pay the headwind then like that is what an opportunity is also so I think it's both um yeah very excited about it I had a lot of fun talking with a bunch of people that I met you know when doing this kind of uh unsolicited of secret Network so I mean it was neat to talk to the obscura folks a bunch of projects are using enclaves that don't consider themselves smart contracts but middleware of some kind so fala is one of them and it's a little confusing because even though they they're a middleware they still are evm compatible that didn't make sense to me until uh Suave is like that it's not to be a competing blockchain but it is evm man running in enclaves for something else um so they're doing something um and the guy from automata uh network automata is another middleware one but they aren't um I don't think they have open source code but maybe could be talked into it so um yeah maybe invite all of them to another roast it's probably the best way to go against uh the headwind is to keep on doing like anything in the open uh transparent events uh making sure position is well known and like being the first critics of our own design choices I think your audio is amazing now by the way Jonathan so whatever you did worked so I guess my next question is just trying to assume the the worst case as Andrew put it which is that this uh you know what what if there's a vulnerability that makes all the attestation keys you know leak um so that there's just no security uh guarantees anymore from sgx what would be the plan for us to have is it that you you fall back to the to the current model I guess and does it mean that uh yeah I mean I am sorry uh so yeah I think I think I think there's like a few options that are like really practical from today uh you kind of summarize them there's like decentralized that's what we have with flashbots and flashbots protect now then there's committee based uh you could call this like the chain link ish trust assumption something like that you can layer on some staking and call it decentralized also you can possibly reuse the each validator set these are all like ideas in that camp and build some sort of committee uh where you have like some protocol that Aggregates like multiple semi-trusted kind of inputs into like an oracle um you could also do privacy that way certainly um either trusting the kind of ore of like all the people you choose to trust and like optimizing their intersection that's very easy or you can use NPC to like trust the end uh I don't know if I reverse those or not I think it's right um so those are like kind of the levels and so yeah we'll have to probably kind of go to one of those options so probably ultimately the system will be like you know some will be configured to allow you to fall back to this if like uh sgx is broken it would be sad though I'm very bearish on committees and this is why I think sgx is the only choice just for the reason that in Mev given that the the brakes aren't falsifiable and the incentives are so high and there's a kind of positive incentive Boost from being on this committee if you're also a Searcher or a builder that to me makes me very bearish on like those trust assumptions actually holding especially under like stress so that's why we we think sgx can maybe like patch over that like paper mache over that a little bit and so I would be sad if we had to like fall back to that I guess I think that there's a very interesting assumption uh in in what you've been saying feel is that were you able to identify this new vulnerability vulnerability and act accordingly uh and I think that that's what happened up until now in in sgx right it's mostly been uh academic or white hat hackers that like like end with papers that went through the process of like disclosing the vulnerability to Intel so that they could act accordingly even though uh we can we can debate like the update process afterwards um what's what's maybe more interesting and I'm not saying I've got an answer to that is that if the stake became so large that some people do not have the incentive anymore to to go through this process and but but on the other hand to try and exploit these new vulnerabilities that they've discovered then we could be in troubles because then you you have like this asymmetry again between users that that exploit and uses that pay the penalty uh basically so and I think again like to lean back to your to your paper um it's kind of like interesting to see uh and try to to Coast uh how much it would it would be to to mount uh such attacks I think that that would be a very interesting line of research to try and estimate the cost of like you know breaking these in this aspect of uh of the technology yeah I've always said that that's what's like a few years ago that that's like what's missing from this whole sgx conversation like we don't understand the economics of all exploits like it really depends on like the marginal cost to break additional chips like whether sgx can be secure at all like is that zero for all exploits or no I don't know maybe you know if anyone's done research in this uh Andrew or Jonathan but I'm not at least aware of any it's not really my area but I'm a fanboy of all the uh uh people that do this vulnerability research uh at that level have you seen this on uh uh YouTube from Linus Tech tips Tech tips on the like a tour of the Intel uh debug lab debug lab is like the spookiest phrase in the context of um sgx because what debug lab means is they have a big laser thing that'll burn off the top of a production chip it turns a production Intel processor into an fpga they can rewire the logic of the chip by beaming it with powerful lasers in their debug lab and they gave this little tour of it to a famous YouTuber and um you just it's nice to put like a a picture of it to the uh to the myth you know the uh it must exist myth but you know that's what it looks like that doesn't answer the economics question I don't I've heard people say things like a hundred thousand dollars is what it would cost to get access to that or like the one place in University of Florida that can do it or something like that so I don't know the details um should definitely we should be trying to find those because that would fit into this kind of analysis yeah I will say like our one leverage Point here is like a lot of this can be punted to Intel so like they have PR skin in the game uh not that we should and we shouldn't answer these questions but they also have skin in the game and like if someone does build a secret sgx lab to break Mev and they succeed Intel's PR is on the line as well um so presumably you know I think the relationship between the uh crypto Community including uh y'all and the blockchains that are doing this I think should try to present like a United uh uh lobbying block to Intel so I mean one of the lessons in the sgx.fail paper um which like Daniel and Christina and others have been kind of tracing down this for you know a much longer time it's a much broader Point than just the the blockchain setting but um no one understands TCB recovery that well none of the you know relationships and things that you do afterwards what it takes to get early notification or not are so clear um so I I don't know what my guess is that it's possible to do a better job negotiating and informing this relationship with Intel you know by acting as a cohesive Community rather than just a one-off startup project one of the things that uh struck me you know when you guys gave answers is that you didn't mention AMD SCV as a potential replacement for sgx if sgx is completely broken does it mean that SUV is maybe not appropriate for for Suave well first of all I think that the TCB is much larger so that's like regardless of like that the properties of the of the hardware itself the question is like whether you want to trust a relatively small application Enclave size or whether you want to trust the whole virtual machine that there's absolutely no loopholes that could be exploited in there um and I guess that that also maybe we should not address all of these Technologies under the same name I'm kind of like I'm not very happy about you know anything falling under the t uh name I think a lot of these texts are now becoming just like confidential virtual machines uh and we should we should clearly make the distinction between between them two it's it's not it doesn't mean that it's bad fundamentally but it's like we should not expect the same uh behavior and like security properties from from two different like Technologies basically yeah I would say like that being said like it could iterate into something useful like if they see a market demand and you know I don't I'm not like fully bearish on AMD or any other tees like it would be great to have more diversity if we had multiple solutions that work for the threat model maybe we could come up with a protocol that like you need to break both to get anywhere uh and that would be nice um certainly I think like in the same vein as like the the Asic for any delay encryption function that uh EF may do like maybe one day the EF or other crypto companies together build a tee that's like open source um if this actually does end up becoming critical infrastructure that we can't replace and the other avenues don't pan out so these are all like yes they're all kind of like on the the research radar but I think as Jonathan said like today uh less attractive for various reasons although we have talked to some people recently who are bullish on on uh AMD kind of eventually being enough for this use case you could also maybe even jury rig like the iPhone Tes plus like Apple's authenticity check if you do like a Network that has like enough attestations for your Economic Security maybe you could get security out of that I don't know um but yeah uh things to think about but I think less immediately obviously applicable than sgx guys thank you so much for your time I think we're over an hour and 10 minutes over so it may be time to wrap up thank you all yeah thank you thank you Justin thanks everyone that was right spicy moderation and yeah thanks everyone that was really great thank you Justin to our tireless Road semester that was awesome thanks Sarah for organizing thanks see everyone later see you guys bye bye
