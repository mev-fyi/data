foreign in 2019 after which I joined the ethereum foundation in 2020 we started the robust incentives Group which is a research team looking at some things that have to do with crypto economics in Via theorem protocol like proof of State consensus cip1559 Mev more generally mechanism design we have a new home page which is a work in progress that has all of our work I encourage you to check it out my goals for today is to give you mental models for vfu protocol kind of tell you who does what and why a bit of speculative discussion on alignment because I thought this would be the theme of this conference I talked about them for quite a bit actually for maybe the last year or two as principal agent problems and I realized that yeah it's very much related to to these questions that people are asking in sales like what David was presenting on commitments and so my goal is really like a zero of audio information transfer just tell you what I know and maybe later you can tell me what you know and we can add in it and we can find a common ground so let me start with this idea of seeing like a protocol it's something I wrote about a month ago and I wanted to address partly of course the questions of first where does protocol credibility come from because we talk about credibility a lot about okay it's credible when ethereum does it it's not credible when you do it after the ethereum and so I was really wondering okay what do we mean exactly can we find like a definition that's maybe more actionable um and what is the capacity of his credibility so how much budget we have for credibility what what is the the constraints that we have and how much can the protocol defend if if the protocol has these credible mechanisms and then what is the relation between ethereum and other domains that may reinforce or may attack The credibility of ethereum mechanisms directly so this is in a post but I'll give you let's say the tldr and I I start from this perspective which is that the ethereum protocol is an object that is set up by a community which is fairly diffused you can think of them as the stakeholders of the protocol you have this idea of the rough consensus type of governance where people are making updates we try to figure out uh yeah what do we want out of the ethereum protocol and we leave a goal as I think of it is the decentralized provision of block space for users to achieve maximal welfare so this block space is what users are using to make transactions interact with programs deployed on ethereum and they do that because it gives them some kind of value um and and if you want to achieve maximal welfare the let's say corollary is that you want to achieve minimal rents for whomever is running the platform and so to achieve this goal of decentralized provision the protocol partly delegates its execution to set a validators which is here it's already you have kind of like three parties and so you have two relationships with Community setting up a protocol and then the protocol delegating that execution to the to the network of validators and so there comes the first problem and investor can often be saying is misalignment because I'm not exactly sure but perhaps you can tell me after uh but the first alignment problem is I see is how do you ensure that the validators who are kind of the ones that are delegated to the task of running the protocol do that in a way that is synergic with the goals of a protocol and so two things that I observe is really when we talk about uh credibility or when we think about protocol we think about these two concepts the first one is protocol introspection so it's vid where the protocol is kind of trying to gather credible signals of what's Happening how people are interacting with it how the validators are uh yeah the quality of the job they are performing of the whole protocol and so the credibility of this signal is very important because when the protocol is going to want to use this signal to respond to let's say attacks or to defend itself or to promote something or to lower or raise the price of entry into the into the chain and so that agency path is very important it's really the how do you make these signals actionable to some extent and so these are opportunities so you want to use this introspection and this agency to essentially have this protocol that satisfies your goal but these are under a threat so one thread to introspection is that the validators may want to attack The credibility of the of the signal if they find that it's rational for them to do so for instance they could do this and I'll go into that a little bit more later by credibly committing to rational majority attacks and and if you have structures that allow them to make these credible commitments you may find that some of the mechanism that you have in protocol they are not stable any longer and one thread to protocol agencies when you defend certain outcomes as a protocol it also means that you're becoming very prescriptive like you say this is what I want to be realized and so when we are very prescriptive about outcomes uh we may end up optimizing for the wrong thing which as I understand is a big question when you think about AI lines like what is exactly the thing that you're trying to optimize for and if you said you Optimizer wrong you might have like very weird second effects so I see let's say a few places where misalignments may happen in this talk I want to focus on on these two the first one is the validators May subvert protocol consensus so they may try to capture the network and extract more or all of the revenue for themselves that's the first one and the second one is validators may try to subvert user expectations who come to the trade with some kind of economic need or they want to do some economic interaction but the validators who execute these transactions they may be in a position to enforce the worst possible execution or the worst possible conditions of the execution of these transactions and that dilates to some extent the expectations of the user so the validators are not aligned with the users you don't get this maximal welfare for users that was your original goal misalignment which is that you set up the protocol and he turns the earth into a giant mining Farm uh but I won't talk about this one today and so is there hope I think so this is how I think about let's say realignment uh with proof of stake protocols specifically it's actually possible for the community to sort of intervene to step in and to root out validator misalignment which is essentially forking out validators from the set that is currently operating the protocol so what you want to do is as a community you want to commit to a course selection which is why you set up the protocol in the first place you say you know now if your protocol is running it's out of our hands the punishment is automated the signals are given by the let's say environment it's credible and so you want to be as kinds of as possible and say you know is there a rules the open source you can see what will happen if you do this and so you want to have this introspection and this agency that's really the First Defense that you that you have but if you find that your validators are trying to actively undermine either of them well you can still come in and provide this defense of last results and so this equation that I write is The credibility of a protocol really comes from the ability to have this introspection the ability to respond to signals via agency and then at the back you have this defense of last result which is that you have a community that set up this thing in the first place and if the thing goes Haywire maybe you can try to realign it um based on this and so what I find interesting is I was reading the open problems in Cooperative VI paper we talk a lot about this idea of Institutions and how you have institutions that are defined essentially by the norms and expectations of people who interact with these institutions and what I find here is that when I talk about this community and these kinds of Last Resort what I'm essentially saying is that we see a theorem as an institution and we're willing to defend the goals that this institution has set up for answers any questions so far any comments I'm curious if everyone is stuck familiar with the concept of like about the data yeah yeah it's a good question and I have a handy slag okay okay so yeah I I can talk about this when uh right here actually let me I had another question okay and so you say you make this point in the local misalignment that uh rather that it is very support user expectations and I would quite understand what you what you mean um I really mean like Mev so you come in with your transaction you think you're going to do a swap and big given the best price uh and then you end up being sandwiched yeah I'll go into that but one a bit more yeah or is something more diffused you know okay like that it's a question that comes back often so on the one hand I think there's a this idea that maybe you want to have like a constitution and you can say these are the things that we really want to happen like we never want people to destroy the credibility of the basement which I'll talk about a bit later um like you you set up for yourself you want to write down precisely the thing that you are willing to step in and do if you do that it means that now you're telling opponents I'm not going to step in when you're going to do listening and so there's another Camp which is more or the idea of governance which is that you know it's better if it's a diffuse process because first if you have the Constitution and if you have a set of people who write it like who who's that said the people who's the committee that kind of makes these decisions uh so yeah I don't know whether there's like a single answer but definitely it's uh I see like these two let's say polarities in the in the debate yeah yeah do you think yeah uh our resource approach works on Royal Vader sub Style roasting wise yeah I think that could legitimately be some conditions maybe I can talk about some of them as I go through more examples in the talk but for instance if we saw very details consistently messing up with the timing of their decisions we could essentially try to step in and say okay you can't really do that yeah but yeah that's a good question maybe I can come back to that once I have more examples to give so all right I was going to skip that slide but so what's a validator so validators are essentially the people who are running the the network so ethereum is a distributed system it requires consensus over the state of the chain and this is done with What's called the proof of stake based mechanism who participates in that mechanism these agents are called validators and you can think of it as first class protocol operators they're the ones who are ultimately responsible for maintaining a single view of The Ledger and to do that they produce blogs and they are accountable for safety faults so whenever there are different use of a network that exist perhaps because the chain has fought they would be responsible for bringing back the state of the chain into like a single view that everybody agrees on thank you a bit more precisely how they do this so to become a validator in ethereum you have to look up 32 if in What's called the deposit contract and when you wait for Activation um so you have to commit some kind of non-trivial amount of money which would be taken from you if you it's into a bad job and the job that you have to do is first you have to propose blocks so every 12 seconds somebody sampled from the validator set and they're asked okay now you make a block and you include the transactions that you see that are pending and then more regularly the validators are expected to provide attestation so they give value of the network they emit a single message that says I believe this is the head of the chain and I believe that these are the blocks that we should finalize and say okay this is definitely part of history and we can't flock back uh before that and so you can think of it as there's a bit like two layers in the chain the consensus layer which is responsible of like coordinating people around this single View and the execution layer which is responsible with the transactions and the execution and these economic interactions that users are doing on the chain let me please please idea validator accountability is that the protocol essentially specifies rewards and pentatives so whenever you produce a block you get reward for the production of that block you get reworked these people vote on your blog and you also get transaction fees that come from the execution payload so whenever users are making transactions these transactions are valuable and you get some of that value as a as a validator if you don't do a good job for instance if you're offline and you're not booting you will get this inactivity penalty where your state will be reduced over time and if you do the faults that are essentially attributedly very bad such as proposing two blocks that are conflicting uh you will be slashed and you will lose like a very big part of the stake that you put in the in the system and so that's one way that the ethereum protocol tries to align its goals with what the value detectors are doing by specifying these rewards and penalties and the question is well hopefully the blockchain that is output by the process of validators doing their job should match the specification of the protocol which is maximum throughput no not too much forking no validators being online and responsive and but that's not always the case foreign recently with some people in my team including Toma Andover collaborators so you have time in games for instance validators they could try to carve out more time there should be honest specifications that they're given to complete their duties so whenever I'm going to propose a block I can wait a little longer to accumulate more transactions that give me more feeds for instance but if I wait longer then via testers who want to vote on my blog they might have incentive to wait longer as well so we've modeled that in a paper and I just learned about faithful implementation from David's talk and I'm wondering if maybe this is related because you specify this protocol to run in a distributed system and you expect validators to run it but perhaps it's not rational for them to do so but in the in the paper we find that you can essentially find a Nash equilibrium that shows that yeah people would do the job in time and you can coordinate them but the larger point I want to make is perhaps highly sophisticated validators can figure out optimal release and potentially find even more creative ways to prevent overvalid vectors from doing their duties so try to extract as much money as possible that they can from these consensus duties over time if you have these very intelligent validators they will discourage the less sophisticated ones and eventually you will have a capture of the system by these very intelligent validators and so I think it shows you kind of a limit of the control that you have over validator set that not everything is seen and in particular time is one feature that is very difficult to have a credible signal for in a in a distributed system I mean question again as a mantle model I have is that the film protocol has some amount of control over the validators we have these rewards and penalties but it doesn't see everything that the validators do particularly it can very partially see the timing of the actions of the validators and because it doesn't have his full picture it cannot precisely align its goals with what the validators are are doing does that answer what the validator is oh are there more questions on the okay so now I want to that was pretty much about the first points like how do you ensure that value details are aligned with the goals of the consensus mechanism and now on the move to the second locus of misalignment which means that validators may subvert the expectations of users or may act I guess the alien try to extract value from the economic activity that is happening on chain so the protocol now ethereum offers with general purpose virtual machine so you have this distributed State replicated machine the developers write dabs which are decentralized applications the users send transactions to use this dat for instance sending payments to one another swapping items between one another doing some Landing all these Financial applications or domain names and when as the user I do this I do it because my this transaction has value to me so that the value of my transaction is essentially conditional on the execution quality that I get so if I am if my transaction executes quickly it's more value for me if it if I send the Swap and it executes at a good price it's also more valuable to me so all of this value is is really conditional and the validator meanwhile when we act as a block producer when they are sampled from the set and they're told okay now it's your turn to make the next block we really have ultimate control over what gets into the block or not they have the power to reorder insert or remove transactions From the Block that they build they even have the power to install their own transactions from Sony addresses or from their own addresses and so follows small amount of time they have really like control over the state transition function of the of the state of ethereum that gives them a lot of power and I want to talk a bit about the things that they can do with this to talk about it I have to introduce a bit of terminology the first one is how do we measure the let's see the load of computation in ethereum so it's done with with gas so when you are a user and you send a transaction your transaction is going to be executed by all the full nodes that are on the network and that kind of track the state of ethereum so your transaction may use let's say compute if it does some basic operations it may require some storage capacity like short-term memory State accesses of the history of all the function calls that were done by the transaction and it may also have like impose some uh bandwidth load on the on the network because if you have a very large Block it's going to take more time to get through the network and so all of these are physical resources that are expanded by the by the network when it executes the the transactions and so these execution payloads so the list of transactions that are contained in um in the in the block they consume some gas which is a measure of resource use and you don't want to set the gas limit to high because if you have a lot of execution then you'll notes on the Chain contract the the execution fast enough and so whenever you see a block in ethereum it will tell you well the gas limit right now is set at 30 million and it will tell you how much gas and the the block has as used of the transactions in the block has has used and so now if you think of your valid details as block listers I think a nice Mountain model is to think of them as almost like market makers between these two sides so on go one hand the protocol is kind of giving the validators the supply of gas it says now it's your turn to make a block and you can make it with as much as 30 million gas and on the other hand you have the demand from the user so we come with their transactions their transactions have some demand for the physical resources that gas represent and the validators are in the middle doing that market making between the the two sides of that and what happened is we output blocks as a result Studio another mechanism that we have in ethereum is called eip1559 it was deployed in August 2021. and since the deployment the ethereum protocol is able to quote a reserve price you can think of them as pricing dynamically the congestion on the chain and the way it does that it's a little bit like uber so if you come to Uber and there's a lot of people who want to get rides at the same time it will quote you a higher price same for ethereum when you come in and there's a lot of people who are also willing to transact at the same time uh the protocol wants to to give to say okay but now you have to pay you have to pay more than you would usually pay and the way you get that demand signal because again we're in this decentralized environment when Uber does it they have a centralized seller they can just observe the request from the app but when ethereum does it you don't trust the block proposal to quote the price fairly so you have to ask a question about the credibility of that auction and the way that you get a credible signal is you say well we're going to Target a gas user 15 million so we will set the block limit to 30 million so we'll set the block limit to be twice what we are targeting and if we find that enough transactions are willing to pay the current reserve price it means that the current reserve price is too low and in that case we're going to increase the reserve price we use a very simple update rule here and same goes in the other direction if I don't sign enough transactions who are willing to pay the reserve price I'm going to fill my blog under the Target and then I will decrease the result price and so over time you're trying to learn what the current congestion price is so the inclusion of transactions there was quite a bit of work on the incentive compatibility of that mechanism this paper by teamer of geldon is probably the ultimate reference and what it says essentially is that when you're quoting that reserve price and you're saying well transactions that are included in this block need to pay at least this much you can't give back the reserve price to the block producer so otherwise we have room to enter into site contracts with users that would defeat the reserve price um and so you can't give it back to the to the blog proposal today what we do is we simply burn it so whatever we capture from the transaction fees as the reserve price is just removed from the circulating Supply so the user pays one if so the result price but one is sent to the bill it also means that you can't manipulate the the signal for free to include more transaction to pretend like there's a higher demand you're going to pay for it um as as a result price is not given back to to you so what this gives you is this credible signal of the congestion on the chain so yeah back to his mentor model the ethereum protocol has now the ability to provide gas and and give that yes to the to the validators it has some amount of control for instance it has the block limit it also imposes the use of eip1559 solve the reserve price but it doesn't control exactly everything so as I said earlier the validators even if they satisfy the cap 1559 Rule and the block limit we can still order the transaction in whichever way we want or insert there all in transactions so what I'm saying here is that that if it does have a privileged position on the network and and this previous position or the amount of money that they can extract from from this previous position is known as Mev or maximal extractable value in this talk I really think of it as all the revenue that's achievable by the validators from being the person who's controlling the state transition at this incentive time and that includes the revenue achievable by reordering consulting or sensoring transactions foreign that people have considered in uh in blockchains is the idea of congestion um because the the price the block space is calc um for Bitcoin there's a really nice result by uberman and what it means 2021 it shows that essentially the miners of Bitcoin who act as block producers they cannot enforce Monopoly pricing because of its decentralized set of block producers if somebody tries to impose this Monopoly pricing there's going to be pressure from other block producers to come in and kind of get that Surplus all that rent that the miner is extracting and so at equilibrium you'll find that Monopoly pricing cannot be enforced credibly by the by the miners of Bitcoin and now with eip1.559 on nefario what you find is that you can internalize the the costs of the congestion fees uh in the post office which means you can capture them and then decide to to burn them so yeah that kind of solves the problem of validators abusing from their position to child checks and Monopoly prices um on the chain and there's the second type of thing where the validators can do um and which which really relies on the idea that value details have a last look on on the transactions that they insert and they can capture value that comes from externalities of these transactions so the simplest type is I'm a user I send my transaction to to be included on chain and my transaction is a swap for some token against another token on a market it's my swap executes it will create a price difference with the second Market where the pair is also listed and so what the value talk and do is after including my transaction they insert their own transaction which performs the Arbitrage between the two markets and they just look at the difference it's risk-free Arbitrage it's just pure profit opportunity the validator is really in the previous position to do that so other users may try to insert their transactions after nine but the variable can simply censor them and add their own transaction as to so they are they have the party in the food chain who has like the the greatest capacity to do these things so hobby hobby tragedies somewhat harmless man it's it's a good Market function but there are things that the internet else can do right seem a bit more harmful and one of them is sandwiches and so take the same example I'm a user who makes a swap for token a against token B when I make my swap when I send the other on chain I typically say I'm willing to do it at this price oh let's say plus or minus two percent of slippage because I don't exactly know the price at which my swap will be executed it's not like a limit audiobook um and so and so I give Downs for the quality of execution of my of my swap but the validator is very adversarial what it can do is essentially max out the bounds that I give for my transaction and execute my transaction with the worst possible price at which I was prepared to pay it's kind of my fault I told them how little I was willing to get out of it but at the same time I come into the market thinking that you know this is my lower bounds but I hope that you give me the best price but what whatever is it all does here is it doesn't do that so how he does it is places the same order as we user before the user so that increases the price for because when the user swap comes in gets the work the patient possible and then the validator sales the tokens that they bought in the first place and that's called the sandwich because very details by his law so the user buys high and then the variator sells hide and so that seems like a problem and you need a problem especially when it's taken out of the pocket of the user but because you have this permissionless entry evaluators like you don't really have rules on who can give any data and because you have permissionless programmability that you don't want to prevent people from doing any kind of state transition you can't really outgrow this thing in the first place and there's also a fairly counter-intuitive result that is that sandwiches May create some actual Surplus sometimes it might be nice to have these types of thing in your in your routing of all those because it creates higher welfare for the user so you're really trying to yeah get the profits of this coordination without outlawing its entirely so just being there so today for validators to do this it's pretty hard validators are not assumed to be very sophisticated um you require for instance to know about this idea of Arbitrage to run some sort of uh program that tells you how to pack your block um or you need access to exclusive audio flow so users who only send their transactions to you and so what we've observed is that delegator started essentially doing a division of labor he said you know I'm not good at doing this job but finding like the best optimal opportunity so I'm going to ask you another party to do it from and this party is known as a as a builder so the builders there are parties that are specialized in packing blocks and extracting the maximum amount of value and you can think of them as a almost like a procurement auction so there are several builders that are competing to get included by the divery data and so the builders extract the value and they try to beat it away so convince the validator to use their block but today all of this is out of protocol and the market has just completely emerged and was induced by this network of very intelligent players so very sophisticated Builders and Searchers who are the one creating these bundles of sandwiches or Arbitrage okay this is my last section that is there any question at this point okay and so having shown you like the different ways that yeah some space of mechanism that we have in protocol all the kind of interactions that we see now I want to come back to this idea of how exactly is the process called credible and how do we defend these these mechanisms and maybe what are the threats that we that we see so as I told you um because the block construction was not really part of the ethereum protocol specification you was sort of left to the validators this question like how they make their block what ended up happening is that validators would delegate the construction of the block to a network of Builders and they would organize that market based on on an auction so the builders would bid to be the ones who are making the blocks on behalf of the validator and so now the question is well given that this Market is is happening should the protocol do something about it like should the protocol enshrine the market structure and Visa allocation mechanism and essentially place the auction as a protocol mechanism would that give us more credibility enshrining this Market structure is that something that makes the protocol more powerful in the sense foreign how we could do that is the really the idea of instead of having this out of protocol Market that's 2D organized by um let's say a set of trusted parties that are known as as relays you want to make the protocol to be the auction and and to have this permissionless option and if the auction is permissionless you can enforce that whatever you see as the highest bid coming from that auction is a bit that the validator has to has to select and so what you're trying to do here is you're trying to elicit the value that can be returned by the block and understand that value and place it in consensus so come to consensus over the value returned uh driver block and if you can come to consensus on the value you can also internalize it in the same way that eip1559 placed under consensus congestion price and internalized it you can hear understand how much value the block has and capture it and so the idea here is that when the validator makes a block there's a set of the testers who vote on the Block and if the block returns a value that's greater or equal to the best bid that they have seen then they vote on that so the reject blocks that don't return and have value and the value again is elicited via this permissionless auction and so what we do here is saying the protocol is the one that's going to guarantee the fair exchange between the block that the builders have made and the position on the chain from the validators and but here when we extend let's say the space of control of the of the protocol it also means that we need to extend the set of defenses that we have or we need to think about how exactly do we consider that mechanism in light of everything else that exists and and what I was saying earlier is this auction is only credible if a majority of their testers are honest so if only a majority of our testers honestly tell you what the value what the highest value they have seen is but what to see more work on is this idea of commitment attacks that may defend the credibility India testers are rushing so for instance you can get your testers to to commit to a strategy where they are not being honest with what they're reviewing then you might be in a situation where the mechanism that is in protocol is defeated and so what you see as your fans you want to ask is it essentially robust to his coalitions of validators attacking your mechanism miscommitment attacks it may be one way you can also have something like driving you could if it was rational for these people to be bribed and to report the wrong thing you might find yourself in a situation where the mechanism again is defeated and in this case is if you really care about the outcome of having a credible mechanism then it might require for the community to step in or to have another mechanism on top to to ensure the defense of the of the first mechanism but that mechanism again could be defeated in other ways and so what I'm saying here is that you have his shading fence which is the expectation of people regarding the film protocol that extent and now you're saying you know you used to have all these things to defend now you also have this mechanism to look at so the mechanism first is credible because it's incentive compatible against let's say individually rational deviations but if you have this majority deviation then you have to do something about it and and I don't think there's any mechanism that kind of defends that other than hard-wiring that outcome by the community and why this red let's say is kind of on top of our mind is we observe different protocol is no longer the only institution in the game and especially in the last two to three years with this Mev and with the value extractable just increasing by a sector of 10 every every year and there's been a lot of sophistication and a lot new institutions and and products that live in their environment that if the room is at and specifically there's a lot new applications and infrastructure that that directly have to do with the incentives or validators and so the validators now they are not just doing their job as agents of vfm protocol they also sometimes delegated the responsibilities by a community of liquid stickers who pull their money to activate validators they also have to think about Roll-Ups which are extension of ethereum to scale they have this relationship with the builders who are making the blocks on their behalf and there are also other things that that directly influence or shift the the incentive of validators and so given that environment which is highly Dynamic and emergent how do you design mechanism in protocol that that kind of stand the test of of being worked by these different institutions almost done well I wanted to come back to the user because I left the story with the user getting sandwiched and we are trying to maximize the amount that the protocol is getting from that sandwich and I don't think it's a very happy end and so how do we recover the how do we make the user defend itself um how do we create essentially credible mechanisms for the for the user to come to the chain and have their expectations realized without the validators being able to to mess with it we have the real tension here because we want to preserve the permissionless programmability which gives us the potential maximum coordination value so incentive sandwiches are part of the execution optimal path we might need sandwiches to be around but we also don't want to add like these defensive protections and constraints because they may destroy value and so for instance if we credibly commit to ordering rules we have to make sure that they don't lock us into a sub-optimal welfare outcome but are we lost I don't think so I think the the variators may have the last book but the user is the one that's essentially oh let's say initially signing the transactions the user has this power to commit before they act and before they they do things we see these examples more and more for laughing about other flow auctions where the user doesn't allow you to execute the transaction unless you pay them uh something first and that's something can be priced this level you can have IDs like contextual execution where your transaction execution essentially is polymorphic and can have many different execution paths depending on on how it's executed and you have a lot more innovation in cryptography and mechanism design that we are seeing in this space and so yeah questions are what are the Traders can we do these things in a way that is as trust minimized as possible and and who earns the rewards from having users coordinate better and I think this is what Shane will tell you about next yeah and that's it thank you again uh yeah I think it's a bit stronger yes so what I mean is when I don't want my transaction or my execution or the outcomes of my execution to be dependent only on the single person so for instance if part of getting good execution means that I wanna not reveal the inputs of my transactions or reveal them let's say um Darkly I don't want to have to trust the person I reveal it to like I'd rather rely on cryptography than somebody saying I promise that I won't tell so anything about you your transaction and so yeah we're always trying to think about ways to not have a single actor in this chain becoming a choke point or like a centralized party that suddenly has the power to to execute that outcome fairly or not so yeah trust me you might believe the idea of who is accountable for the for a bad outcome happening and if you have a decentralized enough set of parties you have more guarantees than other ones yourself very nice so we take first institution protocol the foundation and then maybe what did the Lord actually emerge it's only this problem or is it you know yeah so you mean should we protocol so the way I pictured it is the bubble expense so so you're saying okay I see this problem I see like the validators now we are entering into this with Builders and this is becoming like a systemic component of the way that validators are doing their job and so maybe I want to extend the bubble so that that becomes part of the of the film protocol is that your question all right this uh yeah yes so yeah yeah I think it's pretty harmful and it's definitely like what inspired on that line inquiry for me is asking myself what exactly do we want to put in in protocol so again like the benefit is you have more control so you can enshrine certain things you have more credibility um it does give you like more power to to do things but that power steams out over time and that's what I wanted to express with this fence is that the longer your fences uh logically becomes to defend because any single intrusion uh you might say okay if you really narrow your focus to a few things that you want the protocol to do maybe it's a bit easier for for that to be done properly but if you start adding like okay you sort of this and you take care of that and you look at this mechanism and you ensure that the outcome is not tempered with yeah your fans becomes longer and longer you put into protocol but you're like this is maybe more of a secondary nice to have thing but people attack this mechanism and you don't care about it because it was secondary in the first place but then it strengthens the confidence that oh we can attack things that are put in protocol and move on to like the more meteor or more like core mechanisms of the of the protocol I think it's yeah I don't actually think these are Game Theory questions we are making some design questions in the sense that these mechanisms have to be incentive compatible in the first place otherwise they're just not critical to begin with but then it becomes maybe more something like a political economics question of you know how exactly do you want to draw that boundary and what other things you want to include certain example where you think the program they send it too much not yet yeah thanks right now we're still pretty minimal but I do see that risk especially with the builders and the PBS proposal vehicle separation because it's a fairly new market and it's hard to tell if that will still be the mode of organization of block production in the future yeah but so far I don't think we've done things that we shouldn't have done I think we are late on doing things that we should be doing rather than the other way around and and we get quite a bit of lack on that too but uh yeah another question oh yeah yes that's a good one yeah it's obvious but um of the problem for example in the strategy group how do we compose those mechanisms yes yeah and the question of compatibility has been asked quite a bit uh more precisely especially in this thing so I I could like tell you a lot more about the relationship between these different entities but what's been interesting is that you have this option now between the builders and the validators who are trying to beat so that their block is included you have steel chairs who are also bidding from their partial blocks to be included by the builders and I was telling you at the end you might have these other flow options where the Searchers are paying the users for the opportunity to to execute their transaction so now you have essentially like three auctions that are kind of sequential and they're not just sequential like I show it as a chain but it's really like a network with a variety of Builders variety of Searchers and maybe like different tasks and so you have like all these mechanisms some of them may exist in protocol so yeah p1559 maybe you'll have this option in protocol in the future the Silverman will will rely or remain kind of outside of the the view of the protocol but it doesn't mean that they don't like you still have this composition mechanism and you still have like these different things that are happening and so I think having the correct language to talk about these mechanisms and especially like this idea of mechanism Innovation where anybody can deploy a new thing that kind of goes and messes up with the established holder yeah this is something that I think is very interesting yes I think also I think that a few months and I haven't had a chance to really forget their minds after this relate to the I got myself confused about how we can get into this work into that but um perhaps they can enjoyed but we've got um so I think of it this way you have receive a demand curl of the users our job yeah 50 notes very quickly so this is the demand curve of the users with ap1559 does is it tries to find like the so you you want to Target like this 15 million gas supply and he tries to find the price that that does that so he really takes care of like that part but now you can think of when the users are transacting they might have this extra value or when they transact the induced this Mev that is capturable and so now there was the Mev path is it it's it's really more concerned with but what's in there so what comes in the in the surplus of the of the demand and so you can think of eap1579 and this Builder auction as a separate volume that's yeah p1559 cares about the value of getting included by the user and the Builder auction cares more about the value from State contention oh um no so if you have a user transaction here let's say they have like the paper reads of price that's taken away when the Builder might compete over the tip so the user can add a little bit more value over the reserve price and when the transaction itself might induce some Meb and the Builder will also compete on on that yeah so the what's burnt is not part of the Builder auction it's called basically because yeah but okay and then I just asked one other thing so when we talked about the users having incredible power we were talking about them being able to control let's say the following action that was the type of thing you had at last yes okay and then um whether or not it would be um healthy to have it say multiple credible periosynical builders strange multiple credible Builders the different the marketplace and then users get to the cycle Bishop they thought that they want to use uh yes so yeah I should have been to the question so is it a good thing for users to have multiple Builders to choose from when the Builders of your credible services such as uh execution of the users yeah I think this is what we're heading towards so there's this idea of Builder services so the the builder takes care of your transaction in a sense and it provides some guarantees um about your execution it Returns value very soon with the order of reactions for instance it would be nice to have that you would definitely help us explore the visible space of mechanisms with respect to yeah that user commitment ID but then again the limit is that the builders are interested entities and so then the question is how do you make them less trusted and how maybe can you distribute the role of a builder across like a trust minimized infrastructure for instance um what's your definition capability like um we're saying but it's better than there's a war that they commit to uh which they will obey would be impulsively include in the walk and and probably say they will do and that's so they can they can they get how they can sense so they can do it so they can they can they can add they can sense so they can do a better detector yeah it's the rule that I'm going to use to decide about the sequence um I think credible in the sense of uh Lee and agbaku would probably be not trusted in what I'm saying right now yeah yes it was supposed to be broken take a question but not because otherwise if we take the break so I guess we got type of questions if you want but there's also a break uh when oh yeah thank you December again foreign finally um thank you a little harder thank you all right exactly thank you very nice I love it please supplements [Music] yeah all right I'm still coming good destruction thank you because everything everything thank you Society products dominant please um audience thank you absolutely whatever yeah thank you all right um good morning foreign thank you very much political Independence questions Humanity like um about tonight thank you okay thank you um Millions uh what time
