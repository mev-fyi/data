the flashbacks pm the m-e-m-e-v roast yeah you're good okay not sure who's for sharing actually but cool okay well hello everyone welcome to the 10th edition of mdb roast i'm tina one of the flashback stewards today my co-host rose master aka meme master tom smith will be joining us through his meme and his rose questions because he's super jet-lagged having just arrived in taiwan and it's already past midnight there and also shout out to our new friends and researchers joining from asia at this hour from the meb roast it's past midnight i recognize some of you there so um as a tradition all questions are good questions and every one of you who choose to do your own research can be our roast master in our pirate ship treasure map roads tradition we used to prepare rotten fruits and plenty of rum in case we don't like the treasure maps presented so i hope you have your cups of coffee and your critical minds ready on the lookout for our ecosystem so in the mbb rows today we will have three parts first a succinct update on flashbots followed by a mini roast qa session led by tokyo second yerim from b protocol will discuss insights from designing and implementing a decentralized backstop liquidity protocol and will be followed by qa and finally rose questions from the meme master tom smith and if we have time i would like to hear from those at the end who choose to stay till the end enjoy yourself and while you're here so um as i start um flash spots update from an organizational perspective um we are still going through the mvp phase of flashbacks and you may have seen or read from our blog posts that flashbots is a um came from a research collective and the research and uh development uh are the tightly coupled dual engines that propels us in a phased approach and so um we started out really in july and the first flashback original spec which actually has full privacy but we decided to um iterate uh simplify it um for the sake of iteration and to test out uh the validity of some of our assumptions so essentially what you see now what you see today um we have released um in november our proof of concept which is mbb guess and last week in january our engineering team has released the flashback alpha which consists of mv guest and mbb relay and in the next few months we will first release our ecosystem product mbb explorer and then hopefully we will be able to present a more decentralized and promotionless version which is flashboss beta and invite all of the searchers here to flashbacks olympics on the research side august was our first treasure map roast and this is the 10th so a lot has been discussed and a lot has transpired and has been thrown away temporarily for the sake of um iteration and where we are right now is um before the new year's at the end of 2020 um we have received five frps in our research repo our research process follows that of a eip process and our first group of mv subtitles were selected we expect the paper three specified on the flash box research roadmap which is also in the flashback research repo to be published soon and this will be published by phil who's on this call with his cornell collaborators and um the second um frp submission deadline will be on valentine's day so we will select our second sets of meb fellows in february and lastly we hope by the end of q1 we would like to have research paper 1 and 2 drafted once again all of the all of the roadmap and deliverables are specified in our flashbots github repo so feel free to check it out alright next steph do you want to give a quick update on flashback alpha which we released for sure um let me know if you hear me okay so the um flashbacks alpha super exciting stuff things have been moving quite quickly and and it's it's nice to be able to uh put this uh architecture on in the wild and and try to figure out what what impact it has um in an empirical way um so where we're at right now is we've done some initial testing around the mov guess with uh with some some miners and we noticed that there was some some significant concerns around the os that and and spam that we wanted to uh to make sure we addressed properly uh yet at the same time we felt that there was a need for opening it up for a broader uh range of participants and users to to start sending bundles um and so the intermediate solution that we came up with is this idea of uh flashbacks alpha where uh we are providing uh an endpoint through a through a relay that allows for searchers to submit bundles uh to the miners are participating in in this version um the the relay itself is in charge of doing things uh like rate limiting and spam protection and uh and is then relaying over the the bundle request to the miners uh so really the goal here is to start the bootstrap the the adoption um of flashbots both for uh miners and searchers start to get some feedback and and pave the pave the uh the road towards uh future iterations of the of the system so right now we're running with about three to ten percent uh of ethereum hash rate at any given time on the system um and scott will go a bit in detail about uh what the search experience is like right now and the types of bundles that we're seeing so going forward this is you know very much so the beginning of the development of this system um some immediate goals that we're focusing on solving is adding uh minor privacy so that you can have more confidence in the way that the bundles are being submitted that there's no way to um to steal them or or manipulate an auction with that information and then the second one is to improve the scalability of the system so that these issues like like spam and dos become less of a concern cool well next we'll have a sneak preview of mev explorer alex [Music] yes hey guys can anyone hear me or can you hear me take that as everyone yeah sweet all right um so mev explorer is an initiative we mentioned in our initial blog posts uh the search blog post and the medium blog post and it is essentially uh you know a public dashboard that we want to uh share with the community and maintain with mev uh related metrics um so uh we're gonna present it soon in the in the coming weeks but until then and relevant to this to this roast was two particular metrics we've been looking at so what you're seeing here in that first one revenue split by extraction strategy is looking at the total value that we've quantified that has been extracted on chain since the 11th of february 2020 related to a transaction ordering um and so it is this this extractable value that we keep on mentioning so the 124 number is 124 million uh dollars um and you can see that so this is this is quite quite naive uh right now and there's more work to be done which is why you have this this big disclaimer but you can see that most of the value has been extracted through arbitrage um about like 94 in this in this pie chart and um the rest is is liquidations uh this is particularly interesting the the split being quite naive is just liquidation in arbitrage for now so when you see arbitrage plus trade that is still uh arbitrage for the moment um but it's still relatively interesting to see most the value at least that we've quantified so far related to transaction ordering um has been extracted uh in in you know price price arbitrage and these these type of arb trades um one thing that we think is particularly interesting is is the the size of that number right 124 million dollars is is huge especially given that this just goes back to the 11 11 if you can go to the next slide um thank you so diving or i guess giving some more color into this this uh number 124 million this split we see above this is a split by protocol um the way the split is done is is you know because uh joey 124 million since the 11th of february 2020. so last year now um nice um so this is a split by protocol so because most arabs and and you know liquidations touch several protocols they're not double counted but the value is split between each of them equally so again there's some nuance to this metric but it's still interesting to see uh how it splits as you can see it's mostly a lot of value is split between different uh you know automated constant function market makers and automated market makers which makes sense given that most of the value is is is in arp as we've currently classified it um but it is particularly interesting and relevant to us even though the metrics are not fully uh you know um at maturity yet and we we we expect for them to be at that stage soon and we're very excited to share them with the community and provide more more uh transparency into what's happening there um what's what's i guess interesting to us is it kind of guides where we think people should be building um you know their their bots and bots that could potentially run run run on flashbacks right um so that's that's definitely interesting to us in that sense um and that's it so for amv explorer definitely stay stay tuned have a mf is mostly around flash loans uh yes flash loans and um yeah mostly on flashlights um i think i think i think liquidations is another place that ave gets a lot of like mav thank you scott yeah um the 124 is usd so we quantify uh a lot of this in the relevant token it's be traded on then we convert that into eve and then we convert if into usd using using price data um so again there's some nuance there and how it's converted of course but you can relatively trust that figure um so anyway i i won't dwell much longer on mev explorer we're very excited to share uh february 11th sorry uh tessa february 11th 2022 uh early december of this year um so it doesn't fully include i believe the the latest the latest blocks this is this is part of the disclaimer of the numbers being early estimates um anyway uh we're very excited to share more about explore soon uh we're kind of nearing the the final stages of iteration of the dashboard and uh once we share it with you guys to to see how you use it when what kind of other information you might you might be looking for and how we can you know add more metrics that will benefit the the whole community um i'll pass it on to scott for an engineering update on muv search awesome thank you uh so maybe search this is the category where we uh we're looking to bring on people who are running bots so a searcher is what we consider a bot that is using the uh the flashbots transaction submission endpoint uh and in uh to power that we've we've created a process to onboard what we call mev searchers this is a a form that they can fill out it's really really high level that will eventually allow them to receive an api key that they can use in their bundle submission process since uh an api key is currently required to uh to communicate with this because of the the denial of service stuff that that we were talking about earlier we open sourced a repository here it's called simple arbitrage it's a very very small example of how you can use the the flashbots bundle submission endpoint to submit bundles and how you can you know discover opportunities outside of the flashbot system one of the things that we noticed when we started getting some inbound requests for how to use the system was that there was some confusion about what role flashbots played they were they were asking how do i use flashbots to find mev opportunities and i think we need to do a better job of creating more examples and more documentation showing that this isn't the method that you use to discover meb this is how you take advantage of mev in the most optimal way we've been doing a lot of hands-on with with searchers right now we're really trying to get searcher volume up uh we have just a few searchers running right now and the more we get the more profitable bundles we're going to find per block and we're really going to kickstart that you know the flywheel of more bundle profitability leading to more miners leading to more uh searchers that want to participate in the system so it's really important that we get the volume as soon as possible yeah and so we're just trying to expand the the quantity of searchers and and how much we make per per block uh but i have a demo that i was going to show you that i thought was kind of cool we were able to use the system for a a white hat rescue of nfts and i'm going to share my screen here in a bit so i'll be taking over but the the gist of this demo is that several days ago somebody lost their private key to a hacker and the hacker quickly took all of their erc20s that were obviously valuable you know their their dies they took all their eth of course they took a lot of these these assets but this user actually had a really really large collection of any of nfts they you know cryptokitties and axes and like tons of these these gods and chains cards and we were talking to them and found out that we can actually use this meb system to rescue nfts in a way that would not be possible without flashbots and yeah i'm going to share my screen now all right so my screen shared you look good okay so so what we have here is a uh it's a searcher right this is the same kind of a component that you would use if you found some profitable opportunity out in the wild and you wanted to bring that opportunity to the chain not by using a pending transaction but by submitting it to the flashbots bundle submission endpoint and this the searcher instead of going out and finding some new arbitrage opportunity kind of creates its own profits to the miner if the miner is willing to include several transactions from accounts that don't have any gas associated with them they don't have any eth on the account the problem that we have right now is since the that account has a disclosed private key any if that goes into that account just gets siphoned out now if you if you submit you know half an inch to pay for the gas to conduct these transactions the first thing that's going to happen is a bot's going to come sweep all that eth out so what we did is we created a we created a set of zero gas transactions which is a bunch of transactions from this uh this is this account that has been hacked and then we also created what we are considering donor transactions which is this is the account that's actually going to pay for the gas and by including them into a bundle you can see here we have a bundle where we basically take all these zero gas transactions and then the transaction actually pays the miner we throw them into a bundle and we we ship it up here let me go ahead and run this thing actually because the way that this outputs it is a little bit easier to understand so it's actually trying to submit this bundle right now but the gist of it is you know this is the hacked account uh this is axi we're saying like the the zero gas transaction is from the hacked accounts to axi to move one of those assets to a new owner and then the other transaction that's a part of the bundle is a check this is the account that actually has eth that is communicating with a contract that checks to see that the previous transaction occurred and if it has will directly transfer the miner some fixed value and the system will actually will trace these transactions working it will figure out how much gas they use combined you can see what the effective gas price is for that bundle to be included since the the miner's not going to get paid anything based on transaction fees but will get paid this and it will end up and it will end up kind of calculating the gas price just by dividing gas use by gas price um for how the key was was disclosed i don't know actually i should we should i'll i'll ask the user how that happened it's something we've been seeing just a little quite a lot lately but especially with like metamasks or you know people that are uh the ledger one is the one that i've seen several uh private keys get get yanked when they you know fall for some sort of a a fishing you know hey you know we need to confirm your 24 word seed um so let me quickly show you uh uh let what it looks like on chain because i mean i know we're just kind of like looking at some code here that's we don't have enough time to really go into details on um one thing that might be kind of interesting is i it's generalized so that you can make one of these per protocol so all you got to do to go from cryptokitties to axi is is just you know use a different engine and this engine basically just constructs the transaction requests for the zero gas price transactions and it could do a bunch of them in a single bundle and then the singular donor transaction they can check multiple things but let me uh i'm going to show the browser real quick because it looks pretty um looks pretty simple when it lands on chain okay all right am i sharing a screen that's moving not the one okay yep good awesome okay so this is the account that got their private key compromised and uh you can see that there's a whole bunch of value that moved out of the system this is back here around when they got their their their key disclosed and then in the last day there's a whole bunch of interactions with cryptokitties where the transaction fee is like exactly zero if you click on one of these you know it's not it's not running down to zero the gas price was literally nothing but what you can do is see the way the system works is we're going to look at the block we're gonna look at all the transactions in the block we're gonna go to the last page and you can see that because it was a flashback bundle it was included at the head of the block here and there is a transaction here that doesn't seem to be related but it is this is the donor transaction that basically paid for the rest of these so we're going to click on here it's actually a source verified contract so we can do this so what we can see is i called on this source verified contract that it's open to anybody to use uh a bunch of targets these are all cryptokitties the question is what is the owner of the four kitties that i traded in that or they tried to move to the rescue transaction in that block and then what are the results that i expect to match for those if this gets called and all of these conditions are met it's going to take all of its value and ship it to the block.coinbase effectively confirming that those things actually occurred and then rewarding the miner directly based on it yeah and so this is a source verified transaction that anybody can anybody can use and the idea is you just submit value and a bunch of conditions you want to check and if they match you you pay the miner so it's a pretty it's a really simple really simple contract but it allows us to basically have one account pay for another count's gas because moving eth into that account would immediately be swept by a bot and so we don't need to do that now we can just interact with things so long as we know the private key all right and that's um that's it for the demo and uh yeah i've uh i'm torn on on open sourcing i guess i probably should because i think it's a it's a really interesting example because it is a example of using the bundle submission endpoint of the um of the system you know the simple arbitrage only does a single uh transaction since arbs happen in a single transaction but this is one where um you know we're actually using a bundle right all these were bundled together it was important that they all landed in the same block cool all right so um i think we're going into um a qa session um one moment just trying to uh on flashbacks and i'm once again trying to share something alex can alex can you um help uh with curating the questions in the uh chat on the side chat yeah that sounds good we have one from luke and one from joseph i believe right now yeah um so um i think uh luke's question on what we plan to do um to uh minors who behave in certain ways that are detrimental to the system and adversarial to the searchers um during alpha phase right now we have the soft rule of essentially um we will give them warnings and potentially excluding them from the system right now we're not um codifying any of these rules yet we're trying to see where how um the ecosystem players behave at the moment um so that's uh where we're doing what we're doing in the alpha base and um alex if you can read uh joseph's uh or joey's question i just i can't really see the screen sure i guess you just you just answered luke's question um or gave part of an answer um joseph's question is around asking the main saving so is the main saving the block space from from transaction arts they would have errored or failed normally i guess the main saving from using flashbacks i i i can i answer that one go ahead please uh i think that is is definitely one of them is you know that we don't need error transactions to land on chain anymore uh i think another larger one is that there's a lot of arbitrage opportunities that are using back running where you try to slide in a transaction behind another one and that can yield to just you know hundreds and hundreds of transactions for a single opportunity and using the flashbot system and the way that bundles work you can actually discover a transaction in the pending queue and include it as part of your bundle and just uh you know instead of hoping that you land behind it like programmatically just say like i want to land behind this and you really raise that transaction up to the top and land right behind it and you're not just spewing garbage into the chain just to capture an opportunity cool um so mini road session tokyo are you on the line oh actually uh another quick question on the on the nft if we have [Music] go time uh so uh two questions actually first off uh is this uh since you're still sending bundles to the flashbots apis and they're private uh would a simpler solution have worked where you send let's say like one ether to that compromised address you withdraw all the nf keys and then you send that somewhere else and since the whole bundle is private uh the bot would not have been able to steal it and so that that's part one but then part two it sounds like your framework is uh is very cool for making method transactions work so like even if it was not necessary in this case it sounds like with very little twiddling and you'd be able to make pretty much any account uh be able to do transactions without ethereum yeah those yeah those are two um really good questions the yeah so the question one was well if you can just use a private relay couldn't you just you know submit eth do some stuff and then transfer the email the problem is that all the transaction relays out there that are private you can't gossip a transaction from an account that doesn't have any ether and so you first need to send the ether and then the ether needs to land like the ether actually needs to be your transfer inbound needs to show up in a block before you can actually give it any transactions to um to send those entities out and by the time that it lands in a block it gets discovered and swept out there's there's bots that are sitting there doing this like you know all day like next block and they pay you know 99 percent of the ether value to the miners to transfer that value out um i i think john's question was like why can't instead of going through the contract we just send each directly in that same block first and then uh yeah importantly importantly do that privately so that uh if the evgef is simulating this it's first simulating receiving ether second simulating a private transaction uh yeah yeah sorry go ahead no i i think i'm maybe not understanding the scenario are you talking about running a forked version of geth that allows that because the current version of of any private private transaction relay wouldn't allow that to land in the same block uh wouldn't wouldn't meet f allow this so uh you you use the mvp gifts and bundle api the first transaction is a signed transaction that uh sends one ether from your account to the compromise account the second transaction is a pre-pre-signed uh like taking out nfts there's maybe some tooling with metamask to do given that you don't have guests but you still need to sign this but this seems very doable using so yes totally that is 100 like another totally viable way to do it is to yeah actually fund the account actually spend real transaction fees and then um you know return whatever isn't used just make sure that you only put in enough that is that you need to to do the thing yeah that's that's a that's another totally great way to do it probably a little bit cheaper yeah i would say that the two trade-offs there are like in the current version where miners can technically uh you know misbehave on flashbots and we have only like after the fact remediation it's still if you do it that way it's still technically possible for them to say like okay we're only going to include this funding transaction since the key is compromised i don't know what the benefit would be because they're getting paid anyway so like maybe they can also steal the nfts that way i don't know um i i guess the second case that it's relevant would be if you want to have some sort of reorg protection so like if a flashbots block later gets orphaned uh if you had like an unconditional eath send as part of the bundle there's no guarantee that it would get reorged into the same bundle because at that point it might actually just be in the mempool i think those are the two edge cases but but largely yeah you probably could have accomplished the same uh the effects question is much more interesting how much have you thought about actually doing this like matter transactions as a service where accounts with no ether can basically send stuff to flashbacks yep uh yeah that is definitely one of the ones that that we've talked about it was actually um i think uh it was the vitalik we talked to him about this and that was like one of his first thoughts like oh well yeah now now we have like uh you know basically a a globally supported gsn with no like on chain overhead um you know but but for any of these systems you know tornado even i was talking to roman about that and that was like the first thing that that he thought was interesting was like oh well you know this is this is uh you know relays but the relays don't have any there's no act there is no middleman and there's no chance of loss for for the middleman to actually need to charge a premium on cool all right let's let's move to about pal q sorry we had to cut you off before yeah so um so uh the reason why um you're seeing this current screen if you guys can see was that i think yesterday um i just keep on getting um you know um waking up by uh the eth uh security telegram chat i i thought there was some hack maga hack going on but then they realized uh palkio was discussing flash spots um in the community and i um wanted to protect the anonymity of some of the folks who spoke so i quoted some of the lines that i found to be interesting the entire discussion was absolutely fascinating it reminded me of the early days of the mbb roast where we uh are very critical of what we're trying to achieve here and so um pelcio um would you like to um share your kind of major concerns um some of the questions that we decided to narrow in on but uh we could uh you could go over some of your um main concerns first yeah sure can you all hear me well yes yep okay perfect um yeah maybe i can just like sum up my thinking so first let me say that i really like like it's what flashback does is really exciting but uh in terms of uh focusing on mevgeth i have a more of a like critical thinking uh on my like controversial point of view is does it do more harm than good um so basically i think we all agree that uni swap for example i think is a good use case uh has some like fundamental design flaws um and i think we all agree that in the short term if mev death takes off it will enable sandwiching and it will hurt end users um but the thinking is that it's a like it's a necessary pain in the short term to actually fix properly these problems right so uh but to me first there is um i think it would be nice to have a like a broader discussion about the ethical aspect of this short-term paints and then maybe you know measuring the mev that could be extracted through sandwiching on uniswap because sandwiching on uniswap will be made like possible in a hundred percent of the cases where it's possible so i think it will change a lot um compared to the situation right now um so that's like the short term thing but in the medium term i think it's even more important that either like uni swap v2 will die because user will just you know abandon it because of this fundamental flaws that may be like the happy path um but i think there is another alternate scenario which is that the user are very like unhappy about being systematically sandwiched um so they kind of pressure the depths on these depths end up uh having like uh making partnerships with miners to send their transactions privately so they will never be seen you know in the public mempool and they cannot get sandwiched because it's all private and i feel like like this would be like a second order consequence of uh mev death which would be to you know to like push like basically that mvvdf is about making stuff transparent enable on enabling more possibilities but it would actually as this second order effect push everything uh to be a pack again and it will not actually solve these problems it will just make everything more like one level more complex without any benefit that's kind of my fear so i don't know what's your thinking on that cool so um essentially there are two questions here right um which question we address here also like i think in fact there are three but i put two here and then there's a third one which you mentioned last the user harm the reason why i left it out of the current slide of the qa was because that is actually one of the research roadmap flashbacks um major research question so like in the second research paper for mdp face um you could see on our uh mbb research repo uh there is a study of the consensus harm and the and the study of uh user harm um and so in this approach so i think um that deserves a deeper conversation i would love to well uh welcome everyone to chime in but i will uh direct that particular question to a separate research workshop which we host um on a semi-monthly basis as well so we can go more in depth uh with potentially deliverables um to accomplish so um yeah so here uh so perhaps uh pacquiao do you want to focus on kind of these two questions first yeah yeah i think the second is the most relevant yeah as a second order effect yeah um does it actually makes everything opaque again that's my question any takers yeah i mean from my perspective i think it's a it's a good question um i think that was one of the things that i originally scared me about mev and uh that i was originally you know uh several years ago in devcon warning people could be an outcome and i still think it is a very realistic scenario um i think like naturally these kinds of on-chain decentralized financial products are going to create some asymmetries um and i hope that one of the things that's going to be different about the flashbots org from other extraction channels private mempools etc is that is like a commitment to reducing those asymmetries um as much as possible through open source uh so i think uh yeah maybe alex and other people can talk about how we see that but yeah i share that concern even with my own um even like decisions as granular as like participating on this call you know i think we all share that fear um and and from my reasoning it's gonna matter a lot how mev is handled within the next two years of the ecosystem and uh as much as i wish i could say like the outcome will definitely be more transparency that's not necessarily the case so i think we have a lot of work to do to actively be committed to actually making that happen uh and there will be like nebulous scenarios where we have to prove that through actions just one more thing my point is that yeah i mean even if flashbots is fully committed to transparency i really wonder about the fact that some other initiative will uh will start like against uh the like the kind of harmful mv extraction that will actively harm users on that this like new initiatives will be completely opaque and even though flash bots itself is fully transparent it will like strongly encourage uh such opaque initiatives and you know partnerships with between dapps on miners so that they send the transactions privately to avoid sandwiching i think that's very real and one other thing i want to emphasize is that i feel like you like there is a lot of you know politics on the and that's involved on that flashback is mostly like i feel like you are mostly focused on the technical aspect of it but for example i think that if we have not seen a lot of mev extraction so far it's also because of this politics thing and that miners have a reputation that kind of stuff on i think it's also politics that would create these second order effects and i think it's very important to take that into account so just just wanted to add something because i'm i'm on many calls with with mining pools uh trying to uh to foster the adoption of of immediate and what i see is that because the numbers of that of maybe extraction revenue go up a lot of pools become more um sort of acquire this more profit seeking mindset especially newer entities that enter the market so this sort of opaqueness will happen no matter uh with or without flashbots and i think flashbots is just the best answer to to try to make it sort of as as not opaque as possible because uh these things are happening miners changing their mindset i think that's that's what i'm seeing i mean mining pools yeah and then like my last thing i want to say is that um i totally agree and i think it's a like it will it will go in that direction anyway but if flashbots make it uh much faster um and it also like in the short term hurt users i feel like it doesn't really change anything in the medium or long term but it will help like harm users in the short term so that the thing i want to consider i i think there is a possibility that like overall it's it has a negative impact yeah no i totally agree i think there's a strong possibility um i think so the division is that through three prongs this will be avoided one of them is transparency and like actually being committed to open source um the second and this speaks to like private forks and things like that and also the politics that you guys mentioned uh i think the politics of the community is going to be really relevant in how mev is just uh extracted and distributed in the short to medium term i think in the long term it makes like absolutely no difference that's my hypothesis because like the incentives are very obvious and clear so like eventually they will play out in a certain way but in the short to medium term how much gets extracted by who where the profit goes um which miners do it how they behave towards each other i think these are all details that matter a lot um so like my proposal there is to kind of be very vocal about mev issues as projects and as a community and i think another prong we can use to mitigate this is education and like teaching users how their designs are uh insufficient like what does unit swap slippage really mean can you expect to uh get a certain price or like what kind of execution can you expect i think these education questions might actually be helped by having mev actually actively extracted especially if we integrate with like the the the visualization tools people are using um so i think it easily could become opaque in the future i hope that it becomes transparent and it actually helps users um but i think there is a lot of work and like a lot of conversations like these that will need to happen um and not only just happen but have been in a meaningful way that like influences mining pools and the community's decisions um so i think these roasts are a good start but they're somehow we need to also think about how to expand this further yeah i feel like that does not really address the second order effects problem because that's more about flashbacks transparency and i feel like this second order is about something else on politics and i'm a bit more pessimistic about like user education on i don't know i feel like a lot of people who won't really understand and will be pissed off and that will pressure that's on the to to try to get their transactions mined privately even though i totally agree with you in with the fact that we need more education and we actually i mean like in the long term we just want to remove this uh you know these incentives and actually design that properly that would be nice but right now we have a problem and we kind of have to deal with it and i feel like it's important to try to minimize harm as well uh it's like you are building a very powerful weapon on uh it has the potential to help people i don't know i feel like what is that positive from though like i feel like if we can get more dabs to like adopt like by default send all transactions through mev yes but not like you know i think the point will become not to extract mev but to protect people from exactly let me be if everything's going through private mempools i think this is like a positive thing for the ecosystem like i don't think i don't think i think this is like i mean you know don't call it on papers call this privacy like if maybe just helps push us towards that faster i think that's a good thing yeah that's true yeah well i think that's why we we have um essentially laid out i'm sharing my screen here i hope you can see um the research roadmap and this is like literally one of the major research questions that is unclaimed and i would love to invite all of you here um interested in these research questions specifically to participate in our research workshop don't worry we're not asking you to like as a full-time job thing it's more that collective research process that we could uh co-author and work on uh something of academic rigor together um that said because of time we're running kind of uh you know uh way beyond time so i'm going to um um uh uh continue to um aaron's discussion um aaron from b protocol would you like to share your own screen yes please okay so this is part of our second uh because um mvp rose is not meant for flashbots the implementation itself it's meant for mev projects and communities and this the discuss the merits and debates the designs and et cetera so that's why we're having um we're inviting um ecosystem projects like b protocol to share their insights yeah okay so first of all thank you for having me and i will not be able to see text questions if there are any so you know maybe if there are any questions please relay them me try to go to full screen yeah okay maybe let's go like this okay so thank you very much i'm jaron ceo of b protocol okay so i was asked to share my insights about designing the system for liquidations especially in the presence of mev er so first of all let's start maybe with the bottom line or what is my point of view it actually gave rise to this project so mev is annoying for uniswork arbitrage in general but for liquidations it's much worse than just annoying and in my view eventually you know it could give rise to some major collapse in landing platforms simply because there will not be anyone to liquidate or most even walls so my point of view is that currently no big player really want to liquidate and it all goes to small players who just run you know some arbitrage boats yes so yeah and moreover so every dollar that goes not only to miners but you know one of the difficulties now that if you really want to be competitive then it's not only about trading and hedging that you need to focus but also on blockchain developers i add today that currently the market liquidation market is not that big on the one one hand and on the other hand once it gets too big it will probably be too late to start hoping that you know big players will come then yeah i mean all these will make d5 platforms very unstable uh some insight from traders we discussed you know before starting the project uh so talking with you know so-called traditional algo traders are now doing crypto but maybe off-chain so when they do backstop in a centralized or traditional finance so you know that a lot of unknowns the hedging is is very complicated you don't really know what you get because you don't know market conditions etc [Music] but this is something you know they learned to do they they have a lot of experience but now if you add all the blockchain issues gas wars is one gas cost in general which does not exist traditional finance network topology etc then you know all of a sudden risk estimation models become much more complex so this is why they don't you know don't tend to participate there is speaking with existing projects so previously i was cto of kyber network the kaido network team actively market make on-chain a lot does millions in volume so yeah i mean it does know how to handle the blockchain complexity gas costs etc but still they don't want to go they didn't want to go into liquidations because all of the gas walls and finally another perspective is that but it's not only the my the mev uh that make the required premium for liquidation higher and indeed it's much higher than in centralized finance so it's not only about the mev the uncertainty or the competition element in general uh make it less profitable or at least less unknown and this is why d5 platforms are forced to offer bigger incentives so this is like the overall or maybe the summary but let me now dive in into the talk and present what we do so first of all about myself so c of b protocol before b protocol i was working for a few months on a front running backgrounding boats liquidation boats before that was city of kyber network cyber network especially in the sense that it was the first to actually do market making on chain it's not not just by a fixed formula but actually submitting ethereum transaction for the price update having liquidity on chain etc was working on wrapped bitcoin uh before doing it uh smart conduct professionally and he was doing phd in computer science and did some academic research one of them was later the ceo of kyber network we did smart pool which was a decentralized smart contract mining pool and even mind few blocks there yeah yeah so first of all okay i will briefly explain what are lending platforms and liquidation i saw most of the audience here is already familiar with mev is definitely something you know and then we'll talk about the big protocol solution so yeah okay learning platforms are you know like a key element or key pillar in defy with billions uh in locked value basically you have a lender who deposit a coin you have a bo so you have a deposit of coin everyone can deposit everyone can borrow and return to a deposit and once your debt is bigger than your collateral plus some safety margin then you get liquidated and the incentive for liquidators [Music] is that they get the user collateral with a premium and in return they have to pay the user that okay and without liquidation so that in particular could lose the peg compound and ave will go bankrupt eventually all of d phi is based on proper liquidations in our process okay now how liquidations are done in traditional finance so first of all when you set up or spawn a new new centralized system that you know but typically in traditional finance these are exchange that allow you to trade with margin so first of all you you form a backstop of big big argue traders they commit on liquidation of certain amounts namely they lock some capital uh on the other hand the platform commits that it you know if liquidation were to happen then you will get a guaranteed profit which okay it's not really a profit but a liquidation discount yeah when it happens uh and when liquidation is needed okay they are either sold to the other book but the extra market condition they just dump the position on the liquidators and then the liquidators need to get rid of the position uh so liquidators here get certainty and this center certainty allow them to prepare for such big events and platforms like bitmex can do hundreds of millions of liquidations per day just to give you know maybe some comparison so in maker dao recently they introduced this parameter that basically does not allow to liquidate more than 60 million dollars per six hours or so a maker is by far you know like the biggest liquidator uh consumer liquidation consumer uh so okay so in indeed decentralized finance this day so instead of onboarding big argo traders so you just let everyone participate now you let everyone participate so you cannot ask for any commitment from the people who participate so platform do offer a discount but this discount is shared with the miners with the so-called mev yes so the outcome eventually is that liquidators only liquidate if it's convenient to them most likely if they can immediately arbitrage it with uniswap or other platforms in unison liquidation unisop liquidity gets bigger and bigger right but still you cannot liquidate with proper slippage more than few millions so this is not something that can bring you you know to bitmex level and bitmix already has four billion dollar in liquidity right i mean the scalability there is also bounded so okay so we discuss centralized finance decentralized finance and finally what is it we offer in big protocol so in a sense we let everyone to participate or at least in the pa in the future however we let everyone participate on a time base and not an accreditation base namely the competition is not for every liquidation but instead liquidators get a franchise for a time period and then they share the liquidation as a result the liquidators are more committed and in the future you know this commitment might be in the form of actual uh economic incentive uh the liquidation itself has been decided by a smart contract so nothing is shared with the miners you know besides the standard gas fees but there's no competition on the miners and as a result the liquidators are committed are committed and they do have incentive you know at least as the system get bigger to be prepared for bigger liquidations so liquidators compete on liquidation franchise which in the future could be uh share posts so right they're already willing to share the proceeds with the users uh in the future they might be auctions around that a smart contract decide who gets to liquidate a specific user at a specific time and users share the proceeds with the liquidator so liquidator gets certainty uh but lower liquidation penalty which most are happy with because liquidation penalty in d fi are still relatively high the platform get committed liquidators and users get a bit more than they used to uh so they protocol is already live on top of existing platforms and like the core value proposition of the protocol is that we take an existing platform say maker dao we let user interact with maker dao exactly the way he interacted before only some smart contact wrapper namely the b protocol so user deposit and borrow as usual but the liquidators can provide a cushion to the user position namely they can repay part of his debt in this way when the user user account become insolvent according to maker dow metric so make it our external system or external liquidators uh see it actually has a lower debt right so let's say user original debt was 1000 i but our liquidators repaid 100 die of his debt so now according to maker dao it cannot be liquidated so none of the maker thou keepers can liquidate but according to b protocol we know that if he were using make it out directly he would have been liquidated and at this point the smart contract allowed our liquidators to liquidate him every time they liquidate it liquidates someone they send some of the proceeds to agile and every once in a while according to some user scoring method this jar is distributed among all users okay so b protocol is already live already over 20 million dollars in deposits there is or there will be a governance but without a token so like here maybe an insight is that users are willing you know the selling point is that users do not take any extra risk but obviously there's this smart conduct risk so we see that at least for now it does get some traction it is enough to convince some users at least to try us out yeah yeah and that's us so um thanks for the presentation um i think uh uh actually a question for uh for yarn do you think uh so how do you see b protocol and flashbots uh positioned in uh in to each other within the um mvv ecosystem yes so i i think it's quite orthogonal because you know so to be honest and maybe it's a bit uh related to the discussion before like you know like the ultimate goal of mv get is maybe to make more transparent tools but but again like our position is that it's not really about lack of transparency but actually competition in this case and make liquidity you know liquidation process uh walls so it's not really about transparency and in this in this sense it's kind of orthogonal to the mev research group efforts yes i i don't think it's really about the miners though again maybe i'm not fully understand you know your guys agenda because you know even if it were some kind of player 2 solution there then still someone would or could have you know profit more by reorganizing the transaction order etc so yeah that's my view cool we'd like to invite questions anyone here have a question for yaren and the design of could you just talk a little more about the cushion and why i guess that was helpful in the protocol yeah okay let me share it again so we you know our value proposition to users is okay you're using maker dao come use us and get get exactly the same conditions you know plus some [Music] posit distribution positioning so without the cushion we could could not have liquidated him under the same conditions right i mean because then we will have to compete with maker dao other keepers which you know again we have gas walls again okay so in maker how it's been synced on auction etc but in order to get priority uh for our liquidators they have to provide a question because otherwise user will just get liquidated in the maker though so like an alternative solution here would be to say to user okay so maybe you know we don't provide a caution but you'll get liquidated before you would have normally get liquidated in maker but then you know it's a different value proposition to the user you know we ask him to give up something in return and with this question you can use maker exactly the same way used before get exactly the same conditions that makes sense um i think to answer some of your questions also ben i think you're you're right that i think this is somewhat orthogonal uh to flashbots and uh i think it's really interesting to kind of provide priority in that way and use it to align those incentives a little better and improve efficiency um long term i think in terms of the the layer two layer one like i personally expect there will probably always be some layer one mev for whatever reason there's just so many different ways that it gets created and sources i expect a lot a lot of it will move to layer twos but like i expect there will still be something that sticks around on on layer one and i think what percentage is a interesting open question that depends on like weird things like each starting and other blockchains uh that become popular um i also think uh yeah in that world like a lot of the tools and the research we're doing still applies uh on things like like how to extract that mev and the ethics and things like that so uh yeah i i think if it ends up that all mev goes to l2 i think that's very unlikely that like all mav goes to l2 and like we can't fund mev research on l1 mev um then probably that will be some sort of reevaluation but i think the the artifacts that are being built here will still be useful in that world yeah just thought i wanted to actually say that even if i'll go to l2 so still my view is that it's still a huge problem you know for liquidation platforms or for lending platforms because you know liquidators don't care if they pay to the miners right or pay to some you know very cool research a group right i mean eventually what matters is the certainty they get and how much it cost them you know or like the cut of the premium they get so yeah yeah absolutely can i ask a question quickly sure is so a technical question i guess and so uh first is how exactly does that work there is like a proxy wallet for for the user when he is using that both his funding and your funding so that in case that you don't liquidate on time who is getting liquidated this proxy wallet yeah the second i mean on the same theme i just want to make sure that yeah in case that you don't liquidate on time what exactly happens yeah okay so first of all the easy answer yeah if if i don't click you know if the platform doesn't liquidate on time then make it out dow liquidators will just liquidate it so in this sense you know there's no custody of funds user does not have much or almost anything to lose by using us so yeah i mean the stakers do lose i guess because they put some more that they wouldn't have lost if they they would have done information or something like that yeah yeah so the liquidity provider if they do provide the question and don't liquidate on time they extend to lose the question yeah so where are they in charge of also monitoring and sending liquidation transactions so yeah yeah yeah at this point it's their responsibility and also at this point it's kind of opti or not only obtained you know it's like a best effort system where they don't really have to liquidate if it's you know too hard for them because like the at this point uh when bootstrapping it you know we we made it as easy easiest as possible to liquidate also without any strict requirements along the time as it gets more traction you know more revenues to the system more liquidators we want to join then we can ask for stricter commitment maybe or but by the way it won't be us it will be the community who will get in charge uh so yeah and i answer maybe a question from a text question so yeah as i forgot to say but the platform already liquidated collateral loss of hundred thousand dollar actually it wasn't in the recent days in the recent days uh there are very few liquidation because most of the users joined when east was much lower but like few weeks ago there was a market crash from i think seven hundred dollars to six hundred or so oh yeah i don't remember the exact number and yeah there were already liquidations of hundred thousand dollars of collateral back then [Music] so yeah hey okay in terms of percentage of total accusations so again we only have you know like 20 million collateral and in-depth it's only seven million out of over one billion uh of total maker dow like users so obviously we didn't capture all of make a difference we cannot capture we can only capture our users and being still a small fraction of a maker now so we only had small fraction of the liquidations well on this note actually uh i would like to uh direct this question to alex uh alex from um boss team so well the question here is i don't know if you guys can see my screen i switch back to the mvv explorer which currently um tallied up uh uh common mev strategies and liquidations as we know um as we see here due to early stage of coverage we're still working on improving coverage accounts for a small percentage however one um particular uh point we um are making in our uh mbb inspect progress a process is that uh maker deliberations uh we are not accounting for them for specific reasons and so um i think for the audience here a lot of us um are not quite familiar with um mbb um the the definition the formal definition and as well as like uh essentially maybe alex do we want to kind of uh share a bit of thoughts into essentially how b protocol is touching a uh the um mbv uh so uh resolving the mvv problem and how uh from our view of the space itself like um what constitute of an mbv um where is the overlap here right so why we don't classify maker liquidations as mev is because they have switched to an auction model in multi-collateral die which means they're not influenced by transaction ordering like a dydx or compound liquidation say so you don't have people you know doing backgrounding strategies or earlier on trying to front-run each other and that's that's more so so something yeah in my career still in the current system so actually you you do get some priority for being the first namely this auction system and every bid should improve the former bid by at least three percent so actually towards the end of the auction there is a bit of a race on who is doing actually the last order you know which is typically like three percent below market price so there's still some emmy video but but the fact that you can't create like a full loop out of it means that like you are uh you're constantly exposed to like an asset you can't you know i mean like there's a big difference between i'm placing a bid for something with like a six hour time horizon and i'm going to complete a loop right now yeah no no but you know like in the one minute before the auction end then there's kind of a race on whom you know who will bid a market price minus three percent yeah uh yeah okay you know just to emphasize you know so big protocol main objective is mostly to secure and make you know d5 platforms safer not necessarily reduce mev but commenting on the chart so again my first slide said that you know while mev on landing platforms it might be much smaller than on arbitrage platforms unisport etc i think the danger to the d5 ecosystem is much bigger in mv of liquidations other than mvv of unesco arbitrage that's my point of view cool um any other questions um i think we are essentially running very low on time um our jet lag watery eye teary eye tom smith because he's asleep so we're gonna run through his questions because a lot of them we actually touch on and i think there are great questions that deserve much deeper thoughts and uh deeper conversations um so first um how um so basically in um every problem space there's the unknowns and no no no no flashbacks through meb inspect is basically quantifying um the um mev uh in the space that you have you guys have seen um a little bit of it in the sneak preview earlier and in addition flashbacks the core infrastructure is diving into experimenting and mitigating actively however in uh pacquiao's roast um questions essentially um we touch on the second uh second order effects and opacity due to private mempools uh rampant existence is um somewhat considered a second order effects i want to uh quickly ask rapid fire anyone to think of other second order effect or if you're a galaxy brain third order that we may not be anticipating anyone um i think so let me throw out a few for food for thought regulatory legal uh public perception effects in the way people perceive d5 versus traditional finance political ammo for incumbent financial institutions mining regulations generally around censorship cool anyone else say random words i think it's it's fun yeah this is pure brainstorming because i think most of the time we're very focused on solving uh the problems right at hand and we can't really untangle the problems itself so perhaps think about it from secondary or tertiary back order effect could help in thinking some of the longer term impact while we're acting anyone here surya zarya is one of our meb fellow who's working on auction mechanism research but who's muted so if there's um no one here who can think of any other secondary effect i would like to direct that question to being discussed async in our discord channel on the research channel in discord well the second question which we also touched on is in the future world phil as you mentioned majority of economic activity on ethereum moved l2 with built-in sequencing then what is the role of the generalized l1 mev tools that we will see emerging on top of flashback ecosystem hello i mean i don't have a really good answer for this but as phil mentioned kind of briefly early on there will still be l1 activity right even when you have l2 you still use l1 as your trust layer and you know there's some interactions between the one and layer two and there's actually new vectors of attacks as well and med attacks between layer one and layer two related to you know submitting a frog proof on layer one and miners censoring that and that type of stuff um so i think mev will definitely probably change its shape um and it might look very different in the sense where it won't be individual transactions and uh on layer two you know the delay the transactions on layer two will be submitted on layer one as like a batch of transactions and that type of stuff so one there'll be new interactions two um i do think a lot of the approach and work we're doing applies to generally a lot of different systems including layer two systems there's still a notion of transaction ordering within a lot of layer twos and so a lot of the research and work we're doing would you know would have to be adapted but does does apply to some extent to that um so again not a very good answer but uh it's an active area of research and also as it's not entirely clear what is going to happen in this layer 2 war i mean i don't want to call it a war but and it just you know how how things are going to shape up that's going to dictate a lot of how we can adapt the tools we're building and that the community will build two layer twos i do know from firsthand conversations with some of the projects building layer twos that mvv is a concern or generally the you know uh meddling around transaction ordering uh this the problem is just somewhat shifted from from miners and later on to you know roll-up providers for example um i don't know if anyone has additional comments or rebuttals what i would say is if you draw a box around every l2 that people actually use that's basically the same as an l1 and like there's still going to be pros cross protocol opportunities that need to be understood there's still going to be things that need to be quantified for users in mev explorer there's still going to need to be an auction mechanism i expect there will be a lot of different projects and protocol tokens um i think there's already a few that operate on l2 uh and also maybe handle me on l2 but i think the the open source software technically is not not very different i'd be curious if anyone has thoughts on the economics or anything like that well um once again um let's move on to the next question and um would keep this uh questions discussion in discord and so should protocols and their users have the rights to protocol-specific meb should a portion of mdv go back to users or the dow if so how might such a mechanism work in attributing the value back to part of the ecosystem stakeholders this is a question very i think specific and quite often brought up i would expect most of us here would be able to have some thoughts into into it i think we just saw a presentation about exactly a protocol for this right so yeah well um the question here is like how much how large is the design space here i guess uh or what is what this implies i think b protocol showcase one um example implementation design implementation count is there any potentially general generalizable approach to this any takers so i i think although you know it's not really clear but keeper now claimed to have some approach you know like i think the generalization of it is okay let us you know all the transaction but also let us take some of the mev you know this transaction entails for example let us time your units work trade and you know we will font on you but someone will front you anyway so might as well let us do it and then you know let us share the profits still personally i think you know a lot of issues is that but i think it it is an approach that keeper now may be trying to push yeah i think the design space is is pretty large from my perspective uh i don't know i haven't thought about it that much but uh seems like from the design we've seen and the designs people are trying there are definitely a lot of different possible ways to do this um i wonder like basically what we see both on mev explore and in general is that like once you have an interesting mechanism like maker dow you basically get a bunch of spin-offs that use the same core incentive scheme and the same mechanisms to accomplish different uh goals uh so i wonder if these can almost be like standardized for classes of mev and if that can inform how we uh how we categorize in our research taxonomy um that could be interesting cool noted for our research next step um lastly um this is more of a meta question i think essentially maybe resembles climate change in the sense of existential threat uh that's a collective action problem but negative effects are too difficult to feel on any individual or local level so what's the most important thing we need to do to get people to care how do how do we find more people like palkio like leb who um vocally um uh write down their thoughts and and voice their opinions on on things and how do we be able to get people to care i guess that's i think that's something that's also flashbacks want to bring to the table as well we want to let address point out the problems um dissect them so that it's digestible and be able to help the space in understanding the second order and tertiary effect uh and so i guess we want to open up to everyone here i guess the fact that you are here on this call means that you care so perhaps if um we haven't you you haven't got a chance to introduce who you are um maybe ask um share a bit about what you care about in this space and who you are and thanks for staying for the last bit i think we're just um i would like to hear from some of you if you uh would like to share i definitely see a few people i follow on twitter but i'm never spoken person and i'm very curious why you're here if you're listening i'm going to ask jin yu from ic3 right well maybe it looks like quite a few folks are on mute or um anyone else olivier um from from representing the mining miner perspective if you would like to speak about what you care about meb you know maybe it's because i am this is near the end of the uh presentation also my pronunciation of everyone's name is probably just completely off so um well if there's no one who would like to share why they care we assume that you don't care enough so um so i have something to say you know that it's not related really to liquidations uh maybe you know like from a trader perspective although i'm not really considering myself a trader like in the real world algo traders will definitely will usually try to you know pick up some arena when they have when they have some unfair advantage for example fast connectivity to markets etc uh who translated it you know into defy so if me as a you know like potential defy trader know that some other people might have some direct connectivity to miners you know with some optimized tools which are not available to me then you know eventually it will make me not participate in this space and you know try to find some more fair playground so i think in this sense mev you know the real issue is maybe not the user who gets frontrud in a unislope but actually a lot of traders who don't join the space and as a result maybe less liquidity or others other stuff because they feel you know other traders have some unfair advantage unfair sometimes just a lot of you know they have a lot of blockchain knowledge or maybe unfair because they have like direct connection with miners yeah i think that's a really interesting point i think buddhist buddhist crampton and shim wrote like a bunch of papers on hft really one core paper which i've always thought was super interesting in this way where they like basically say that like a lot of uh arbitrage behavior disincentivizes liquidity provision and maybe increases volume but actually decreases liquidity so those two things aren't necessarily correlated like across market designs um and you know has a lot of interesting uh i guess hypotheses about uh how to change fairness but i think the question of mev in fairness is uh super intricately linked and uh that's actually why i care about it like i think we should build things that are fair for users and mev has a huge potential to turn all of the things that we're building with the best intentions into something that's not actually fair um and therefore isn't actually efficient or desirable um and i i think i want more people to speak if they're around but if you don't that's fine thanks for staying i know we're over time uh and maybe you know if you want to tweet something about why you care about mev in the next week we can turn this into like more of a homework style thing but i would also love to hear if anyone else wants to say anything i guess uh hi everybody um my name is robin i am quite new to the mev space so was still pretty quiet and just listening um i guess one perspective that might be interesting to think about is how much actually let's say retail or non-professional users actually have to care right uh at least on a casual level at the start um because even if you get even there's a front running board on uni swap like you set your slippage right so if you set your slippage too high you risk a front-running transaction right and if you don't want that to happen you set your slippage lower right so i think there are some some elements of control to how far you can be impacted yourself and even if you get liquidated you don't necessarily care who liquidates you right so i think that's uh that that's on the mind of a lot of people out there right now that probably have never dealt with a topic in general or maybe need some general education in terms of mining and transaction ordering and how everything of that works because i guess only still the minority of people that are involved in crypto have proper knowledge about it um and then obviously crypto and everything is a lot driven by monetary incentives right and a lot of people still don't see big monetary opportunity there necessarily which obviously isn't true um so i guess a lot of people still don't have proper understanding about that so i would say it's maybe just an educational question as well um i will say thank you robin i will say one thing that i think you can also add to i mean user concern could also be around flash loans and flashlight enabled hacks right because that is somewhat somewhat mev that affects users directly um in a way that is meaningful to them um and so that that could be one way to attract the user's retention related to you know being more careful about mev in that case it's it's more about changing the the standards right in terms of like the the control that you mentioned so having a slippage limit is some somewhat of an nad control uh i i definitely think there should be more such such tools and generally more thinking around uh the different like surfaces of of quote-unquote media extraction uh in these protocols um yeah just adding them yeah i think that was a super awesome point thanks for sharing uh i think definitely when we look at the mev taxonomy we should make a note to kind of categorize because there's many different kinds of mev and it's like a kind of catch-all mathematically speaking but in terms of what it actually means for users uh you're right that like a uniswap trade being slightly out of the slippage limits is very different from like i had this stable coin that someone paid me for a hot dog and it collapsed because of like this weird like second order liquidations thing that's like uh totally foreign to me and i have no idea what a liquidation even is so i think it is relevant in very subtle ways and like thinking from the user perspective is definitely something we need to work on more um so yeah yeah i mean there's there's also a monetary or um even like investment narrative that's still i didn't hear a lot yet but might be interesting which is that we've seen we've seen upticks in the usage of things like archer dao is all right seen keeper for example use it for some transactions and obviously people are wondering what is going on right and even from from an investment perspective like obviously people are interested in nurture because they have a token and it can pump and they can make money but the relevance of hash rate will be quite important in the future so all right so that might be an interesting topic there so and basically if if mev starts being more uh important there's uh there might be some direct value adds to people who actually have a certain control of hash rate so that might be also an investor narrative that could actually catch up which i haven't seen out there a lot yet which then the intersection of tokens and mev is like one of those unknown unknowns that tom was asking about that maybe we should actually write down uh i think that could easily could easily yield very interesting results so yeah i totally i totally agree that like uh we need to improve a lot of things about how we how we like understand these things even ourselves and how we communicate them yeah i think everyone here on this call is participating in defining the space itself and in furthering our own understanding and so that we could better uh inform the genera the community at large well i think we're 10 minutes over time so thank you guys so much for joining i would like to um actually i do think twitter discussions of these rose questions are a better uh outlet um to to get more people who may be interested to care so um i would um suggest we uh you tweet out your thoughts on some of these research um rose questions um and your opinions if you are um you didn't get a chance to speak here or you would like to um share in other form thank you yeah i might take these and start doing like a mev question of the day like all the backlogs we generate that like just tweeting it out every day i think that might
