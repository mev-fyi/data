that would be the best so yeah so that's um that's it for the roast and let's start can we do curses yeah it's your personality yeah okay great um in that case um i can roast a little bit better that way thank you everyone for coming to mev mev roast number 12 med from a to z we are sponsored by amazon they are absolutely our sponsor as you can tell by the little amazon smile um yeah uh part 0 is the intro and meme section do we have any memes to present today that's okay if we don't we'll be getting the animal mascots later and that's going to be pretty controversial so having you here is having the meme hudson thank you and i like that you use the laser eye picture i actually just changed that back on twitter but it's it's pretty cool um so yeah i am the meme uh i'm hudson i am from the ethereum foundation and also from zcash uh grants committee and also from texas where we just had a big winter storm and i survived so i now know how to handle snow kinda um let's see i guess we can get started on the presentations unless there's anything else for intro i'm kind of like stumbling through this so anyone stop me if i'm need to do something different oh no you're doing great um we're all uh waiting for your explanation to the last rose question uh that you will have this grand revelation at the end but i do have a question for you hudson sure what do you know about mev so here's what okay so i've done research in the past 24 hours so let me tell you where i came from and where i am now so mev i thought was like when you front run a transaction or you just like do stuff within like rearranging or reordering transactions to make extra money like arbitraging or doing something like that i found out it goes a lot deeper than that and there's a lot more ways that you can uh extract mev from uh you know a block or from you know a community ecosystem so that's kind of where some of my roast questions are going so you all can see those ahead of time and start to think of some answers um basically thinking about mevs beyond defy was kind of like a theme in my head because i didn't know if like you can do nft mev or like uh you know maybe someone's leaking secrets and then you get the heads up on that and so you leak a different secret or stuff like that so uh that's that's something that i was kind of thinking on a little bit uh in my noggin um what else is going on what can someone give me like the just like one minute version of like where who was what was the first paper on mev because i didn't i don't know if i went far enough back in time i'm gonna i'm gonna mention that briefly at the beginning of my presentation perfect okay including like a short definition of mev actually a great question because i think the author of the first paper is sitting here and smiling at you ah nice all right so let's go ahead and get to the presentations then uh and we can have a little bit extra time there uh so we don't need any more intro uh so quantifying on chain med activities on ethereum presentation by alex abadia abadia help me out with the last name uh whatever however you want to say it is fine alex oh my god it's alex um all right go right ahead obadiah or something that sounds really biblical i don't know why just kind of there is like a biblical thing related to that i think um okay all right but not to bring religion into mev what if we did though [Laughter] okay anyways alex go ahead with your presentation uh feel feel free i don't think i need to run the slides i think you got it yeah let me put up well i think the structure of today's we have two presentations this is very different from our usual format which is gem with guest um speakers who are to be challenged and roasted this is time this time is alex and phil gets roasted and so the reason for this is because we would like to do a deep dive into the russian dolls which has no illustration picture in in your head of mbv how many layers of mev do we have in terms of um what uh goes what accounts for uh meb and where does where does empirical current mev extraction activity lies and where is the theorem radical upper bound so um alex question or alex presentation will be focused on the existing on-chain activity that we and a few other scholars are quantifying and phil's will be on the theoretical upper bound and i am downloading an air horn app so i can cut you all off with like two minutes left and make it really annoying so you better be on time i would also accept jeopardy music oh okay yeah or like the what's the academy awards like you know like the play you off yeah all right i'm gonna get get started unless uh there's anything else no go right ahead go right ahead sweet sweet so as a quick quick thing though as tina mentioned for the the i mean i'm mentioning that for the new people that have just joined the call the roast is is open and relaxed atmosphere and um you know we're we're here to to to share and learn together one thing i will say though is for the sake of everyone's time um we'll have a q a at the end of the presentation and but i mean i do understand that you know your questions are going to come up as the presentation goes on so feel free to like pop them in the chat and then at the end we'll kind of like pick from those plus uh have like a open forum for for for people to ask questions um that being said yeah let's get started also yeah i won't click on admit you know trust you do that um so the mvp conversation in general is is growing and part of our mission at flashbacks is to help the community understand it better um and so this growth this roast purpose is obvious hopefully for you to get a better grasp on what is muv um so let's get started so what does that mean so a one line one sentence definition is that muv is a metric that represents the total value that can be extracted permissionlessly from the reordering inclusion or censoring of of transactions so let's let's dive a little bit deeper into what what that means um let's let's first start with oh and by the way the term mev was coined by phil and his co-authors phil who's going to present the the second presentation in uh the pay-per-call flash boys voice 2.0 anyway so um ethereum is a bunch of a bunch of blocks right uh that are kind of appended to to each other and then each block contains a set of transactions from from the first to the last slot of the block um and so within ethereum the the concept of time is discrete as opposed to continuous by by that i mean that time advantages per block um and then within each block time advances per transaction and transactions on ethereum are executed sequentially and so what happens when users submit transactions and you have this this little graphic here thanks to sam from our community for for sharing it is you have several several senders submitted transactions and before transactions are included in a block they're part of this this pending pool this this waiting room if you will where miners pick transactions within that pool and include them in the block the way they're going to pick these transactions usually and the way they're going to order them within the block is going to be related to the transaction fee that they pay to the miner which is a multiplication of the gas price times the gas limit so that's the kind of conventional ordering of transactions um you'll know that the miner is the ultimate person that um orders transactions and while uh they will traditionally order it by you know related to their financial incentive but how much money they're going to make from it through the transaction fees they could order them in in any way they want right um so muv extraction on on ethereum today is has been mostly by by defy traders and bot operators so what i mean by this is it's it's essentially the senders here or types of senders here that execute trading strategies where transaction ordering matters so think of for example a price arbitrage or or liquidations so why would these strategies um be dependent on transaction ordering so taking price arbitrage um cyber charges are ephemeral opportunities where uh for a moment there is a price and efficiency between different liquidity pools and you're trying to snatch that opportunity um and that opportunity is going to go away either because someone else snatches it already or because there's a there's a general rebalancing without getting into the subtleties of it for liquidations in a lot of so liquidations of loans for example and a lot of protocols you're going to take out a loan and you're going to collateralize it with some asset and there is a mandated collateralization ratio that you need to respect and so if the price of the asset falls under a certain a certain price target then the you the clarization ratio of your loan is going to be below the required collateralization ratio and so your your loan is going to be able to be liquidated um and so that price update to the protocol is usually a price oracle update and so as someone who wants to seize that liquidation opportunity you want to be after that oracle update so again this is where the the sense of transaction ordering comes in right um moving on to the next slide um so there's been a bit of confusion around mev because the term itself that was initially coined again by phil and his collaborators was called minor extractable value and um what what a lot of people took from that term was that miners are extracting this value right but what what the the term minor denotes is um the the theoretical maximum extractable value because going back to these opportunities right the miner could in theory put themselves basically copied these transactions that are capturing some value and uh capture the value themselves right and so what the minor term denotes in minor extractable value is essentially the the upper bound on what the most powerful entity uh related to transaction ordering can can can extract in terms of value so the the the permissions that miners have uh are essentially the the constraints on on quantifying that value um and so there is this this like theoretical maybe that that that you see in the circle and then there's this extracted mu which is what what has been recorded uh on chain and what what what we've tried to to quantify um and as you can see on the right there's been several efforts to uh quantify this uh that have happened relatively recently so there is mv explore e0 that we released on monday as well as a team at imperial college i'm not sure if they're on the call um but if they're not shout out to to them uh i released a paper in january and a paper that was released recently by invested during uh also trying to quantify um some some of that activity that i just mentioned so it's it's more related to d5 trillion activity but i hope you can see the relation between that and uh mev and how they're both one and one in the same in in some way until your question time unless you want to move into your question time for a little bit more of this presentation um i'd be happy to take maybe one or two questions just because it's it's important to if there's anything that was unclear that it's uh clarified uh before we dive a little bit deeper into this but uh what what what is going to go uh what i mean the following that's going to happen is i'm going to talk about this this gray circle and then phil is going to talk about this this white circle essentially um so maybe if there's any kind of confusion i'm happy to answer a question now if now we can also keep it to the end i think alex and you're running out of time all right sounds good sounds good all right so let's focus on on mv explorer which we we released on on monday and our our approach there so that's the little little blue circle um so we released the the explorer monday um which is a live dashboard of uh mev activity as well as a transaction explorer of mvp transactions that we've included in our inspection of the ethereum blockchain and we've we've found uh these these values that you see here so we've gone back to january 1st 2020 and since then we found about 300 plus dollars 300 plus million dollars of extracted mv and we kind of display a few numbers here so the last 30 days last 24 hours cumulative and daily extracted um we also drill down into this value and we try to look at it from the protocols these transactions interacted with as well as the type of strategies like the ones that i mentioned before right arbitrage and liquidation and arbitrage plus liquidation as well as how that value is split between uh the miners mining uh the mev transaction and uh the senders i'm gonna explain all this in a little bit more detail but um kind of going through this um finally in in in the dashboard we're also uh quantifying the network activity from extracted mev so trying to understand how much gas maybe transactions took as the overall gas usage of the ethereum network as well as some more specific network activity from what we've called failed mev transactions which i'm going to explain as well in a in a second and imply wasted ethereum blocks related to them in terms of the transaction explorer which is in the leaderboard section we put all the transactions there that are inserted into our database and there's a little easter egg where the ones that have a blue highlight are uh flashbots transactions uh you can spell them particularly because they have a zero zero gas fee um i won't go into the detail how the flashback system works but um yeah so anyway um it's important to note and that this is what we're going to go through a little bit in more detail is is that we only cover a certain set of protocols and a certain type of transactions and we also use uh some some data sources not all the potential data sources we could be using right so we cover eight protocols mentioned here and within these eight protocols um we cover different types of strategies for for each of them and more more importantly we don't cover multi-transaction mev so we only focus on single transactions and the value that they uh snatched or seized so if a strategy involves multiple ethereum transactions that's not something we'd be able to cover currently so one at one example of such strategies would be sandwich sandwich trades where you submit a transaction uh before uh unit swap order for example and after it as well um we also don't cover uh centralized exchange to decentralize exchange arbitrage which uh intuitively is a large chunk of um the activity you know the activity related to transaction ordering we also don't do any address grouping so if someone is uh executing a strategy with several addresses they control uh we don't currently group these addresses and try to find the ultimate owner um we also the type of data that we look at is mentioned here and one thing to mention is we don't look at any mental data so uh we don't we it's hard for us to see how many transaction replacements were done in a priority gas auction or to quantify other types of network overhead like the the the network overhead for example from these these repeated uh transaction replacements um and so how do we calculate extract energy so how do we calculate you know this number that's shown here and then the kind of breakdown by by date um so we we we essentially look at two types of transactions successful and failed mev transactions and within failed they're reverted and checked the mvp transactions so as as i mentioned before we scrape the ethereum blockchain and we essentially look at the logic inside each transaction and we kind of do some some accounting of understanding the the starting balance the ending balance uh and then trying to understand how that works i'm going to give you an example right after this to make it more concrete but what what is what is essentially counted in extracted mvv is um this excel i mean the successful mev transaction value that was created from it or captured from it plus uh the related gas fees as well as the related gas use of failed mv transactions why we're counting the gas fees for failed mvp transactions is because even though that transaction didn't capture any value because if it failed to capture value they're still to to to have the privilege to go for this mev opportunity they still paid a transaction fee to the miner and that's mev-related value that was paid to the miner right within the failed mev transactions there are reverted transactions and checked transactions there are two different types of failed reverted would be for example you ran out of gas the transaction ran out of gas or someone else snatched the opportunity before you uh and checked is a more subtle one where before actually firing the mbb transaction and paying a lot of transaction fees you you actually first do a check of the relevant liquidity pools for example um that you want to do a price arbitrage on uh and you decide based on that check whether to fire an mbv transaction or not ultimately the result is the same in terms of uh failed energy opportunity so let's let's go through like a quick quick example which i'm conscious this is a little bit theoretical and so it's it's nice to anchor it in in something more concrete so this is an example of a transaction that's part of our database um and this is a screenshot from etherscan so as you can see i mean i'm using the transaction action which is is not always correct but in that case it works if not we should use the tokens transferred but this particular sender started with 4.15 approximately ether and ended with 4.24 what they did in the middle is they swapped that ether for usdc on unit swap then they swapped that usdc for wu which is a token i'm not aware of and then they swapped the woo for ether and so they ended up with more ether than they started with and this is all happening within the same transaction right and so if you kind of break down oop sorry if you kind of break down uh the extracted mav here so you you take the ending balance and you subtract the starting balance from it um and then you look at the transaction fee which is the the txt collided by the miner right because that's damn it because that's part of the the the value from mv that was given away and so essentially what you have from the extracted mvp breakdown is you have the income from the mav transaction sender and the income from the med transaction miner um so this is this is essentially a very simplified version of uh the logic of what we do within explore um and what we do with transactions we do something similar for failed and reverted but in that case we we look at their gas fee as the the the only mvv the only extracted maybe that was that was created from them you got five minutes left all right i'm gonna i'm gonna rush um so they're they're as i mentioned before there are three different um at least there are two ever approaches that were recently released of trying to quantify that extracted mv um the one from imperial the word from the university of luxembourg uh there are differences in them uh in that we cover different date ranges we have different approaches so we we look at the transaction trace whereas imperial looks at event logs and university example takes a a very generic approach of looking at just trying to identify bot operators by by doing some some cluster grouping and then examining the transaction structure directly we also cover different protocols which obviously is is a big difference and uh relatively different transaction types right so in the case of university of luxembourg they focus on uh front running but essentially they also include sandwiches in that which they they they call insertion uh imperial focuses on sandwiches arbitrages and liquidations and we focuses on arbitrage we focus on arbitrages and liquidations and arbitrage liquidations um what i why i'm talking about this and why this is important is that what i want to essentially what i want to essentially say is we're all kind of trying to um do the same thing which is trying to get closer to that gray circle and understanding that better and these different efforts are all kind of related to to doing that um and so how how can we get closer to that to that gray circle right so we can increase our protocol coverage uh covered new d5 protocols or gd5 protocols can expand the single transaction mbv types to more i mean to different ones for example coupon reductions for rebasing tokens and some some of the other things uh mentioned mentioned here um one of them by the way is adding in canceled mv transactions which was suggested by a community member and and court uh and that is extremely relevant um that being said is not the only thing to do it's not only about adding more more you know making the number bigger uh it's also about cleaning the data more and making sure there is less and less misclassifications um so we have a in the transaction explorer section we have an outlier maybe transaction currently in review tab and we also have a public repo where people can open in issues for misclassified transactions they found as well as anything else that they want to improve as well as the the inspectors we're using themselves the code is all open source and we encourage you to check it out and potentially contribute to it finally we're also working closely with the uh imperial team that was mentioned before in uh comparing our approaches and uh our databases and understanding the subtleties of our methodologies better um the last thing is also to to have more discussions around me because there are a lot of kind of broader questions um that three that i mentioned here and as part of the public repository that i mentioned before there's a discussions tab in it where we definitely love to to have you uh uh create discussions there um and understand you know some some of these uh some of these questions is there such a thing as negative mav uh is mev that is not permissionlessly extractable really mev like that first point about keeper dao um and yeah sorry i rushed through the end a little bit uh you got about a minute or two left so i can throw the questions at you that were in the chat yeah please so this one will be a quick answer can you make the start date of implied wasted ethereum blocks configurable currently 4 600 blocks out of 2.2 million mine blocks at the same time does not really convey a good picture since there's almost no activity until july um it is something we can make configurable so on metabase i believe we can add filters um and so i mean i won't go into the the details of of metabase itself but it is definitely something something to be clear this this dashboard that we released maybe explore is a v0 as the names as the name says um and we're planning to provide a lot more granularity into this data uh and to also provide a lot more different views so uh making a lot of it configurable so you can look at the date range that matters to you is definitely uh something we want to do uh it's not something you can currently do with with the current version of the dashboard now and then what about giving up on mev transactions by replacing your transaction with a transaction of 2100 gas or higher are they calculated uh so they're not calculated and that is what i mentioned in the canceled mv transactions here so there are two types of canceled the one that you just mentioned and the second one that is quote-unquote cancelled where um you essentially burn a bunch of gas tokens to lower your your effective gas price um or your gas gas spend um and the other type that you just mentioned where like you kind of spot that you might have lost a pga and you you you give up on that transaction so it's like right now we're calling them canceled mvp transactions and they're not currently counted i will say that when they are counted in the split that is shown here you know the the split by roll should differ significantly because this is a again no mev with seas but a lot of gas i mean not a lot of gas but some gas would have been spent maybe not necessarily by the example that was mentioned by that question but by the second one the the gas tokens that are burned um and so i expect this to change as well as the network overhead here to change uh where the the green are successful and red are are failed i expect that the failed to be significantly higher i hope that that answers the question very good presentation alex and yeah i think that did answer the question uh thank you for the questions from marius world famous geth developer um and we're going to go ahead and move on to phil who's going to be talking about extractable value a clockwork finance a mechanized framework for a con economic security and smart contracts so he'll have 15 minutes for slides and 15 minutes for questions and i think that's it yeah this is a 50 minute thing yeah there we go go ahead phil uh great hey everyone so great to see everyone here and thanks for coming and uh being interested in mev and for the great questions let's see so they recently upgraded linux to make it way crappier for hangouts can you guys see these slides it is loading it is loading and we can see them they look great and real quick do you want the air horn at certain intervals or just at the very end uh what did you say 15 you have 15 minutes for a presentation and uh no wait uh yeah 15 minutes for presentation 15 for questions is what the agenda says if you want to go into that question time a little bit for your presentation that's fine too but uh how do you want to be rushed yeah i'll probably talk for 20. you can give me five minute air horn would be cool sweet all right go ahead all right so great to see everyone uh so today we're going to talk about defy we're going to talk about how composability relates to mev we're going to talk about how we define mev and how we plan on measuring it and we're going to talk about why mev is such an important metric and how it can prevent defy composability from becoming compostability so today i actually have my cornell hat on this is uh not flashbots research this time this is cornell research that i'm doing with co-authors kuchal babel mahimna kalkar and ari jules although it is all open source research that of course plays into kind of the broader flashbots agenda and the research roadmap and kind of synergizes with all of that and we we do plan on probably integrating eventually into some of the the products like explore um so first we can talk about compost it's a pretty essential to understand this to understand my talk uh so here where i am now in west virginia it turns out that recycling is not really that big or existent at all so in order to reduce our waste we have to use only materials that can compost and that's when you can take food scraps and other kind of degradable items mix them together mix them with some soil and some other kind of catalysts and you basically get a pile of worms and other biodegrading entities that give you mulch and fertilizer that you can use instead of cow manure for your garden so why is this important to defy well we're all here kind of talking about mev and alex did a great job kind of introducing mev so mev was originally kind of created as this metric to study blockchain and consensus security but as it turns out i think mev is really the holy grail of kind of defy metrics because it unifies all these different concepts that we kind of talk about here at flashbots one of them is arbitrage and that's kind of in the style of wall street bots in like the 90s and high frequency traders another one is exploitation as a source of mev so like all these new attacks we've seen with flash loans and things that blur the lines between arbitrage and uh like system hacking and compromise um also verification so there's a whole literature of so on in software security of like how do you make sure programs do what they want uh what you want them to do how do you check these things how do you develop automated tools to prove to other people that programs do what they think there's also the concept of mev which is minor or maximal as we just kind of went through extractable value again this is kind of important because high mev potentially could degrade consensus security as miners kind of fight against each other and are incentivized to behave poorly and there's also an important concept here of composability so like if you're a defy instrument or app developer how do you make sure your legos are secure and that they don't affect things that are already in the system and that they're not kind of overly affected by things that other people will deploy in the future or already have deployed on the network um so we can start kind of unifying all these things and talking about how to measure this mev and how to measure composability and arbitrage and exploitation in the theoretical bound so how much is there in the system right now on the table first by defining mev so how do we define meb formally so i'm going to give you kind of a hand wavy high level formal definition here and i expect you to pop questions in the chat if this is not clear but basically we define mev formally as how much each a special miner account can extract given a set of user transactions t an initial state s and a set of contracts c and the power a minor has in the system as we've mentioned includes inserting their own transactions censoring and reordering transactions in t so you can think of t here as the mempool basically what are all the things people are doing now that these miners or validators or entities uh that we're looking at kind of have access to what is the state of the world these are the things that these entities kind of can't change so maybe the state of the last block they're trying to mine on top of and what contracts are available to them so what code is kind of known in the universe um this is important for things like quantifying muv before and after introducing a certain contract which is how we relate mev to composability so we now use this definition of mev which is how much ether minor account can extract given all these three things to define composability um composability basically defines how well smart contracts mix together so we basically say a set of contract c composes with the contract c prime in initial states s star so you'll notice that all these mev definitions are parameterized for certain states and that's kind of fundamental for for various theoretical reasons you can imagine a state where a miner has like a trillion dollars gives them access to much more mev than a state where they have zero dollars because they can do things like buy up all the token supply and attack governance and stuff like that so it's important to kind of put assumptions on these states and to be aware that your contract is probably only going to be secure in certain states if it does anything that's interesting and then you also have to be aware of what these states look like so now that we have these kind of state conditions we basically look at if adding c prime to the set of contracts adds mev then more mev than having c alone for any state so basically we're saying this set of contract c that's on the network composes with a new contract we're going to deploy if adding this new contract doesn't increase the mev of the world substantially again there's some theoretical kind of caveats here so we bound this by some function in kind of like a standard definitional way and we say something composes universally if this holds for all possible um contracts and all possible uh states but that's that's going to be something that's very rare right you're rarely going to have a contract that's secure in every possible world generally because we have financial instruments here they're secure as long as people use them a certain way or as long as other instruments behave a certain way or as long as the world behaves a certain way so now that we have these definitions how do we use them so the title today is what's called the clockwork finance framework and this is kind of an approach to defining and reasoning about smart contract security and it starts by taking your contracts let's say uniswap here and defining them in this abstract mathematical way as a simple pseudo code cs program like you've seen in all your cs textbooks but in with a universal notation for kind of state entries and things like that so the idea here is that our goal is to create a number of these mathematical definitions for every contract on the network so we can then throw them at our magical math tools and ask how can these things interact and when do they fail when they're kind of composed in what states and under what actions and strategies and concretely we can throw the ethereum network data at it to see how much could miners be making on chain if they were using other powers today rather than kind of playing this game with bots so here's an example of the uniswap contract this takes an in token and now token and an input amount it looks up the balance of uniswap in each of these tokens call that x and y and it calculates basically how much the user is sent as this formula of x and y this is the idealized like abstract x times y equals k invariant formula that's in the unit swap white paper and also the formal verification of unit swap and then it affects all the kind of state changes required otherwise it outputs this special failure case similar to throwing on ethereum so even just having this abstract mathematical model is already useful from a theoretical point of view um so one thing we can do with this is kind of reason about composition so one thing that turns out to be surprising that that you know this this again is is research that's not released and not peer reviewed yet but we plan on having it out very soon and you know we have been giving giving talks about it for some time so in some sense it's a little bit battle tested but i don't want you to look at this as like finalized peer-reviewed in any way but once you have these kind of models you can start reasoning about them and uh thinking about things like how introducing multiple amms that operate together causes instability by increasing mev so even if you deploy the same unit swap code twice you have basically structural mev that exists because users are going to trade in certain ways and any kind of set of trades user makes is always going to expose some arbitrage transaction to the miner and that's kind of what we prove algebraically in a very very simple way here it kind of logically follows from the model and this is this is interesting because we wrote this proof like probably like six months ago or something and that i i don't think at the time there were even multiple amms out there it was really only uniswap but since then we've seen for example sushi swap has come out and done exactly this of redeploying you know plus some token incentives that aren't modeled here but the same amm and we've seen these large opportunities that come when unislop and sushi swap pools become close in size that is predicted by the model so that's one use of these models is for dapdavs to think about how does their dap behave in unforeseen circumstances how does it behave when it's composed with other dapps or even with itself um this kind of formal framework of measuring the loss loss function in mev is is a way for dap devs to think about this um great so now that we have our paper stuff we also have executable models so now that we have these on paper models we can write them down in mathematical software tools so this is kind of the same program we had earlier written in a in a framework called the k framework which you might know from smart contract and evm verification in a very simplified modeling language so this isn't the full evm it's just a very simple language that carries a little bit of state and allows for an ordered set of transactions called a block and allows kind of arithmetic operations on the state so here you can see this model is exactly the program we had before when some address in some token wants to swap some trade amount of input for some output token with some gas fee so it's a little bit more rich than the model we have before it includes gas and what it's going to do is it's going to debit the address that's trading in the input token the amount that it's sending into the unisop contract so this arrow here rewrites means like this execution is going to do this whole block of operations and the next thing it's going to do is kind of uh credit uh the user with this x times y equals k formula it's not exactly the formula we had earlier because unit swap does some rounding to kind of uh protect its liquidity providers um from drainage attacks so we include that in this model so that it's accurate to on-chain state transitions and then the unit swap token kind of gets the opposite where it gets credited the input and debit at the output and the the address gets debited at the gas fee so these models are intended to be human readable by kind of anyone who has math training and modular so that each protocol dev can define their own models that are separate from each other but that can also inter-operate on the same state and the same network s and b here and allow us to reason about compositions between these things using these definitions that we just showed so one thing we do after we define the model is we then spider the blockchain and we look at every transaction say to uniswap and pull it out as a kind of programmatic description and these are a little bit simplified they don't have slippage limits and things like that that we do have in our data but it's just intended to basically provide an english language data driven log for the models that can be used by researchers to study what would have happened in the past if these things were reordered or if they composed with something that we hadn't thought about kind of at the time um so once we have these kind of programs we call them all these inputs that happen on the blockchain we can ask our tool to kind of automatically find the amount of mev that could have been extracted by a miner given these transactions um and our tool will magically spit out like this is the best block order for the miner and uh blah blah blah i'm sweeping a bunch of details under the rug there's a bunch of caveats limitations etc so it's not quite magical but you can stay tuned for the paper if you're more interested in those here i really want to talk about the vision of what we want to build and kind of get roasted on that so the vision of what we want to build is basically this definition the set of definitions of all these d5 protocols that we can use uh in existing program verification tools like k to generate things like optimal strategy finders um and debuggers for our models that we can throw on chain data at fuzzers to kind of automatically find strategies things like that um yk well k already like i said it has a bunch of evm support it has a bunch of formalized drc 20 models that we can test our simplified models against and it also has verified smart contracts like uniswap and other kind of uh d5 contracts so it's been used for east contracts before which kind of is convenient um but nothing we're saying here is case specific and neither are these models uh and there are a variety of kind of formal verification tools that you can use to do this verification and and use this definitional framework to reason about your contracts um hey bill you're you're halfway through your time and is there really something called yes there's really something called cops it means in in french and uh the logo is a big rooster uh um and uh i'm pretty convinced that the the french formal verification engineers where by the way  like the whole french formal verification community loves like you've never seen so uh yeah i'm pretty sure they were trolling people but uh this is not like substantiated and they fervently deny it as far as i know got him yes so is probably the biggest the number one tool that we're looking at possibly compiling into so we can probably automatically compile a lot of these models into and we can kind of benchmark the performance of that against k but fundamentally these tools are kind of all for doing the same thing which is mathematically reasoning about these programs and these protocols um yeah and casper is not eth casper it's a different casper it's a very overloaded name so yeah we've taken our tool and we actually ran it on every on-chain unit swap transaction in our unit swap models as well as a bunch of maker dial transactions this graph is only for validating the unislop models so at the time we first validated our model there were something like 120 000 unit swap transactions in the biggest pair we validated only by pair because the unit swap model doesn't use state across pairs so there's not really a point um the results are kind of path independent along along different pairs um and so we ran about 100 000 transactions through our models in about i don't know 500 seconds 10 minutes of wall clock time slower than executing native code by you know maybe an order of magnitude but considering these are fully formal models that we can now use to reason uh not too bad for validating these um the other thing is a lot of what we're doing here so this is kind of parallelism when you're looking for the optimal order for mev because we're looking for the optimal order of transactions this is actually embarrassingly parallel up to a certain point so this graph kind of sucks and it's very preliminary we're gonna we're gonna refine this quite a lot but the point here is in this beginning region of like up to 20 threads kind of you get almost linear um speed up from parallelizing and this probably holds across machines too so we're looking into parallelizing like much more massively across various clusters and things like that but that work is still under wraps um so we use these models to kind of measure mev in practice uh in various blocks this isn't the mev that actually happened so we're not looking back and like replaying sandwiching attacks we're not looking back and measuring what bots did or anything like that we're looking back at the list of transactions that happened and throwing each block of transactions into this formal model and saying like try to reorganize these and extract as much muv as you know how to and give us the best order so many of these attacks may not have happened in the past in the blockchain they're just theoretical um and there are some limitations here right like our models do simplify away some details like arbitrage bot wrapper contracts that might make some of these attacks like less practical and require an extra validation layer that's kind of beyond the scope of this talk but the point is that you can use these models to measure and get insight as to what the optimal strategies are on chain to exploit various contracts and also what the order of magnitude of the mav problem is so here you can see in unisop v1 like the highest mev blocks are on the order that our tool found are on the order of like 175 mev um 175 east of mev which is uh you know 60 times higher than the block reward similarly for sushi swap around 128 again these are very preliminary results we're doing they're not very clearly presented and that's just because this is uh early stages of kind of getting all this work together um the other thing we did here is we looked at two more things um and i know my time is almost up but let me just quickly talk about these so this this is an analysis using our tool of two different models uh that we compose together unit swap and maker dow where we swapped out the maker dow oracles for uniswap as a maker.oracle and we asked the question of like what would the mev be if maker dao in the past were to be using uniswap as an oracle not in any smart way not like averaging over blocks or anything we just did it in a really stupid way of like looking at the last trade price how much can miners gain simply by manipulating transaction ordering and kind of inserting their own transactions and we measured that using this tool again with some limitations that are in the paper i don't want to don't want to oversell too much but i think the point here is that if you're adaptive you can get insight onto changes like this and how they affect your protocol and your users the other thing we did is we looked at the number one example of sandwiching mev in the paper that alex talked about from imperial college and we asked our tool how much better could the miner have done than the bot in that example how much could the miner have extracted if they were kind of pinching every penny out and we got the the kind of optimal trade insertion for the miner so like if you are a miner what transaction should you do how much money should you swap in order to profit as much as possible that's this um kind of alpha parameter of like what amount you use in your transaction and this y-axis is how much mev you make if you use that amount so here you can see our tool being used basically by a minor to solve for what their optimal strategy would have been in a certain kind of execution in the past um and because we're using a mathematical tool our tool can straight up just give you like a formula that you can then graph on wolfram alpha if you're a miner and get a graph like this and see how kind of the profit you're going to make varies with how much money you're going to put into the trade um right um okay so i don't have to tell you guys this next part and that's that everything is meb mev is super important we really want to build tools and approaches and definitions and formal modeling and formal language to measure this in a principled and exhaustive way because if we don't measure mev any mev that we don't measure becomes tail risk in these systems of someone else to find later down the line so we need a really rigorous and formal approach and that's what we're kind of slowly building up to here and thank you for participating happy to take any questions now because this was again a talk with my cornell hat thank you so much to all my cornell co-authors a lot of this work is theirs and not mine and especially my faculty collaborators and all the youth community for being super receptive to this um so that's all i have to say happy to answer questions now you got seven minutes and we got a question from marius that says are you only replaying successful transactions or also failed transactions this would probably skew your results right that's a great question yeah so our data right now is we're only replaying transactions that succeeded because we're using the success of the transaction as a heuristic to identify kind of which transactions were eligible to succeed and that is a very important limitation so like our metric is in in some ways a fuzzy estimate because of various subtleties of mev like there are sources of error both in the overestimating and the underestimating direction unfortunately um and we we're trying to quantify and minimize these as much as possible but most forces are in the underestimating direction like the number is probably much higher than what we've presented and one of the reasons is that we don't cover failed transactions um at all um another reason is because our our state-space search is only so powerful like we're only looking at kind of a limited subset of the state space because we only have that much computation so all right um alex has a question how far are we from miners using such technology to do non-transitional transaction ordering yeah so i don't know if it'll be exactly this toolkit or exactly this framework but using kind of this approach of developing these models and doing this state space search that's exactly kind of what i showed you i think it's i don't know if miners themselves are gonna do it or if we're gonna see specialized kind of companies that specialize in this which is kind of the flashbots state space searcher role um i don't know but i think how far out are these tools uh in terms of like finding mev hard to say i think they they can be useful today with uh with some engineering effort uh that being said it is a decent amount of engineering effort and it might be easier to just and more profitable since it's so early to just like encode specific strategies which is what people do so you'll have like a bot that only does liquidations because the person saw a profitable liquidation strategy it doesn't kind of do this general thing of uh of looking for constant reorderings and things like that um so that's that's most of what we're seeing today and uh it's hard to say like at what point the efficiency equilibrium will will switch so that doing the general state-space search is uh is more profitable but mine but i do think that that the technology is there and i don't see why that wouldn't happen at some point soon we got a couple more questions or three more actually and the next time we'll probably be up what's your intuition on how big this total extractable mev is versus extracted evm or mev that's a great question um i think it's really hard to say like it depends on what you mean by extractable mev which i know is a little bit of a cop-out but like let's say you take the theoretical maximum i think it's way higher because that would include like every single exploit that hasn't been discovered yet every single hack that no one's known yet every single flash loan attack that hasn't been done every single reordering that people haven't anticipated like there's just so many different sources that i can't anticipate it i can't see it being not being like 100 a thousand times higher or more than what people are extracting um that being said it's not what we're measuring is also like some approximation of that we can't account for every single hack because like that would require solving the halting problem and a bunch of other things uh so in terms of that estimate i still think that's an order of magnitude higher than probably what people are extracting all right um marius asks can your tool be extended to compute inter-block reordering yeah so our tool doesn't care about blocks at all like the the block concept in our tool is really just a sequence of transactions in fact we were even considering renaming it in the formalism um so i think the block is almost like at the meta game level of like what does a miner want to try to reorg but yes we can we can kind of reason about multiple blocks uh but by kind of compressing them into one quote-unquote block um we also use like kind of oracles to provide things like block number and block timestamp so you have to kind of build in semantics for that but that's super easy to do and we do look at multi-block reworks it just turns out in many cases they're the single block cases is actually most of the profit these days for subtle reasons here's a good one um gigamo ask and the maker dow using uniswap is an oracle simulation you did does the one hour delay in maker dow's osm oracle affect your results um yeah so we took the one hour delay out for our uniswap uh kind of results um i don't know how you would you would necessarily integrate that so that's like a design question if you have just an hour delay on the uniswap kind of uh price execution like you use the last price but with a delay of an hour my guess is you get like you'll get the percentage of mev equivalent to your hash power so like if you have 20 hash power your muv will go to 20 of what it is in our figures basically um if you do something like average over that hour mev actually goes up pretty substantially um or sorry goes down pretty substantially because it's harder for you to manipulate that whole number which is kind of what the the the uniswap people actually propose at the same time i don't think that's a silver bullet because there's still kind of attacks that bias the oracle but don't like fully extract all the mev that's on the table but maybe make certain mev more or less likely to be extracted that are still economically rational um so yeah this is this is a very theoretical attack with the maker dow oracle like no one would ever actually implement it this way i hope um and then final question from akira how were you able to use k in the unit swap k model to check for previous mev opportunities yeah so basically what we did is we have a k semantics where uh we feed it a block and the k semantics can execute that block in any order it wants to so it can choose to to execute whatever order and it can also choose to like leave certain transactions out and then we also put certain points where the miner was able to insert a transaction so like reasoning about the generic space of minor insertions turns out to be really hard so we just like basically put a bunch of random minor transactions and points with variables in the values so like we'd have all the transactions in the block let's say hudson trades three die for one each with slippage limits blah blah blah tina trades two eth for three die with slippage limits blah blah blah um plus we'd have like minor trades x ether die um and then you you basically ask the k tool like solve for x uh such that like x is maximized and uh it kind of does its magic and says like the the highest x i can find is like when this formula is satisfied and here's a proof potentially um so we use like the proving capabilities of k to basically solve for the optimal amounts that a minor could insert and we also like basically did this for every possible transaction order because there weren't actually that many transactions in the blocks so we were able to do that exhaustively so what has been the most surprising result of this analysis so far this is from robert miller yeah i mean i think i think it's been surprising at least for us like how efficient uh people are in finding attacks like uh i think the sandwiching attacks people do on unit swap are actually pretty good and considering how fuzzy the bot miner game is now they actually capture a decent percentage of the available mev so like i was expecting the bots to be much worse at what they do and be burning more money than they are the bots are actually i think the the more sophisticated actors in this whole game right now um which we kind of knew but it was it was surprising to to see it it's always surprising to see it kind of come out from like first principles i guess [Music] we're on to the next section amazing i wanted to use airport so bad and i forgot to use it during your presentation so i just had to pull it out there thank you so much phil um all right well we're on to roast questions this is where things can get spicy everyone throw out your hottest takes your things that'll get you kicked out of flashbots maybe uh actually don't go that far um let's see uh there was a few questions i had we might not get through all these and that's okay but um one of the things i kind of i came up with these just from uh looking at past roast questions and some of the stuff i looked over in the last 24 hours hastily uh but like can you design a program or a contract that like detects bad image well okay bad and me v is like probably subjective but like stuff that isn't arbitrage but that is like harm more harmful than other types of mev and like have a contract reverse the transactions and kind of punish the person extracting that med in certain circumstances and that's for anybody in the call uh just like unmute speak up you're good to go i mean phil correct me if i'm wrong but like using similar logic to what you described someone could do that right yeah i definitely like uh i mean i think it depends where you approach it from i think defining good mev is a lot easier than defining bad mev just because you good mev you can like specifically say this strategy is okay or something or this order is fine or this state is okay whereas bad mev is just like such a large state space of uh of things that like it's hard to say like it's hard to categorize because it's even hard to like programmatically notice and detect like like a hack for example like how can you tell whether a transaction is a hack or not um like you might be able to look at how much money is moving around but there are plenty of normal transactions that also move around lots of money in weird ways so you really have to know whether it violates people's expectations outside the protocol and that's like hard to do from just inside the protocol by itself um but good mev i think is much easier like you could say like yes you can reorder unisoft transactions as long as the slippage doesn't go more than like five percent below a randomized order or five percent below the gas order or something so like that that could be a programmatic check and like that could potentially allow for things like that um yeah i think this is an open question that i think we've discussed several times on the ethical the ethical side of things also like is there good and bad mev and like do we want to um classify it and like what are the pitfalls of classifying it versus not uh it's kind of maybe like to to give an analogy hudson like eat transactions like uh are there good and bad eth transactions like uh is the dow hack a bad youth transaction should we try to detect it and not execute it or de-prioritize it um same with like people uploading things that are like bad to the blockchain like obviously i think there's there's wide consensus that there's certain types of like you know maybe unethical information that we don't want to be propagating with running our nodes uh or maybe the information's not unethical you know it's like it's i think it's a very controversial question but i would draw that analogy to mev of like uh what are the unexpected uses and like what's the harm and what's the harm in harm reduction and how do we balance all these different things cool um i'm going to just skip some of my questions and go to marius's questions in chat because i think they're more cool have you thought about mev from a gas token refund mechanism and i like this question a lot because right now in the latest core developer call there's been a push by some poor devs to get rid of the um self-destruct opcode that enables gas token and would completely wreck the gas token market pretty much uh and make sure that you know doesn't happen i guess is gas token any v and if that's so then i guess this would be a good way to combat it um right yeah so gas token definitely exposes and is a kind of mev uh like let's say there's a liquid gas token unit swap market then the mev is from like miners minting gas token and selling into it for example that would increase their eath balance um there's also like subtleties in like the way i defined mev was like in terms of eth how much eath can a miner make you could probably reasonably define it in usd also if you want to include things like off-chain systems or like minor costs so it also depends how you define mev like if you define it in usd i think unambiguously yes gas token is uh pretty much pure mev interesting and uh marius also says is it ethical to publish any v-enabled guest that makes it easier for miners to extract value that is a little um little like uh ticking sticking your tongue out face i believe because uh uh i think that they're not publishing death with any of these stuff right now but i like my take on that personally is i think it levels the playing field so that like mining pools and miners who don't have the technical expertise to go and mod geth or mod open ethereum or whatever they're using to mine like they have a level playing field or a more level playing field to actually do this and then that pushes the responsibility onto the dap developers to code their contracts in a way that prevents mev so you're really pushing the responsibility to better software development practices which is never a bad thing in my opinion so that's that's kind of my take what do other people think and marius you can also speak up too if you want if you're on mike uh because i'm really curious what the geth team has thought about this if you all have any public opinion i think the the emoji that he put is also because that's essentially what flashbots has built uh as i would i would expect maybe that's why he asked this question yeah yeah uh i i think generally we take the approach that mev is unavoidable and so in that case you don't want it to be extracted by you know that there's like significant asymmetry in its extraction either because some actors have some privileged rights related to extraction or um because there's they're kind of unilateral deals that are not transparent so making sure that extraction is uh as you mentioned a level playing field not only on the minor side but also on the extractor side uh that it's uh relatively permissionless i mean fully permissionless of course um but they're there there's a spectrum there um and and that it's transparent i think it's definitely very important uh again taking the approach that med is unavoidable looking at ethereum as this kind of uh general purpose computing platform with uh unbounded complexity and so as phil was mentioning as you add even as you add just like one new small contract there might be new ways to uh you know extract value from transaction ordering or insertion and so uh it's it's it's it's very hard to take take the other point of view which is we can just completely have mev gone from ethereum and so um i think that's that's what i would answer um i don't know if anyone else has something to add to that or a counterpoint i have a lot to say but i want people to argue with alec yeah argue with alex someone yell please yeah i don't really have a counterpoint because i agree with you i wish i did i mean i think there there there have been some oh sorry phil go ahead that was i was gonna say there have been some counterpoints in the form of uh talking about changes to the protocol itself uh that would that would reduce mvv in in in some way or citing you know other other forms of blockchains or consensus protocols that might be leaderless for example where you don't have uh you know um transaction ordering that is centralized for for some time interval um and so i think people kind of mentioned that as alternative architectures uh but i think looking at ethereum specifically uh this is about this this is the argument i'm making so i i'm not necessarily making it for like generally for all blockchains i think for for ones that are at a point where they're still designing some of the some of the elements of their protocol can they can do such drastic changes um i think there's there's there may be a different answer here steph has raised his hand get in here steph yeah um thanks so yeah one one question i have about me mitigation so i tend to agree with the idea that this is the adapt developer's responsibility to minimize mev um i'm wondering what is the sentiment on approaches that essentially give permission rights to extract it to like whitelisted participants as opposed to miners is that uh is that better is that worse than than having miners uh extract it uh and why i mean purely intuitively it does feel like when that grows big enough then you just you know moved the problem from you know the ethereum chain to that that pool of white listed addresses right so ultimately it does i mean maybe i'm missing something uh but it it it does feel like you're just punting the problem to that white listed pool rather than um rather than solving for the problem and there's like a trust element to it interesting any other takes on that oh represent whitelist as nfts oh that's a cool idea that like you can trade them well they're kind of open so you could like replicate them so it wouldn't be an nft but if you do like a if you kind of wrap them in something to make them like so like a new cipher type of deal where only certain people can see it that would be interesting oh it's an idea presented at a past roast okay awesome so something i was thinking about this kind of goes into question four of my roast questions there's a lot of like uh like polarizing opinions on mining pools in general there is the people who are like they're profit seekers they're only in it for the money and we shouldn't you know include them and a lot of major decisions on ethereum they're they're like we're they're like doing this for their purposes to extract value and so we're not needing to include them on stuff and then like i come in and i'm like well i know ether mine and i know spark pool and i know f2 pool people and they're all really nice and they seem pretty altruistic so from a flashbots perspective from your interactions with minor miners and mining pools what has in your opinion been the overall sentiment or is there like an overall flashbot sentiment about mining pools and like whether or not they're willing to work on some of these research questions and solve things for the good of the ecosystem rather than just be profit-seeking i guess on that question uh i've been the one who has interfaced most with mining pools and um just like you said um most of us um like i think one of the biggest issues between divide between maybe the developers um users as well as like against the miners and mining pools is that they're viewed um before they were viewed they were reviewed as an evil entity um as an assumption before they were viewed as individuals um and so they are in some sense um entities but we sometimes forgot that they were the earliest supporters i think sparkful wrote a tweet um yesterday about um despite they were against 1559 they were the first investors um uh first first sets of investors um that invested in ethereum and they've been there since then and so i think a lot of them were just geeks we forgot about that and we view them as um their corporate entity and identity um way over beyond and assume the positions that they would take so that i think that was essentially that has been what i've observed as the biggest misunderstanding that is lacking from the other side um and coupled with certain type of um behaviors oftentimes associated with mining pools because of its uh adversary uh real environment spark pool etc and every single mining pool in every uh in bitcoin ethereum gets ddos on a daily basis and um so essentially they try to stay low um as much as possible and so like essentially by not speaking or having language barrier um that would uh further the communication barrier and essentially the trust sometimes is necessary for the community to move forward together so i think that's um i'm commenting on a observation and to answer the question of on mev extraction the interesting observation may be surprising to many of you here the ones that are pro and active about mev extraction are the ones who actually vocally supported each 2 and eip 1559 that is a very interesting coincidence that i've noticed recently as i've spoken to most of them and the ones who have initial scrapples immediately upon reaction of hearing this um idea um um are the ones who are currently vehemently opposing for various reasons um i think um that that that are i think uh interesting in in terms of diving into their real um how much skin in the game there is and how diversified each mining pool as an entity is in terms of their um vested interest in eth interesting what other takes do we have on this one yeah i know that there are signs that i mean there's definitely risk because like i think it was in phil's presentation he was saying that like when you extract 60 times the block reward from mev as a mining pool you get richer than the other mining pools so you can buy more equipment and become bigger miners and then that kind of you know cycles over itself and you you know like basically like price out other mining pools and become a major pool that has like could have over 51 percent of the network at some point or you know things like that if you take that example all the way to the end so like that's a threat but at the same time like i think scott's in the call and there was like a paper about the dark force that scott did where in order to mitigate a defy hack that was potentially going to be front run they worked with the mining pool to insert the transaction anonymously basically or not anonymously but without having to have it be processed through the mempool and publicly available for people to front run um and i think that that's like kind of shows a sign that like yeah they're not in it just for the money like they could have made a lot of money off that and instead they're helping with the ecosystem so i don't know if you can get on mike scott and give a take on that um yeah i think that's one interesting thing that i've learned in talking to these various mining pools is that a lot of them because they are composed of lots of people that are volunteering their their hash power to these these services um that they're they're really concerned about the perception um i kind of assumed that it was going to be like oh if i can make one way extra i would do it and it really hasn't been the case there has been a lot of discussion around you know what they can do to be perceived in the most positive light and i think that's where things like um you know mev explorer or using flashbacks in a way that has done like white hat rescues i think those have been like really valuable in in getting some of the the miners on board is helping them understand what is going to be perceived in the most positive light but yeah you're right it's not purely profit driven interesting marius asks a good question what about mev and layer 2 such as censoring plasma roots and that kind of goes into my question two like doing side chains or separate chains or this future where we have multiple block chains all interacting with each other what what are the opportunities for mev extraction when it comes to like seeing that there's about to be a big cross-chain transaction using a dex once those kind of become more readily available yeah i mean i think you hit the nail on the head and so did marius um yeah i think it's it's going to be a super interesting world because l2 is like optimism they intend to handle mev in some way at the l2 layer and they have some strategy for dealing with that but my intuition is also that there's going to be cross l2 mev and things like that and uh how that world shakes out i think is very much depends on the implementation details of things like how do cross l2 transactions work and how do the operators kind of affect which user deposits are like eligible to be censored by miners um and how do things like optimistic roll up interact with uh zk roll up and other kinds of protocols is there any weird edge cases that expose meb there so yeah like like alex said we're definitely interested in that but i don't have good answers other than things will probably be weird and depend on a lot of engineering things we don't know yet i'm curious to hear what other people on this call think about this too and yeah alex posted some good links of examples of the across layer two arbs and some uh research topics on on the on the topic does anyone have any uh stuff on this if not i think we can take more audience questions for a little bit and i also have this what's everyone's favorite mev extraction they've seen because like or the oldest one or like the greatest one because like the one that i remember really like honing into that i think this might have been before mev was termed or widely known but f2 pool censoring or reordering the status uh ico transactions in like 2017 was like such a big deal to me at the time but like no one talked about it like there was like five tweets about it maybe and like none of them got much coverage and i was like why isn't anyone talking about this a mining pool is interfering with an ico during network congestion like what the hell that's a great one yeah that's definitely a vintage one i like i like ether delta arbs because they were my first mev experiments but uh that's biased you know the the the status ico one um i wonder if it didn't get as much coverage because i think the way that it was implemented was just such a terrible idea with like a maximum gas price um you know i i think i think it was very early on in in the mev but uh i think that we moved very quickly away from these these little ceilings on on gas prices as effective ways to allow everyone in yeah it was interesting did you have something phil you were talking uh before scott yeah i was gonna say uh tina do you have a list of people's favorite mevs or any do you remember any fun ones because uh tina always asked people what their favorite mev is when they joined the uh the pirate ship chat which is kind of what spawned flashback yeah well uh i think they it really depends on uh the person um i think a lot of the major hacks were some of the more gray hats folks um favorites um i i would actually uh think that um one of the coolest way to find a interesting mev is actually literally go on mev explorer i know like we deliberately take out some of the stuff on the leaderboard but still there is a weird column called outlier transactions and you can actually find a lot of weird outlier transactions that work or did not work in that particular subset so i think like it's in everyone's game to kind of define what's your favorite what is your favorite type um and go into you know the wild to see what has been done i think that's you know that's a a pretty uh fun thing to do and you'll continue to have a new favorite you know every day we're having a favor every week um for flashbacks um that um the where we're looking for um looking at meb um um strategies that are creative uh the mev of the week especially the ones that are smart um and do not harm the users uh those are some of the ones that scott has a short list of for sure um scott could you could you explain the the toasts i think that's a fine one oh yeah the toast yeah this is one we'll be seeing more and more of um the reason we call it a toast is because it is like a uh it's a sandwich attack but it's like an open-faced sandwich attack right so it's a toast where there's just one bit of bread and some meat so you know when you submit and and when you submit an amm order even if you include like literally 0.0 slippage in the the uniswap interface if it's a large order you're going to have some natural slippage just from the volume of your exchange and one of the yeah is a hot dog sandwich i'm sorry uh you know even if you uh so if you background this transaction a large large large order on an amm with zero slippage you're not like pushing something in the wrong direction but you can back run it and be the first to be exposed to that new price post that large transaction um you can instantly take large arbitrage opportunities and there's there's really no no harmed party here you then you know a sandwich attack some people usually push someone's order and give them a worse price and then sell back to them on the other side a toast is really just being the first person to get what to get the price of a market that was going to be available to everyone after that transaction um you know what went through anyway so it's it's kind of a um a fun way to to have like a half sandwich attack where there really aren't any harmed parties the only harmed party is that somebody else wasn't going to get that new great price on this market from a large order very interesting huh so when you said toast i was like are we doing toast at this roast and i was like yeah i mean i'll do some toast i like the people here uh uh steph what was what's your what's your deal i think the nft ones are still very underrated like um scott had a great uh thread about rescuing some nfds from compromised accounts um that sort of covered how um you know technically the miner can transfer uh nfd from from from from compromise account even if the account doesn't have any heath and so there's a way to use mav for for rescues um but another one that happened i don't know if it was yesterday the day before was a crypto punk that was being sold on on the auction um and someone figured out that the website wasn't uh implemented in such a way that like securely closed the auction like when the you accepted the auction result on the website it just accepted whatever the latest bid was and it didn't specify the amount of the bid and so someone watched uh the mempool for an accept transaction front ran it to replace the bid with a different bid essentially transferred zero to the to the um the to the seller um and and effectively buy uh uh you know quite a valuable nft couple a couple tens of uh thousands of dollars for uh for uh for zero for for nothing um so um people are getting pretty crafty with the way that they use um mev uh plus nfts that's crazy uh we have a couple minutes left um the only um other question is what is the animal mascot for mev and why is a platypus the correct answer we'll take a few comments on this and then probably continue it in the discord chat but uh platypuses are just weird and i think flashbots has very unique people that are just odd they all are just odd especially trying to dive into something like this that's kind of esoteric what do you all think yeah i like it i like platypus i mean honey badger's good but i think andrew miller took that for a whole consensus protocol or some so like we can't use that one i thought platypus was uh neat because it swims in the pool oh yeah well maybe but my english was really bad so i actually had to look up the word so oh beavers are good they build dams makira has a good point beaver's another good candidate oh yeah they they can alter the flow of a pool of uh of water yeah we're damning up all the mev [Laughter] platypuses nurse without nipples and if you take mev as nipples i i don't know where i was going with that um yeah no uh well cool um is there going to be any v-con or and yeah any v-con or like big sub things that happen at conferences once we can go in person or even online there is a uh lined up mev.wtf um that is in store um what's going to be if uh devcon was to happen in colombia in august but i guess that is not then we can either make it virtual um you know have a fun and we have this thing where we haven't really uh started but it would be fun to have this thing called flashbot olympics where instead of making gas wars we um compete on a separate fun game and without hurting the users right the olympics so i think that would go well together would be you know for anyone who's here down to uh you know up for the challenge um and or uh give a talk i think that would be a great time so you know just waiting for um folks to make a proposal on what works when we should do it awesome yeah i wish we know when devcon is but yeah it's postponed for sure um yeah so i think that's about it for the meeting we're just at time or even a little over time by a minute or two thank you so much to the presenters we have a link to the discord channel in chat um and uh we got we had phil and alex present thank you so much thanks tina for organizing these along with other people from the flashbots team and uh yeah everyone have a good rest of your day sorry i wasn't as adversarial as potentially other roast masters but everyone kind of gets along that's exciting and uh definitely looking forward to more conversations on uh ethics and stuff and all these issues favorite mevs so hope you guys all join future rose and uh keep bringing the fire yeah thank you you've been the best by miles all right yeah and for everyone um here our next uh thing next week will be our first ever community transparency update of the flashback organization plus a searcher workshop uh held by scott it'll be next thursday same time need a flashbots pizza party oh that sounds good yeah all right goodnight everyone good morning whatever time it is for you thanks hudson bye you
