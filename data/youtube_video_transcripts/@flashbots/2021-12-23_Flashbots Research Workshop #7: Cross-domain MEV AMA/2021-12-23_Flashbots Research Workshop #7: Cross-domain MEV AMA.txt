all right perfect uh thank you all for joining um this is an ask me anything on the cross domain muv paper you have here myself alex alejo and phil three co-authors of the across the minneapolis paper and we are all at flashbots research so the point of organizing this soon after we released the paper was for anyone that went right through it and had any questions on stuff that was mentioned there uh to give at least an hour or more um for people to ask their questions to the authors of the paper or anything else that has come to your mind that you'd like to ask us before we start i'd just maybe like to point out this is still a work in progress paper um as was mentioned in its its release so there are still of course elements that need to be polished and things that need to be looked at more that's also partly why it's great to have an ama just because a lot of the time people from external from who didn't write the paper or who weren't involved in the research process have a lot of insights that are hard for someone who has been so deep into it to find so i'm not putting any pressure on any of you to give those insights but generally i find it helpful to get questions the last thing i will mention is there are no uh stupid questions please ask whatever um you'd like to this is open and uh generally we want people to understand what was written there and so if you don't understand then we'd be happy to explain it to you all of that being said if it's really like clearly explained there and it's about you reading a definition then we will point you to that definition all right um i'm sharing a screen where i guess i'll write down questions if people post their questions the main point of doing that is if someone joins the call midway that they're able to see what we're talking about it's not a huge benefit but i thought it'd be it'd be useful uh i need to find where the chat is which i i don't know where i can find that right now but as soon as i find it i'm ready to get questions you're also welcome to unmute yourself and ask questions as well um all right maybe one thing we can do there's a hand raising system in here you guys might be familiar with it um so if you want to raise your hand when you have a question and we cannot mute you that way if you don't want to speak and you want to post your question in the chat please do that as well hello and phil if you can see the chat because i can't please then point questions that are in like oh there it is perfect all right questions if now we can speak for a little bit and then if people have have stuff on their mind they can they can come at any point all right so for everyone who has joined here you're joined without question so far all right cool um well we can talk a bit about the paper alejo and phil how'd you feel about that sweet should i shall i pull it up maybe would that be helpful sounds great you want to go through yeah all right all right so again if there are any questions please send them um cool so this paper came about uh as we were looking at mev across layer twos um so the idea was to explore mav on other chains and other quote-unquote domains and as we dive into that research we found this topic as cross-domain mvp as something interesting so maybe first the title we use domains instead of change just because we want to generalize that concept of you know interactions between two domains more than just chains so we want domains to include layer twos which you know arguably you can consider them as their own chains but they might also not be their own chains um as well as other types of domains so um a centralized exchange could be a domain for example so we wanted our definition to encompass these different places where you would have activity where you know you could do cross-domain and ev between these different places and they're not necessarily chains so maybe that's one thing to know and so the general structure of the article is i guess its main contribution first of all is to formalize cross-domain mev and then is using that formalization to arrive at some understanding or some early results of the impact of activity that would be cross-domain extraction of extractable value um so the early on we define different terms so what is a domain what is a sequencer what's an action and we also motivate why we're looking at this and so we give examples of multi-domain arbitrages so between here ethereum and polygon and matic in w-matic raptomatic i presume and here between three different domains ethereum bsc and polygon we're using data from western gate which is a hackathon flashballs hackathon winner at heath global who's been done amazing work and this data is all public and you can go on their website and see that live so after we motivate this and we give a few definitions i'm not going to go through the definitions until unless a little over phil you think it'll be helpful um we dive we we use these tools so these different definitions to um express what mev is or to define mev so first we introduced the concept of reachable states which is pretty uh i assume some of you are familiar with familiar with it but using that concept of reachable states we're able to define mev as the state where your balance is the highest i'm simplifying things a little bit so now that we have all these tools we start by redefining the original definition of mev i would say or the single domain definition of extractable value using these tools and using these terms and i should mention importantly a lot of these definitions were introduced in a paper called clockwork finance where phil is a co-author and there's also mahemna kalkar and kushal babu that introduces these definitions so we essentially reuse definitions that were introduced before and we try to build on top of these definitions there's slight differences to it and alejo can go a little bit into that he also wrote an article on it called on the formalization of mev that you're welcome to check out and we can put a link in there so now that we have a definition of single domain extractable value given these tools so here we have extractable value is a difference of balance right so bi and bi here represent the balance of inner domain i and then the the the terms that extractable value takes would be the the player the state of the system and the sequences of act of valid actions that are applied on the state s and this valid actions applied on the state s bring the new state of the system to s prime and so what we're essentially saying here is the extractable value not maximum extractable value is the balance difference for a player in state s prime versus the initial balance in state s essentially um [Music] so we then this was extractable value we then defined maximal extractable value saying um it is whenever that balance is at its maximum um so the state where that balance is at its maximum for a single player for a particular player um so that way we obtain a somewhat formal definition of mev for a particular player uh given the state of a domain and again this is single domain maximal extractable value um now that we have this now that we have this tool and this definition especially now that we also define uh not only that it's single domain and so in domain i but also that given our definition we can consider actions that are in a separate domain so here for example we look at the mev in domain i so given that we're looking at the balances in i but we're looking at actions that can only be taken in j j being another domain um and so using this and using this this formulation of mev we're able to then define uh two domain mev um in particular we're trying to understand um whether there's a difference between two domain mev put together in a way and single domain mev from each of these domains um which i'm going to talk about a little bit more later by the way phil and alejo if you want to stop me anywhere feel free to no do note that there's some questions on the chat oh whenever you want to address them so i can't okay perfect uh no questions okay i'll start with 33 gray is one of the attentions here to identify which chain flash bots should give the most focused multi-chain relays uh this is not the attention of this paper this paper is trying to formalize the idea of cross domain mev so i'm going to go into an interesting result that we use given this formalization of course given this result this result will will present itself more acutely in domains where there's a lot of mav very roughly at least intuitively so it does give give an intuition for where an effect that we're going to talk about a little later will kind of show itself or show its head first this in particular paper does not mention where flashbacks should expand or can expand or where other relays should be built that was for 33 away uh francesco a bit of a lazy open question known as among do you see any mitigation to centralization if cross-domain mev were to prove to be much higher than single domain mev i'm struggling to see what could be done since we can control the design of one chain pbs but we can never hope to control the design of the whole multi-domain space i'm trying to understand your question when you mean centralization you mean centralization of the sequencers right that sequencers on different domains would be the same people or that the sets of sequencers would slowly and slowly overlap with one another i assume that's what you mean here it is something that was an argument that was put forward in endgame the article by vitalik um and so i i'm going to introduce that result a little bit later if you don't have more questions but is there a solution to it um it is an open question you're right and somewhat of a lazy question but i think it's a good one to ask um i think there might be a way to design a market such that uh the block building or the sequencing is not centralized i don't think we've achieved such a design yet maybe phil and alejo if you have more comments on that it's definitely something we're very interested in um i do know the theme foundation and other researchers from other organizations are working hard on even if the building market or the sequencing market is centralized how can we maintain censorship resistance um and how can we firewall that centralization to only this and not to block validation and that's the the point in vitalik's endgame article but actually you would want building to be decentralized as well i think what's hard here to some extent is building is inherently computationally intensive at least intuitively it is and so there's a mode there that might be hard to um fight against uh and there's also you know it's prone to information asymmetry for example so i think you can certainly design systems where block building is easier to do for example to the point where you might be commoditized i would say that people working on fare ordering to some extent are looking towards this direction so in a way there's a fair ordering algorithm for how transactions are added and how transactions are ordered and so you can just run an ordering node you don't have to do crazy things or bid the most profitable block you just run the same algorithm that's an ordering algorithm so one could imagine that there could be such a system that would intuitively again would be inherently more inefficient because the ordering wouldn't be the optimal ordering um but at the same time it would maybe allow us to decentralize block building i hope that answers so if i cannot i believe the challenge friends francesco is highlighting here has more to do with the fact that in the cross chain uh domain we don't have control of the design as we could have in a single domain so say okay perhaps we're happy with pbs like and we can come up with a way to do the building in a way that's like sufficiently decentralized or whatever but then how does that interplay in with the cross domain where there can be many other chains with their own uh different designs uh that do not like uh so so then like the the question is like okay with all these domains and this mev that's only appears in the crossover main settings how to minimize uh concentration effects um so that that's my my reading of the question and uh yeah i think it's it's a very difficult uh open problem we are starting to uh think about it more actively at flashbacks yeah but we have some hopes that a marketplace can uh be be built and but yeah that's like uh as far as like uh we have right now it's a it's a it's a super good question and and perhaps one that like needs to be solved if we want like to build then a really open economy in in a multi-domain setting so yeah thank thanks for that question francesca i think it's a very important one phil do you have anything to add no i think that was very thorough amazing all right francesco if that doesn't answer your question or if we got it wrong please say it um i'll keep going until there's more questions yes i assume that's a yes you can still see my screen oh sorry i couldn't hear you but yeah we just see we can still see your screen um okay so continuing here we now have this two domain mev definition so um you can see here in the exponent and the index or indices we now take domains i and j for a player p and for state s of of the system and the state s that we're taking is a general state of the system and we're looking at taking the the maximum of the extractable value of of each right so if you remember the extractable value equation that we have earlier and we're looking at all possible actions both in uh i and in j um one thing to note here that is interesting is this a pricing function here so to be able to reason about a maximum here that our balance is ultimately so there's a value you need to somewhat convert um the assets in one domain to the assets of another domain if you have like optimism eve rb eve at the end of your calculation you need a way to reason about that balance as a unified number instead of two different numbers and so that pricing function allows us to do that um and there's a lot of really nifty things that this pricing function represents uh and quantifies as well which you'd think we think are very interesting um [Music] so now that we have this this little formula we look back at the example above uh the the figures one and two where there were arbitrages between ethereum and polygon ethereum polygon and bsc and we kind of apply this formula there uh including looking at a case where for example the pricing function would be such that the cost of rapmatic would be uh at a significant discount thematic that's on ethereum for some reason that's maybe due to bridges and we can see how you know the profit is still positive it just changes so this is this pricing function is really interesting because it could to some extent give us a lot of information about the market structure um and how markets will unfold because everyone will have their own pricing function in a way um there's a little section about this a little later that i will shout out and talk about this forever so now that we have a two domain case and that we're relatively happy with the formalization um we generalize to you know end domain case and so this is the the formula for us to do that so here you have a pricing function that convert from each domain back to a particular domain and so we obtain this like general formula for n domain maximal extractable value so why this is interesting and we're getting to the point that francesco kind of hinted at in his question is that in a way with this formalization now we can compare uh the med by looking at all the actions that one can take on both i and j at once versus local maximizations and you can split this into three cases which are the three these three bullet points here and if it turns out that the mev by looking at both domains at once in terms of the actions that one can take is superior to the local maximizations um then you found an incentive for the sequencers of inj to collude with one another because what you're essentially saying is hey if we collaborate with one another we'll make more money than if we were doing our mev optimization independently [Music] so it's true often enough and what that tells us is that there is a nonzero financial incentive that is frequent for sequencers to collaborate with one another to make more uh money and here money is value and its extractable value so that's relatively worrying because we've formalized an argument of centralization of sequencers across many domains and we've tried to show that there could be cases where that happens so far we don't go into a lot of cases but we do mention that there exists such opportunities so we then explain that further with an example because it's it's a little bit uh hard hard to grasp in in the abstract and so we look at a very very simplified example but we look at an example where the nav at that particular point time on each domain would be zero but when you look at the cross domain mevs you're looking back at the two domain muv that we looked at earlier that's non-zero and we look at a price discrepancy on one particular domain with a single amm so no one can rebalance it because there's nothing to rebalance it against in that domain but on the other domain you have another amm and that one is at a different price and so you can basically execute an arbitrage trade between the two that can only happen if you have a view of the two um and so with this simple example we're kind of trying to illustrate um how such cross-domain name would happen and also there is implicitly um the the what we're trying to say as well here is that arbitrage is still the most common way for people to extract value from ordering and so if there are many cases where there are arbitrages that only exist from this joint optimization instead of local optimizations then is something that we should worry about as a credible incentive for sequencers to collaborate slash collude with one another and so to some extent not only collaborate but to be on both chains or beyond both domains because there's a there's a clear benefit for them to do so um so we talked a little bit so after going through all of this we now reason about how the market structure would look in particular while um just like in flash boys 2.0 the the risk of time-managed attacks is put forward as something you know that would be destabilizing for consensus um flashbulbs 2.0 also shows the activity that bots uh take where belts do on the network right and we kind of try to take that other perspective as well so not thinking necessarily what the sequencers would do but what would bots that see these opportunities how would they react and so we think about how they reacted so the tldr of some of this is that to be the fastest to react to such an opportunity you need to be active on both domains at once right so you can close the full loop by starting in a single domain executing the trade bridging continuing the second leg of the trade and going back to your initial domain that will be too slow and so one of one of the conclusions is you're just going to execute both trades on two domains you need capital on both and then you're going to rebalance your inventory later on so that looks a lot like just plain old uh centralized exchange cross across our centralized exchange trading right but it is more capital intensive uh and somewhat worrying in the sense that you might increase the barrier entry for players that want to trade in this cross-chain mev world it might be something that one should think about more it also makes some trading more probabilistic and so it introduces or it reintroduces the concept of risk management in these trades this is relative to atomic execution of arbitrage when it's only on ethereum where there is of course risk management there but it's it isn't managing the risk of each leg of your tray so we don't go into depth about this nor do we go into depth about the pricing function and it's definitely something we want to look into more one thing that we mentioned in this inequality is alpha here so a cost of collusion so this is how we build our argument that for for this inequality to be true you don't only need the local optimizations to be less than the joint optimization but assuming that the sequences aren't the same they need a way to communicate with each other in a way to share potentially profits with each other and all of this is encompassed in that cost alpha cost variable um and so you can imagine that if instead of paying that cost a sequencer could just build sequencing power on the other domain that they interact with a lot to bring that alpha as close to zero as possible and to emphasize why we think there's a cause to sequencers talking to one another we use a result from a paper from alexei zamyatin called sok on cross-ledger communication where they find an impossibility result on cross-chain communication in general so that whether you need a third a trusted third party or you need a synchrony assumption beyond a synchrony then using that that result um and the fact that we we don't think a secret new assumption is reasonable in such a system given that these opportunities are latency sensitive you need to trust a third party and a way to model a trusted third party economically is an additional cost right it's a it's friction it's burden that's uh shouldered economically um so that's kind of the argument that we put forward that there is a centralizing force for not only sequencers to collaborate with one another or collude with one another but also for large sequencers or large players to aggregate sequencing power across multiple domains in order to reduce their cost of operation and to make this inequality true more than they would if they weren't on that particular domain that they're interacting with um right and then we talk about some negative externalities so again this is just a list uh we don't dive very deeply into it uh but so the first one is the one that i just talked about now the cross domain sequence for centralization and why that's a potential problem there's definitely something that has to be looked at further also potentially calculate the economics of this one thing that's difficult there is a lot of this work was done with layer twos in mind and sequencer architectures of layer twos are changing very rapidly they're currently centralized and run by teams right so the arbitrarium sequencer is run by off chain labs the optimism sequencers around optimism etc etc um and so it's not the case yet that there's permissionless sequencing and so that sequencers can do all these shenanigans and it's you know presumably someone like optimism or arbitrary would not uh collude with a sequencer in another place just because they have an incentive for the users to be treated as well as possible quote-unquote so while it's not an immediate worry in these layer twos it will be something that will be part of the conversation as they decide how they decentralize sequencing or how they allow permission to sequencing but they all want to it's definitely not something that they want to keep doing themselves um we also bring up cross-time cross-domain time minute attacks so you know time-out attacks they were introduced in in phil's paper flashbox 2.0 the idea that a miner on ethereum for example would have a financial incentive to rework the chain in order to extract value that was there in the past that's something that might also surface in cross-domain mev and that's something that it's a little bit harder to understand um and definitely more research needs to be done there but it kind of speaks to francesco's point to some extent which is to say you can consider your chain or your domain in a vacuum and it's designed in a vacuum but at the end of the day it's influenced by other domains and other chains and how those interact with your own domain to some extent the composability of these different domains um and so there there might be even if you think your domain is is quote unquote safe they might be uh an incentive that's external to the chain to mess with its finality for example so it's definitely something that needs to be looked at more super traders that's another negative externality in that case the worry is that on some domains today you have latency races taking place so taking arbitrary for example ordering an arbitrary currently is first stands for style this means that whoever pings the sequencer first gets their transaction in first so that requires latency optimization and in traditional finance what we've seen is players investing hundreds of millions in latency infrastructure to be milliseconds faster and so one worry is that a player that plays this latency game across not only one domain but multiple domains we'll reuse that latency infrastructure and build a stronger mode around it and we argue that you know these latency games are not additive to the system and this is something that was also brought up by eric buddish so that's the number two here that we mentioned where basically the effort that is spent to be one millisecond faster is not um it's it's marginal to the utility that users gain from that right so it makes the markets a tiny bit more efficient i guess but ultimately it doesn't matter as much and so ideally we would want these efforts to be more productive um however it's hard to change you know if people invest hundreds of millions in latency infrastructure there will be enshrined interests in keeping such a market structure alive and going and so that's the kind of point that is made here uh and emphasized by by phil finally the last point is the subjectivity of mev and so that's what i mentioned earlier with this pricing function so people will have different pricing functions because that pricing functions price is also the how you quantify the trust guarantees of these systems so you know if i'm using this particular bridge how do i quantify the risk of this bridge failing and people might have different opinions on this so that means that ultimately the way they look at mev at a particular point in time will be different because they'll have a subjective pricing function and that's interesting because such a pricing function creates markets to some extent and you have that in traditional markets as well right where market makers have a global fair price of a particular asset and that they trade against on many venues but establishing their global fare price is you know their secret sauce and they have potentially different ways of arriving that global fair price and the global fair price can slightly differ from others global fair price and that's pretty interesting so it's something that again recreates a lot of the dynamics that we see in traditional markets that's also a big takeaway from this paper i would say is that this world looks maybe more like traditional markets and traditional markets market making and cross chain arbitrage or like structural art that would take place in such markets i know there's questions i'm gonna address them um finally we end with open questions and so these are i kind of mentioned a bunch of open questions already i would say to some extent all these negative negative externalities are open questions but so we look into how to best define the action space this was this was added by phil um there's a lot of modeling that needs to be done there's a lot of complexity that we swept under the rug to some extent and there's there's definitely more to be done there i would say this joins alejo's article on the formalization of mev and the limitations to the definition that we uh introduced above um so there's a lot of word that needs to be done there um maybe other forms of mvv then cross-domain arbitrage people are talking about cross-domain governance voting across domain lending um and there might be other use cases there so maybe thinking about those more and how ordering having ordering power on many domains at once when these interactions take place happen um then what does a protocol for sequence circuit really look like and what are its desirable properties this is kind of taking the flashbacks approach of if uh sequencers colluding with one another is inevitable at least if you follow the financial incentive then what would a protocol for this to happen look like um and then maybe from there we can also deduce some things about how the market will evolve and then we can mitigate some of the negative externalities that would arise it's to some extent the approach we've taken at flashbacks for many things that we do um and so we think about that a lot how can we identify and quantify across enemy extraction is another important one so before on ethereum there's to some extent full transparency um there's some opaque like opacity but um you can measure and quantify mev extraction and um people at flashballs working on mev-inspect pi and the the explorer dashboard et cetera do a great job of doing that here if you think back to the thing that i mentioned before of a trader seizing an opportunity by submitting two transactions on each domain it's very hard to link those transactions back to a single strategy that one has um and so you need to do a lot more guessing work and to some extent use your heuristics more and also maybe maybe do some de-anonymization right or at least some some clustering of activity such that you can identify a player that exists on multiple domains they want it is much more complicated and what worries us there is one one of our goal is to illuminate the dark forest or bring more transparency and clarity to what's happening in these markets so this introduces more opacity so it is something that is on our mind and we're thinking a lot about and finally we want to look into distributed and parallel programming literature so there is a appendix who's the co-author of this paper as well who draws a parallel between this notion of crosstalk nav with not only do we potentially want to look into more traditional oh can you still hear me yeah no you're about all right um we want to look at existing theory basically in existing academic literature not only in financial theory but also in computer science that have looked at these problems that to some extent it is like multi-threaded computing a little bit there are differences there part of part of the differences are surfaced by tarun but it's very interesting to make this parallel um and we're we're hoping that maybe uh someone who has a lot of expertise there might and that understands d5 a little bit might be interested in picking that up and doing more there all right and five questions by the way if phil and leo if you have anything to add i kind of talked for a while right now i hope that was helpful to people okay just to create a fly i'm quite okay with builders being very centralized as long as validators are not but even pbs on each chain doesn't guarantee that if crosstown mep is much higher that was that was a clarification on the previous discussion um more practical question about definitions again from is this still francesco is this fra someone someone else okay my intuition of what we care about tends towards the highest bid in a full block auction rather than highest amount that can be extracted example of the difference is justin's son potentially being liquidated for one block and being willing to buy that lock for up to the amount he would lose though there's no participant who can extract that much value from the block justin's son may bid that much but because he is extracting that much from the block difference for a single player seems to me something like balance change review best block versus best delta between balance change with your best blog versus balance change with a block made by others i don't know how much this is relevant in practice i feel like it might be irrelevant most of the time definitions agree but capture some important tail events uh okay i didn't actually ask question i guess it's just what you think about it um [Music] yeah it's it's hard for me to reason about your question i the first thing that comes up to mine is again alejo's post on the formalization of mev and how you consider a player in that definition and potentially not considering a player at all um filler alejo if you've read the question do you have i'm gonna read it again but if you haven't no i can i i can i can answer we talked a little bit about this with francesco before so so so what franchise francesco is saying is like uh why not characterize mev as um the the the amount that people are willing to pay for inclusion as opposed to uh how much like trying to figure out how much is extracted all right and i think that's that's an a nice approach but i think it ultimately depends on what do you want your mev definition for right so um so i think if you if you do that uh type of thing like the the just in some example even that what you will happen is that you will get like quirks in mev uh that depend a lot in people's behavior on the chain right say justin sun uh is like uh exposed for a huge liquidation and then your mav definition when you try to quantify the mav in that chain you will get like a huge value due to that actor behaving like they did at that particular point in time which again perhaps it's useful in some context but i'm not sure it's the best like approach for a general definition of mav and in in in the post that alex has opened uh my approach there is to try to get rid of the player and this is a separate question but that but i think what like i would want uh an mev definition to do for us uh is to be able to talk about um say protocols and the mev uh that they expose without like notion of a player and without in particular depending on what players are or are not doing with the protocol because again if a player is just like uh not cautious enough then and we will be like much higher and then like i don't know if that's what i i want to say okay this semi this protocol is exposing a lot of mav i don't know if that's a conclusion i want to drive because of how a particular player behaved at some point so anyway that's my approach here was try to uh yeah like a point to the uh player situation and try to point out that okay perhaps we want another uh definition of mev that does not have the player uh in there but but more so that's two parts like what should we have the player in there or not america would have two different notions uh but like in the independently of that i think if we do go with the definition that uh and it is the value that anybody is willing to pay we could run into a lot of these problems that are very particular of these these cases and but again perhaps that's what you want to see from your definition if like you're thinking about security of the network or things like that so long-winded answer and yeah i think it's uh it's an interesting question and then like i was what i was um i aim with this like companion boss so to say is to like sparkle sparkle this like discussion i think it's important we like try to agree on what maybe is and the minimum several people pointed out it's it's tricky because what if you have like a black list and yeah this is like another topic we can discuss like what how to encode the idea of like permission that's what's the best way to encode this mathematically um hope that more or less answers there's more questions i see alex so back to you all right thank you um awesome all right 32 33 great it seems that directional strategies versus pure arbitrage can be especially lucrative in a multi-domain world where there are multiple dimensions to consider does this formulation assume a delta neutral strategy or is it inclusive of directional strategies levering changes in price between protocol and or app tokens so i'm not extremely familiar with uh being delta neutral uh and if you want you can tell us more about that i will say though the the pricing function is for that particular purpose right so it is inclusive of these quote unquote directional strategies this brings up another interesting point which is when emily so far or has been looked at as like pure profit right and as to some extent like finding a structural inefficiency and executing on it atomically but there are examples of mev that defy that definition where you still want a particular ordering but you might hold on your position for longer right and so in that case of the cross domain mev you might hold on to your position for longer because you're going to do inventory rebalancing um and so it brings up an another interesting point related to definition of memory which is when do you is there a time boundary to it like if i buy eth and then like five blocks later i sell it and i make a profit was that me be if i wanted to buy eighth at the top of the block to pay less than someone else um this is where it becomes a little bit murkier um and then in the crosswind anybody world it becomes very relevant um [Music] so i didn't really answer your question i kind of said that it was it was something that we're looking at um i wonder if that helps or if you want me to to answer more you're also welcome to speak if you're i think you can unmute yourself if you want to share more assume you're typing if you're not answering um tinyuan said i think given the price function formulation of formalization the idea of the actual strategy is already incorporated i agree right you're interested in the time component all right so that's something that's that's maybe harder uh intuitively the closest we are to atomic the more i'm inclined to say that's a pure profit so mev oh you should be able to admit yourselves guys think if not i can frack and mute you as well uh how do i look at participants maybe because i changed the setting while we were still in there all right ask your mute 33 do you want to do you want to speak if you say yes in the chat i'll ask you to immune all right all right all right um the price function considers price differences at a moment in time yes but i'm interested in the time component so again as i mentioned that's a little bit trickier especially when you look at different domains with different notions of time and to some extent time and its relation to finality on each of these domains is also kind of related so to me and intuitively the closest we are to atomic the more i'm inclined to say that it's mev um and so then it's about defining atomicity in a cross-domain context which is another question uh the the more you're holding the asset and you're taking you know beta exposure it's not purely alpha exposure then it becomes less and less of mev but we've seen for example people using flashbots to snipe a token listing which they anticipate the token will increase in price but they want to be the first to buy in the liquidity pool you know and so they use flashbacks in order to do that and then sell the tokens later not on flashpods so they did have beta exposure in that case because they had price exposure to the token but they still benefited from the order so how do you separate that concept of benefiting from the ordering to the better exposure i think that would be something that we're looking into more and i would say that alejo's work and what he described so far is kind of going in that direction he also does mention towards the end of the article that exact point right so i think he does even mention sniping uh yeah from running nft bids or buyouts of utopian listings so exactly the example that i was talking about um so that's exactly it actually surfing mev versus probabilistic mev i do think there's something to say about probabilistic mev right and generally the practice of like statistical arbitrage and then inventory management which you do take a price risk on your inventory maybe not if you borrow all of it but there's some some risk there that one needs to quantify and it's still very much trading and it's based on ordering um so that doesn't answer your question but i hope it gives you more more color on the the problem space um i do really hope that this because this looks a lot like traditional finance that we can dig into more traditional finance literature to understand some of the work that has been done there there's a lot of financial theory that has been shelved and just stays theory that's quite interesting to revisit uh because there are new components here there's the programmability the transparency of these systems uh the fact that there's permissionless access to them um are all really interesting features to match against some of the theory that was introduced in the past there's also people like eric buddish that looked at like traditional market structures and proposed new solutions like for example frequent batch auctions that people like cow swap are adopting um all right alex zedd do you highlight latency race as negative negativity for cross domain specifically would an in domain mev pursue lowest latency either way if sequencer was based on latency absolutely in domain mev would pursue well yes there would be latency race in domain the the risk that is highlighted there is that there is synergies between multiple for player say they're playing on a single domain and they're optimizing their latency there we believe and you know it's been kind of shown in traditional markets that you can a lot of that infrastructure and those skills can be transferable to other domains so if there are multiple domains where there is a latency game to be played someone could build the remote uh and and try and have enshrine interests in a way that if they were playing on a single domain they wouldn't so it's a it's a subtle it's basically saying latency is a problem in a single domain as well and in multiple domains it can be a bigger problem just because there's emotes around latency so you're you're right though that it's not only for cross-domain it's not for cloud domain specifically it is first and foremost for inside those domains um and some of the negative externalities we see is because people fight for latency there's a lot of um wasted block space with transactions that come in second um and then maybe uh wait on on on the peer-to-peer network and congestion in terms of a lot of transactions being submitted quickly is in winning pbs auctions is similarly transferable skill it is absolutely a similarly transferable skill um well sorry i wouldn't say exactly transferable but it is similarly transferable ultimately what what is what the problem with latency races in in that has been put forward for example by buddhist is that you have people spending a lot of effort and teams and hundreds of millions of dollars to optimize you know one millisecond one microsecond what if there's a way for these people to expand that effort in a way that is more useful for the network and for the markets and that i think is a question for protocol designers and uh protocol designers are also market structure designers of how that could look like so in in the case of pbs you're trying to construct the most you know valuable block because you're bidding in that auction to propose to a proposer and so building the most valuable block i would argue is more productive than the latency rates because you're trying to optimize transactions and you're helping increase the parallelization maybe of of the network this is just an intuition right but maybe there's a way for the effort that's expended by traders to be even more valuable to the network uh and so there's a question of how do you value valuable to the network what are desirable behaviors there but i think we're still at a point where there aren't these like very enshrined interests from players that have an incentive not to see market structure change massively also the crypto space in general is very open-minded to new changes and to rapid iterations at the very least it's adding to network security through auctions payments so that's something there we go um so we can do stuff there that hits another point that's very interesting frau francesco um is the redistribution point we don't talk about it at all in this paper but um [Music] this general idea that i just talked about like how can we make this effort as productive as possible it goes to this broader point of what is a desirable redistribution of mev so you know in the simplest case assume a single sequencer extracts all the mev um and so you have access to that value and you're designing a system where you have access to that value from the sequencer where should that value go optimism says retractive public goods funding right other people might have a different view in the past there has been a view shared that it could contribute to the security budget of a network by subsidizing minors and potentially having no block reward um so there are many different ways i see kind of them split in two ways one is more systematic and programmatic and one is with a human in the loops in the case of retractive public goods funding people are voting on which projects should get funding retroactively um i don't know yeah exactly burning is another one uh eip1559 style or smoothing so redistributing that to everyone this is kind of two sides of the same coin um that's definitely on our mind a lot and there are a lot of people thinking about this because it's just value created from the network and how can it be used uh in the most productive way but it is beautiful because i think anything can be an engine to growth and to security in a way that um the the capital markets today in traditional finance might not be as much um and so we have a chance to design a machine that's more powerful that's self-reinforcing and so we're definitely very excited about that speaking of growth how can you envision cross-domain mev when an evm is deployed on another l1 for example neon labs on solana or moonbeam on polka dot um [Music] i don't know if alejo or phil if you have some intuition for that there's emmyv on solana and there's anybody in polkadot related to the ordering and depending on the the way ordering works there the fact that an evm is deployed i'm not sure how that influences uh ultimately the ordering so i always go back to trying to understand how the ordering mechanism works so although i see you coming closer to the screen oh yeah i don't i don't know this project it does this mean that they're like a an evm in a contract so that you can deploy things in that protocols on the chains this is what these uh projects are about i i also am not familiar with them i would assume there's some kind of like transpiler where you can just bring your code that's like evm based code to so on it but then i don't know how that works right like i just uh allowed to unmute if you want to verify hopefully it worked this time can you can you hear me yeah yeah okay yeah thanks for the thanks for the call the way i see it is you know moon beam um not you know moonbeam is is launching an evm as on its para chain and so that allows that um you know developers to deploy any smart contract they have on ethereum to also deploy that on a para chains so then that would be plugged into the polka ecosystem and i was just kind of wondering you know that doesn't that seems kind of distinct from a cross-domain mev from say you know ethereum to solana itself because that's kind of seems like an intermediary point um in between the two uh but it seems that they're also two distinct evms so how could i just kind of wonder your guys's thoughts or if you guys have been thinking about you know that sort of intermediate step between the two uh ecosystems yeah i think field replies on the chat i agree with that like it depends on how the the ordering is uh chosen in those systems if it's like the same l1 it's it's the same uh but if there's a separate sequence then it looks like an independent l2 like any other like l2 if that makes sense um we are one minute at the time does anyone have burning questions they would like to ask on anything that has been talked about in the paper on flashbots nmev if not we'll close it up one thing that i will say i should have said at the beginning we are hiring in the research organization of flashbots and so if these questions interest you if you think about this a lot definitely hit us up yes definitely hit us up we have a job board on notion and that you can access from different places i believe even here in the about you can see the little dropboard link right here we're hiring senior researchers research engineers junior researchers and we're having a lot of fun doing this research so join us uh last question by 33 way are you guys building or simply researching and very generously sharing yes nice uh flashbacks is open source and most if not all of what we do is uh privy to the public also all our research is is public or at least most of it um you can look at our repo mev research um well you can see some of our efforts there um including a little summary of what we do we also give grants to the community uh so if you're interested in uh researching a specific topic and we have this this flashbacks research proposals where people can propose a topic and then if it's accepted you get some grant from us to research it and some light advice or at least we we we collaborate to the extent we're able to help um yes all right on that note it's 101 which is funny um thank you all for joining if you have any more questions feel free to message any of us to phil and myself on twitter uh or other places um and you know we're very excited about people looking at these problems more and potentially looking at some of these open questions so if there's anything here that is interesting to you please definitely reach out we'd be happy to chat see you guys guys hi thank you for training thanks everyone do you know how to end the call stop sharing oh there we go all right see you guys
