hi everyone I'm Max Resnick I'm the head of research at Rook I actually am the new head of research I just joined three days ago so there's a new sheriff in town thanks I'm going to be presenting some joint work today with Elijah who's right here and malesh Pie who's a professor at Rice who I heard tonight like six months ago into working on this and now he's fallen so deep down around all that I don't know if there's any recovering for him anyway so our focus is going to be on on-chain auctions and whether censorship can warp the equilibria of entree options and cause some issues and you'll see what I mean by those issues in a second so let's just talk about some motivation here why do we care about options on chain first of all auction's extremely versatile mechanism and it kind of slots into whatever you want to do in financial Market design so even just the central limit order book is sometimes called a continuous double option right we also have even already on chain we have art gobblers with their um variable rate gradual Dutch options we have maker and Euler with liquidation auctions in some ways any boost is an auction that doesn't run directly on chain so these are kind of existing mechanisms one thing I want to point out is that we've been talking about lvr in our own research group a lot ldr is loss versus rebalancing it's kind of one of the reasons that liquidity provision on an amm is maybe pretty bad for the liquidity providers so we think if you start the block off with an auction that allows you to capture the lvr then you take the proceeds of that auction and give it back to the LPS so I can start to heal some of the ldr issues that are causing a lot of the unit swap fund on Twitter okay so that was kind of the direction that we started this with is how do we hold a starter block auction to capture ldr and I think we moved it in that direction so why are we talking about censorship because if you censor bids from other people who are bidding from competing bidders it becomes easier to win the option and you can win the auction for less money okay and we have off-chain agreements like Med boost that allow you to pay the proposer to censor other people's bits what do I mean by that if I win the blog in the Mev boost auction I can make sure that only my bid gets in and then I'm going to win the auction for free or at the reserve price nobody else is going to get to bid so that's kind of the main question that we're going for here okay let me get into the model so a simple model of an auction I want to go over this because not everybody uh maybe is an auction purist but we're going to have n plus one buyers for an object okay each of these buyers is going to have a private value and that's drawn from a known distribution what's going to happen the seller announces that I'm selling the item then all the bidders are gonna submit their bids and their tips so a little bit of a Point here is that the tips are going to be public tips are always going to be public but we're kind of giving the auction the benefit of the doubt and saying the bids are actually private so you can do this with a commit reveal scheme you can do this with some more fancy ZK stuff and I'm sure the cryptography cryptographers here have a lot to say about there's a ton of ways to do this but we're giving the option all the bits are perfectly sealed but the tips are not okay and then we're going to select the highest bid and then for those of you haven't seen sacrifice auctions we're going to take the second highest bid as the price that the winner pays and that's just for incentive compatibility we want people to bid their True Values okay I'm going to add one more thing to this model I'm going to add an opportunity to censor other people's bids and that's going to be after all the bids are submitted a extra bitter bitter zero is going to make an offer to the proposer remember the proposer is the one who controls which bits get into the auction because they control which transactions get into the auction and he's going to make a take it or leave it offer The Miner is going to accept that offer if it's greater than the tips that correspond to the bits that he's censoring okay let's solve this simple model and this is going to be the only math that I make you guys do today okay we're going to do the two player Ace we're going to do two bitters one of them is the colluding bidder looting better gets to make a bribe to the proposer to omit the non-polluting bidders okay so the first point here is that the tip that the non-colluting or honest bidder pays has something to do with their valuation by value the item pie I'm willing to pay more to get into the auction simple right and actually we know that the honest bidder will never pay more in tip than they value the item because if they get into the auction and they end up winning the item they value it less than a tip and they've actually lost out because they've paid this large tip it's more than the value item so even if they want the item for free they would still not want to pay a tip Which is higher than their value okay knowing this the colluding bidder can say given the tip that I see I know that your value is at least greater than the tip and what that allows us to do is say when the tip is less than the colluding bidders value be zero we're going to make the bride and we're going to try to omit the other person's bid but when it's greater than v0 it doesn't make sense to do that and so it's a simple best response and that's going to allow us to write out the expected utility for the honest bidder that's going to tell us what the tip is so it's t the probability that you win the uh or the probability that you're included times your expected Revenue if you are included just you win every time minus the tip that you pay so just reformatting that into a simple quadratic equation T V1 minus t squared take the derivative set it equal to zero and I promise this is all the math we're going to do V1 minus two t equals 0 t equals V one over two so I submit a tip which is half of how much I value that okay now we get to the non-mathy part um what does this mean like how do we see what happened here first of all in equilibrium the the bidder who value the item is only winning three-fourths of the time whereas without censorship they do any all the time so before the time we have somebody winning the auction who didn't value it more so that's a loss of efficiency in the language of auction Theory um one-fourth of the time we have or the proposal is extracting actually a lot of value here extracting 1 4 which is the expected tip because either the honest bidder is paying the tip or the dishonest bidder is paying abroad of the same amount as the tip and that means that the so this is like Med clearly right because the proposer is getting minor extracted value of one-fourth and this is a lot if you look at the kind of expected value of the option so the revenue of the auction for the person who's holding his way down that's not great um in fact we'll see later that it's almost as if the uh proposer is running the auction as the number of bidders increases and the tip function this is an important cryptographers and it's not going to be a fun one for you guys the tip function is invertible so we can even though the bid is uh private the tip is public we can use the tip to back out your bid this uh kind of destroys The credibility of the option it actually kind of raises the question of whether um privacy and bids matters so much because we have the potential that the public tips which are associated can reveal information about the product vids okay I have some more math here but I'm gonna skip through in the interest of time and show you the results Instead This is for the end player case um as you can see the expected total tip so this is inversibly proportional to the probability that the dishonest bidder wins so as you can see SN increases the uh which is the number of bidders the probability that the dishonest bidder wins the auction is going way up why is that because the tips are going down okay so as we add more competing honest bidders the dishonest Bender does even better the miner does even better for the proposer I should say and we've kind of arrived at a point where we don't even have an auction anymore because you can see this is turning into zero um there's there's kind of no reason to hold an auction at that point um so that's the single block case let me talk about this real quick this is just with a bunch of other distributions just to show the robustness of that previous result as you can see this is kind of trending towards zero with a bunch of different wacky distributions beta distributions over here same results okay so it wasn't just the uniform so now I'm going to talk about holding it over multiple slots right we would think that if we hold it over multiple slots we're gonna get more security and we do but actually let me do the next slide first unless the number of blocks grows faster than the number of bidders censorship is still profitable and the auction still breaks down so I'm jumping around a little bit here but be the point to see here is that this total tip function is decreasing sublinearly so it's like decreasing really really fast and so if I add more blocks I get kind of a Linear Security but this overpowers it and that's the intuition let me go back to the more formal stuff basically um we're gonna make a slightly modified assumption here and I'll explain that this is okay to do we're gonna allow the uh colluding Betis distribution to be a little bit wider from zero to K where K is greater than m and that is going to allow us to recover the equilibrium from the single block case n is the number of blocks so now I before I have one block now I have M blocks and um you know if you want to see this this is maybe the trickiest result in the paper if you want to see more about it's in the paper but it's also the most surprising result that kind of this eventual censorship resistance that we get from liveness that's the definition of liveness right isn't fast enough in practice to hold an auction um so if you have you know a large number of expected bidders you probably don't want to hold an auction on it on ethereum or something uh or you are going to need to have a ton of ton of blocks um so that's I think maybe one of the biggest takeaways of the paper now I'm going to talk about okay since running it over multiple blocks and work maybe we can try something else maybe we can try multiple concurrent composers and this is an idea that I'm really excited about life is really excited about I think even Anatoly from Salon is a bit excited about it too so here's how it's going to work it's not just going to be we submit one tip we're going to submit a conditional tip Little T which is much less than Big T and they're going to be in a pair Little T is going to be paid if more than one of these concurrent proposes include the transaction Big T is only paid if a single proposal includes and everybody else omits it and what this is going to do it's going to set up a kind of prisoner's dilemma here's the um The Game Matrix the path Matrix in the single uh in the two proposer case okay if if you know Christmas dilemma this looks kind of exactly like that okay let's think about what we have to do as a sensor in bitter we want to bribe the proposer to like not include the bid we have to get this up to greater than capital T otherwise we're still going to end up at this equilibrium so we need to pay at least capital T to both proposers so what happens here is the honest bidders are paying Little T but the dishonest bidder has to pay at least n the number of concurrent proposers times Big T so we get much much more security for a lot less of a cost okay so okay I promise no math so we'll we'll skip that one um video Zero so this is kind of solving the full equilibrium of the multiple proposal game here's the takeaway bitter zero doesn't bribe the proposers ever instead they just compete in the auction good all bidders pay zero in tips on the path which is really good because they're not you know giving Mev and the equilibrium tips don't reveal bits to other photographers can happen again and they can keep showing their audience okay one more thing I want to talk to you guys about which is how do we actually do this the last slide so The Duality team has been kind of hacking hard on this and I think maybe if you asked Korean he would say that multiple concurring proposes is really hard I think we maybe disagree a little bit here's a pretty simple and practical way to get multiple proposers so we're gonna kind of take tendermen as a base and before anything happens in tenderment that you you've heard of we're going to have all the people on the committee who are not the leader submit a special bundle of transactions and those are the bids that we're talking about and then we're going to require that the leader includes at least two-thirds of these bundles otherwise a block is invalid so in order to make a ballot block you have to basically provide the censorship assistance and then just the takeaway from that is if you want to make a block that omits a transaction um it's very hard if it was included in greater than one-third of the stake weighted bundles okay that's my last slide I don't know how much time we have left but happy to take any questions if I have time just a note of anyone who cannot see this being um all of the slides are up on the hack MD so we can speed it on your phone okay so any questions in the multiple uh proposes secret sequential proposals result you have a different value distribution for the centering person to be like normal visits um and it's much much larger which intuitively seems like might like support you in the English results so there's actually a footnote in the paper about this um thanks for asking it's a really good question um you can do it with uniform01 here's the issue because um so if I have M blocks I'm multiplying the security of the tip but I am because the bribing dinner has to pay the first proposer and then the second proposer all the way up to n so they have to pay a tip of M times t remember we said that the tip was actually decreasing um super linearly so overall the expected tip is still going to be less than one as long as and uh stays lower than n but the issue from an analytical perspective is that we really want this uniform distribution this kind of constant Hazard rate and when we multiply the tips by n the sum probability that when we add up all the tips and multiply by m it's greater than one when it's greater than one there's no chance that the colluding bitter uh has a value greater than that so there's actually no probability of buyout okay what does that all mean there's like some probability that the uh increasing your tip doesn't do anything um and it actually means that you want to pay less of a tip if we did uniform zero one and that means you actually get bought out more so it's even stronger because of that yeah and there's a more detail discussion of this in the paper but this is definitely we actually found that kind of slight issue right at the like 9 00 p.m of the submission deadline so I think in the next update we're gonna we're gonna do the uniform zero one full derivation it gets a little messy there's a nuisance term but it's actually a stronger result with the zero one unintuitively and then uh I guess another question about the assumptions taking these results uh so as I understand it the reason that as a number of goodies increases it does agree to actually available is because you have this kind of like um tragedy of the Goldman's arising from them alone that's the best Outlook in the century but it doesn't matter why on the business knowing how the other business they are and what do you think changes if people don't know I mean if you don't know and you you probably have a prior over end so you probably expect n is somewhere in the region of 100 right it might be 105. so you're probably gonna get kind of a similar result maybe a little more messy analytically um yeah let me speak to that tragedy in the comments real quick because it's an important tool for understanding this um if everybody's so if I submit a higher tip as an honest bidder I'm actually helping all the other honest bidders but helping the other honest videos get into the auction is worse for me so um that's that is a force along with the fact that kind of there's more bitters in and so I'm likely to win the auction at a higher price uh if I do win means and I'm also less likely to win the auction I did more videos as well so there's like all these forces driving together and that's why we get that super linear reduction in expected tip and that's why we see the colluding bitter buying up the auctioneer all the time I mean um Department each other person is alumni you are sitting the proposers don't include yeah is there any way to do that backwards yeah I mean well in some ways we have already a baked an assumption that if the blockchain is working then the proposers then not greater than uh one-third of their proposers are Byzantine so that's a bit of a pop-up let me say in terms of like a game theoretic situation right we have repeated prisoners dilemma we have both theorems about this um there's kind of a trade-off between how often this game is repeated and how high the payouts are that um tell you whether you can have a tit-for-ta equilibrium or whether you can have a full colluding equilibrium like that and if you look at ethereum actually the rate at which proposers are matched against the same committee is pretty low right just because there's so many nodes if you look at tender man 150 nodes right that's the stuff but is that's a lot more likely that you can have the repeated business dilemma and a lot more likely that you're going to be able to see kind of collusion equilibrium sustained so I think but also another thing to keep in mind is that if 40 of the nodes are controlled by Lilo that argument that there's a ton of balance and so they're not like winning each other again it's kind of falls apart a little bit yeah and unless there's any other questions thank you guys
