thanks for joining us alex you want to start yep sounds good i was waiting uh for a few more more more people to join hey everyone thank you all for for joining us today it's very exciting to have you all with us the first uh public roast uh so again thank you um so the the i quickly i'm gonna tell you what what this this this roast is and a few kind of house rules and then we'll get we'll get started um for the roast as you might have seen is a semi-weekly call where we invite a speaker to actually roast our our project uh and we also consider it our main point of synchronous communication with the with the community um and so this is the the main goal of the roast is to invite criticism constructive criticism of our project and community interaction with us uh while also giving you guys updates on on what we've been up to um so this is what's gonna happen and this this is the the first one so before we start a few key things um the first one and the most important one is this is a chill relaxed environment and there's no such thing as a stupid question here we know you know the the the topic involved involves a lot of uh different disciplines put together and it's totally fine you know to not be an expert at all of this when you ask a question and that that's that that's why we're here together and we're here to help each other that being said there is such a thing as do you own research uh and so you know we've put out two posts the medium posts and the easter search posts that introduce different parts of what we've been up to and we do recommend reading them before uh generally you know asking a lot of questions that might have been answered there um mit alright so that's the first thing the second thing is um well actually stefan could you go to the [Music] next slide right so there are other uh community calls that you can join um so there's a core dev call that happens twice a week on tuesday and friday and there's a research workshop that happens weekly uh on thursday so these are different calls that have an hour of scope and should you be interested in some of these areas this is this is these are calls you can you can definitely join um it's important to know that this call is recorded and the slides that were currently stefan is presenting are public and will be made available in the github pm uh repo of flashbots that is publicly accessible and you know we definitely want to continue the conversation asynchronously and so you know that can be done on on our on our github where you can jam with us and you can join our discord as well where we have different channels where you can continue the conversation um yeah so last thing the agenda stefan please next slide right so this is this is the agenda for today so we'll start with quick updates on uh our organization and our our different endeavor so far so research may be gaff and maybe an inspect and then we'll get to the main event so dan's uh first roast and you know answering those questions and then we'll finish by a general uh ask me anything um one thing that's important to note is for each sections here we'll leave out a little bit of time for questions afterwards and we ask you to ask your questions in the chat directly rather than speaking to be more efficient and so the the person leading this section will just pick a few questions uh in the interest of time of course uh please don't get offended if you know your cutoff or your question isn't selected we want to make sure we we don't uh overrun on time um and so you know we'll move forward and and um we might not be able to answer all the questions nor be as exhaustive as we would like it to be if we had unlimited amount of time um all right that being said i will hand it off to tina to get started by talking about the flashboard organization and uh our research efforts thank you again and yeah cool there seems to be an echo i hope you guys can hear me fine okay so i will start with introducing our flashbacks organization that arise out of mbb powership research collective which is a continuous flash organization designed for anti-fragility research and development are the two tightly coupled dual engines that propel flashbacks in a phased approach our research effort is long-term oriented whereas our engineering is milestone driven the research arm focuses on defining our organization's faces and identifying key milestones associated with each of them and is responsible for spacking out our engineering roadmap the engineering teams plural here are organized as product focused teams we mean as special purpose vessels as a play on spb that basically ship the core infrastructure and the ecosystem tools and currently our core infrastructure entails an eth client implementation and eb gas and our ecosystem tooling involves mdb inspect which uh steph and scott will uh introduce in a bit and so uh the engineering teams with its product portfolio uh while basically collecting data and producing other artifacts that can feed back into the research next page thanks so phase one of the flashbots research roadmap is considered a proof of concept stage of flashbox it is basically a practical ultra applied research process uh similar to the industry r d in closed loop with development and we expect the um research engineers to be heavily involved in the research process so phase one has um two papers um as deliverables the first draft will be due at the end of january and publication targeting p1 of 2021 the outcome of phase one is immediately relevant to provide the technical and economic evaluation to the flashback group of concept and communicating our design and intentions to the community so um for our full research roadmap that entails beyond um phase one please check out the file in the flashbox github and um the paper one and two um basically uh focuses on seven or maybe more than seven research questions that we have spelled out here including how can we build a good auction mechanism for validator priority bribes can we leverage existing auctions literature to design a good mev auction mechanism and how does the system architecture differ across the different blockchain architecture and um from for the second paper there are currently identified three uh sorry four core research questions um including should we build a good auction mechanism uh should we build one and second one is how do we minimize the possible user harm of priority price incentives and how do we minimize possible cons consensus harm of the of such incentives and lastly should we allow for any mvp on the system and should we bound them of course are we limited to just these seven research questions the answer is no the if there is a critical research question you believe essentially paper one and two um for our mvp stage please open a github issue in the mtb research repo and convince us why it merits to be a standalone question to be answered and why it is crucial to these two papers at this phase of flashbacks uh next slides so how does this collective research process work well you can consider it as a research hackathon the key there is anyone can contribute you can be a natural person with academic pedigree or a renowned organization or a professional d5 thought leader not pointing out at anyone specific in this call or you could be a crypto anime with a hot alias we only care about the quality of contribution and the alignment with flashback sets of values that has been set forth in our medium and each research post so there are two main roles for contributing to the flashbacks um uh collective research one is meb fellows and the second is research contributors so basically an mev research fellow where m.e.b fellow is a um med fellowship grant recipient whose frp has been accepted upon review and who undertakes answering the research questions specified in the flashback research roadmap in addition to delivering the frps the mav fellows who can be either as i said various entities they will act as the co-authors of the flashback research paper and are responsible for collaborating with other mev fellows in architecting coordinating and delivering the flashbacks research papers and presentations um next page please and um frp basically stands for flashback research proposal and it's basically a markdown document described the approach to answering a flat flashbox research question specified on the research roadmap so it's very similar to a proposal that um well a research proposal for academic writings and it entails introducing what the research process to propose us to do or proof um and it should incorporate systematic breakdown of the research question should uh incorporate ingest account of the methodology methodologies approaches or theories that will be used to support a hypothesis within the project including a review of the relevant literature and of course each frp is unique and can vary significantly in structure and in the flashbacks research proposal process it follows roughly what we modeled upon which is the eip process and you can actually check out two examples so uh one for the first research question for paper one um in and second is also linked in the slides um it's basically surrey bakshi's [Music] frp draft that he has worked the repo and drafted the first version of it and lastly key dates so december 13th basically uh two and a half weeks from now will be the deadline for the draft frp submissions and on december 17th we expect the fellowship to be granted and at uh the end of january on the 27th it will be um the me fellows presenting the completed frp on mbb.wtf unconference and lastly we plan to [Music] finalize the papers at the end of february for publications so that's all all right let's keep it moving and then maybe we can do q a at the end if there's uh those questions um so engineering update um we've been quite heads down so far on the engineering to make sure that we have a proof of concept that is production ready and people can start actually mining against and sending bundles against but the proof of concept is sort of an incomplete version of where we want the system to be in the future um so this is sort of step one in the in the process to getting to a full ecosystem of flashback development so step on proof of concept mavgas uh we've completed and built the um the upgrade to geth we're in the process of running latency benchmarks uh to compare what side by side of running a regular get node with an mvv geth node is we're hosting currently an mev geth node for searchers or potential searchers are interested in giving us product feedback and helping us iterate on the interface that is currently being exposed through the json rpc um and we're looking for feedback from miners and mining pools who are interested in in running mevgath i'll say something about where this fits in the greater roadmap of flashbots and a good place to look is on the ether research post where i've taken this screenshot from essentially mevgeth has partial guarantees on what we would deem to be sort of a robust mev auction system the two components that are missing are complete privacy and finality the complete privacy is a guarantee where even the person who's ordering the transaction doesn't know what the um what is the content of the transactions so in this in the case of uh flashbots it's saying the miners don't actually see any of the transactions that they're mining against um so that would require some sort of sgx or some other privacy technology and is an area that we want to really incentivize research in so that it can be brought to a production readiness the second one is finality and this is the prevention of attacks like time-banded attacks where there is some chain reorgan going on in order to extract mev that would otherwise be expected to be finalized [Music] here again there's a bit of a discussion in the blog post about what expected solutions could be but we want to incentivize research in this direction so for muv inspect um scott do you want to talk about this yeah sure thanks so the mvv inspect is the system which analyzes previous transactions categorizes them and then provides that information on a dashboard to surface what's been going on with relation to mev so we'll classify things as uh as you know whether something was a liquidation whether something was a an arbitrage and we'll try to figure out how much profit was there um how much wasted transactions there were and we've made some really good progress in uh you know adding additional inspectors coming up with a great data design we added a new dashboard based on metabase that allows for a really nice presentation of these of these metrics so people who are interested and also allows ad-hoc analysis and we've come up with some some some really interesting charts i included some more in the following slides um we're currently in the process of providing beta access to um to users that are interested with a login password to this to this dashboard we are also back filling data it's a fairly intense process running through every single transaction trying to figure out how much value was extracted and we're in the process of backfilling this we really wanted to make sure that we captured a baseline before black thursday so that's why we're starting in february of 2020 to kind of see how things were going when things were normal and then with liquidations picked up i'd like to understand how those liquidations were profitable and how much they were weighing on the chain in some of their inefficiencies so we're still expanding on coverage metrics and the accuracy of this classification system and the way the system works is that we need to um specifically target dapps that uh that expose this meb and create an adapter that allows us to look at those on-chain interactions and figure out what actually occurred so we're going to be we're adding more inspectors because the there's a there's a fairly long tail in d5 but we can probably cover a huge amount of it with you know maybe 15 or 20 inspectors we'll probably cover the vast majority of use cases for figuring out how much med is out there and how much bots are paying the fees and how much gas is used on mainnet inefficiently due to these heavy instructions um look at the next slide this is a view of the the dashboard right now based on the number of blocks that we have have grabbed so far from here you can see that we're we're quantifying uh on average how much mev there is per block just by looking at total mev dividing by the number of blocks we've looked at we look at blocks wasted which is not the things that extracted mev but the things that attempted to extract mev and failed things that for instance might have been a transaction that checked the status of a liquidation before proceeding we classified that as wasted space because the inefficiencies of the priority gas auction led to many transactions that landed on chain that weren't really useful we also look at how much uh the how much the the bots are paying to minors relative to how much the uh actual um the actual opportunity is is yielding i mean we break that down we can see that right now um the traders are making a pretty hefty profit on on their activities uh we're planning on on both increasing these uh the coverage of the apps that that's that we code up here so these are kind of baseline metrics these are of the things that we've coded up so far of the inspectors we've written for various d5 protocols these are the metrics we found and as we add more coverage for these default apps we will we will see these numbers rise this is just the things that we could positively attribute to to these metrics um one one thing that we found you see that in that top left chart which is kind of interesting is that the uh the mav extracted per block is extremely uh volatile and you can see that that one um you know 400 that's that's in the east right that one 400 each transaction uh is actually not a false positive it actually was a 400th mv that was extracted on that block and it's going to be important to when we when we talk to miners about how much mev there is to to recognize you need to look at it on a long time horizon for how much mev and average that out as opposed to just looking at the the day-to-day um you know the block to block normal ones because every so often especially with liquidations we see very large med opportunities that's one of the discoveries we've had from running the system next slide this is just showing that we are um we've we've processed a bunch of older blocks we've processed a bunch of newer blocks we're currently in the process of filling in blocks in the middle so this shows us a bit of metadata here about how many blocks we have processed in these various ranges of of ten thousand uh it's actually twenty twenty thousand blocks um just just to show that we're making progress in in filling these in um but it just takes you know processing time and it's a it's a process that is going through and whenever we make changes to our system um it's a reevaluation that's going to have to happen again so we're probably going to be making kind of sweeps across this block range as we as we make improvements to the uh the mev inspect system that generates these metrics next slide um oh yeah this this was the uh uh this is just a zoom in of that amygdala for block just because i found it to be a pretty interesting chart with this very very profitable um in the extraction opportunity which was just a it was a simple arbitrage and uh they ended up paying like 0.00 they didn't even pay very much gas it was like a 21 way transaction that yielded this this massive response so there's a there's a bit of uh you know i would say uh outsized distribution of of fee splits between bond operators and um and miners um next slide i think that's the last of these ones all right we now move on to the second second uh part of our agenda our uh main event our roast with our roast masters today dan so dan would you mind all right sorry can i can i ask some questions before they for the prior part uh sure we have a few minutes ah okay sorry about that um so this is actually wonderful this this uh this dashboard um i mean it's really important to understand what's the current state of the art right i mean what is happening actually to visualize this in some way it's great um so my question would be how do you so in which language do you write these contributors or these inspectors or how can we contribute an inspector um so yeah that's an interesting question so we initially wrote a um version in uh typescript um but then uh georgios offered to um to provide a large amount of engineering help and he ended up writing it in in rust and um yeah the so right now the the inspector and the main engine of the system is is written in rust um so is it based on um is it based on um on parity then yes so okay we use we use parity because they have some really nice um block based very very very detailed internal transaction tracers yeah we just have a parity arc we have a parity archive node and then walk through and and grab all the data yeah we're kind of kind of a pain working with parity that's why we we're working currently with geth but okay because it would make it easier right to contribute inspectors and um the other question is what metrics do you use to classify an mvv i mean you might have false positives or false negatives right depending on your metric that tells you that's an mvv or that's not an mvv absolutely these are uh these are numbers that i think are going to be hopefully close to reality based on the ways that we classify but you're right classification is uh is an extremely difficult process and we generally do it by i mean we look at the internal calls and and try to use our inspectors to break those into various classifications and then um you know for trades we look for cyclical um trades that that that recognize you know create an arbitrage opportunity we classify the the net benefit of assets and normalize into if um but yeah it's you know because these contracts can all operate in such different ways it's it can be really difficult to recognize what's profit and what is uh funds coming yeah yeah with transfer especially funds coming from a system that you don't understand one of the examples that i use most often is if we didn't classify ether delta then somebody that's just you know withdrawing their funds from ether delta be like oh my god you called this one function and they sent you 500 eth you made 500 each but we didn't actually understand that that storage slot value that changed reduced their assets by 500 each at the same time and so yeah it's it's difficult and and i we generally try to be very conservative about it and so these um you know when when we really can't classify things well we we we opt not to especially when it comes to the classifying the profit um but i think these charts really exist i think to kind of help us understand the scale of not it's lovely right it's really what we need um so just to give you a bit of a background we're currently trying to um to model um from which transaction value uh or value in general um a transaction would incentivize a miner to fork the chain for to exploit the avv um so we just use some markov decision process to model this thing and i mean it might be a model might be wrong right um but we try to kind of understand from what like how how much bigger than the block reward does an mev opportunity need to be for miners to start forking the chain because this is kind of the step at which it deteriorates the security of the chain right so yep that's that's something we're currently looking at um so wonderful great great dashboard great thanks um we have time for one more one more question scott there's a question in the chat if you can see it if not i can read it out live from from from robert um looking was that earlier where is it at there it is uh taking out these outliers curious what the average variance of the lower 99 i see so um looking at the that top left chart here the question is if if you kind of remove these these outliers what is the jet how much can miners consistently expect to um to have per block um that is a good question um that actually that would not be that hard to write in in sql i don't think let me um let me get back to you i i don't think it actually it changes this number that much because this is a very very large block range here this is a block range of like you know um like over a million blocks and so that that 400 gets this 400 here and these ones here they get diluted pretty quickly i mean probably down well below the like points you know 01 or 0.05 so i don't think it's going to massively change this number i think this number is for the most part made up pretty consistently um within standard blocks but yeah that's um i'll do that let me let me add a chart i think that's a very interesting metric to say how much miners can generally expect to make over time without the uh the lottery of liquidation all right let's now move on to the the second part of the agenda are our roast um steffi if you could go to the roast slide dan is our roast master today thank you very much dan for agreeing to to be uh our roast master for this first roast uh could you briefly present yourself and then you know the floor is yours thanks alex um so yeah i'm really grateful to everyone on the flashbots team for inviting me to um do this i'm uh i'm an investor at paradigm um who is uh who's supporting flashbacks in this research and uh generally and a researcher interested in um a lot of topics including including media and its impact on ethereum i was really glad to be asked to do this for the roast because i think that everyone on the flashbots team has really been given a free pass so far and hasn't been subject to the kind of scrutiny especially tina that maybe is warranted for people with such power so i wanted to um ask you just you know a few questions of this team to really hold them accountable for what they're proposing to do so first question is one that i think is maybe the most common one that comes up when anyone talks about a project to to capture me v and help out with mev which is um how can you distinguish tools that can be used for a good mev positive mev or ones that can use mev for positive purposes from ones that are just purely extractive and so i'll direct that one first to the people on the team so if you wanna sure i can give it a stab and then i would love to open the floor for public challenges or other team members or public clarification questions um i think that's a really good question i think uh you know i wish i knew the answer to it um i think that's one of our research questions and it's something on our research agenda and there's quite a few researchers on the call so uh you know i think coming up with a framework for the the various types of mev and the benefits and harms to various stakeholders and mapping that out kind of completely is something that needs to happen um i think there's some like obvious intuition we have from traditional finance where like traditional finance tries to toe this line kind of a lot where like they want to be extracting something uh to an extent from like the engines of capitalism right that's why exchanges do things like charge for co-location and charge for order types um and you know why routing is such a such a market um but many times they kind of end up being seen as or acting predatory um because of either information asymmetry or because they've set things up in a way that advantage certain actors over others so i think to kind of port the analogy there um like good mev would be something like providing liquidity which is like one of the goals that any hft company will tell you their enterprise has of like making markets more efficient so like someone really needs this token this one block on uniswap and there's been a change since the last block um in the market rate the price has gone down on an off chain market why should this person have to pay a higher price so so that arbitrage opportunity against the pool in some ways both helps users and maybe makes our bot some money in the process uh bad mev i mean we've seen like a million types like i would argue that many of the smart contracts hacks we've seen are bad mev like the bzx attack um you know probably a strategy where let's say uniswap had no slippage limits in theory and like you just reorged every single user to get the worst possible execution or even with their limit order you like give them the worst possible price even if like normally they'd send this transaction and they get a like a mid price you just make sure they get the worst possible price for every single order so that seems like more unambiguously bad mev uh i think there's also mev in terms of like bribing other protocols that are used uh to perform attacks and things like that that socially seem bad so that's like i guess my intuition but i think to answer the question if you're interested on this that would be a great uh frp and maybe to collaborate with other people in flashbots so would you say the answer is that you know it when you see it good mev versus bad i don't know if we know when we see it like i think we want to have yeah i mean i think we want to have a better answer than that because it's going to probably be politically contentious if mev starts being extracted and i imagine there will be kind of a natural opinion that will form in the community of people just assessing for themselves but also i think having like a more rigorous system of understanding would be cool too now this maybe gets into my third oh go ahead yeah doesn't this question go back to uh do we need kyc on chain like because do we need kyc on chain yeah because if you have anonymity or like pseudonymity then how do you i mean you can always disguise let's say a bad mav as a good mav depending on your how you describe a good mev right so without identity i don't see conceptually how you can avoid that actually i'm not sure i'm not sure identity helps with i think that would be cool go ahead yeah i think that would be a cool uh a cool uh result i don't know if i i agree that all bad mev can be disguised as good mvv i think there are things that will unambiguously like show up like for example one example of bad mev could be breaking maker dow governance to liquidate people's cdps and like breaking the dipeg like there's no way to kind of disguise that as something good because people will notice that the dye peg is screwed up um so i think there are some kinds of muv maybe that are unambiguously like detectable but i agree for many classes of mev that is probably true and like i think it would be interesting to look at which ones can be disguised and how um yeah i think identity is very controversial so i'm not gonna touch that part of it maybe dan dan was kind of starting to do that yeah i mean that would potentially be throwing out the the baby with the bath water there to to give up on privacy and in the interest of stopping and maybe like then at that point why not just go back to iran i just might not just have everything be done in centralized centralized protocols um but yeah but i also agree with phil that i think there's qualitative distinctions um it sort of gets into my in the third question that i had which is um even if you can distinguish between good and bad nav um your the tools that you build um will likely be usable for both and so if you were building these and keeping them in secret and using them to extract only good mev and fight the bad mev then potentially there could be um you know that could have a positive effect but if you're open sourcing these then anyone can use them so the analogy that i'm drawing here is between um you can think about like nuclear technology or artificial intelligence or biological weapons um where or maybe 3d printing where making something open source and these norms of of as much openness as possible in these kind of con you know areas where there's really central conflicts between individuals who have this and where the technology being spread out can be bad um just being open source may not be enough or may actually be harmful like do you do you think that nuclear war would be prevented if if it was impossible for anybody to build nuclear bombs if it was just if it was something that was uh open source it's like basically like the question of whether script kitties script kitties will use open source viruses or trojans right and i mean yeah there might be there might be some negative impact but it might also boost the research community to to to become stronger it's a it's a cat in a mosque you know in the end yeah um so i have a lot to say about that question but i think other people on the team should get a chance before i say anything so i don't know or random people if anyone has anything to say go ahead yeah how about it but i mean i i just don't i don't think that the um the system that we're building you know while worthwhile is not you know nuclear uh nuclear physics and we've already seen several other projects attempt to launch things in in the same vein as this kind of back channel minor interaction system and given the given the way that the hash rate works in ethereum and given the way that mining power is going to be drawn to the most profitable i just i think that there's going to have to be some you know once somebody starts doing this which we believe people are going to i think it's going to become a necessity to be competitive and not something that you can weigh in on philosophically you know it'd be like go on go ahead i mean it it'd be like i i don't think what we're doing is complicated enough that we can think oh if we you know if we don't do this then nobody's going to be able to pull this off i think that what we can do is put ourselves in the middle and raise awareness of it invisibility and try to ensure that it is as open as possible because once one once one pool starts doing it i think that it's going to become difficult for others to be competitive so doesn't that logic what you're describing there which i think is certainly true where there's this kind of malic um incentive problem where it's in everybody's interest or everybody it becomes necessary to survive to extract all kinds of energy possible doesn't this prevent you from exercising any kind of ethical judgment over what mev you extract because ultimately you'll be out competed by anyone who's willing to go to go more malicious um there one of the things we talked about with with um spark pool is that they talked a lot about the um you know since not all their hashing power is their own but it's it's contributed by a lot like the there is still some community sentiment behind it and it sounds like the people who contribute hash power are fairly involved just given how um how interested in in that spark pool was so i i wonder if we can still have some sort of community assessment here with you know understanding the types of mavs so long as it's detectable being included but um yeah i if i can if i can weigh in here i think please arthur made an interesting analogy between you know sort of open sourcing uh infosec you know viruses and uh you know certain tools of cyber security destruction with what's going on with mvp it feels like the big asymmetry here is that mev is is free to be analyzed by anybody and free to be weighed on by anybody but miners and relatively small number of mining pools have the ultimate ability to actually deploy these weapons and it doesn't seem like they're particularly responsive or at least intrinsically responsive to the you know complaining intelligence on twitter and so i think one thing that's very dissimilar between the example of like doing cyber security research on the open and the example dan gave of you know open nuclear weapons um it seems analogous where it's very difficult for individuals or small organizations to uh to create and use nuclear weapons uh but governments are are very able to and they're much less many of them or at least the worst among them uh are not responsive to the complaints of their of their citizens and it feels like we're in a similar situation where we're appealing to you know sparkful is the biggest mining pool i believe um and so it maybe seems plausible that they're fairly altruistic and they're fair-minded and that there's an appeal it's like okay hopefully these people will have the best interests of the community at mind and the way the extractive elements of being a mining pool with the kind of uh stewardship that they also must have um but mining mining pools are competitive and mining pools have gone up and down and they're uh in their in their ownership of hash rate and uh if they're not if they're the most altruistic then would we not expect them to get out competed hi folks i'm wrecked did you explain yeah i was just gonna say i mean it's really fascinating how long it's taken for this conversation to arise in the public you know people at the ef i mean this is what prompted casper i mean people when casper was first being created the discussion was well what happens when miners turn malicious and start reordering transactions and doing these sorts of things i mean this is this has been a long-standing issue um and so for me you know when i was asked to think about that stuff all those years ago the conclusion that i sort of came to was well these are well let's start i'm gonna do it a little bit backwards because i actually have to go soon but um you know when you know bitcoin is a single application blockchain right it just handles bitcoin transactions on ethereum we have these competing applications and so there's just this natural competition for block space that we have in ethereum that doesn't exist in in other chains and we're just kind of stuck with that as long as we have a first price auction system and i i recommend that everyone um look look at uh tim rufgarden's work uh he's he's actually paying attention to blockchain stuff which is great and he invented a lot of this stuff i mean he really knows the the subject matter super well um so a lot of what i'm saying is going to come from my interactions with him uh as long as we're having these first price auctions um we should expect the miners to do things that are against the user's best interest i and i i just don't i don't see that's part of the design you know so if we want to um change the behavior which i think as a community is a reasonable thing to want we really do have to look at how we auction off block space and and just do it differently i don't think that makes any i don't think having a conversation about good or bad mev makes any sense to me there's only good and bad protocols and if and if your protocol is susceptible to exploitation from minors in this way and you as a designer didn't want that to happen then you just failed as a designer and there's not much anyone else you know no amount of ringing our hands on twitter or or anything is going to fix that because ethereum you know assumes that miners are going to you know there's some weird assumptions in ethereum about what miners are going to or not going to do and i think this is just you know our chickens are coming home to roost basically this is a really fascinating discussion um i don't i don't want to cut off but i do want to manage to cover some of the uh some of the other questions including about coverage go ahead tell sorry sorry i was just gonna say so that raises so i have a few just brief things to say to that one thing is i think uh i kind of decided yeah uh sorry there's like a huge hangouts lag on my end i don't know why so if i'm like a minute delayed let me just rant and then it'll be over um uh so yeah a few things i guess one of them is uh is that i think the conversation between good and bad mev is still worth having in that framework because then it becomes like a protocol design question of like how much should we constrain minor behavior because presumably there's going to be other trade-offs associated with like whatever constraints we have on preventing uh maximal mev extraction but i think i do agree with the general sentiment and like one sentiment that i wanted to contribute to this issue maybe as food for thought before uh we move on is just that like we are building systems that are intended to work in an adversarial environment which i think is unique for financial systems like you don't assume that nasdaq will be adversarial in their ordering uh at least not not as openly not maximally uh but in cryptocurrency that's kind of like a design goal that like we want these things to be secure even if all of these people are doing bad things um so i think if we don't have a framework for minimizing and kind of extracting mev to the max extent all the time whatever is left on the table kind of becomes a subsidy for whoever is willing to ethically not care about the system uh which i think from like a security equilibrium point of view is not good for a permissionless system uh which i think in many ways is different than you know the atomic bomb that kills everyone um i also think that like there is more of an argument to be made that you opt into ethereum than that you opt into you know having a bomb dropped on you but i also think that argument is tenuous because like as things kind of get more important like it might not really be a choice for many people so that's all i had to say cool thanks phil um yeah so i wanted to move on to um some of the other questions so one that's very topical because the ethereum two deposit contract just reached its threshold for for activation of the beacon chain which i think is scheduled for december 1st whatever whatever that means um i'm curious for what uh the flashbacks team or anyone else on the call who's familiar with with e2 design um thinks about how e2 will affect mev and how your tools might adapt for that or proof-of-stake generally so my understanding is that is it uh there won't be much of a of a difference it's it's just a uh transaction ordering problem and that doesn't go away with these two you just have validation uh designers instead of uh proof of works i i don't see anything uh fundamentally different about youth too do you think there could be like would it be possible to slash people for for tracking mev design space anymore right yeah exactly exactly then uh i mean anything you could do there you would have parallels that you could do in a proof of work chains but um yes i don't i don't see any fundamental uh difference between work and proof of stake with respect to um uh mev well it's not yeah it's gonna work because it worked right yeah right yeah the miners just run off there's no there's no single pool of capital to slash yeah you could have miners yeah i could have miners put in capital when they mine a block and like it's flashable or something to penalize them for abuse but yeah they're pretty pretty they're i think actually it might well be that the idea like the actual coordination required to slash uh manchester miners is so remote and so unlikely but they sort of know that it's a nuclear option right it's sort of the way that like constitutional challenges almost never actually get litigated but everybody knows in the back of their mind like look there is some path down which we could end up litigating this you know very negative thing that could happen in you know us government i can imagine something like that operating in east 2.0 i mean like in a social layer exactly but sort of being a remote but real enough possibility that it will just keep miners in check much more so than they would at 1.0 yeah i think it's it's it's feasible although i don't i don't i don't necessarily know it's a good thing because then you start to compromise the neutrality like the the uh the neutrality of the of the protocol so i would be a little bit worried about people threatening to do that um but yeah that's social layer stuff which i i'm less familiar with and more hard protocol uh design things one one point there for my limited understanding of these two and robert just mentioned it as well is a block producer nif2 is chosen a little bit more in advance so they have more time to actually prepare for any of the extraction um and so that that means this potential if they have more time to prepare they have more more compute power or like more compute time to to run you know some simulations to be able to extract them even in a maximal fashion um one point to also make is relative to proof of work miners on on ethereum uh the the validators are maybe more aligned because they're staking their eve so there's a more direct alignment and in some way there's maybe something something to think about there although i don't have like a good intuition of like the implications of that uh definitely as um austin pointed out there's still transaction ordering uh and so in that case the problem of mev is still very much present so i would actually um add one other point dan on that to alex um because i agree with you there's there's a little more subtlety though to the block proposers knowing a little bit in advance that they're going to propose a block it's also that they know 100 that the work they're doing at that time is valuable and they know not to bother to order mev transactions at other times so the mev attacks from an algorithm perspective can become much more complex and still be profitable um if you're doing this all the time with proof of work and you do very complex transactions you could end up burning more you know aws time or your equivalent time in your you know hardware pool so um yeah so i think that it'll be harder and so from protocol standpoint right the protocol designer makes a set of rules that define good and bad behavior and incentivizes it the algorithm designer which is the mev attacker is looking for an algorithm that follows the rules right and so you know things that we could think are bad still follow rules um but so they can be more sophisticated in the algorithms they put together so it's going to make the protocol job hot harder i think in youth too my like my you know we i don't think we have so like so the the core thing is like we don't have any proof of stake algorithms really at this point that have like enough interesting economic interactions to like extract meaningful mav um so we like are still very early in this game um and so we don't really know how how how it would work um my experience with like validator behavior is is that validators are going to be probably optimizing for uh investing engineering resources in in sort of extracting mev during like their proposer slots um but less in it seems extremely unlikely that people are going to be um like censoring block producers to try and extract more mev um so it it may be less pathological on like the protocol level to have uh mev extraction uh improvement networks i wonder though if like that doesn't mean that we should create uh more pathological like protocol extraction because otherwise it's like a a security hole that someone could still exploit just that the the current set of validators happens to be incentivized for whatever other reason not to um but i think that's that's a complicated political question also so this is the accelerationist philosophy of just let's make let's make that uv as that make the environment as possible as possible as fast as possible so that we evolve into solutions that can survive us yeah i don't know if i'm advocating for that to be clear but uh but i think that there is an argument to be made that because of the way cryptocurrency is secured and the design goals of like at least the top few cryptocurrencies that are intended to operate in hostile uh political environments i wonder if that's not something that's useful i find the lack of exploitation of like protocol level vulnerabilities to be very frustrating as like a protocol designer it does feel like all of your effort and like trying to design systems that are resilient to this is like wasted because everybody just behaves altruistically in practice that was the big argument between vlad and silvio mccauley at like fc 2017 where they like derailed the whole conference for 10 minutes and yelled at each other about uh whether people are honest or not so maybe maybe sylvia was right well i think there's also a difference between things like resilience against nation state actors i think proof of work and selfish mining are good examples of this where there are sort of tail risks that you want to ameliorate against whereas mev extraction is more of a sort of continuous risk profile it's not really that there's some it's not really that hardening ourselves to nav prevent some like super scary mbv miner showing up one day and really  things over and so i think the the accelerations are going to play somewhat differently to something like the security proof of work versus the security of you know the uh expectations around fairness of block ordering uh this is a bit of a tangent from the from east to as a discussion but um i think one plan for how we two will x transaction execution transaction ordering will actually work and one that was proposed by vitalik um a couple months ago was a roll-up-centric vision of this where transaction ordering is actually done at the roll-up layer and so i've seen some interesting proposals for for example having the transaction ordering be done by just submitting to different shard blocks and then they get aggregated later um so there's only like so that lowers latency to confirmation and also makes it harder potentially for someone uh proposing a block to be able to know exactly what the state of the roll-up is but when they when they do so so it's a sort of art do that and then you can imagine more advanced ones involving like ddfs or or some kind of blinding on top of um the roll-up so that even the roll-up proposer doesn't have the ability to see um so does transaction ordering blinding just sort of fix mev does that restore the fog of war yeah so one thing i will say is that like from my impression of vitalik's trade-off preferences right now it seems like this roll-up mev on the roll-up kind of way is what is the current preferred strategy for eth2 to answer the original question so it probably will be relevant to mev assuming that these two plans go as laid out which is rarely uh rarely true but anyway let's assume it um and then i think there'll still be an interesting question of mev both within particular roll-ups i think that's just a like a fractal of the current mev question on layer one but also like a cross roll-ups like if each roll-up is its own siloed universe that's running some set of daps there's still going to be a flashboy's style kind of set of incentives um like classic 90s flash boys to like move information from one shard to another or synchronize things across shards um and that there will probably still be some economic benefit associated with being that that actor so quantifying that i think is a is an interesting research question maybe even for the next phase after the mvp when eth2 is more concrete um in a roll-up centric vision though like the um like like you can do a lot of you have a lot of flexibility on the protocol level um to um sort of modify you know to like punish potential proposers for misbehavior um have them like provide additional guarantees etc like it's a lot like sort of the cosmos vision of like application specific consensus can be applied in that domain i'm sort of i'm very interested in that uh like roll up yeah i think that raises an economic question this is the last thing i'm going to say for like the next 10 minutes but like in classical finance right there's all these fair markets like uh the buddhist work for example and like many other designs but a lot of them are kind of analyzed by themselves and when they are side by side with other slightly tweaked fair markets or the kind of limit order books that we have now they have very different properties than when they're just kind of executing by themselves um so i wonder if that's like a general economic question of like what is a good consensus algorithm and how do these ones that have like all these fairness properties in isolation actually interact to provide fairness like to the whole ecosystem well so um one question that's relevant to paradigm as an investor in flashbots is how do you plan to make money for yourselves and for us if you're giving away all these tools and not using them for to extract all the other massive amounts of bad mev maybe that's a question for team yeah or sure do you to i can i can take it if you don't want to take it to you um sure alex you go ahead i think you still muted the wrong me uh well i think generally we think you know what we're building creates a lot of value and so there'll be plenty of opportunities to make money on top of it um in the case of paradigm in particular right i think what we are building benefits ethereum broadly and uh you know it's no secret that paradigm is a large order holder of ethereum and is also very invested in some of the projects that i have built on ethereum including for example unizua and so you know helping these projects and the broad ethereum community becoming more resilient and resistant to what can be seen as some existential risk and you know at the very least there are a lot of negative externalities involved i think you know rises the general tide for uh any you know people that are exposed to ethereum um that that's that's kind of the the you know on that front i think it's unclear yet uh how exactly we're going to you know these opportunities on top to make money how we're going to approach them what's clear for now is we definitely want to build you know this strong research organization and we're very research oriented um and then as as things go along and as things become clear they will i mean we can definitely imagine already a few a few uh businesses that can be built on top what i meant by what i said before is that whether flashbacks takes part in this so flashback stays as purely a research organization is is up uh up for discussion and it's not something on top of our mind at the at the moment hope that answers the question uh well i think um just a challenge back dan i thought we um decided to shake hands because we're gonna explore this together aren't we i think none of us on uh flashbots or the uh greater mbb ship community like to uh make promises that cannot be delivered the entire uh premise of flashbacks as a project relies on it needs to um take an iterative approach of actually um evaluating the economic and technical feasibility while in prague and uh to see how much what to verify about whether they're validate whether there is going to be market uh validity um in in being able to bootstrap this market up front and that is the whole premise of mbp phase and there are specific research targets benchmarks that we've uh set up in uh evaluating the success in a non-revisionist way in a sense of we want to look at the technical and economic metrics however if i'm saying if that is validated we're in the process of doing so the question becomes where can the value approve whether it goes to the ecosystem of being a player in the ecosystem or whether the infrastructure itself can be able to create a positive feedback loop that can achieve network effect and that question is being designed however one thing that we have made up front in our commitment which is also made clear in the youth research post and reinforce in the median post is the values that we stand by that everything the core infrastructure flashbots create will be open source and made available to the general public 100 and whether flashbacks will uh um how it would plan to in fact bootstrap the two-sided market from a business perspective would eventually um we will only design mechanism and we in fact have some really fun mechanism um uh well look forward to a meme um in the future down the road called flashbot olympic where the searcher activities will be bootstrapped in plural so i think that's um you know the directions we are exploring and it's a long-winded way of saying we do not have firm answer and we do not want to be how liable for things that we do not know for sure but are actively exploring i think that's a very very fair answer and to be clear i think paradigm is very proud to be to be supporting flashbacks regardless of what happens i mean the the line we always heard back when we invested in unit swap was that um oh there doesn't seem to be a way for this to make money um so we're comfortable underwriting these investments and things that seem out there um to most people at the time and we're very excited about our involvement in flashbacks um i had one more question and then then i can hand it off um uh to the end which was tina seems to have crossed it out because she's afraid of people knowing more about her um i met tina about a year ago at devcon um and uh when she had when she organized a conference took over and organized the entire conference um uh one day conference in about in about uh three weeks um and was very impressed with that but no one really knows where tina what tina came from or what her story is and given how much power she's about to have over the mev ecosystem i wanted to to ask her to maybe explain herself i can't hear you oh huh that um first of all i i believe that is a revenge against my mimifying of dan's uh you know glorious twitter profile pic um on the michael lewis book cover but um to answer that question in all seriousness tina is a powerful meme i'm not kidding it's short for there is no alternative coined by the you know classical neoliberal um classical liberal philosopher herbert spencer and then became a rhetoric forcefully institutionalized into pop culture as a doctrine by margaret thatcher uh in the 80s with a policy but at this moment it is currently an alias that represents one of my devices that's on this call to show the last refuge of the established orthodoxies called traditional finance but um yeah so i think what matters is not about who i am i am a lifetime experimental economic student who is fundamentally interested in designing in prod the minimalist mechanism that could um make um surplus human capital fungible so aka i would like to um be able to create an anti-fragile organization like i said from the beginning that can allow the kind of digital nomadic lifestyle that we all love in this age and especially in crypto especially in ethereum that everyone who want to contribute regardless of what your level is you could find on a flashback a role be it whether you contribute by learning about d5 by writing the basic ground level inspectors where you contribute to crowdsourcing knowledge contribute to um essentially increasing our mpd coverage through the mdv explorer that we plan to roll out or whether you are someone who is a uh academic researcher who is fundamentally interested in these fairness questions and is solving but then applying it in um things that actually matters to us or you want to play the politician and see where it goes um in distributing if there is anything to be distributed um npv or governing how it should be distributed i think everyone has a play and has a role in this ecosystem and that's all that matters and tina is just a reflection of everyone's effort and so who i am doesn't really matter thank you that that was everything i was hoping for uh to wrap us up phil did you any thoughts on that i was just gonna gonna give some other spicy thoughts on the previous question which is how we're gonna make money uh which some people on this call are probably gonna slap uh but it also maybe relates to to who tina is which i will just say tina is a very powerful meme uh and one of the the first time i met tina she was talking about flash bots uh over flash boys and i just thought that was a great meme because uh you know it's universally just better than flash boys uh i think it's much more like 2020 than like 1990 so you know clearly a better meme maker than i am for my my uh paper writing uh so all props um but i will also say like on the how we're gonna make money point because i think this is relevant to you guys in the call and how things will go forward um i think that mev is obviously a really important issue and i'm glad you guys are all as passionate about it as we are um i think mev has the potential to either be a great thing for crypto uh to organize and align incentives or predatory to users and like harmful to our overall feel-good missions of being happy and like helping people uh in an adversarial environment uh so i think we do need some sort of effort that's basically you know the word carl likes to use and i should probably shouldn't call him out for this but uh uh in regards to this is government right um and we need some sort of body that corrects the externalities that come from just the raw capitalist extraction of mev uh and so what we plan to do is basically form a cartel that represents this body through like the sheer force of the people in it which include all of you guys on this call so there's like a lot of very prominent uh very smart very influential uh you know cryptocurrency people here who are interested in mev and are on the kind of front lines of influencing this meme and what we need to make sure is that mev is extracted through a cartel that is socially aware and that is committed to doing the right thing um you know in in this extraction process um and and really i think one mechanism to do that is through taxation um so this infrastructure you know part of the goal is to redistribute some of what is going to be extracted anyway and what is already being extracted today to understand mev and correct some of these externalities we've identified such as this lack of transparency or inefficiencies um at layer one things like that so there are a lot of ways which mev can go south and i think we need an independent uh open community based uh you know organization to make sure that we use our collective force to make sure that these technologies are the best things they can be rather than like the average or worse things in terms of how we plan to make money you know taxing that infrastructure and using it to do things like fund research fellowships and do research that's one possibility competing on our own market is is another one um uh you know and maybe there will be future efforts future subsidiaries but either way we don't know and like i would love to have you all involved we're firm believers around aligning incentives so like if at any point that kind of incentive question is discussed you know we put the community first in all these aspects and yeah we just love to have you contribute uh based on this proof of work that tina is all about and that i'm sure she'll explain to you um to this kind of cartel slash effort thanks thanks very much phil and thanks everyone from the flashback team for for having me on and letting letting me roast you um i'm gonna i'll i think that's our time for the mev road so i'm gonna hand it back to um back to alex for the last part of the of the program all right all right thank you dan that was really great uh love the conversation thank you uh guys non-flashball team for participating in this um the last uh point on the agenda and we we have about you know another like 10 11 minutes for it is a general oh right next to me if you roast that's december 9th so mark mark your calendar for it there is a public calendar uh that you can subscribe to it is on the slides here and i can send it as well if you give me a sec uh the the last bit you know the for the last 10 minutes basically if you guys have any just general questions anything you want to ask the flash box team that doesn't necessarily have to be related to the questions that dan put out for the roast uh this is this is your time actually for those remaining on the call i would love to get a intro from people who's interested in you know uh meeting e-meetings through the google hangout because i think we had a lot of discussion on this court like maybe share a bit about like why uh what specifically interests you like which aspect of flashbacks and where you how you wanna chime in whoever wants to share okay if nobody uh goes i'm gonna i'm gonna start hi my name is arthur i do i do blockchain research academic blockchain research mostly since 2012 full time so i started with bitcoin and moved into the ethereum space as soon as it became more mature and and quite interesting with the with the different opportunities such as immuno um and what motivates me is really to understand things deeply um and to not just scratch the surface but to really take a few questions and try to really go deep and and get quantitative results um for example what transaction value actually constitutes uh mvv right from which value onwards can we count mev as an mvv value so just as these very simple questions that are hard to quantify that's something i really like um and later on given this deeper knowledge we can build better systems [Music] yeah happy to have you here uh arthur big fan of your work obviously and uh i think there's a lot of intersection there's a lot of deep questions um both on the cs and game theory side of mev so yeah excited to explore those i think zaki has been raising his hand for the past like 30 minutes i'm not sure whether his cursor is tired or not yet oh i i set my thing yeah you guys ignored him so he had to interrupt we should be more organized about hand raising uh interruptions and like uh in the future just so that people don't have to be aggressive uh but thank you zaki for exerting your your will in that scenario i don't think anybody had never ignored me of not being aggressive fair enough some people you know in the recent conversation i found out that zaki has been thinking about the word uh you know mdv before like four years before and the the term was coined zacky you want to share a bit about the backstory i mean i was just gonna say that like from my point of view probably the first time i really started like i mean so when andrew miller did honey badger with his co-authors um which was like i think probably the first blockchain consensus protocol that sort of treated mev as a real thing um um and at the top like even before that like you know um there were conversations about like order fairness um in this like in the weird niche community of public blockchain scalability um in like 2014 2015 uh time frame and we were we were thinking about like order fairness and um and like you know censorship incentives and all of these things like all of this thinking has like goes back that far um and so yeah i mean like a lot of the a lot of the like reason why we wanted to build cosmos was this idea of um of like we thought that there would be a world where you would want application specific consensus um so you wouldn't have to um uh so you could do things like you know in in you know on this blockchain like the proposers give out receipts to everybody who does a transaction and they're slashable um if they uh if they reorder transactions and in other blockchains we don't care um because people do payments or governance or whatever on it and it's less important um and so yeah i've been thinking about this for a really long time uh it's all it's really nice to see more people caring about it rick is probably in the same boat we've probably been thinking about it for roughly the same amount of many many years yeah i know there was also hawk very early on there were a few different protocol design papers that tried to achieve you know some degree of uh reordering resilience um i think the protocols that were that one were the ones that didn't do that because it wasn't really something people concretely cared about until really defy started like actually exposing like really really large amounts of uh you know money in the real world and like now suddenly there was a bot ecosystem so i think it was like entirely a foreseeable problem um i wonder i'm curious in the future like what will happen at the protocol design level because i could see the argument for like doing this at the application level i could see the argument for doing it at the protocol level i could see like all sorts of interoperability concerns and i think you know probably figuring this all out is solving the grand unified cosmos vision of like app specific optimized uh engines uh but that seems like a lot to uh seems like a lot to solve let's make that happen hey guys i just wanted to chime in i'm matt from block native i know many of the folks who are here but it's great to be here and i think the initiative is really cool um for those of you who don't know us we're sort of experts in the mempool and and we built the big hunk and memphis data system that actually has a perfect archival record going back a year we have over 40 billion ethereum mempool events that we think could be super valuable for research purposes but we're not exactly sure how to engage so in a couple different ways i've been kind of raising my hand saying hey we have a bunch of stuff that might be useful for this effort if you guys are interested let us know we're a commercial entity and we're getting pulled into many very significant mev conversations these are not things on the surface they're behind the scenes these are potentially very lucrative we have lots of debates internally about where we want to sit in this spectrum and what we want to participate in but this is by no means abstract or theoretical for us it is very upfront right now i am involved in multiple conversations with multiple commercial entities who are looking to do real and serious things as it relates to mev um and so we're trying to find our way in this ecosystem and we very much want to and historically have been supportive of research we are small we don't have a lot of capacity so we sit on top of all sorts of data that we just don't have the capacity to review so uh to the extent that it's relevant we want to collaborate to the extent that it's not relevant we're happy to not but we just wanted to say hey we're here we're paying attention we want to be supportive in whatever ways we can but we're resource constrained so i'm matt thank you yeah great to see you matt i know we've talked in the past and you know i'm not always the most responsive to messages i know you've offered before i kind of wanted to figure out some structure to make sure that all this data that we're all collecting kind of ends up you know maximally benefiting the community and uh creating good things so i think there's a lot of conversations that maybe we should have with tina on on what that looks like and like how you guys view the the public commercial kind of line in your enterprise and like how we can kind of help translate the things we want public um to the users to figure out a way to do so and we very internally we want to be on the white hat side of all of this but when you have economic incentive which is grey hat it's uh it's challenging because we have shareholders right i i'm not super worried about it i think we'll be able to navigate it just fine but these matters are affecting our business right now we have large trading customers who are abandoning abandoning certain strategies because they're no longer profitable because they're getting you know out-competed by mev and then they basically downgrade their commercial accounts with us because the strategies they were using are no longer affected right so this is like not this is here and now and affecting us and so anyways we want to be productive members of the community and and i'm curious to understand if what we have is really all that different from what anybody else has like if it's just another source of mempool data that's fine but if what we can offer is differentiated we'd love to do so yeah there's definitely a lot to explore um would love to set up a chat um after and i think this is on on the value front on discovering where the community stands is in um jointly illuminating the dark forest um we love the meme we actually uh wrote the same one and we kind of uh basically published at the same time so i think we shared a similar vision of the future so lost you tina but i agree with everything before that yes but there's another one of me but uh that uh uh lastly i want to really hear from robert um because you are a new face uh robert roast sorry if i'm butchering your name yeah i know you definitely got my name close enough um yeah no so um i and joseph chao is also on the call so um some people on the colleague dan dan robinson knows us we worked at consensus and we've been helping consensus build a stronger r d effort with the aim towards supporting work uh that goes out in the common goods so open source projects open protocols and so forth it's kind of the more foundation wing of the company um i feel like i'm less i came on this call because i wanted to understand how deep the research well would be around mev um and i think i have a better idea that it could be pretty deep but i think the question is it becomes relevant based on how big the opportunity is and you know i think it's really good tina that you sort of are trying to bring in people that are also on the economic side because this is in order to like make this you know kind of like deserving a lot of r d effort requires there being a big enough opportunity to move people from the altruistic to the malicious side um because if it's a small opportunity people tend to behave altruistic so i have a better feeling now that this is important so thank you um i will definitely be there at the next meeting as well and i'll be doing some reading so i can participate more than thanks for calling me out yeah super glad to have you and i think we can convince um hopefully you uh but hopefully anybody that the research well exists and i think there's a lot of good unexplored questions that are going to be very practically important that will take many many many years to answer so i'm pretty excited about all that too yeah i should also say that i have a predisposition to like trying to see if it can be solved at layer one because it's universal then versus it's always nice to do things at the application layer or layer two but it doesn't is generally hit things if it can do the bonus of actually allowing there to be a non-fragile mechanism for supporting r d by having kind of a service that's taxing that then puts money whatever money it does make back into kind of common goods work i think that's awesome so um i'm hoping we could yeah i'm hoping the research shows that there's some good uh layer one type things um that we could do for it that would be really cool yeah totally i agree awesome anyone else if not i think we are a bit over time and one of my devices has already died that usually means this time so without further ado perhaps we will see you uh in two weeks or sooner because you can always find us on our poor dab call which happens every week uh twice of twice a week in fact and we will have our first public research workshop starting next thursday and it will be every thursday from next thursday onward that said anyways have a great thanksgiving um turkey days um and um talk to you soon thank you guys for joining thank you thanks everybody great work you
