thank you all right um let's welcome this is whiteboard the machine it is supposed to be a show with whiteboards and uh you know you might yes with question and uh we are talking about how to specifically unlocks magic for crypto or unlock the magic of credit documented devices which I think it's one of the biggest valid proposition of crypto and specifically in the process of discussing dramatic propositions we will see that Mev or you know traditionally and maximum incredible value will arise as a you know whether surprising or unsurprisingly as a result of the application or our Pursuit the classic tendency of our pursuit to use crypto to unlock the true solution verifications um so for this this is the first episode we're going to talk about solicitly and positive show horror show is going to be laid out and specifically you know through the game theory perspective and today we have fun today uh would you don't mind giving a little bit introduction for sure I am Donna I'm a researcher at the ethereum foundation at the robust incentives Group which is a research team dedicated to mechanism design and Game Theory fully ethereum protocol yeah so let's start with discussing the big picture right the value proposition of crypto so one of the things I think particularly interesting in games Theory is the idea of price and energy and specifically how agents when you assume then that all of them are have rationality meaning that you know maximize their own utility then they inevitably run into some gas scenario and that is what you want to solve right look at this like why I guess many people in the crypto Community are obsessed with words like coordination correct yes correct and from from what I have understood so many uh game series previously all worked on you know various ways of establishing uh how to humans coordinate especially how do rational Agents from teenage um you know what do you think are something of the good examples humans coordinates all the time I think one of the most powerful coordination tools that we have for instance you language like we use the same words we describe the same things and the money we use the same referential to describe the same amount of value by its data on internet we use the same protocols to communicate with one another language is a protocol so it's very clear that once you find the correct way for people to meet one another [Music] um yes here so your website will generate things yes yeah I can see that language is like a lot of humans in the past to coordinate with humans in the future and we look at time traveling machines but you know even in the absence of time traveling machines we devise this device called language and then yeah money is another great example yeah um so uh I have this Theory talked about so crypto has the various biggest value for audition being a credible connection device so if you imagine look at all those previous Dimensions incredible you know alternate devices we see that human beings move from further which is like okay so here you have a and you have B and then they want to change something right I you know if we think about the most General case to give us some preferences you want people to find a way to satisfy your preferences okay so they come together into a location let's say like a central yeah Central Park yeah because they said but uh okay so they come here and then they departure right I give you something at the start and we both can physically explore each other or if you don't give me this thing after I give it to you I will I touch you in the face or something like that so This Is How We Do previous to money with money then you know I think money Improvement primarily has two two sides the first one is like one tip of the coordinate and we know that your repeat again people are quoting it much more right um so the money is a way to Market make welfare individual game setting I'm willing to give out the super number a I'm going to give up something uh freedom of some you know this box I give up this box but in return I I do not require you to give me like a box Prime in return I ever saw I I just want some money and then this money uh this money is supposed to uh in my future expanding particular Philippines uh allowed me to gain more welfare along into being an advantage and partner uh however another view to real money is that everybody has some utility dependent on money and then my utility minus ten dollars should be equals to the you know the the other people's utility decrease in that person losing under 10 dollars however we see that my action on YouTube and when I would say first that money is bigger than battle right like there's this popular narrative that Battlefield doesn't scale and maybe I want a cow and you won't honey at the exact moment in time the things that we both want and so there's this popular narrative that money comes because now you can solve these Coincidence of what you knew people have found out that money comes up much more natural in the system of credit for instance you're trying to give a debt or like an IOU to someone and you didn't mean that in some kind of unit of account so I can give you account today and you give me the money today and we can have some sort of record that we both enter into with that transactions yes however I think that we need to kind of make the difference so their access money is like a one-dimensional scanner that's like not even yeah some kind of real number but what you have been talking about is like a reference so that's uh kind of a memory right so yeah a much richer from expression like we see in credit cards I given you though you don't have any money so that's that transaction that in English in social welfare shouldn't have happened but in their similarity makers you know and that market because it's some kind of like credit system yes yes and once the field party wants to get involved and once I say well I have this IOU from ship is that worth anything to you we did these kinds of death to be fungible because that's how we scale the system and so then we are trying to move from nfts or solva previous tokens to something like SpongeBob and that it eventually looks like monkey so money is really an emerging property here but Intel mesh okay yes that one have with another Alpha like multi-international money and I I would say like smart contracts or here we're getting finally equivalent of crypto right so uh what's what what is even better than those like records credits and multi-dimensional money you know it's you know you have the previously you have money but with enforcements right so the technology of enforcement allows you to for example like so so previously without enforcements people have to calculate the risk and the account risk into the pricing and then this reduces some kind of you know systematic um risk for you know decreasing utility however this person will actually avoid that yeah so there's always a reason that you don't pay me back in which case the third party who got the debt that I got from you is completely screwed so if there is enforcement system which is exists somewhere yeah it's much easier for everyone to enter into these coordination games definitely definitely and also since you are mentioned in depth we know that most of the financial prices coming from the tasks or derives from this kind of over leveraged uh Financial product or like you know both fundable and tradable right so like you require those two things about your credit book you know commitment device Holdings position yeah so they're like once we have those then you know of course we can scale which is another way of saying that we can bring more people into this coordination game uh however you know we know this is called financial crisis so maybe it is better if we have some undesirable coordination right so that is another name for as we know collusion yes so yeah so it has like two sides and we really want to um avoid it as far as I know you have like an interesting uh youth diagram for the project here yes that'll be great yeah so we're coming back I guess a little bit on the idea of try savanaki yes um and just as an explanation surprise I have energies this notion where uh if you try to chart the plot and you see the best welfare state supposedly this [Music] um so suppose this is like uh well State the weather of State s and then this is like uh larger than any other possible state okay uh and then this is like supposed to be a real number whatever then let's suppose that right now uh and then we know that's the original we have a set of equilibrium States right you know uh I just play the games with three and end up in a set of equivalent States suppose we are playing this game G and then uh another state let's say uh is in the set of equivalent States then we know that the price of energy uh denoted by press and of energy equals to the uh the welfare of the maximum state divided by the words uh the worst state in the equilibrium so here we are like uh you know abbreviating it a little bit like just yeah the thing is arbitrary J that of course um yeah so this is a generic definition well yeah so what we mean is that if we have a dictator in the game who can assign actions to every player in the game that dictator can get the best overall the maximum of all the payments to all the players the players themselves if they play against one another very often they want to do things that are good for them and they start negating so you can think for instance of the tragedy of the comments where everybody has an incentive to follow us at the end of the day everybody is worse off because we all try to maximize their own profit and then the price of Anarchy can be quite loud between a world where the air is very clean and the world where the air is very polluted is the the fishing Village example yes yeah and so this President is really it came up I guess starting end of the 90s when people were thinking about the internet and congestion specifically on being pregnant so trying to understand you know I understand Sheen some bytes of data he wants to send to someone else there's this big network of bags we don't have time to compute the optimal routing of all these types through the network so we have to make simplifications we have to be supportivistic and maybe a bit greedy I I want to send it as fast as possible to you specifically and then we are going to get into situations where the network is not as optimized as it could be if there was this I think crystals permanent recorded micromanager who is optimizing the internet and so yeah then we're getting these bad steps and this is really the the price of uncoordination like how much we lose to achieve this map of payoff should I notice yes usually okay so when I was doing my PhD physics I was trying to understand how exactly we can get back to the Utopia and I was thinking of it this way which is that on the one hand we have efficiency and on the other hand we have decentralization we can be very efficient if we have a dictator yet Singapore in this case we're here everything is perfect everybody's needs are maximized people are presented from achieving better health for themselves or their individual Readiness but society as a whole is feeling better philosophers yes and on this end if we let everybody decide for themselves and make their own decisions they are really naturally going to decrease the efficiency of the system right if it's let's say language if we're talking like a different language to one another the body can really understand there's no one who is there saying no no you should all be using English so that we can talk because like the most efficient language for myself is gonna be optimized from my own personal experience and everybody's experience is different than you know if we go for energy level of course people cannot speak different languages and that inhibits this coordination correct and so it is hopeless right like we do we only have a choice between Lui kettles or the Anarchy in the world no as we get as a designer what we really want is to still achieve efficiency while being somewhat decentralized so we want to move in that direction yes what I mean here is that well to some extent there's a bit of centralization because we bind ourselves to follow what a mechanism tells us to do but the mechanism is also able to recover be efficient allocation of uh yeah of the outcome of the game for all the players yeah so uh and this graph kind of reminds me like efficiency has defined by the total welfare achievable which is you know you know you're serious hearing model would be the sufficient paralysis utilities um and the decentralization I think is kind of another way of saying credibility of mechanism right so uh if we think about it what's decentralization or these things being is that uh we are why we don't want another things now because you know anything is benevolence that's kind of better than if someone can do whatever he wants uh he or he wants and that is not restricted by Constitution or whatever you know a set of mechanisms yeah so it feels like there is some fundamental uncertainty that human beings are not possible to gouge in reality right you don't know if in the future that the king is gonna you know turn that or something that these things are simply unpredictable and because of this on an inability to predict fundamental fundamental uncertainty we try to embed this worry into our mechanism which is that we model the fundamental uncertainty as a form of strategic uncertainty right we say that oh we know that the Monarch you know he let's take the worst possible case we assume that the Monarch or you know the dictator is rational and it can have a well-defined strategy space and within English Spanish space he you know he can choose whatever strategic once denotatively by his own rationality and then this transforms the fundamentals uncertainty which is like the formulas you know a nice playing game that we can start to reason about as many things like the power of blockchain I've got things about private creditability and programmability yes and in this price of Anarchy framework we never really consider the incentives of the Mona we just assume that there foreign we think about replacing centralized institutions that pretend or sometimes advice uh embodies so it would be so much better if instead we we had ways of yeah ensuring that the Monarch doesn't act against Federal interests or abuses the position by extorting uh the price from people yeah yeah exactly and that's like what's interesting also here is like people like even you even if you're in a monarch model you will have different beliefs right we have like uh common knowledges each people have data different life or a different belief and then even though it's credible even though if if you're indeed valuable energy we're seeing if you are not critical then they will still act in an energy way into their own interests so like uh instead of alignments and this you know probabilities even only in supports a very important part and by crypto you know we all know that it is secured by uh you know you know at least what ethereum is doing in crypto and it is to be ensuring the existence of a decentralized in our party and also if enough this interesting part is is interesting meaning that they have a high pollution fast if you know do you think this part is called this commitment for you then you know they can't you have less strategic uncertainty here right right yes yeah yeah and something else maybe that needs to be said is very often to achieve this optimal outcome with the mechanisms the players have to do payments to one and in particular they have to do payments to the mechanism which then decides to allocate things properly and so having the ability to believe in the mechanism and to to get this credibility of the commitment of the mechanism also maybe allows you to ensure that these payments to the mechanism they can be further redistributed or they can be used in socially beneficial uh ways yeah the public goods funding abroads public goods is good yeah um so then we know we want to include this mechanism and uh you know what are some of the examples in crypto that you know we have actually enabled this to this to happen you know we'll talk about how this is the biggest value for decision does Bitcoin use income you know having people pre-commit to a schedule of releasing tokens or anything yeah I think I think the ability to commit to some kind of emission schedule I will schedule the audition process because if everybody really have a schedule that we know that has the function that we take as an input the economic activity of the trade and output the issuance and the wealth of the currency I think this is very powerful because it means that yeah everybody has variants tied to this and it provides some sort of meeting point for people to to make their decision based on that on that mechanism so at least you fix one part of the mechanism and that lets people be more afraid to do what they want something to them knowledge that any disconline yes yeah it has common knowledge that Bitcoins schedule is you know has the much higher probability in the traditional system that we use since okay so becoming and ethereal and all kinds of tokens um I think another example might be that we see that people have attention right your attention is a resource we see that happens in more than they you know Facebook Twitter Tick Tock that's the big operation patients have your resource which is your attentions your attention generated some revenue and maybe you don't want this generally Revenue to be easily generated but then you can only choose to oh I allow you to use my data or I don't allow you to use my data so it's like a binary situation that we exactly see here right you have the Monarch or you have an anarchy situation you don't have the you know a credible General commencement that people can do um this is also something I think is interesting for crypto tweaks for more um with other examples such as privacy right like privacy apps is and as we talk about kind of an overall over approximation in our seeking of uh you know credibility versus efficiency I think uh for example Mario or others coins are a practical commitments such that we know the action space the fundamental certainty or the Strategic uncertainty of the month is reduce yes yes yeah yeah these are all great examples I'm gonna want to provide it's very exciting so let's go into the theory land right let's do it let's do it let's do the real and this is gonna get more mathematical let's talk about that uh talk about the simplest example for prisoners yes yeah I hope everybody has heard about it okay so imagine two prisoners Alice and top okay so Alice and Bob uh they worked hard by a place and then they can either both remain silent or they can you know uh tell the you know your rat uh write the other person out yes depend on one another yeah so suppose this is a payoff Matrix of the or you know here is being silent and this is being a red history of the events betrayed okay so we know that if they both betray then the payoff is going to be the original payoff right when they each kind of get sentence or whatever punished based on based on the behavior and if they both be silent then at least doesn't know their you know they actually communicate anything so that suppose it's two two and then if one betrays the other in silence it's going to be um yeah supposedly three zero and zero three right and then we can verify that this is the uh equilibrium state for everybody yeah because it at least decides to be silent instead of featuring which it gets zero and say we both decides to be silent instead of betraying both gets zero and so that's very quickly yes um okay so that uh knowing that this is the worst outcome possible is the social welfare of uh 2. let's say it's like two okay so then how can we improve it suppose now we have this amazing piece of technology you know crypto let's draw it as a box suppose that before the two prisoners go to prison they actually signal to each other they they they you they knowing that there exists the same you know this box and then they can commit to coming to their actions in the future then uh it is possible for Alex to say oh if Bob remains to be uh if Bob permits to being silent and uh that then I commit to be inside it and if power commits to be betrayed or you know and otherwise or does not commit at all then I commute to Detroit right so you can kind of see that we can write this as a smart contract yeah so if another above coming to you uh actually silence Hip-Hop come into silence [Music] now I come into silence uh okay so this should be how else in any other cases I even need to betrayed okay so then publishing this case of a smart contract uh makes the uh makes about seeing this function and Bob knows that the only rational move between uh to commit to silence uh so but decision tree actually looks like so you you can verify so Alice has two options whether to do a commitment or not do a commitments if Ali is not the commitment then you know both parties know it's gonna end up as one one as the original payoff if Alice does the commitment and then now we transfer the move to about right so then Bob has a bob can choose to either commit to answer this contract or not coming to access contract so Bob knows if thought does not commit so this is the else scenario that is coming to the trade so knowing that is going to betrayed about family issues between zero and one Health so he's gonna choose one so we know that it doesn't commit the list is 101 if you have to commit then knowing that uh it has chose to be uh to and he also Community to uh to be in silent so that they end up S2 through so then like uh you you start tracing we know that this is the dominant strategy for those players to play right on um so then you know here if this sounds almost to be too good to be true right yeah what are some of the repeat uh pitfalls you see right it's almost as if Alice isn't being maximally rational yes I mean at least first what gives you the right to be the first player in making the decision here yes Alex is a monarch yeah and so at least could say I want a commitment from God but on top of this I want a payment from both either extra period he can get I want to get it for myself exactly so it's uh so it's gonna do nothing yeah so it's gonna be if Bob come into being silent and and transfer me let's say one dollars like one payoff after the game then I'm coming to being silent or else I commit to be trade so now if we go into the decision tree again this is not gonna change and uh so that's the address commits to this and the Bob knows that if it does not commit this is one one if this is created as an if Bob app should commit then uh Bob is first gonna give Alex uh Alice uh lesson here minus one right so foreign well yeah useless in the sense but also there is greater social welfare yes Society it's just that Alice is able to capture all of it um yeah actually we can always argue that because it is better to have the value extractive rather than give the value to the you know uh coordination yeah to the uncle election the police exactly okay um so they're not suppose we all know that prefer is permissionless it has always been the case so it's not just that Alice can publish a smart contract but can also make this quite more commitments right so then we know that uh during the payoff is only gonna be one three or three one right so those are the feasible payoffs and in fact we can see that the solution space seems to got larger uh from this or foreign yes so in repeated games we allow players to not only play this game once but to play it over time and when you play it all your time so when you have game theories what you do is you specify the strategies that the agents are taking if you play the game one time I only need to specify one strategy for YouTube to play but if I play over time I can specify a strategy that eventually evolves as time goes on it's one sense my strategy when I feel a lot of time can be the minute seeing plays betrayed I betray until the end of time so we call that the green trigger like it only needs to be one failure of Gene's behavior and I will just do the worst impossible from the both of us so basically suicide one another yeah into the bad day off forever that means that for you it's never rational to play video you want to constantly play being silent because otherwise I will take the version and we both betrayed it kind of as if it is you know common knowledge that one of the players committee can have a credible commitment committed to that in the refugee game setting I have this retaliation strategy correct yes and so to understand the space of the fields that we can achieve with these grateful commitments we use what is called the fourth theorem which is a description of the feasible space so I can write folks yeah yes very Theory so the reason is called folk is not someone whose name 4K it's just that everybody knew that this was true and the proof is not so complicated and so yeah it was just never Rewritten the best as something I don't remember the photo hearing yeah maybe maybe actions so okay so to visualize what the folks here at Texas we're going to plot the payoffs of the players on a two-dimensional axis so first we have the back layer which is here one one then we have the good pair which is here two two and then we have these other two pairs which happen when players play asymmetrical actions so in one case at least has a pair for 3 and 12 has zero in the other case both as a paper Okay so what is actually everybody in that space of the field we are going to draw what sport is the convex health which is all the layers that we can achieve from randomizing actions in this thing so I could say when she plays betray I'd get Beatrice for five rounds and then I revert to play silence and by mixing up the proportions of being silent or betraying we can move around with space and Achieve any payoff let's continue anything this can't let this shape is anything in that shaded region is possible but yeah there is something that we call individual rationality which is that we never we can always do one right together can always be bad to someone and so one is what we call our individually rational field and so we know that Alice is never going to pick a point which is in that part of the of the hell and Bob is never going to pick a point which is in that part of the time and so really the space of equilibrium achievable equilibrium is what they now shaded in Grid and what you notice is this point which is the socially optimal outcome is part of a green shaded region and so all of these layouts here before what we call the barrel Frontier which is that anytime we move on this Frontier one of the player gets felt maybe another player gets a bit destructive but one of the repair gets hurt and it's true from linear programming that the maximum socially um social welfare is achieved as one of the governors which is yeah here uh it will make sense and we can see that we actually achieve uh you know a much larger region of chaos which is very restricted better yes in the one shot game we are prisoners of the Dilemma it makes up and we are stuck here but in the repeated game we can break out about prison and be always a cooperative and what's interesting is that we can kind of see a striking correspondence between this uh traditionally traditional way of Gamecock games you will think of improving social welfare with the actual uh you know what we can see over here right in the crime of living world in the world crypto by the visibility of having agents to do you know those private commitments which is candy from this one one payoff to actually you know different points of the Fall which is I guess here and here it okay um so then it is almost we talked about the folks here for credible opinions and in fact it is indeed proven that we can explore a much larger set of tales and that's stripping then the social here's one question for you and then these two videos that you said will achievable with your commitment device there are no thoughts about convex help right yeah like quantically allows you one three is here okay that's three point and this is one free so how do we get here right yeah yeah then that's a great massive like what's the power that crypto or credible Canadian devices has Beyond you know a related against why is it even better than all of the previous Technologies is it even better because people can extract one another let's see uh double at two sides of the car and you have collusion and you have coordination um that's uh overall I think the set of payouts is like kind of the value add of the enforcement technology in you know in auditory Expressions um but then we still have this like unfair problem over here which is something we kind of need to talk about right because either in in here it's like about in the Monarch and here is status in the Monarch we kind of needs to address this so for a reason about this in an easier way let's just say that um abstract the person who is among up or abstract always the person who can be first in the game as an agency that's called yes like Alice we have thought and then we have the person who goes first so then now we can kind of formulate this in a cocktail games series right so uh you know we know that in completely again there is a Worth or a value of Coalition which means that the payoffs that the Coalition could achieve by you know the agency in the Coalition so in this sense the payoff of only the only artists playing this game should be why right so if Alice face it Faces by itself and without having to coordinates yeah because of them coordination so this is same for about four one and then the person since there is no coordination happening the person who got this there's no pressing concern for us so this can be zero right okay so then now let's get in into the interesting part so suppose is Alice and Bob somehow from circulation right they formulation there are quality and then we know the payoff of this correlation is going to be four right so it's one three three one or two two payoff so that if one of them produce with also in this as uh coordinates with the person who goes first so in this sense if you have AC units yes yes using smart contract or you know vertical integration meaning that Alice without the experience crypto as it's already divided so in this case uh AC means that uh so the words of this correlation should be three right because that is already a repeat last week so this is going to be the same for about and finally the brand Collision if ABC forms a grant Coalition the milk health is still going to be four because there is only four value okay so we can see that so we can see okay so those are our collection words how what's the actual visible payoff so we know that in coffee games there is this node and found the four um so the core solution of a quality again means that it is a set of 12 schedules to each player so this is like suppose it's like payment to uh and into a this is mn2b this is payment to C so it means that the sum of all of this payments equals to the uh to the Coalition Force so in this case equals to four and we also require that no sub Coalition could profitably deviate from this coordination right so for example if we have a b c as the uh this as the brand Collision then we see that this is not stable right because AC could profit to the dbh and then a we will get one and this is not yeah exactly a abstract so so what what's the exactly our structure that is feasible with you know I'll see the calculation but we can see that the feasible one is one one two meaning that uh Alice and Bob get exactly what they would have thought if they did not use crypto or private Limited at all and you know no small contract reason is as if and then uh foresee they you know as an abstracted coordinator or not or validator in this case gets a pair of two and this can you give an example with front running no Arbitrage definitely so what's interesting is that this is a theoretical result right we started only using those uh Fitness dilemma and the formulation of causing cancer and we see this is the only things about the house and in reality this is kind of core manifest itself right the theoretical results uh unsurprisingly manifests itself so in reality importantly we have a front-winning situation which is set and it proposes a payoff schedule of three one right so Alice Alice and Bob are both searches yes yes so that is get the tail for three buckets of health of one and then um this is what happens if thought commits to come is being silent as an eyes welcome YouTube in science if else and Alice comments to be trained right so this is uh this is what we originally talk about but then we know that the commitment is critical only if it is landing on chain right the smart contract have to be published your bundle has to be published yes okay so then we also know that we can clearly see so if you realize when we see this on Focus as you know yeah we're both trying to learn the same bundle and what we know now from practice of blockchains is that the only way for the danger to be landed is we have to give away our whole payments yeah we can see your quality ninja if there is a Common Language scenario yes so in this sense it since the game structure is common knowledge things guarantee that there's common values that everybody wants and then we end up see so you run it is kind of uh manifesting itself in the sense of account by stock transfer payments right as most of uh you know following Services too yes okay so we kind of see we previously talked about the price of the energy example sometimes of energy equals to the best welfare state which is four minus equivalent methods and the state right so two so we know that price of energy equals 2 and it is a you know in the correlation example we see uh surprising when we have a pair of one one two so then like uh was recording is your guess is also equals to so does does this mean that price of Anarchy always good is always going to be internalized by the coordinator right so I think this is Orange is the only interesting factor and in fact we can indeed generalize this into you know and figure scenario um which I think is particularly interesting and uh the only one uh what about blood block space Futures I think yeah yeah um because I I think like having thinking about uh how different how uh probabilities in different slots uh coordinates is an interesting problem and we know that uh we have this private boxing events and then in reality we see that we have different layers and I suppose they are like four players and defense thoughts okay so we're in a model where there's a bonded set of validators and they are sampled and for each slot there's one person who is chosen to produce the blood of that specific slot okay okay so we're gonna try this as four players and they all play again and then now let's Suppose there are some payouts that if they can express such that the worst of the Collision uh is gonna equals to the size of the pollution um squared so let's show the more personal are in the correlation the more chaos that they can collectively extract yeah yeah the sum is greater than yes the whole is better yeah so so so so this is like the stock model super modularity yeah yeah so like uh the words of a b is larger larger or equal to the words of a across the Waters of PewDiePie yeah okay so um okay so suppose all those players they can they coordinate using critical committing devices using credible transition less credible connection device then what is the equivalent payoff that's a good question what is it what is it 16. oh so so we know that the words of the grand commission 16 but we also know we have this price of Anarchy situation and they can drop from each other to publish a smart contracts so I think a a good way to a good starting experience to go through is suppose your you know player one the event Publishers saying oh if because we know the maximum fee of those three players can get is nine of that so yeah okay so it seems that the lower bound of the tax the coordinates are taxed should at least be 16 minus right okay so this is like uh okay so this is our latest but we also know that it is also common knowledge meaning that a one does it 206 strings pronounce it that if two two three fours themselves tries to form a correlation and extract is 90 else then they are also going to run into a smaller situation of the prisoners you know the origin of four player takes right so yeah in doing those uh two contaminations by contract and then extract nine and minus plus two other minus four equals five okay so two can publish and then say Oh I want five and then those two layers whereas an even smaller situation so we know there's a recursive case here which we can model nicely we say that it is dominant strategy for every dominant being like it is better for your activities in any situation in any situation and it is something strategy for other player to publish a smart contract or private populations saying that oh if you they are all the other players come into cooperate with me achieve the maximum welfare states so in this sense we say that there is uh the welfare Suppose there are two collisions right so um Collision a and collision B are from simple so they uh the welfare of uh AP test correlation this is the maximum survival of State minus the welfare of P so suppose the words that correlation a can due to Collision B is by creating the brand collisions so then this is uh you give this is the total of the off this is what you would have got if you know IE storage this is what a can demand of B yeah or benefit of having a in your position yeah exactly exactly so this is original but and then like suppose that they are extorting so they also need to uh is it yeah they also need to subtract their own original skills right so it's like the pure gain from extortion however we can see kind of here is this in a situation right this is this does not consider the common knowledge of the use of a traditional ascribable from different devices so what this means is how many kinds of energy according into the tax situation is that there is some externality to correlations formation right so I think this is something not captured at all International probably against Theory and something we see now because we have this piece of technology Constructor so then like what you're already getting and you can actually for the externality of the formation of the Collision B like uh suppose this is your correlation uh you know the extortion profits of correlation a extracting pollution B so then like you have always an example with these players maybe let's say Okay a is yeah so this is one two this is three four so then once you can collectively uh collectively achieve like four if we assume there's no externality first three four can achieve four because I externality but in reality if there is some externality and uh three four you know you can see this is same as the prisoners dilemma situation right so for have a externality of so that here we have like Kappa which we use to you know the uh so um foreign [Music] strategy and then this once we calculate this it's equals to the price of energy scenario assuming there's no other cost other than this extortion cost in the externality of collision formation right and then the the proof is kind of simple and we see that this is going to reduce to some cases of the welfare stage and then if we actually unpack those three Tails together we see that this is uh this with a welfare of a b as a collision is basically the welfare if a n the welfare if a and b are working together for uh under the path for a plus the welfare can be working together for d right okay so then we make this term into this term as a minus the wave probability together we have a together so this is about the video and then working together I only work together when I see this is this term equals to summation of the externality that is cos into B and B is cos into a and since in this situation the pair function is super modular we know that each agent has a positive externality to each other in college presentation and there's some weapons begin so then we see that you know this reverses situation you know forms into some cases so then we know that in the end you know the ground collisions Kappa the explosion payoff is going to be equal to 57 is the summation of all of the agents externality to each other yeah maybe another way to think about it if you are a bit more messy is the distribution rule when you don't have interaction between the terms you look to read like the sum of everything minus version of the partial terms and that's it right so yeah sets which are not they are in their uh which is the case sections or if you have positive externalities of a supermodularity from people being in other one's condition then it's exciting so they won't be zero and you have to account for wisdom otherwise your double Accounting in a sense right yeah figure it out if you had that classic method for example yes um yeah so so we can see that in general cases um Kappa equals price of Anarchy what's more interesting is that in that we don't really see people paying all of the attacks to the credits it's not the case that in yeah not the case that in any scenario that is so uh it what is it in our game the price oh in this game yes okay so the price of energy will be if everybody will play for themselves and one two three four okay president's house so we know the value of you know one equals one is for others so the summations of the workers can be equals to four I and then the back uh the best uh the best possible WordPress date is going to be 16. so inside 4 minus 16 which is uh means that zero maximum that anybody is going to extract is uh tough yeah so every time there is a coalition we wanted to visual smart contract that says they external to the rest of the collision and then we extract these extracting if they get from the Collision but since everybody is doing that we only stable thing is that yes or you suppose that if they actually publish the collusion coordination smart contracts in their own spots right because you know uh so much what's your the example you are using is that uh suppose so suppose that they all leave our mechanism and so this is a credible device uh platform and then there's like un Prime another one so n Prime is someone to extract that much faster than like they have no like all the people on and has no incentive to use I'm trying because they're already the value impression only have self-published so uh if that's actually the case in the field it's gonna be uh something a bit different right it's gonna be one publishes a smart contract knowing that it can manipulate its own ordering so no one is able to extrude 16 minus nine and then uh for later two italics for 9 minus four right and then we request so there are so the final day of schedule is going to be seven five three one right and then we can check this sums to the next payoff yeah um so this kind of seems there are two situations right what's a better name for Tata that's a better name for Kappa something that looks like an externality something that is uh Crossing one another exactly um okay maybe or do you want Not Duplicate them yeah we want uh added in them we know that this almost feels like uh if you chose a pair of Matrix we know that if they can both to choose to France from or like not franzra so that we know that if they both not from from me which means that they don't use the platform the pattern does not exist one-on-one so this is one one and then this is like something like uh three one or one three so to whom does the value flow from the cell Trails trying to get the atturgency and that their service The Miner yeah extractable learning yes yeah whoever is mediator because like we originally wanted this thing to use for coordination coordination it's mediation mediator is trying to work all makes sense that suddenly it becomes longer but wave internalizes all of the things so this is the dominant strategy it's a wrapped president dilemma you know almost met recurs this all the way up so we see that this is one form of family that erodes uh the fundamental value of crypto we are unable to unlock any of his potential which is that oh so what can we do what can we do so this means that uh so so first we know that I need at least equals to the price of energy situation so this is only even if we only consider every Asian expression and they all use the permission as coordination device so um okay so this is that we know that if we solve them even meaning that we really distribute the movie or like dividing a better mechanism for its extraction we see that we actually actually achieve the optimal complex situation right yeah wait it's going uh but uh so so later in this series we will talk about that much much more and together with this real world applications uh of the sellers and uh some real complications right we see that in it is not necessarily the case that this is only used for coordination and there's no externality extra Insanity aside from the Amiri externality to correlations only maybe you devise a bad mechanism so in essence you have like a better method in the M Prime but this m is really what you want so all of the agents are using hand Prime to approximate and so then there is some extra personality over here right so this is the case we see that in most Fair ordering horses you know okay privacy Solutions such as uh threshold seriously I guess yeah so so this is the product we don't want um uh yeah so uh many problems before in fact I want to kind of conclude this episode using a 9th amount of similar very highly similar to the one by the way I was talking about um yeah um so you have the two axis efficiency and credibility right so now the X's are flipped yes yeah I flipped it a little bit let's use a green light to draw okay so we know that what's a mechanism the mechanism that achieves greatest efficiency no credibility it is a monarch situation and then this maximum credibility and zero efficiency is the Anarchy scenario right this is similar to what if everybody has the commitment and then you order their commitments randomly or like just by some hobby for the other um okay so then those two states are bad and then this is the safe we want right let's say with maximum credibility and then also maximum meditation scene so now with the formulation of nav and carotid again Theory we see that we are kind of actually you know give a quantitative model to the graph that you're working with right so we see that we can Define credibility as the amount of Mev that the quantity extraordinate right we see that uh this equals to the cutter uh the extraction amount by the monitor to the rest of the equation let's say the current position is T so it's like yes yes exactly so then we say that oh this is how we quantify credibility and the efficiency is of course the summation of the utility right okay um so then we say that we also know that Kappa maximally could equal to the efficiency right yes yeah if I'm uh you know seller of log space I am a controller of whatever blockchain and I you know I say from this block onward I do not accept accept any transactions so then you know I already have zero Health income tax links for those little better so we see that this line represents the social welfare minus minus so we know that this is the space of feasible mechanisms yeah okay um so today we are kind of uh you know if we have maximum Target example and then people play in repeat games you can have at least some credibility so it might I don't know stay somewhere at some point like this right and then um this is where we want to move forward and specifically you can use many Technologies for example if you had opaque privacy you're gonna you know if you overshoot you're gonna go here this is what many of the existing Solutions in the space we're looking at which is sound Baltimore right closer to there so then uh for example you add expressivity your url agency Express manage your strategies about strategies and hours then you move of efficiency you move yes and you'll move to here and then maybe through instructional efficiency for example in the private part example we see that the technology of people able to record information in a you know whatever database allows us to use credit credit cards credit rather than money right so then that's an example of the increase in efficiency actually leads to an increase of credibility right so then there are also exist technologies that allows you to and to do this so then what we need do is find the shortest path the compositional factors that allowance and single here Internet only always moving that direction and we have to go somewhere yes yes like sometimes there are the object is not obviously there is this yeah yeah right um [Music]
