so let's get started hello everyone i'm alex i'm part of flashbots researcher at flashbots i want to talk about mev uh it's growth on ethereum i never changed in 2021. i want to focus in particular on the chains mentioned here so ethereum bsc avalanche and polygon the reason for that is purely because this is the chains i was lucky to get data for there would definitely have a chains where maybe exists and so this is not to say that these chains in particular have a lot of mav and others don't but this is just the chains that we're gonna look at for 2021. and let me put a timer all right sweet so first before we kind of dive deep into it i'm sorry this has been you know probably hammered on you a few times but it's definitely important to think about what's mev right in particular what's relevant to this presentation and what i want to address is uh this debate that has been going on a while back on twitter on uh whether arab is mev right so there were a few a few posts about it a few tweets about it uh and people kind of debating on both sides with their arms around me going on this is this is crucial for the rest of the presentation that's why i kind of want to talk about that so really what's what's muv right um mev is maximal extractable value this is what the three letters m and ev stand for so an informal definition so i'm looking for my mouse uh an informal definition of that um is the one that's stated below mev is the total value that can be extracted from the ordering censorship or insertion of transactions within a block being created so this is kind of a little abstract um and so um another way of looking at this is that mev is quantifying an incentive so the the incentive we're quantifying is the incentive for someone to influence the order right so when we're talking about extractable value we're talking about the value that one can extract from influencing the ordering and so what mev represents what the val what this value really is it represents the incentive that one has from influencing the ordering so going back to whether arbitrage trades or mev um well you know looking at it from that lens i believe yes they are and i would make that claim for all the networks uh that were mentioned at the beginning of this presentation um so yes i think they are they are mev uh because arbitrage trades are finite um they're capacity constrained and so when several people go after the same opportunity there is um value relative to the ordering that actually goes through for these trades whoever goes first actually makes the opportunity assuming that they take it off and so there is an incentive to influence the ordering and so what we're trying to quantify with this is simply the incentive the financial inception that one would have to influence the order all right now that we've fixed this let's go back to our mev in 2021 on these chains all right let's look at some numbers but are you welcome to argue this definition i'm happy to talk about this more of course um so in 2021 at least 500 million uh dollars worth of media was extracted on ethereum bsc avalanche and polygon thanks to the great people who gave resources here below and i'm going to talk about this more so first i'm going to address something where we do have a dashboard that we released a while ago called maybe explorer and in there there's a bigger number than this the reason for that is that there are many misclassifications when we released uh the the dashboard and the code base behind it and we've been working very hard in particular the team mentioned here the data team and the team working on rev inspect pi has been working very hard at correcting those so this is a much more accurate figure that encompasses correcting a lot of these misclassifications so to add even more disclaimers to this 500 million dollars number this is incomplete so it is very much a lower bound that's why you have at least in front of it so liquidations if not be counted in on all these networks and some time ranges uh for some of these numbers here on for example avalanche and bsc only partly for the whole year so it is really a lower bound um and the methodologies to quantify this are also slightly different i'm going to talk about that a little more finally it's not homogeneous in the sense where 100 million worth of mev extracted on one chain might represent something different than another chain in terms of who this incentive is for and why and that's also important all of that being said this is still 500 million dollars worth of value that has been extracted from these networks in 2021 and that people have made as real money um so to to kind of uh hammer that point of the lower bound we talked about extractable value a little bit earlier right and this is extracted value so this is a good way to kind of see this extracted value is is this concentric circle extractable value is all the value that could have been extracted and the maximal extractable value is really this boundary here that's really what this is i mean it's all inside as well but it's all of this right and so where we are when we're talking about that in this presentation is really like this smaller circle this lower bound of something that is bigger and that doesn't include everything but it's still a representative amount and that's why i wanted to bring it here and so another way to state this term here at least 500 million worth of mvp was extracted is this um so put another way in 2021 the incentive for someone to reorder censor or insert transactions in blocks produced on ethereum bsc avalanche polygon was at least 500 million dollars um which is cool to think about and we're going to kind of get into why it's cool more but first let's get into a split uh in particular we're looking at a split enough of the whole year because again there's some numbers that we don't have but we're looking at a split from august 1st to december 3rd 2021. um so the split that we have here is the following um we have bsc that about fourteen percent polygon that's about four point five percent avalanche seven point seven percent and ethereum still the lion's share uh seven seventy three point five percent for these five months right but what's really striking here is that there is a non-trivial share of this uh pie chart or donut doughnut chart um that is not ethereum so although mev has traditionally been thought as a concept that is very substantial in ethereum this clearly shows that maybe extraction is happening in other places as well um and that's very interesting and that's that's that's what i want to focus a little bit more on um so let's dive into that more and let's dive into why right like why uh are these things here why have they been growing maybe as well all right so there are two main reasons i want to talk about in this presentation um the first one is the growth of decentralized finance right and i'm going to use tvl total value locked as a proxy for growth don't kill me for it uh i know it's a flawed metric and i know there's a lot of other things we can look at exchange volumes etcetera but it is a convenient one and i still think it's very representative again open to arguing this point so this is the tbl of ethereum by uh defy lama um which is stands at about 150 billion and this is from uh the great team uh building mev inspect pi uh flashbots the cumulative extracted mev not only 2021 there's before but it goes up to about like 400 and something million uh and it starts here at around about like 36 million um and so this this doesn't tell us much right now but this is just um the tvl of ethereum and extracted mvp there now let's look at uh polygon this is polygon's tvl it is in usd we can look at it in matic but it looks very similar um and so it's 5.17 billion but what i want us to particularly pay attention to is the fact that really the tbl kind of started picking up may onwards right so now if you look at the the extraction numbers on polygon in particular we're looking at the numbers provided by marlin uh not unsurprisingly we can see that i mean the extraction kind of started happening between may and june right so it's it's pretty obvious to look at these two things but it does uh give us a clue for why there would be more mvv extraction activity uh somewhere else than ethereum right because there's tvl and tvl implies financial activity financial activity implies the existence of inefficiencies and opportunities that are capacity uh capacity constrained sorry finite like arbitrages um so now let's look at another chain that we talked about right avalanche avalanches 1089 billion again the number of matters a little bit less in this context it is more about looking at where their tvl picked up so here we can see you know mid to late august their tvl picked up what happened then they launched their yield farming program which i don't remember the name of but that was august 18th right now let's look at numbers given by the current people at parsec in particular wills thank you will uh of quantifying atomic arbs on avalanche um and we can see it's kind of dead in august so the numbers it starts here starts at first of august 2021 we can see how there isn't much happening and then starting pretty much september or mid-august this is where we are this is first of august things really picked up so this really coincides with the yield farming program that was started on august 18th by avalanche and again it coincides with a large increase in their total value lot again uh we can see a pattern there where there is more financial activity in other places a hand in hand with that comes me the extraction activity so again doing a similar thing looking at bsc the the tbl here is a little bit more skewed so i did look at it it'd be in in in bnb directly so you can see this this in usd it implies you know the price rise of bnb which we don't necessarily want uh to look at and so here we can see actually the tvl grew before right but really it most of its growth happened around may onwards i would say uh looking at this and so looking now at data from eigenfire who were very very kind in providing this data and i invite you to check them out again this starts from the first of june because they did not have data before that but you can see basically a lot of energy extraction from there so this is less representative of the point i'm trying to make but i think it's still very interesting data so this is reason number one reason number one is the growth of the centralized finance on other chains inevitably means there exists inefficiencies in these places which then in turn means that there is mev to to extract there now the second reason is that the mev game on ethereum became harder to play um and luke is going to give an awesome presentation after my presentation on this so i won't go into any numbers because i would leave it to his presentation but i'm i'm going to give some anecdotal evidence uh they were provided by by robert thank you robert uh for providing those um and so what do i mean by the mvp game is harder play right what i mean is that uh being a searcher being an mbv search on ethereum became more competitive so these are for example extracts of tweets where any of these searchers are talking about optimizing their code even more by writing an evm assembly instead of writing in solidity so that they can like optimize their gas efficiency more and so that they can win the auction by doing so um and you can see you know again this is anecdotal evidence lucas is going to have much more concrete data but you can see how these dates kind of match up with the dates that we were looking at as well right and so um another example of for example like the mev game becoming more competitive on ethereum is pushing the limits of energy extraction and having orbs that are much longer for example which implies like more sophisticated models and also more compute that is more like latency sensitive um and another thing again by any sensei and again july around the time that we looked at these other chains like gaining a lot of tdl and imev extraction happening there more frequently um this is another kind of optimization technique and things there that i believe luke will talk about so we have two reasons right the first one is really that uh tvl grew in other places and so obviously they're the existence of inefficiencies there but the second thing is that uh mev extraction on ethereum became so competitive that a lot of searchers preferred to go to greener pastures right and they migrated from ethereum or ethereum only to other places where they still have an edge and where they don't need to compete with people that optimize their software a lot that i think is a very interesting movement of developers and of traders right and so what do i want you to take away from this very short presentation a few things um the first one is that 2021 is the year movie extraction on ethereum not only grew um clearly there was a lot of energy extraction and ethereum is still like 73 of it for the year uh at least for the last five months of 2021 but also became competitive and that i think is is a very interesting fact to to reason about and because of this fact right and combined with the d5 growth on over places this has led searchers any researchers to much greener pastures um and so why this is interesting in my opinion at least is because we can now compare the activity the enemy activity and the negative externalities that might come from it on these different networks and so instead of purely looking at mev extraction on ethereum only we can now look at it on polygon on bsc on avalanche and i'll never change that weren't mentioned in this presentation like solana like terra that have you know 10 or 15 billion tvl as well and surely have inefficiencies in their systems as well and so this is what the next presentations are going to be about as well they're going to um so i'm i'm i don't necessarily want to give away the topics of these presentations but this is why i think this is interesting the second thing that i think why it's interesting is i think it makes designing protocols with mev or adversarial behavior assumptions in mind a lot more relevant than it once was so um a lot of assumptions that a protocol designer would make in the past uh where it would be more like tailline cases now would happen much more frequently because i think it is more likely to assume the presence of med searchers that are economically rational actors trying to influence the ordering on these networks um so this was like a very very quick overview of mev on some chains in 2021 and the message that i really want to communicate is the one that i kind of just described in this takeaway right and and the other presentations will kind of continue building on that message but so what's next for 2022 well clearly if you all believe in the message put forward so far as that enemy extraction is probably coming to a chain near you um and that this movement and this movement of searcher is actually going to ever change it's probably not going to stop and so we should think about the implications of that all right i think i'm says 15 minutes here i'm within time kind of so thank you for listening i hope they gave you some food for fall i am happy to talk about any of this more so please talk about this on the flash boss discord maybe your research channel otherwise please email me or dm me on twitter i also want to shout out to all these people that provided data on short notice so most of the data here was provided by by others uh so par second will it parsec eigenfire modern protocol who uh took the code at mevinspec pi and forked it to run it on polygon and made some changes to it uh and the awesome evan spike mev-inspect pie team um luke who is part of that team speaking in the next conversation in the next presentation um all right that's it thank you very much i'll leave it now to luke luke if you want to share your screen we should be able to do that okay one second let's see it's going
