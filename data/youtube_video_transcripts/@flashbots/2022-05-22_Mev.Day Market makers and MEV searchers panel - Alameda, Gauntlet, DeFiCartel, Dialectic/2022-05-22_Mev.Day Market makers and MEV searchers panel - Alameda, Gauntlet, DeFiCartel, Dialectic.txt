[Music] how long do we make sure i don't overrun right yeah this is a dark side as well this is supposed to be more dystopian all right we have we have about 30 minutes all right hello everyone um this is the searchers and market makers panel uh i hope you're very excited about it um we have a few exciting speakers with us they represent like a wide range um of searchers i would say from the more traditional side of searchers and traders to the more crypto native so i'll ask them to introduce themselves briefly um and then we'll get started with some questions this is only 30 minutes so we'll we'll pace it well and try to go over several topics that are hopefully interesting could nathan mike be turned off this is working all right my name is nathan i run a mev firm and we operate on a number of blockchains nice uh i'm dean i am the co-founder of a fund called dialectic and internally we also run a prop shop that focuses mainly on mev hey guys i'm jhl and i'm formerly from alameda research hey i'm drune um i found a gauntlet and also used to be in trading all right um i'll expand briefly on what i meant by the by the background here so tyrone used to be at a more like traditional quan firm jay alameda is kind of this this middle ground where they trade on more like centralized exchanges or they you know used to be at omeda traded on centralized exchanges and then dean and nathan are like fully crypto native um maybe do some stuff on centralized exchanges but the the point is we have like this wide spectrum um great all right first thing i'd like to talk about um is whether you have any limits as to what your activities are i mean by this ethical limits as well as like what you decide you don't want to do and how you how you think about these things also the side question how do you think about your competition that might not have the same limit as you and how you how you think about that if anyone wants to take the question you don't all have to answer um nathan maybe or dean yeah i guess my philosophy is just not to engage in any kind of extraction which is hurting the user experience of the blockchain after all without users there will be no mev in the future to extract so it's kind of like a forward-looking proposition uh how i would react to other people doing that kind of negative value extraction i guess when they go low we go high so it wouldn't really change our outlook the the users always come first on any blockchain that we're on what's an example of uh things you don't want to do i'm anti-sandwiching okay dean uh we kind of have the same view uh we don't touch things that we think is gonna hurt in the long run like for example if we're doing sandwiching we think about is this gonna stop users from using uni swap if it does it means that we can't do arbitrage anymore and things like that and so we won't we won't do certain things like that we don't really care what our competition does we don't really look at our competition i think we're better than our competition anyways um and so like i yeah i don't really care what other people are doing we play in our own little ballpark yeah alameda research is is very similar as well no sandwiching or front runs or anything like that i haven't done anything since 2021 so i don't know if i have any very good answers other than uh no multi-block muv why i actually think multi-block attacks and multi-block extraction actually is the most deleterious to user users in the long run um it kind of like completely changes the ux also uh from the perspective of uh the protocol's operation you tend to see a lot more like high value extraction that kind of can kill some some protocols i think i think the inverse inverse finance thing was a great example of that um okay so maybe one follow-up question on this for you is um even though nathan and dean you kind of say um when others go low we go high uh isn't there this dynamic over time that the searchers that are more or less ethical or share a different type of ethic that somehow makes them more money um they can just you know throw reinvest that money in their resources and just grow bigger than you over time i think there is some benefits to being like value adding to the ecosystem and the searchers who are engaging these like negative externality activities often face some kind of repercussions so maybe the blockchain itself is hard for to sort of cease their activities there's or maybe they have trouble networking they can't get to the relationships that they need so i think that these terms these things are sort of like short-term profit maximizing but not long-term profit maximizing okay cool thank you um so maybe to follow up on that and i feel like this question was more directed to the crypto native searchers because i think in the more traditional game even in centralized exchanges i think you're somehow bound by regulation more uh than you are in in crypto um and so switching back to more of you guys so again turin is not trading currently but was part of trading firm before i want to make that clear again um how do you how do you think about me in the centralized world so we jay we briefly talked about this and you mentioned sorry go ahead go ahead all right you you mentioned that um you kind of looked at mev as a particular set of extraction strategies that were for example related to like gas optimizations um and then i had argued briefly that actually like doing market making is also a type of mev activity um so how do you think about mev and centralized systems one two should it be democratized uh the same way that like the the same kind of discourse that we have for the centralized system should that apply to how mev instantiates in centralized exchanges yeah definitely so yeah i think we had a pretty interesting conversation about this um a lot of it stems from the fact that i think that more centralized blockchains and even centralized exchanges can affect the mev landscape on uh the more decentralized blockchains as well so one example of this is for example on solana whenever leader is selected in the leader rotation schedule they're given like four blocks and oftentimes due to like centralization of stake they're given like eight blocks or twelve blocks and so this creates like a window of time in which um no state updates occur other than you know those selected by the leader and so this allows them to do like atomic arbitrage against um even more decentralized venues and so the centralization of stake on for example places like solana maybe can can affect these other venues um and this this can also be seen with like you know centralized exchanges as well right so you can perform a kind of weird atomic arbitrage between centralized exchanges and um a venue like solana where like you submit on for example ftx and then if you get a hit there then you can um perform the other like arbitrage on salon assuming you're in one of these windows so um yeah i think from from our like you know my perspective um there's definitely like some some negative externalities of these other more centralized venues on the decentralized blockchains and so um i think first of all i think it exists in terms of like the second part of your question on like how we can democratize oh i think and also i think it should be democratized um as to not centralize um these other blockchains um in terms of how we can democratize them i'm that's one thing i'm not super sure about maybe you know more crypto native um uh people can can chime in here but definitely it's something that alameda research thinks a lot about and we're interested in you know opening up the like conversation about this uh one one thing i think that's actually interesting in central the centralized world is uh the rebate mechanisms uh basically dominate a lot of arbitrage so like for instance ftt is the greatest example right like in order to really earn rebates on trades ftx you stake ftt and like if you're actually a big maker you definitely have a huge economy of scale uh kind of not so dissimilar to the stake concentration in uh layer one proof-of-stake type of thing i i i think um democratizing any visa for this like proof of stake network seems incredibly hard compared to proof of work um it's just you don't have any secret leader election that actually can work in prague yet and so i feel like we're still like five ways five years away from that so proof of stake networks definitely will have way more extractable value and can you can you expand on that why is knowing the leaders in advance uh a source of like centralization of value yeah so i think it's much easier to do off-chain agreements if you have any advanced notice of future blocks and a lot of the leader selection algorithms either a have some weak grinding affinity so like if there's you know if you're there's sort of like uh more than a certain amount of concentration the actual sampling the way the distribution sampling goes has some bias uh based on the choice of epoch length or like sort of what the minimum stake uh quantities are um and it's just easier to do these kind of like side side agreements uh when you actually have some advanced notice kind of to your point on solana blocks uh okay so what i'm what i'm hearing from both of you um is one you're saying before even caring about democratizing mev in centralized places democratizing it in proof-of-stake networks is already very difficult to do anyway okay and what i'm hearing from you is that the centralization of one chain can impact the centralized the decentralization of another chain and you can expand that concept to centralized exchanges and their centralization and their ordering rules influencing the decentralization of ethereum for example so is there any way we can like like mitigate that that second question um yeah i mean i think it's fairly hard thing to do and and probably you know it can't be done just through sort of like mechanisms alone i think um you know for example i think firms like alameda research and and other um you know protocol designers and blockchain designers can sort of work together and figure out you know how to sort of on a social level sort of move the space into being more democratized but in terms of like on the actual you know blockchain itself and the mechanics and the protocols um i'm not too sure they're although maybe other people have ideas i mean so this is a question for the three of you actually how do you wrestle with like internally democratization of value versus like concentration which is what you're doing by like you know accumulating value by by trading you know it's like the the dilemma is like as a crypto investor you're like you know concentrating value and then at the same time you're like i like to look at everything from an accelerationist standpoint which is that i'm gonna extract as much value as possible because it motivates really smart people to figure out how to democratize this thing um it's an incredibly hard problem to solve and ironically i think some of the ux decisions that we're making with like proof-of-stake networks um motivate more centralization for concentration of value right like lido and e-2 are essentially a toxic relationship when you add in flash bots and the fact that flashbacks and light have the exact same investor it's kind of like weirdly incestuous and um probably doesn't motivate the greatest um the greatest relationship for the network itself can you expand on that um yeah i mean when you have an investor or when you have a group of people that is incentivized to ensure that something like flashbots is used and then also is an investor in a portfolio company that controls a significant amount of the stake on ethereum there's probably going to be the chance that you know the software that is used to extract value on the chain is also run on all those validators um okay that the same party has invested in right okay because there's a party invested in both and they have like shared incentives you you incentivize cross-pollination between your portfolio companies we do that all the time right so how do you deal with that dialectic for your investments uh good question i mean um i look at this as an acceleration okay yeah i i don't i wouldn't know how to answer that question i think it's like um it's one of those do i do do i think that like paradigm would do something evil in that aspect probably not um it's just it's just something to consider right like i i think a lot of us crypto native investors have different incentives than for example the more web to traditional investors um i think a lot of us see the value of ensuring that like the network lives and lives healthy uh in a way where you know as we said before users aren't being squeezed out um but i don't think other parties have the same beliefs um and so it's more about being careful about some of those other parties coming into this space and maybe having different moral and ethical compasses than the ones that we have okay there's actually this perfect it's a great segue to my next uh question which is um in like traditional markets usually have new niches that are created and you have smaller players that capture these niches and it's not interesting for larger players to come in because they have other low hanging fruits that they look at first uh ultimately that niche grows though or some some of the time and as it grows uh the challenge for that smaller player is you have to grow and develop your moat uh such that by the time the big guns arrive you can somehow compete with them otherwise you just get obliterated right um and so we're not seeing this in d5 that much but we saw this in centralized crypto right where you have more traditional players that came in alameda being like a more like native crypto player but uh sbf himself back and amir came from jane street right so we have people from from jade street in the crowd we have people from hudson river trading in the crowd uh and i assume some others that are now trading and market making actively on centralized crypto exchanges that are thinking about going into d5 and as to your point they might not uh see eye to eye with like the the ideals that crypto native uh individuals have they might have a different time horizon with what they consider like the health of the network or they might not care at all they might say like you know let it all burn we'll just make as much money as possible and then we'll move on to the next interesting markets that will pop up with a lot of inefficiencies so how do you think about these new players coming in you as like the competition that comes in uh to to the game that you're playing uh and generally how do we make sure that uh they align with the values that we want to preserve in that system um for number two i don't think we can uh there's there's no way to thrust your values upon some other party especially when you have no idea who the the party is right like the beauty of mev is that or the beauty of this blockchain thing is that like the people i'm competing with i don't know who i'm competing with um it's also really hard to tell even like we do a lot of analytics on the chain as well it's sometimes really hard to tell what is actually going on um how do i feel about competition coming into this space emmy what's interesting about blockchain and all this stuff is that the the playing field is relatively or it's more i would say it's more level than high frequency trading right in high frequency trading essentially what you're competing for at this point is to get as close to wall street as possible to get the shortest uh cable as possible so you have the lowest latency to do some trade i would uh disagree with this for one reason which is people are co-locating with validators now i mean we're yeah we're like it's the same we're doing that we are doing that but you can do that in smarter ways than you can by just paying um you can like we found out where validators are without actually paying for any solution to find out where validators are other than setting up a  ton of our own nodes don't forget the cme moving to aws will basically do the same thing yeah basically ever it's more this game of like you know spraying a bunch of uh relay orders looking at latency distribution yeah like but anyone could do that yeah yeah but i think that's a lot cheaper than getting a cable close to wall street true sure but all the all the the regulated lit exchanges are actually moving to cloud type exchanges it's gonna they're gonna like stocks and crypto are gonna look the same in like five years that's that's probably true yeah i mean in in cloud computing it's still trivial to identify like the rack that a validator is on it's just a process of trial and error yeah it's ping it's sending transactions and seeing where which one lands faster on the network one comment that i have on this is that i think given the pace at which crypto sort of evolves and the various protocols and blockchains that sort of spawn over time i think it's actually pretty hard for some of the bigger players to keep up um just because they have sort of like internal you know risk departments and things like that that oftentimes like gate them from moving as quickly as the more crypto native um players in the space and so even at alameda research we've sort of seen this on like you know maybe a bigger scale where like you know maybe alameda research was was um more dominant on in the centralized exchange space than when when some of the bigger players came in and then sort of alameda research is now you know more more sort of dominant in the d5 landscape whether it's like sort of farm uh optimizing like yield farming and liquidity providing or things like that um and so you know maybe those firms will then kind of move into that and on the flip side like ahead of us are you know the teams that are like you know optimizing like evm byte code and things like that which which alameda doesn't do yet so i think like that there's kind of just like this shift that happens over time and um the bigger the firm it's just harder to keep up and because crypto evolves so quickly i think there's a possibility that this like dynamic stays in play for a while another thing i want to say that is you know true that like the bigger firms have a lot of trouble with like i'm talking about like jump diesha etc is that anyone who works there who works on defy trading realizes they can just leave on their own and go do it on their own like no one stays it if you if you actually look you you can basically see there's no reason to stay at a big firm is an example of that right he left jane street but he that was at a different era this is like you know i think this is like much more systematic now where like basically it's like oh you work at hrt and on doing some like by code optimization like they've written literally everyone who worked on that went and on their own and like started starting their own fun so like i don't i think like the capital costs in d5 are just so low that it's actually really hard for big firms to keep talent more than anything else that's like the number one thing i think you can see across the board incentives are incredibly hard which is why for example at dialectic we started the the mev team that we started is a is a new company which is 85 owned by the team and so all the profits essentially get paid out to the team and so the the the thing we did there is like you can do it by yourself which mev is very stressful um it's constantly drinking from the fire hose you're up 24 hours a day because like you you tweak your strategy a little bit and the guy who's competing with you found out what you were tweaked and has now done the same edit to their strategy and so you're constantly changing things and so i think everyone who's worked in mev long enough has burned out and so with the right incentives you can motivate people to work on a team because it's like okay you can make a million dollars a year by yourself but be up 24 hours a day or you can make you know maybe 10 million dollars a month and get 18 hours a day where you have to be up rather than the 24 hours incentivizing is incredibly hard and we pay a lot because of it yeah in my experience a lot of people in trad fire almost begging to leave they're underappreciated they're underpaid they'll get a lot more rewards and a lot more satisfaction being an mev yeah very few people stay who end up on the crypto teams okay so maybe counter argument to that um the capital efficiency you're talking about in crypto currently as we move to this asynchronous world right there's like higher capital requirements needed to have this like market making like activity so isn't that like a force towards like more concentration where like as a single player you now need like you know maybe 10 maybe 100 maybe 500 million um in order to like trade uh properly so how do we feel about that i think like every time there's a new electronic market it takes like five to ten years before you actually can actually get to the scale where you're deploying 500 million to a billion like just think about how hard it is for dough to buy 10 billion dollars of bitcoin like there's no way you're deploying 500 million very easily right now uh and like we're just not at the scale like that institutional markets look like um and and so anyone who's joining now is like trying to basically put their stake in the ground in case it does get to that size and then they have enough of a enough of a capital base to do it themselves it depends on your strategy though right like if you're market making you want to have like some uh liquidity pools in different places and like this should be large enough to like be able to maximize the opportunity i feel like the only places in d5 you can really deploy like that size capital and obviously you can speak more to this is farming like i i just don't think market making is like it's not that capital intensive in crypto compared to like everywhere else i don't even think you can do it that to that large of a scale in farming right like farming is really sensitive we so at dialectic we also run a yield farming fund which we call our delta neutral stable income fund i can't say how much we have deployed there but even there we're getting to a scale where um we need to start looking at different strategies because all of the interesting farms which are the ones which return high profits the the amount you're making goes down drastically with every dollar that you put in there right like you you you can farm with 500 and make you know a few thousand apy but the second you put in 10 100 million in there it's like back to two three percent api right so there's not really anywhere in crypto where you can deploy that much because the other side isn't taking out that much yeah definitely and yeah again i think alameda research it is definitely like um kind of seeing the same thing right like um there's definitely limits to all this but one other thing is i think um different firms sort of different sensitivities to what like the return profile of a strategy is i think like in tradify you know maybe they they're they're you know more comfortable with sort of like lower returns than maybe in crypto or like there's so many opportunities that you know like they need like higher returns to justify doing something um so in that respect like you know maybe you know once once those bigger players come in they're willing to put in a lot more size because they're they're willing to they have the appetite for for that like lower return profile all right thank you we have like seven minutes left and i have like a lot more questions well a few more questions but maybe just to continue on that that topic to some extent um and the topic of competition to some extent but also of capacity which dean you you mentioned um at some point you have like diminishing returns when would you and this is more for the for the two of you dean and nathan um when would you decide to turn off your bots if that makes sense we'll fight for a long time before that happens i mean it's competitive by nature right you're fighting for every dollar that you get and it would have to be really not fun for us to actually leave a market oh so i mean maybe let me rephrase the question um at what point and maybe you're still active on ethereum you don't have to say yes or no i'm not allowed to i okay not compete all right all right i was gonna ask you know given the the profits being given to miners more and more as uh was shown in barnabas presentation before and the numbers from flashbacks there is a point where like the the margin that you make becomes smaller right so there's like this choice of hey you have limited bandwidth and time to work on your bots and you have to decide like when to turn them off on a particular chain or when the returns are just not exciting enough at that scale um you don't have to answer that question though well it's more about the opportunity costs like should i be spending my time on this or should i be spending my time on that if the opportunity cost of spending your time on something else is higher that's just where you're gonna naturally go but like there's not like a particular reason you would just leave a chain unless you just were making more money somewhere else um so we've never turned a bot off um because we've our the issues which we faced where profits have gone lower have been an infrastructure problem rather than an issue with the strategy uh meaning that someone figured out how to do one small thing in the process a little faster than we did and usually that fix is relatively easy and we can uh be competitive again within the next three to six hours of discovering uh what they might have done um and so we usually most of our bots become relatively low maintenance over time so we have i think right now around three or four strategies that are up and running in prague and we maintain them maybe once a week and so if they become uncompetitive at that point we we do the changes required we haven't really tried to we haven't had to turn anything off i think under some dollar threshold um i'd probably turn it off like if if the dollar threshold per hour um is less even after a change um than what it like costs to maintain for those six or seven hours that we have to every week i'd probably turn it off cool thank you um all right we have five minutes left so maybe i'll get to that last question i'll ask all of you um given what you know about so i mean what's interesting about high uh performance searchers is that they know the intricacies of the blockchains they trade on very well just like high performance traders on centralized exchanges know the the fee tiers very well and the rebates they can get and how the queue works and sometimes what's not written in the documentation of the exchange and so given that you know these intricacies what are the chains that you wouldn't use as a as a as a user because you know like users are getting um you know bad deals by trading there or what are the chains you wouldn't bet on for the long term there's like a distinction between me as a user and me as a trader as a trader i'm a pragmatist i'll trade where the profit so now i'm asking as a user as you use i heavily favor decentralization so i like to sort of vote with my with my fee if a chain is exhibiting like a large amount of decentralization that's what i believe in from an idealistic perspective and that's where i'm investing and putting my personal money yeah same and it's ironic because the chains where we make the most profit or the least decentralized and i don't use any of those chains personally or the chains that we are making the most profit on i have never interacted with so in a way are you accelerating their uh demise i said previously i look at all of these things from an accelerationist standpoint i think yeah dean's onto something really valuable there that like there is a value to accelerationism and that you're highlighting problems with the chain it will lead to solutions right but to some extent the chains have to iterate on their design to achieve like some level of decentralization so for example at what point do you disclose some inefficiency you found so that it can be patched in a way that it can make the chain more decentralized or do you even have that mandate of like disclosure after like some amount of time um we disclose bugs that we find um disclosure of like you know the chain being completely centralized because you have 21 validators and it costs 400 million dollars to become a validator right now um i don't know if i really need to disclose that that seems like blatantly obvious public information yeah and one thing to add to that is you know the point of these chains is that this is public you can go analyze and you know decide to disclose or like someone the chain themselves could actually do that but for instance uh the the chain dean is referring to has had some very uh funny uh github issues with their developers quitting at different times those ones are great so i don't yeah let's just say i think people are very frustrated there yeah for sure i think you know alameda is is you know happy to participate on any chain where it thinks that there's a good opportunity to do so but um you know in terms of like general outlook on on projects that we want to support and partner with i think i'm very much so aligned on all those fronts i will never use waves or tron okay all right we're at time where there's one minute left but i want to leave time for the next panel to come in i don't think we have time for questions i'm sorry i saw someone raising their hand but maybe you can re uh go talk to any of the panelists here um if if they're okay with you talking to you yeah totally okay okay i'm approachable great great for sure okay okay all right well thank you very much for listening thank you to the panelists [Music] you
