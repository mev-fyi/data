thank you foreign and this was supposed to be animated but it's not but that's okay um so first of all I want to talk about credible mechanisms this was an idea that was introduced by Lee and Akbar 2020 um they wanted to ask at a high level what happens if the entity that is operationalizing a mechanism is able to deviate from the intended rules of the mechanism uh so maybe a canonical example to have in mind which you're all familiar with in this audience I think is um a second price auction would not be credible because there are deviations available that are not visible uh to the participants and they they formalize this uh so I want to spend a minute on this so they said that a rule um describes an intended Behavior uh for example in the intended Behavior might be take all bids and run a first price auction they describe the concepts of a safe deviation this is a deviation from the rule that generates an output for which there exists an input consistent with the rule given each participant's knowledge of the input so you know you may know your bid you may not know the other bids and then you observe the outcome is the outcome consistent with some possible completion of the input if it is then this is a safe deviation the the uh the The Entity operationalizing the mechanism may have deviated from the intended Behavior but in a way that is not observable to any party based on what they know and then they say that a rule is credible if there is no profitable safe deviation so they they don't require there to be no safe deviations but they require there to be no useful safe no useful safety patients um uh so I think it's useful to imagine that deviations that are not safe are sanctioned in some way you know you're you're staking your reputation as a mechanism entity on following the rule at least up until the point where your deviations can be caught there are other things you can do that nobody will know about you're not making any guarantees in that regard and we still want to be able to say useful things about the mechanism um and what they proved in this paper they proved the trailer which I'm not going to step through in detail but they proved for example that Revenue optimal first price auctions are credible but second price auctions are not credible um and I think when we think about commitment then I'm going to try to tie things into commitment uh I think we could say The credibility gives a self-interrupted mechanism commitment power if my mechanism rules are credible then I can commit in a credible way to follow those rules um it is a sense of compatible for me to follow them and not use a safe deviation okay so there's notion of credibility um which now you can kind of situate this in the D5 space so in the D5 space and let's think about uh transaction ordering into an amm in the D5 space a rule is an intended Behavior it might be take all transactions that you have seen and follow a particular sequencing methods to order those transactions onto an amm that might be the intended behavior and then a safe deviation is on the again generates an output for which there is an input that is consistent with the rule given knowledge of the input um I think oftentimes when we think about blockchain we will think about the input as being observable that is the input that is used as being observable so when I think about if I for example concretely we can all observe the transactions that were pushed through uniswap in that block so in that sense we all have information about the input and uh what does it mean to be credible it means that um and so a safe deviation is is any deviation where um if there's some space either if there's some space in the rules you still uh off following the requirements of the rule or a deviation where um uh you serve the input in some way you're you're you're allowed to perturb the input it's just that you have to follow the rule given what people see about the input and here the input is all of the transactions that are written um into the block um I'm going to mention in a second the result we have and it's just a slight tweak on The credibility definition so the definition I gave you earlier is there is no profitable safe deviation definition I'm now going to use is that any profitable safe deviation from the rule still achieves design goals that we care about so there may be deviations um and I'm okay with that as long as any deviations that the mechanism chooses to follow still lead to properties that are good for me for example a property I might care about in the D5 context is I'm okay with Mev but only if the execution price on the transaction that is and you read is good in a way that we could formalize and again think about other deviations being sanctioned so this is credibility where I say I'm going to follow this particular sequencing rule if you ever see based on what you see about the input that I'm using that I didn't follow the rule you can sanction me uh you you everybody will know that I deviated and uh now now going forward people will choose not to submit transactions to my uh my mechanism um so here credibility gives a self-interest and policy commitment power to achieve this is a dorata where again the router might be what we could think about and formally uh tolerable Mev um it is definitely compatible for me to achieve these as a router even if I might choose to use some safe deviations so we have a foregrating paper that I'm not going to get into in any detail other than to advertise it here you could ask me about it later if we want to go there uh which is coming up in stock where we give a verifiable sequencing rule that ensures this kind of tolerable um Mev property so it ensures that for any executed transaction a either the price of a is as good as if a was the only order to execute or no Mev has gained by uh executing a and you could think about for example um Builders and relays choosing to adopt that rule and then now they are committing to be observed and have staked their reputation are not deviating so they they're committing and the questions whether those rules have nice properties that's the first thing that I wanted to talk about is the role of credibility second thing I want to now jump back in time and talk about this idea of faithful implementations the backdrop to this was that algorithmic mechanism design started in around 1999-2000 uh there was a flurry of activity around polynomial time mechanisms and then some people in particularly Joan feigenbaum and Scott Schenker started thinking about what would happen if we had distributed algorithms that were implementing them um and and and so now the question wasn't so much is there a polynomial time centralized algorithm that can operationalize the rules of a mechanism but is there a a decentralized algorithm with nice communication complexity and computational complexity that can run the algorithm and they wrote some very nice papers I would encourage you to read them the question they didn't ask is they didn't ask whether it was intensive aligned followed so they said here's the distributed algorithm where if it is wrong it will effectively compute the output of the mechanism uh and they they wanted mechanisms because mechanisms were providing incentive alignments around inputs but they were now insisting that parties wouldn't want to deviate from the algorithm itself um and yet at the same time they're motivating story were often things like bgp border Gateway protocol for an autonomous systems on the internet uh which are self-interested parties executing decentralized algorithms and uh you know there's no reason to really think they would choose to follow the algorithm if they could benefit by deviating from it and so what we did in this work was we wanted to add this additional Criterion of incentive alignment with choosing to follow the algorithm and that's what I mean by a faithful implementation uh so there was a policy paper there were two RMS papers so it's nice that we're adjacent to our mess today um I called this specification faithfulness so this work with Jeff Schneiderman and when I contrast it to credibility so in credibility there is a privileged party say a mechanism that receives inputs can tamper with them in various ways and then selects an output when we were thinking about faithfulness we didn't have any kind of Center any privilege party we wanted um a fully distributed system so I would often draw these types of pictures uh here's a sensor and here it's like no you take the rules of the mechanism and you give them to all of the participants and the in the system and they're all doing some part of the distributed computation and we wanted all of that communication and computation to be an equilibrium so it's a weaker form of commitment reflecting that multi-party aspect it says it's incentive aligned for me to follow my part of the mechanism rules given that others do the same there's an equilibrium notion all right and what we did is we uh ask the question can following a protocol be made an exposed Nash equilibrium roughly this says as long as others follow the protocol then whatever the inputs you also want to follow the protocol whatever the private inputs that's the ex post aspect of it um and if it's true then we say the specification is faithful we formalize that by breaking up the um the strategy now of an of a agent represents the computation that they're doing and we we thought about that in terms of a revelation components a computation component and a message passing component um so Revelation is computation you're doing that is touching your private input computation is work you're doing that is um depending on inputs that you've received and message passing is you sending messages to others and we developed a proofer sop that I will Flash and not spend a lot of time on where we first of all defines this notion of algorithm compatible which says that an agent will choose to follow the suggested computation in equilibrium communication compatible an agent will choose to follow the suggested message passing in equilibrium and then we strengthened ac and we said well strong AC is that you will choose to follow your suggested computation whatever you do in regards to your Revelation action and your communication action so assuming others do what they're supposed to be doing but even if you were to deviate in arbitrary ways for Revelation a message method it's still incentive aligns you to do the computation correctly and you can similarly strength and communication compatibility um and then we we can prove it's quite easy to then prove that if a mechanism is strategy proof and you have a correct distributed specification that is strong AC and strong CC then the specification will be faithful so then the game is all about how to establish these promises and we provided techniques for that in these these these papers rmso4 um almost 20 years ago it's hard to believe uh distributive vcg methods we had our bgp protocol which was in pod C and then a more General distributed optimization algorithm in RMS 06 so that's about faithfulness go back one year now strategy-proof computing this is something I was playing around with um pretty early as a professor at Harvard and I remember giving this talk actually it was in a little room Acapulco at HK in 2003 and um I don't think I've talked about it since so thank you for giving me the chance I think this paper has 10 citations um uh so I I I I I was developing this notion of what it would mean to have something called strategy proof computing and I'd been motivated by what's known as the end to end principle in our Network systems where somehow you don't try to do too much in the network you don't you you you you facilitate Innovation on the edges um and I wanted to kind of think through what would that mean for mechanism design and my main idea was well you don't want it to be one designer you want them to be innovation amongst mechanism designers you want anybody to be able to deploy a mechanism um and have kind of a competitive landscape for which mechanisms get used and I was thinking through okay what would that mean how might that work is there an AI agenda here um one thing I decided was that I wanted each mechanism to be strategy proof um at least kind of locally for the things that it's doing and so what I mean by that is that strategy proofness doesn't compose very well if you're trying to buy a bundle of stuff and I give you a strategy proof mechanism for one part of the stuff you want to buy and a strategy proof matters into the second part it doesn't mean that your dominant strategy is to bid truthfully for this part and the true Fleet for this part because you might not put everything together correctly um so there's this composability problem which I raised in the paper but what I did want to insist is that if somebody deploys a mechanism to allocate this particular bundle of resources that that mechanism should be strategy proof in a particular way and should be certified as such so this is the abstract of the paper I wanted to support continued Innovation and competition focusing on resource allocation arbitration of resources and I buy individual users can treat other resources as their own this is the notion of Simplicity that comes from strategy proofness that you shouldn't have to gay in in the requests that you're making for resources you should just be able to describe what you're interested in just as you would if you weren't competing with others for those resources uh and I laid out some challenges I'm just going to tell you what they were and then I I will point you to the paper which I think we've now we've we've posted on the webpage so I laid out five guiding principles and then I laid out five a chapters principles where we should care about incentives we should be focused on utility and our utilization we want incentive compatibility we want openness and we want things to be decentralized and then the challenges were were designed were how to describe what it is your mechanism does and who it is designed for and what properties does it have um how we can verify in a data-driven way the incentive properties of the mechanism because I had in mind that the infrastructure which was vaguely discussed in the paper is monitoring inputs and outputs to these mechanisms and is able to by looking at the trace of inputs and outputs notice violations and strategy proofness yeah I sanction you you have you have you are you are not strategy proof I have proof by looking at the things you've been doing over time I can see you're not strategy proof that's the way I was thinking about this and we we did later work on that I have a paper on that verification step compositionality um and I'd forgotten about this until I looked at the paper yesterday um yeah I I talked about the idea of learning using machine learning to try to design mechanisms as well in that paper so um then fast forward to this year where we are using machine learning to design mechanisms um and I've been working on this photo differentiable economics now for a few years with a number of collaborators and the particular project that I wanted to briefly mention is about contract design so it shifts with commitment devices so oh and I didn't mention commitment here but I what I wanted to say is that assume the ability to commit to the rules of a mechanism that you are not going to change the rules of the mechanism this was a this was an implicit assumption in my paper that you can deploy something and you will not change it which today I think we can roughly do that so that's good foreign this was something we started in 2017 um a whole bunch of co-authors including jafong and Sai ravindranath more recently um Jeff Jang and tonghan Wong in my research group simple idea it's okay that represents the rules of a mechanism via a differentiable function neural network and that's used differentiable techniques to try to optimize the rules of the mechanism the technical challenge is I mean there are a few but one technical challenge is that you need incentive compatibility so if if I if I gave the network the objective of minimizing negated revenue or maximizing expected Revenue so we say your loss function is negative Revenue well it's going to do that in a non-incentive compatible way it's going to kind of charge you your bid of course is not sensible economically so we have to have a way to regularize penalize in some way the mechanisms of the Learned which we do in this in this research in in various ways um just as a quick example before I talk about contracts in the first work we talked about optimal auction design um very simple example just with one better just to illustrate what happens and you can have auctions for a single bidders I know it sounds a little silly but actually digital Goods do tend to decompose like cross bitters because they're what's called a non-rival good um so suppose we had a single bidder with an additive valuation function uh uniform01 for item one uniform zero one Freight and two the theoretical economic literature tells us what the optimal design of an auction is and this is what it is it says that if the value is in this space you know less than this number for item one less than this for item two then don't allocate if your value is high for both allocates if it's high for one but not two allocate item one high for two but not one allocate item two and then the payments follow from uh typical auction Theory so if you just want to decompose it down this is the allocation rule from theory for item one and this is the allocation rule from theory for item two so it has a threshold kind of structure to it and when you train the network you learn things that look like this so this is the density plot of a 10h based neural network so you can see it kind of Smooths out the boundaries but it's approximately doing what it should do okay so just uh it's basically my last slide so hopefully we will have enough time for this session um working paper led by tonkan Wang in my research group on using this technique for optimal contract design let me tell you what I mean by a contract here and I mean it in the very classical sense from economics so we think here about the being an agent with unobservable costly actions each action causing a distribution on observable outcomes and there being a principle another actor in the system with value for the outcomes so think about the agent as your contractor if you're improving your house you don't watch what the contractor does all the time but based on the behavior of the contractor uh you know your house is high quality or not is on time or late and you can contract on payments with the uh you can you can offer your contract to payments so the conditions on whether or not the outcome is high quality or low quality on time or late and the goal is to in our work is to learn a contract what is a contract it's these outcome contingent payments to maximize the expecting utility of the principal which is the so think about for a given contract this induces a distribution over outcomes you have an expected value for that you have an expected cost because you're paying and you want to find out of all possible contracts the one that is best um so what we do here is we um recognize that if you think about the design space this is a bit washed out but this is a two-dimensional contract space showing the utility function of the principal the utility function of the principle As you move in contract space is discontinuous because as you move from one contract to another the principal's best response the agent's best response action can change and that can lead to a discontinuity in the utility to the principle and so we know it is the for example relu networks are piecewise continuous approximations so we introduce a new network architecture which gives the disc continuity which is appropriate to modeling this problem so we learned the utility function to the principle and then we do inference on that space to find the optimal contract going back to Commitment here uh this is assuming in the background the ability to commit to a contract once if you can commit to a contract which at least outcome contingent payments then there's a contract design problem that can be solved using machine learning so just to wrap up um I wanted to give you these four illustrations on alignment and commitments emphasize that each of them has a different notion of commitments in credible mechanisms uh your your commitment power comes from it um being in your own self-interest not to use a safe deviation or in your own interests to only use deviations that are tolerable in the faithful implementation space your commitment power comes from it being in your self-interest you follow the rules of the protocol as long as others are doing the same in strategy proof Computing um we assumed in that work the different parties are able to commit to the rules of mechanisms uh and then we argued that it would be in the self-interest of a party to publish a strategy-proof mechanism because the infrastructure is going to run a reputation system to catch a deviation and then in this optimal contract design work we're assuming the ability to commit to a contract which is an outcome contingency payment Rule and using machine learning to design that commitment device that's all I had um I wanted to kind of share this with you because I think these are all examples where I I hope that ideas from distributed to the eye multi-agent systems research econ CS research can continue to get picked up in the crypto space uh and I I'm guessing that a bunch of you are building out and designing things in that space thanks thank you I'm curious if the the challenge um do you think any of them have been kind of sorry exactly but um yeah which ones do you kind of apparently see the biggest outstanding uh ones that are still here it's also the case that means um yeah what's what what is that standing in place yeah okay great uh obviously you could pronounce on I can design uh good progress on the automation of the design um people haven't really worried so much about developing minor juices or mechanisms on languages describe inputs to mechanisms but not that normal how you despite the mechanism itself um and I think it's been a while at work this idea that I'm describing at that paper of making a tree since I've been put out early decisions from mechanisms and similarly algorithms that can get with high probability guarantees but in fact the implemented strategy group we did someone on this like facing more work um and maybe there's a whole different approach to this which will be um modern cryptographic settings which we weren't thinking about here maybe we can tell about that uh compositionality is something that people are very aware of that was some work on this after I wrote this paper there were the people that I uh but gave one way in which you can compose faculty together um we also did some work where we talked about mechanism for options so you don't buy a resource you buy the art in teams resource um which gives you get a compositionality do you not expose to having to buy the refills we did some work on that but I think that I think it was Mike one no one said to me and said you know you you you're you're never going to have a communist for our auction or all of the resources on the walls and so there are always going to be boundaries between mechanisms and I think they'll still happen to be a very eventual outcome kind of understanding that space uh I suppose the price of Anarchy work in the theoretical computer science Community has proved some things about what happens if you use very simple decouples options well I suppose you could think about as a computationality yeah the body of the description point I'm curious about the um faithfulness and thinking about how like other Economic Security models um but the you know another concept people look at often is including like usually threshold um and then another angle as well is is um looking at all the economic uh security budget in that if some if some you know there's some unbounded actually uses like the blockchain you know you never know that the audience all over the running ruling around there might be something up about which point like the Magnum just uses it's it's a faithfulness or credibility or whatever so curious if it's installed uh with other uh extensions to the emotions of faithfulness a great ability to cover these kind of Securities yeah great question um and a few things to say um first of all I think that coalitional refinements and what x talks about are uh can certainly be defined um you don't know the people are really take um either credibility um the most constructive offensive thinking I've done about coalitional Fates quickly has all correlational deviations within the alternating McLean design and work well in the learning magnet because what I'm going to do with that framework is we penalize unilateral deviations with a lost country I didn't talk about it but that's exactly what we do so you could penalize correlation abbreviations and I think you could use that framing to be able to build automobiles I'm generally pretty bullish about using machine learning techniques ultimate that in terms of design Loop and I think it's quite flexible so I think if they're a coalition thing you care about or other things can it would be interesting to study it in that via training um the other thing I would say is there was some nice work early on by people like Vanessa T and Jack Halpern on rational secret sharing models you know um the the secret sharing multiple policy computational literature the three excluded classical so with some shippings out of this series it can be an arbitrary way um and and talks about robustness against some fraction of the particular women's deviation that would work again in the mid to badly and say okay what is the difference in that way but our national actors in some nice piece of plans and they have some kind of Coalition robust properties there um yeah a lot of questions and then we had follow-up week uh a little bit down and myself on that as well thanks what's in there uh compositionality yeah thank you foreign yeah I'm still not sure I have anything particularly uh uh excited to say in particular about commitment with compositionality and the way those two come together but hopefully we can get there during the conversation you can have today um I think the best thing I can say in regards to competitionality is uh first of all just contrast it and differentiate privacy you know one of the things people love about differential privacy it's composable and so it's always been incredibly frustrating to me that these mechanisms by and selling seem to not be able to achieve the same properties which is why we did think about it through options a little bit but I think the best thing to say is and actually that was part of my motivation to support strategy computing part of my strategy Computing notion was to let there be Innovation where Mexican dividers could kind of draw the boundaries in the appropriate way in the resource space yeah resource space could be uh could literally be spatial could be temporal could be other things but try to draw boundaries in ways where you draw the boundaries that um match the separability of utility functions or say the majority of participants in the system so that their problems will likely break along you know this way and this way and they can independently make decisions here and then make decisions here um I'd like to talk to you I wouldn't be surprised if there are things we can do by thinking about some of the graphical modeling techniques that people use for probabilistic models where these conditional independencies and dank structures where you you're willing to make assumptions about a lack of dependency between random variables in the worlds but maybe things like that that we can also leverage and or kind of ideas like that you know all the other all the graphical representations we can write down that capture the types of conditional independencies where if I give you this resource then now your value for these results about the couples yeah you you kind of independently inside over here they're getting parallel inside over here this is the type and play that we should be thinking if you want to think about how to break our problems um but maybe maybe we shouldn't be that awesome about uh naive and maybe we should just be thinking about how to build infrastructure so that other people can kind of move their mechanism domains around and try to train to be smarter than the way the cops use kind of blow up fraction to it everything that's online it's something from your other paper and started you through Computing was that it would be the market itself that would like find those regions and now tell me more of a top-down kind of thing the probability so like what do you think it's more more promising there for the meta problem not designing in mechanisms in that partition yeah I mean I would say definitely bottom up um but still that those participants will still need the right heuristics to know how to how to cop out the the resource Space by the way I did do a lot of work on Commons Road auctions that's something that I talked a lot about and there are various uh preference representations in that literature that capture these types of um independencies or couplings so I think there we can we can borrow but yeah I would I would I would say um trade to build infrastructures that allow for Innovations over time probably number eight controversial insolutions um so you mentioned a couple of times um like um I was wondering but wipe your first time being or nobody else starting with I mean relating now about how to enclose those we talked about rotation at one point um but how kind I've been part of the results like um um let's say you can verify seedlings after induction side as um not being restricted or there was like a regulation problem what you were expected to do um yeah I was just wondering about you when your thoughts are impossible yeah um yeah thanks I I I did it I did initially think about that as more of a um kind of an insensive vehicle system like a reputations of some where there are Checkers that are motivated to find problems and call out the problems um but there was a period of time when I did work on using homomorphic encryption type ideas um we were using a pretty lightweight of that where the way we were modeling it once on I we we didn't want to prevent the mechanism getting knowledge of the influence but we did one of them actually to have to prove to anybody that could computation done correctly okay um yeah we were using various we're calling random log techniques with straight line computation make any talk to you about in what offline but there's um techniques doesn't work for them may call Reuben R and he was not retired and Christopher and um there it was this proven brochure model where it were you you run on the mechanism and then you could deviate but if you're deviated you wouldn't be able to prove that you've done the right thing right so I was thinking about that but things like um normal non-design non-decentralized exchanges but there are all these probably dark Finance where uh yeah it became a parrot over the years the banks were not able to credibly commit not to use information they were supposed to use and so I wanted to know whether we could use crypto checkmates to have them commit to a role and then not be able to prove that how we deviated so I suppose all I'm trying to say is that over time you know in today's world we're smart contracts a lot of Technology it's I think we have much more ability to commit to rules um there is always still the question about what happens if you okay I mean there are various flavors about of course it could be literally the um uh I have I have no available deviations but I think typically in the in the kurzo space I can commit to the role which but I cannot get the inputs that necessarily right so the malfeasance and then playing with the Intimates that hit that that function and that's why I think that combining that ability to commit to a a bug show that acts or whatever the liquidity does get that's with credibility which is bringing incentives to the table to complement that I think that works really nicely together because then you've got the incentive alignments around the inputs being correct or not modified in a bad way with the crypto providing protection against the output yeah wow I wanted to expand on the Civic and I wanted to to see if you have anything an intuitions on how can we both faithfulness of a optimal smart contract um again it's about eight months right so uh is it a small contracts a lot closer to what I bring to be something more like credibility but it the contract itself is created by an engine on sector a motion during models to the to the application yeah maybe maybe I could take your question this way um but feel free to push back on I think would we eat used a French bull economics to learn credible mechanisms I think that that's why my mind went and you said that was the army uh but experience on the very final sequencing rules work by Luv I've been thinking a lot about credibility in the blockchain space and I can also continue that that conversation but I think credibility is a very nicely since it's blockchain and I think that would be super interesting yeah you think the French league comes for credibility of the constraint do you have any intuition sort of this shape like that right yeah so I think I think so I think that's that would be where I would I would start I would I would code up the types and deviations that are represented Through The credibility concerns and I would want to penalize them when they go against the technique rods I think I originally tried to do [Music] like the odds foreign so adoption is definitely a challenge um what then what I'm what I'm thinking about you don't want to leave everything's attention right nobody starts using my batteries the reputation um by the way it's an interesting story about launching eBay in that regard eBay launched in 1995. and as of 1996 had a reputation system and it's fine by now on the internet for federal reputations and they divide two-sided reputation where buyers could leave feedback on sellers sellers on buyers people always ask why why would they have sell those providers back on buyers one reason that's given is the biased build up reputation as a buyer and then use that reputation to sell so listen idea of letting reputation in people from and in one way you're acting is another way you're acting so maybe one ways to think about who's tracking recommendation and getting better efficiency you can contribute your reputation to others a little bit like the way we think about things like age radical site that kind of things um but I think are are on crypto ecosystems also right there and I'm also thinking that it shouldn't just be about reputation and collecting data it should be about proving things as well we don't want all of it about having to wait and see what happens we want as much of it can be about um groupable properties that anybody can check on the reputation side of things like there's also this question then of um our uh I don't know what the the correct property is but how like gamers yeah yeah and it's actually you you get all of the same problems of the matter yes yeah um and and there's lots of injecting work on attacks on reputations um you know paycheck it's basically not robust except you get inclusive people cleansing each other um feedback score around so the the random wall can sit this Medics behind me holding it there um and so John rockcraft really really in 2008 where I've been used hitting type which is another static process and proved that that would be simple it was being worked there as well I mean anyway any questions you guys asked me I can probably Point somebody in the past 20 years but it exactly like what is the rate be for the problem you're wrappling with I'm not sure the yeah the references are appreciated yeah once again it's also um uh you know Blake Mac and then United deployment is too easy in the sense that it is super easy to some Indian people uh and then it's just you know kind of never ends up you're right like it's like uh whether it's income I guess so so let's be precise as well um coalition and literally coalitions of participants in the mechanism whereas now I think you're thinking about Coalition of the mechanisms am I right yes that are that are that are somehow setting themselves up to be able to work together to defeat the Divine interacting to some some separation concerns I haven't I don't think I've thought about this um you you may have deleted mechanisms uh I mean you know most people most of the languages you just take for the sense of the single record in the night so even the notion of the being in the context of mechanisms is relatively under studied and then the notion I'm now I'm making excuses but now the notion of like Coalition of the mechanisms and things that's another study but let's see do I have anything to say um foreign [Music] else um I've often so it's in someone's name that with absolute notion of that the existence Implement them shouldn't create newest Sunset concerns something else one thing that came to mind when you you said that and it's there's work on Information Station those but that work typically assume the only thing you're trying to do with a participant so if you get a you don't have any outside so it doesn't work um but what you do want in that case is that that you just play an information illustration mechanism you don't want it to introduce um uh new incentives to be acting in some different way in the World to Change the events of them being um quite the impressions so you can you can try to formalize the the types of interaction that you don't want and then try to prove that the magnetism uh um it's robust against that that was a very click we were thinking a little bit about that the information States yeah there we go and where I get stuck it's in yogas or we think about it oh yeah so uh anybody has any last questions that was uh uh what can you solve this is the difference um Contracting so thank you regret um the the answer at the moment um which is not very satisfying because I'm still working okay so the um computational technique or contracted by that those people would use a bug look like what I described separately for every action so that if you have a a very large um we ate way back here in fact here the the insurance never convince data that we see is contract inside so it's scale but um I don't think I yet have a satisfying concerning comments because element the interesting guy and actually the the so they know the kind of Applied contract design that picture is a little bit less development and so I have it yet we usually yeah so the body the medicinalness yeah yeah some multi-dimensional do you mean multi-dimension yeah yeah um we've been thinking about a related problem for data market design which sounds a bit like yeah so if you have anything to binds we could try to try to take it on this is this is very Union we haven't tried to applied yeah so uh one of the songs challenges about auditing I forgot what the name basic verification I know it absolutely okay um yeah and you mentioned like that you weren't thinking about water that's fine yeah we're trying to like zero knowledge and mechanism s yeah do you think that I'm stalks um we are obviously um and I think even just Swan Hunters where anybody can look at the description of the contracts not obviously because the probability of interest in creating something about is strategy proof that's which is a uh kind of a derived property of a thousand and so even if I describe the function to you it may not be I don't think we know very much about how tractable it is there's a little bit of very recent work but I don't remember really authors um but I think we don't really understand how tractable it is to somehow weary that function and to sign wherever it is tragedy approval not amen zero knowledge techniques hi shaping yeah certainly that's where there's also okay which is developing lens right right but you do have imprator we have um zero zero knowledge in the normal sense just to prove that you correctly with the currency it wouldn't remove property right yeah and I think that's the zero nod right thing right taking to commit to that I guess what you could prove it's not really satisfactory but you could prove it's easily that there's no useful unilateral leakage in a lot of it but that's something that's all the difference that's not bad all right thank you foreign
