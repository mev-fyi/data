yeah so our design is called a wallet boost you can try to tell where the uh inspiration in the name came from um but uh so sort of like our view with block native is that you know wallets are kind of sleeping challenge supply chain here it's very clear that they're not stupid Giants here many angles that they're interested in getting at the game um because we've sort of had relationships in them for like a couple years now some of your favorite wallets like you know switch to our gas estimated suggestions well as usual simulation services uh different wallets and so uh yeah so like some of the motivations for our design were uh basically ease of integration we think well this is more so cool wallets like they don't want to touch a single thing on their screen they optimize that although it doesn't seem like it pretty heavily um and so like they don't want any difference to the user experience like let's just be seamless and then the uh second thing is like we wanted something that Wallace could just like plug and play and uh so I think there's like a larger open question there of there's going to be a lot of these wallet-based lfas and so like how can different groups like you know flashbots block native anyone else working on it like maybe craft an interface such that if they decide to switch between one like it's you know super easy you just like points it you know maybe a different um URL and actually you know you're kind of operating in the same regime um yeah and then also basically just like maximizing uh revenue for the users but then on top of that a lot of wallets are hurting they don't really have created revenue streams and so we'll be able to provide a way for them to have input into how much revenue they would make from this um I think uh it's sort of going to become like a death like a million Cuts type of scenario where like the wallet wants to take a feed you know users obviously need to the relays one two Builders want to so it's not clear how long wallets can take a fee out of this and then as well um so our design like lets wallets set their percent that they would capture from this med and uh we think that should compress to zero in the long run like unless there's sort of uh you know you have like a meta mass type scenario or you do the hardware wallets right so it's a very high switching cost but some of the smaller ones we think like they're charging 10 then you know another wallet will try to undercut them and go to a lower fees so we think you know hopefully balance out there but we're not sure um and yeah largely like we're just trying to experiment here we sort of um you know don't have a ton of research uh at block native and so we're very interested in like the Insight that everyone has here on both days um yeah so I'll get into like the differences between netshare and wild boost um it's a pretty similar thing except we are like proposing some notion of like larger wallet agency so if they get more say and so the idea for that is like the wallet can run a sidecar um and so that's like the big difference I would say between Memphis and wild boost is um in in MedStar you know if there's a trusted Matchmaker or a couple or a few or whatever um we think wallers are very interested in running their own Matchmaker um and then uh basically the next difference is we didn't have really a notion of differential privacy it was sort of like hard-coded subset information for swaps but I think that's really interesting advancement there uh and then the last inference is that we don't like at the end of an auction period in wallet boost we just uh wallet boost like this wall boost node sends the um winning bid to a builder whereas I think medshare just continues to the extremes a bunch of different ones um yeah so those are the main differences uh some like oh and then also on top of that we basically have like a permission Searcher set is how we're imagining this like that wallets would basically have to curate but maybe like there's input from the community like sort of we thought an initial sort of POC approach for this would be like you know only using Searchers that's set into like over 20 Builders so I guess to look like metric or you know like increasing Builder diversity um yeah we eventually would want that to be permissionless uh but it's sort of unclear how we would do that and sort of look one of the big open classes we have is like how do we avoid sort of this uh like arbitrary sequencer type of ordeal with these wallet nodes like if you know Searchers can sort of get like 10 milliseconds Edge on uh you know undoist updates from uh from this like wallet node and they're probably going to co-locate they're probably also going to spam um so that's that's one thing we're absolutely considering um yeah and I think that's like basically it cool yeah are you going to Dropbox no boxes no boxes cool um yeah I think there's like tons of like in the you know the questions in the last round there a lot of things that come up like if wallets have more agency I think it's uh you know even if they do use a permission Searcher set like why wouldn't they just build their own in-house search for the background um I think we're seeing that online so a lot of validators are starting to build back running into their clients so you know it cuts latency so we like that seems like a natural step for a while it's to take um it's uh that's something I'm thinking about yeah we're gonna be something else yes I I think uh specifically osmosis you went through the differences really fast you're just high level repeat what you just said about the main differences I got it's like so wallet Matchmaker here yes do you have the official privacy ability or no we don't but it's something you know we would definitely yes um sure yeah yeah I haven't can you I have a hack MD actually we start the auction at the unsigned transaction that's also a slight difference um and so once we get the unsigned transaction we sort of start the auction um as well as like publish the auction and so that's where we reveal a small subset of the swap of either yogurt initially we're focused on swaps sort of where the majority of this is and sort of interested in taking like the qualifying approach here um yeah so we published the auction with like some subset of the unsigned transaction um from there we accept in new bids uh after that auction period is over we stop the auction pick the highest bid um science for bundle and then from there these law boost node sends out to the Builder um how do you stop the the like winning bit of a mistake like not exceeding the transactions so the note operator requests assigned payload from the winning bidder and the node will stimulate it to verify that it's legitimate before it sends it otherwise it will just go through so the next highest point yeah okay but so even then something that we've learned about performance um so you can like here business bundles aren't actually all the same in that um what what happens to execution obviously like different bundles react differently to different changes to state that precede them and so you might have um someone's betting very high but as because including so why they need the state to be very favorable well datability to make sense and then the battle rewards today is there any changes to stay there unfavorables um you know and that makes sense from a social perspective but you might not understand about something does that make this my question yeah I think so I mean yeah that's I think like how do you think and then send all those instead and so most donors but I'm working algorithm which is probably there I think it's because you might have some some issue with one God and the same level right yeah yeah totally I mean well that's why we're also focused on like a permission set at first yeah that is probably lots of things we haven't thought about so this kind of gives us like some type of control so yeah it wasn't that answers how does like are there economics for a mobile wallet um the wallet yeah yeah oh that's okay like as versus like a desktop on it or these are bad images of time too I guess I feel like the economics might be slightly that is good versus the best stuff whatever whatever the answer okay that's interesting I don't know I haven't thought about it Mobile versus desktop I think like our thought was like the wallet sort of sets like a b it expects and then so like when we do the simulation we guarantee that the wallet sort of gets that feedback but um foreign [Music] do I get paid if I'm deploying a wallet I'm gonna feel like it is right you would like it to pick the fee but uh sorry the idea is like movie is additive so attractive from the the total map as soon as I can add on yeah yes yeah it's like they wouldn't get paid anything if there was no matter yeah no I'm saying does the user wait who pays the fee all right yeah like I guess sort of the Searcher since they're extracting the value okay like what what would be like an estimate for MLG oh right uh not sure right right that's like you only know until the option goes here two weeks ago if that has that picture because basically you might be sponsors don't get money so if your wife is even like please excuse me and then decide whether they want to hear they want to share yeah yeah good advice up front before I I mean every company will activate it right because I mean that's the connecting things right yeah the um the swaps that would happen would be very similar to what happens today so you should be able to look at this your um the swaps that you're using to make on your platform and do some sort of analysis to figure out how much any video is captured and then figure out that's worth employing okay let's start I think it might be the details sure fair enough um yeah like it would be done on researchers to happen and so they would sort of get some like settings right um is our Rose Master asleep yeah okay so now you've heard a few different designs okay can you be mean and roast the designs yeah so I think my my meanest thing is that it seems like that uh and this is mostly mean to like me and you're gonna swap because I'm like it all this should be happening right like the idea that users are creating transactions that creates so much energy that it's worth creating a whole infrastructure in order to barter about how to get it back to them it's like mostly just like don't do that right um and so I think like uh is one question is am I right that most of this MAV they were talking about who's created is Dex so that this doesn't happen that'd be cool right [Music] well um Dan before you design a better decks okay now which one um what do you think of existing designs that has been proposed yeah I I think I think I think it's all very interesting I'm not I look I don't understand well enough um how much of are you leaking by like just the fact of the trade as opposed to the ability to trade against it like when people are are buying sorts or are they looking like just to see the trade to like know what they're happening or is it mostly about like background email or I think background yeah yeah and that was one of the things we considered is like you could just watch the stream and not participate in the auction that's definitely uh a consideration that we have a challenge of this but um there's no guarantee since this is it's at the intent level there's no guarantee that the transaction never happens because they haven't signed it yet information like before the user had clicked on it just like oh they're looking at this train that we're trying to put it back to um right and sort of yeah yeah and I guess what I mean by that is that you see the information and you go and take some actions that they thought but should you be able to internalize that uh through selling the rights sort of background the phrase what are you going to do if there's like a very low trade you probably buy yourself a little bit more orange right well if you have the actual training you can have like perfect out of this you know it's going to happen and you will only do this thing that's it perfect yeah but could you even front run if uh the person signs it they create a bundle they send it to the Builder and then you try and Frontline it wouldn't that make that bundle worker so like how would they how'd they both happen like you'd have to take advantage of the information is not an ethereum but I think my point is that uh maybe there's some amounts of information you can internalized just from the information about you that'd be linked that is separate than the atomic effects so yeah so I guess because I think if your leading information then I sort of worry about the trust assumptions and like who you're saying who's a Matchmaker which is to but if it's more about just the trade itself than I think I think I um like it makes sense um yeah I don't know I think it's I think it's it's reason like I think my main roast would be that it's solving the problem that shouldn't use this but that's not your fault um dealing with the consequences of your actions yes um question for Den so is there a world of um wallet share um and how does that work compatibility yeah yeah uh I don't like I don't know I think we have to like move up an abstraction layer in the interface potentially and create some type of like modularity that we could you know um whoever's implementing you know like whoever whoever's integrating this can sort of have the optionality of choosing between them or maybe future ones I think is a potential thing another thing is maybe we just like help contribute to the Matchmaker code base and like sort of test out this other idea of like you know get a couple wallets to run a Matchmaker that you know they run as opposed to like using the flush maker just two previous videos and I think like in the abstract since the both wallet boost and webshare are just who are you sharing information with what information are you sharing and what's the rules of the auction like these three things maybe there's a fourth thing I have about it too hard um and I think then it's a choice because who is also running from software too maybe that's the fourth thing um and having like a standardized set of apis and a way to think about this and to a central arts research and an open Collective makes sense totally yeah and I think like if if we were to like experiment with having wallets running a Matchmaker um yeah is probably important to have like some type of like interface that they could set the Privacy for the user because I think that could be a pain point is like users like it would be interesting seeing a user like select how much information they want to reveal like at the uniswap UI yeah they think that shareable I mean what the user said all the all those parameters on privacy or with the wallet or both uh I think the answer is like whoever wants to everybody so the engineer is like interested in settings I want to share this particular program right if you're friends on this contact then empowered to them and we'll open up that API otherwise we'll let the Oracle originator like the wallet do it otherwise we'll try to have sensible defense anywhere within the supply chains um self trolling um anyone in this room actually uh would never run a Matchmaker um anyone actually um think that what you do today might give you an edge money and a Matchmaker that makes sense here we go well I'm curious like what Edge would it give you building the software all right what Edge does it give us or what Edge do I have yeah uh oh yeah besides manage running yeah from the ecosystem that's experience running infrastructure like this software design and software yeah and I definitely get it it's pretty that way yeah um yeah well I mean I think there's gonna be like a similar issue with like the relay where it's like you know a lot of infrastructure and unless you were profiting from it it's foreign thank you yeah single connections oh I forgot you're from Rook I was looking for someone to do a quick tldr five minutes of the rock but I forgot you were in the room sorry um to our products
