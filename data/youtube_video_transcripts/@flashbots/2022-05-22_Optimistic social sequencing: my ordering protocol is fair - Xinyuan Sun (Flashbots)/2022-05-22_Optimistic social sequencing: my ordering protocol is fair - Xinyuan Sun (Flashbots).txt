[Music] you know what's unfair with his fairness i stumbled i don't know and i couldn't glimpse into the vast oceanic knowledge of his and then i asked please enlighten me i think he whispered us as us to my ear the end is here and then i spent a lot a long time last night to think what did he mean but then then i had this epiphany that us actually means optimistic social sequencing and that is what i'm going to talk to you today to spare spread the gospel of the kaiju of the cthulhu the ultimate ordering protocol and uh yeah so i'm basically going to roast all of the other political designs and finally come to the inclusive cthulhu's enlightenment first fair ordering by randomness what if your destiny your faith is designed by god does god play dice we don't know but that sounds fair right so as many of you here probably know that theoretically by randomness encourages spam and spam crosses network congestion which in turn causes high fees and that is a clear negative externality of mev on this kind of random fair ordering chains so what about ferrari by the majority receive order which is the og fairness notion and uh so this quickly turns into a latency game which causes collusion and centralization and therefore you know vertical integration between validators and searches if you take out and take the hood of the validator you will see you know under the hood there are actually amiib searches most of them so boom roasted fair ordering by commit review what if we cryptography cryptographically in encode all the transactions and then after their mind we review what they are so as we know we all know uh committee review schemes require person to decode the transaction and the person who decodes the transaction have a more pro is a more pro probabilistic advantage at backgrounding the review transactions than others so naturally this also causes collusion centralization between the cryptographic key keepers and the actual searchers so boom roasted fair ordering by being ad hoc what if fair ordering doesn't work for general computation but then can we actually have a fair link for application specific chains so this is basically what what if we assume uh more we have more assumptions for the players so study have shown that units of liquidity providers or generally any amm liquidity providers loses the most and maybe because they just post their orders that are waiting to be sniped so they are the biggest losers but then who are the biggest winners uh in in this just last year august to october you can see that all of the flash boss bundles there are they you know the number picked at the bundles that paid more than 95 percent of the total and ev extracted to validators so naturally validators are in approved position they control blocks based so they are the biggest winners of meb so the idea of this is that what if we make the biggest losers also the biggest winners this idea correspond to requiring that you have a liquidity provider rlp token in order to stake in the network and become a validator so in this way uh you know imei is kind of conserved but of course this creates a much lemon situation where there is adverse selection you know the players not necessarily have incentive aligned so roasted fair ordering by burning uh this corresponds to yeah so this idea is basically i take all the mev and then i burned so that all the base token con based consensus layered token holders gets a fair share of their mev this is this corresponds to having a universal basic income for every east holder right and but of course this creates the same problem that it is not inside incentive aligned because what if a user gets sandwiched the user loses the mev but then all the mev goes to still you know uh the person who holds east but the user not necessarily hoses so this also inherently favors you know big holders which are just wells so roasting fair ordering by maximum efficiency of course this is the argument saying that by extracting the most mev i'm actually uh so this is the argument used by hackers right by hacking you i have warned everybody that this is hackable and such you will be able to better defense this we all know where this is leading to a predatory behavior on ching but of course this uh philosophically i think aligns with effective altruism on ching and we know all those crypto billionaires ftx spf no no offense is gonna um it's gonna do to us and uh yeah then what if we make fair audience by making the cost of extraction always greater than mb you you hear all those people say that mev is uh a trust assumption model problem right we should all assume everybody to be rational instead assuming some people are honest and some people are malicious so under a ration all rational model assumption if we always make the cost of extraction to grow super super linearly to the immediate that is extractable on this chain then all rational actors wouldn't extract them you right this sounds very good then the problem with this is that is that this is kind of essentially the same as making everybody's life harder so that they are not in a mood to extract them maybe which isn't a very good solution but of course that's arguable but uh so roasting ferrari by social norms this is garen chester she's he's the chairman of fcc what if he says everybody who extracted mbb we are going to call fbi come here and waterboard you uh right then nobody would dare to extract that maybe but the problem is this is of course we are back in the old days um roasting what if we have fair ordering by centralization and enshrinedness so suppose we have a uni-swap protocol or any amm that is enshrined into the ethereum consensus layer and then we say that we encode a public key that's in that uh amm contract and we say the only the person who holds a private key to this public key can extract mev in this way there is no negative externality except for centralization right because there won't be spam there won't be you know any latency words but of course the two problems this is that first it creates a central point of failure in the sense that there is only one actor and second is set because there is no competition capital is inefficient the extraction is inefficient so that the chains who have this in shrineness wouldn't be able to compete with other chains their maybe would be cannibalized by other more efficient mob extractors so what if so by now you guys have uh you humans must have all uh figured out that amiv is ultimately an overlapping of user preferences and typically this preference is how prioritized their their transactions are in the blog space but then you come to you come to this realization that all blog builders are actually people who aggregate all users transaction preferences and produce maximally efficient utilitarian best ordering in that block right so what if we produce this thing you know take a utilitarian approach maximum happiness for the maximum uh amount of people but of course this this is the trolley problem who is to say that the transaction preference of five people is greater than the transaction preference of one people right so that there are a lot of nuances in this so what if you know when you see the word fair failure is usually related to equality and what if we have this equality of outcome fair ordering which is basically to say we favor the commons so the idea of this chain would be i have everybody you know either have a social score every area has a social score and i and the probability of me prioritizing the transaction preference of a less privileged people is greater than the probability of i prioritizing the transaction preference of a more privileged people right uh this actually makes sense because it reduces the genie coefficient and seismic everybody have equality of outcome but of course this corresponds to taxes you know kind of like taxes and as many of you have dealt with irs it isn't a very uh pleasant experience and of course there are lots of problems with that so what if we have this equality of opportunity you know corresponding to the quality of outcome we have this opportunity that people who contribute more actually gets more rewards then the problem with this is that imagine a freedom monster let's imagine a monster now without a capacity for joy but the capacity of devious cunning and he always knows how to make trades at an advantage then this freedom monster in the end is going to accumulate all the meb and become a super centralized validator and an ev extractor and sus that is very detrimental to the security of our chain and in real in reality this freedom monster is called megaphones so what if we have fair ordering by retroactive public goods funding you know we extract all the maybe and we put this maybe into public goods funding to actually kind of you know like tax all the criminal activities and then use this use the tax to build infrastructures that everybody use used railroads things like that but of course as all governments there is a human element in this public goods funding process and as you can see here we have the devil tom and the angel jerry in every one of us so it's inherently it inherently has some certain flaws that cannot be dealt with then what if we have failed him by governance that actually you know people vote and choose uh you know the person with the least devil and the most uh angel right then of course this leads to a problem of benevolent dictatorship the person on the left is the uh also the authoritarian dictator of singapore and ligua and he you know arguably under his dictatorsh not dictating under his governance under his governance uh well yeah under his governance the singaporean people on a utilitarian view has more happiness than before right but of course that is one problem with government the second problem is with this uh wittgenstein you know the person on the right that you see here because ancient governance is usually encoding our philosophy of what fair is what morality is into an on-chin smart contract and that smart contract is a computer fun computer function right it is a formal system and the problem with formal systems as many of you might know is that um it has paradoxes and traditionally researchers have have seen that you know as long as the formal system is consistent it is acceptable but consistent isn't a isn't the only element we need to look at more properties but that is a super underdeveloped area so you know governance further by governance is also roasting then what if we have fair ordering by governance and dynamic pricing say that we don't encode the rules into a smart contract we actually use a a dynamic pricing we say that everybody expressed their transaction preferences by a bit by a a monetary value we put on it and then we run an auction for it this is essentially what flashbacks as it is today but uh flashbacks is also not without our problems right so who is to say that everybody wants their preferences to be expressed in a monetary value in a dollar sign right so uh here you know we are coming to the conclusion coming to my epiphany after talking with the kaiju is that is there an actual fair warning that we can do please optimistic social sequencing i present to you the op the ultimate ordering protocol or oz as the the kaiju told me so uh us composed of this first element of a sequence verification program which is a smart contract on layer one or any modular layer right modular blockchain is pretty popular these days like a specialized layer that's just for sequencing and this sequence verification program is a proxy contract that is upgradable by the governance and the governance decides what kind of fairness what kind of sequencing spec specifications they want the actual sequence to adhere to and then we have this program and there's a contract and then suppose we are working on layer on layer 2 on rollup then the layer 2 sequencer sequences a batch and that makes the batch sequence data available in the da layer and then after that the sequencer m plus one will optimistically assume that the sequencer and already produced a fair ordering and that the notion of fare is whichever ordering that adheres to the specification that is written in the sequence verification program determined by governance and then at the meanwhile just as sequencer and plus one is sequencing the next batch um people will run far approvers off-chain to check the sequencing's correctness namely the sequencing of sequencer and and if they found an unfair sequencing they will send the fraud proof and then the a1 sequencing verification contract will check and slashes the dishonest sequences right so on paper this seems to work the pros of this is that us is social in the sense that we have the frequent but not too frequent ordering updates you know and this solves the governance issues and also since this ordering this specification that sequence must adhere to is determined by governance then we can finally say that this sequence ordering protocol is actually fair and other pros include the sequencing program is modular and the the the notion of fairness the notion of morality that everybody agrees on is upgradable and some technical things is like this is this has lower latency because this uh this is optimistic so let's take a look at the example what if we want to do the og fairness to run the same ordering as the aquitas protocol which is the original uh fairness on zk roll ups so in this situation the sequences will make their uh receive other data available and you know we can add extra requirements say that you know if it's not available in a short time then we slash the sequence or something like that but um yeah after they do that the provers will the approvers who generate the dk proofs were optimistically accept the sequencing and generates proofs and the meanwhile the client's office will off chain checks the correctness of the sequencing use the fairness of the sequencing and if a fraud proof is found they submit that flaw proof to an unchained verifier contract and if it verifies the os fro approval will slash the sequencer another example is to a more dystopian one a far-fetched one is for competent searchers so suppose that the governance decides that we all want to pro and movie extraction we want to extract a lot of value from the sequencing then they they might write a sequence verification contract that is a minimalistic searcher you know a easy entry searcher that checks for sandwiches arbitrages and then you know just three other things and and then they would require that the mev extracted in the actual sequence pro provided by the sequencer is greater than the minimalistic arching in contrast search determined by the governance in human words this means that the governance has decided that the block builder has to be competent the researcher has to be competent in its amiib extraction so some use cases of this could be that hey i see i want to donate a million dollars to charity every day and i where does that money come from i want it to come from mev so then i write this contract saying that hey you know in every batch sequencing i require that the imei extracted is greater than one is and if it's not you know i fire you then you know then then basically the the sequencer gets slashed or some more dystopian example could be you know a performance evaluation for me traders that if the trader is incoming he gets slashed he or she gets slashed um so with all those examples we see epiphany with the gospel of the cthulhu you have it has brought us to the final takeaway so uh mev is created if there is an overlap of user preferences there is no good and or bad mov you know amiv is just created if there's an overlap and people have overlaps all the time it's hard to say whose preference is good whose preferences is bad you know the trolley problem and the second takeaway is that whoever is in the position to allocate resources to overlapping preferences is an immediate searcher or a blog builder and that leads us to three mev is a governance problem just the same as it is a security problem which means that the future is multi-domain with an ev conservation between each chain so imag just as governance are self-assembled people with similar ideologies from a government and the future may be you know a domain that the us sequence verification contract is determined by people with similar preferences for their smart con for their transaction ordering and why an ev conservation between each domain is because if we don't have miv conservation then people who have less immunity extraction you know people with fair ordering preferences would be cannibalized or like have their chain be extracted more and maybe by people who actually believe in effective altruism or some  like that right um and then uh the the fourth point and the most important one is that uh mev is governance complete meaning that the problem of mvv is actually as hard as the pr at least as hard as the problem uh of building a good government building a good governance mechanism and maybe all blockchain problems are governance complete in the end and the fifth problem what we can do right how can we contribute governance is hard and foremost using formal systems to describe to encode our governance preferences our no collective notion of what fair is into a smart country is very dangerous and then the most the best way that we can do is to make governance researchers jobs easier so i'm a re i mean we so by this point i'm an ev researcher my job you know my job is done by us because zulu has spoken that i don't need to work on this anymore it's you know governance researchers job now it's uh you know if there is anybody working on dolls that's your problem and one example of this effort is of course us the the as the kaiju said optim of optimistic social sequencing rules yeah and that's all [Music]
