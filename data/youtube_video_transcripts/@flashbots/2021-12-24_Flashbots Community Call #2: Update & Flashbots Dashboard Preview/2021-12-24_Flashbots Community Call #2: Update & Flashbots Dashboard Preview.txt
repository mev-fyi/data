hi everyone welcome to our second flashback community call this is a monthly event that we tend to hold at the at or near the beginning of the month and um now is almost halfway through the month so it is halfway through the month so thanks for bearing with us uh with a lot of updates so um most of you here may know already flashbacks we are a research and development organization formed to mitigate negative externalities and existential risks posed by mev to smart contract blockchains starting with ethereum our primary focus is to enable the permissionless transparent and fair ecosystem for mvp extraction and it seems like we are on the right to achieving our goals um a bit first on our organization update and then we will proceed to research update engineering update and finally um we will share a sneak peek preview of the flashbots transparency dashboard presented by robert miller so compared to our last community call one of the most uh major difference is our core team has grown from um essentially uh seven to now uh nine almost ten um core groups spread across different continents and with around 20 additional contributors as a crew member from an organizational standpoint we have essentially been focusing a lot of the effort on the engineering side as of late in particular as the hash rate adoption um has picked up and us exceeding 50 so um essentially upholding the quality of the engineering as a core trading uh as a core infrastructure for ethereum is our topmost priority and um in the flashbacks engineering effort most of the focus has been on what we call the flashbacks alpha um which is what has been live since january which composed of mbbs extract or mbb guest implementation plus mev relay however in addition thanks to a very vibrant community we have also been um building up um our tooling around for the ecosystem participants to first utilize and provide a continually improved ux on the flashback alpha we've been rolling out essentially libraries around the um for mev searchers we've been providing um test net supports and lastly um one of our core team's responsibility we take it on our shoulder is to essentially provide transparency through maintaining the blocks of flashback.net api and as well as putting out publishing the flashbacks um transparency report that hopefully in the future one or two months will morph into a real-time flashback transparency dashboard and um lastly um as you uh as we have uh shared in our last community call our mev inspect and um visualize through mev explorer has been an um a uh important effort uh as part of the joint effort and now joined by etherscan and many others uh in illuminating the dark forest another major development um over the past course of past month has been with mevs gx which is crucial to the flashbacks 1.0 roadmap which we will cover on the engineering updates on the other hand research has been where we came from and where we will continue to give back to the community and um without further ado i would like to invite alejo salas our research director to share about our focus in the past month on research sure tina thank you i like i like it better when you call me sailing master though but all right so welcome everybody to our community call um so this has been a nice month for research we kicked off the a series of blog posts uh with a with a with a post on quantifying the realized extractable value by the different actors in the system so minor searchers and in particular defining a metric for the extractable external value cost which is um the the sum of negative externalities that the mev extracting activity imposes on the system and so this is a summary way of seeing how uh to what extent the movies is harmful and and it's what we flashbots are trying to to reduce and and i have to say there's been talk about how gas prices recently in ethereum have uh dropped significantly and and part of that being due to flashbacks actually uh making everything more efficient right and and and uh making this cost not being paid by the users essentially so reducing this this external cost one one this is on the on the first point we will have more uh coming up i'll talk about a little bit in a second uh we have a community research highlight so a research post by by our community by georges and leo and this is a very interesting post and looking at the block space economics both from the supply and demand side so i encourage you to check that out and we had an uh super interesting mvv roast hosted by vitalik where we um discussed many interesting upcoming topics for for me particularly maybe on l2 and and if to also vitalik suggested uh the use of um flashbots for account abstraction so this is one one topic we are also looking into so for enemy fellowships we have another round of funding uh so we have a flashwatch research proposal mechanism i encourage you all to check our our research repository on github that's our our hub for research where this process is described in detail essentially we have some research areas that we want to tackle and and and we open uh that to the community so anyway in the community can come and open a github issue with a course id or submit an frp which is some of a more well-formed proposal for for doing research along one of these these topics and and then we we issue grants so we just issued a grant to hashcloak on working on mempool privacy all right so so one of our big challenges ahead in terms of roadmap is achieving full privacy so right now you know that we run a relay and and we trust that miners will not misuse the the bundles we send them we ultimately want to um make a system that that stands on its own and that doesn't need us as a relay and that that is private in the sense that miners do not have the the ability to to to see the the bundles we send them right so this is part of the research in that direction one of the directions here when we will talk more on the engineering side is the sgx um latina already mentioned good so again i encourage you all to check our research repo propose issues there submit frps and we have grants that we will extend to the to the most promising proposals so as of next steps for priority and in terms of research we are we have a the second upcoming uh post on the research series on mev on if two which has been worked on by our own steward alex together with the prismatic labs people so stay tuned that's going to be super exciting we're going to announce that when it's out uh we're going planning on doing some work on fair sequencing thing as you might be aware we got recently criticized by by some people that are proponents of fair sequencing uh uh uh dubbing us like thiefs or or enablers of thieves so we really want to be open and we we always welcome uh criticisms so we're gonna be open with with what we think about this and and the problem with fair sequencing essentially is who who calls what is fair right so who decides what is fair fair has no universal definition so anyway but this is an interesting research topic and something we want to want to pursue uh to try to have like a constructive dialogue with the people that are favoring the first sequencing approach over the auctioning one um yeah quantifying concerns on security harm this is another topic again related to what i said before in terms of extractable value cost and trying to quantify and be be be very upfront on on the extent to which uh flashbots is helping the the ecosystem and again this is gonna come back uh when robert shows you the the dashboard we've been working on so yep that's the update i encourage you to check the research repo and back to you tina sounds great thanks our sailing master for keeping us on track so um the next part i want to mix it up a little bit um robert what do you think about uh sharing a bit of the highlights of the flashbacks transparency dashboard so that we can before we sell into the engineering updates we can have a sense of how much adoption attraction we have been getting and what may be some concerning trends or interesting insights we may be able to see from this dashboard that will soon hopefully be available for everyone um to check out real time right now we're collecting feedback robert would you like to um share a bit on the um flashbacks transparency dashboard i'm more than happy to dina thank you so much appreciate it so i will steal the ball from you on the screens here so like tina said in in line with our goal of bringing transparency to med activity we want to release these real-time dashboards surface metrics that we think are important to the community and med more broadly and what i would ask from you in the in the audience today is if you see um any metrics here you think are really important and need to be highlighted more please give me feedback and if there are other things that you want to see please send them to me or add them in our community discord you know we really want to make this a valuable tool for you so i really would just love any feedback on this so we have three different dashboards for three different sets of core stakeholders here we have a dashboard for searchers for miners and for the overall network and there's a lot of information here so i can't get through it all but i will try to show you the highlights of it i'll start with our searcher dashboard so in our searcher dashboard we have some top level metrics on adoption by searchers and trying to quantify how many different searchers are using our system at any given time and this is actually a pretty complex problem because there are are several different ways you could measure the unique number of searchers using flash spots instead of choosing just one we surface three different methods here the number of unique eoas that end up landing on chain the number of unique contracts that searchers are interacting with and the number of unique searchers within the relay and no matter what way you cut this or what metric you use it's pretty clear that our graph is going up into the right over time as more searchers enter the system and in particular there's been a lot of growth in the last two weeks almost doubling some of our metrics we've placed almost 32 000 bundles on chain over time um and we can measure uh 503 total unique searchers within the relay over time so we're actually retaining most of the unique searchers in the relay that we um that we have and there's a about 70 or so that haven't been active within the last week which is the discrepancy between this 430 number and 503 i think these graphs are super interesting we're showing here the distribution of gas prices for the bundles as well as the tail gas price so as a reminder to everybody the tail gas price is the gas price of what would have been the last transaction within a block and when a flashback bundle is included in a block we end up displacing that tail transaction and we need the bundle to have a effective gas price that is higher than that last transaction in order for it to make sense for the miner to include the bundle in a block um and again it's sort of difficult to get the right metric for what um average bundle gas prices over time they really vary as you can see in this chart down here but i like this top chart that shows you what the minimum bundle gas price is in green over over one day what the median is in yellow and then the the 75th percentile of bundle gas prices within a day and the 25 percent of our gas prices within a day in blue and red respectively and then the tail gas price is this purple line which you can see is almost always below the gas prices of the bundles except for the minimum in a day and these over time are getting higher and higher on average as more competition enters the system along with the searcher metrics i'm going to skip over this chart again it's just the gas prices of the mind bundles except not smoothed out over the day and you're not taking the median or anything we have a couple leaderboards here of the top flashback searchers by the number of each they've paid to the miners and their average and then total minor payments as well so if you're interested you can go and see who is our top eoa uh what's the top contract that's being interacted with and how much money have they paid miners in comparison to others and and spoiler the top ua in the top contract is the person that has been sniping token listings um and they had that 100 eth bundle i think two weeks ago now this is a a different way of representing the same information uh who are our top 25 eoas that have paid miners of the most amount of money and how do our top 25 compare to the rest of our searchers our 500 or so searchers so it turns out that our top 25 account for roughly 80 of the total payment to miners and it even gets pretty top heavy here with this one eoa in particular paying 14 percent of all eth or 962 each two miners in total and the same sort of story can be told about contracts except it's a little bit more top-heavy with the top 25 contracts paying out more as a percentage basis than the top eoas it's kind of interesting we do the same thing for gas consumption too i won't rest on here but you can see who our top gas schedulers are in terms of eoas and contracts and then we list some of the largest bundles in total in terms of the total miner payout so most of these are token siphons i think except for this 40.25 which is a giant arb that used our simple arbitrage bot actually and then the largest bundles as number of transactions which are super interesting to see what people are doing so those are our search for metrics again would love to hear feedback and hear other things that people find meaningful so post it in the chat or in our discord or dm me on twitter or something and i'll switch to the network view of things so in total miners have profited 5276 eth from running flash plots and this metric is what we call realize extracted uh value so minor realize expected value and it takes the total amount of eth that a miner has received as part of flashpots and it subtracts the opportunity cost of the transactions that they would be displacing and so you can think of this as sort of the pure profit that they're making um from running flashbacks right now we have 55.37 percent of hashrate that is onboarded to flashbots um it's sort of difficult to reason about what percentage of this hash rate is actually running any v-gas at any given time but we'll get to that in a bit and you can see some top-level metrics on the number of bundles that have been sent to the relay how many are forwarded to miners included on chain and et cetera and the difference between a bundle sent to the relay versus ford is is a bunch of these bundles received end up failing our simulation so there's no reason to send them on you have some top level growth in the number of bundles i'm going to really quickly fix this so some top level growth and the weekly number of bundles that have been submitted and the reason why these numbers drop off is because the week is not over yet um and as such this number is going to be lower because there's still a couple more days in the week for us to submit bundles and all of these again are just like up and to the right exponential growth in the last two weeks or so catalog the rate at which bundles are included in in ten thousand block increments so this is very reflective of the hash rate that is actually running mevgath a hockey stick up all the way to about 30 of blocks in a 10 000 block range are running uh are have bundles included in them and sort of interesting is the rate at which we forward bundles to the minor which is the percent of time the bundles over time are passing the simulation the last two things we have for this this network view are the amount of times that a flashback's block was mined where a bundle was actually present in it which is kind of an interesting metric to view um how often our flashback searchers are getting within the block and this is a super meaningful and interesting graph that scott made which looks at the amount of transactions on the normal mempool not through flashbots that are paying more than two eth and you can guess that they're doing this because they're engaging in priority gas auctions and then the amount of transactions through flash bots that have paid more than two e's is part of their payment and there's sort of an inverse correlation that you can look at here as flashbots ascends uh the pga gas wars are descending um and maybe this is a strong indicator that flashpots is reducing overall network congestion and actually we don't have any data points after the fifth for the number of two eth transactions through the normal mempool in pgas none of them have reached over to eth i think so lastly we have our minor dashboard again super interesting um like i said before about 5 000 eth has been paid to miners that are running um mev geth and this number is their top line profit so it subtracts the opportunity cost of transactions that they're displacing and this is the same metric except done in dollar values and we're taking the value of eth at the time that it was paid out instead of just multiplying this number by the value of eth when you look at it over time we are getting an average of 0.17 extra eth to minor that are running mevgef uh and this is a slightly outdated number but the currently onboarded hash rate um as you saw before is is a little bit less than that yeah 55 so that needs to be updated and you can look at this average per block profit and weekly profit from flashbacks over time again up into the right and it's interesting to see the totals per week as well as going in and seeing which particular miner is realizing the most value from flashbacks who's getting paid the most um of course according to their hash rate over time and monthly which i find a little bit easier to reason about you just multiply monthly by 12 and come to annual rates this is a super interesting graph so this looks at the effective gas price of flashbots bundles and then it looks at the gas price of transactions that were displaced by flashback bundles so what i was calling the tail gas price earlier and you can see here this is in logarithmic actually so these numbers are way higher than the tail gas price and flashbacks bundles are always almost always paying far far far greater than the transactions that they are displacing over time there's an interesting distribution of the profits of flashbacks bundles here so um you know in a given 10 000 block range what uh how large are the profits comparative to all the other bundles um so in here for example 53 percent are within one one hundredth of an eighth to one tenth of an eighth trying to speed up a little bit here um we show how often flashbacks bundles are included by miners for ten thousand blocks so in a ten thousand block range on this particular week there was about three thousand uh bundles that were included and you can sort of use this graph in order to infer the amount of hash rate that's running medgath at any given time lastly there's this uh bundle inclusion rate which you you previously saw on the network so i won't go over it too much more and we have some uh some leader boards here for the top miners that are getting paid the most eve uh that have earned the most youth rather and that on average are making the most ease from the blocks that they uh they mine using mevguf um and over time we can actually measure this the med reward as a as a percentage of vanilla rewards so we're currently sitting at about five percent extra uh minor income from running med f and we can look at the median bundle gas price versus the median tail gas price uh which tells a pretty similar story to the gas price graphs that we've seen thus far and the the interesting thing here is like these trailed each other for a long time about two months of flashbacks being out open in the wild which implies that if you had a bundle you could sneak in just above what the tail gas price was of course it always has to be above on any given block but at around march 1st this median bundle gas price increased greatly and what you can infer from that is competition for inclusion in a flat spots block increased a lot over that period of time and it's getting more competitive over time as well so those are all of the metrics that i have tina i don't know if you want to stop and get comments or feedback or if we want to move on to the rest of the agenda um i think there's a lot of question going on in the site chat um i suggest um everyone leave your mess leave your questions and we can uh on the side chat and then we can come back to it um towards the end of the call because there will be a lot of questions i would not be surprised um once again we're very very interested in getting this dashboard out to you as soon as possible once we fix as you could see as we're sharing there's still some inconsistency we're trying to correct across our table a lot of the charts where you know we need to know what you care about what you want to see and we also need to respect a lot of the uh more the data the privacy of the individual uh search robots um on the network so uh how to strike a balance um is currently what we're trying to resolve um so once you have the dashboard if anyone is interested in uh testing them out um feel free to reach out to robert um we have uh essentially just like all of our flashbacks product because they're um going to be uh readily available soon so feel free to um ping robert if you would like to uh test it and get some feedback before we release the v0 version on database great um so shall i take over the screen sharing chris so next um i would like to invite um um our captain um stefan to um share a bit about our engineering timeline and um in light of a lot of things has happened um berlin happened last night um and flashback uh over 50 happened to flashbots so um what has the core engineering team been up to can everyone see my screen yeah we can see perfect steph go ahead sweet uh thanks tina and that dashboard look incredible um i can't wait to have that in the public and for people play around with um okay the alien is dancing perfect then i have everything set up correctly um so we've been really busy on the engineering side uh you know luckily enough we've had the chance to grow our uh the reliability of our relay over the last few months since we launched the alpha at the beginning of january so we've been able to handle the additional load um from from all the new interest quite well things have been scaling up nicely most of our focus however has been around accelerating the way that we ship new features so now that we are uh working with about 12 different pools and they all have their own implementation uh yeah that's a good one reliability and they all have their own implementation of muv guests um there's some coordination required to make sure that the upgrades happen seamlessly amongst all of them and there isn't some um some change in the way that each of them do bundle inclusion because that could have a material impact on the revenues that the searchers actually have so how we going about this well we proposed an upgrade process um which you'll be able to find on the discussion board under the v 0.2 proposal if you look at the the flashbots pm repo and this proposes essentially a process through which we collect feedback from the community propose a spec implement the reference implementation as well as a formal specification for mev gap and then we provide time for miners to integrate and uh start rolling out the new updates to their to their nodes we want to process everything as rolling upgrades so that uh during a given point in time we can have a versioning across uh two two breaking changes that are reflected out to the searchers um such that the searchers default to upgrade to the new version but they can specify if they want to remain on the previous version and then at which point they would only be pointed towards the miners who are running the the previous version so now that we have the process together then the question is what do we actually put into the v0.2 release um we have sort of the core proposal that has the list of all the features that we've identified as the core priorities some of them that you guys have been asking for a while around bundle merging is definitely something that we're looking to integrate also changing some things around the bundle pricing and around some of the performance on communication side between the relay searchers and the and miners i'd say finally um the big change that we're proposing is uh um a structured approach to defining what are the fair market principles that flashbots um aims to uphold for the ecosystem as a whole um as you guys are aware in the flashbots alpha we have incomplete cryptographic guarantees right and there's a requirement for some level of trust in any relay that the searcher uses but also any minor that receives the bundles from the searchers um and so these guidelines essentially provide a set of rules um by which miners and ourselves flashpods can be expected to um to uphold um and if we don't essentially the community can be really angry at us and shun us and potentially if a miner does not um uphold these principles we can um we can withhold future bundles from them until they uh come back into compliance with them so i encourage you guys to to read through these uh flashbacks fair market principles it should answer a lot of questions around the trust requirements of this system and and would love some feedback on this so for the v 0.2 release um the proposal has a timeline and it's expected to be launching towards the beginning of the month of may um we're still in the phases of collecting some feedback and building the reference implementation and we've actually released a pre-release to the miners that includes some changes to the um the bundle pricing algorithm um as well as the ability for all bundles to be atomic and to never revert on chain so both of these changes aim to better uphold the initial design that we were striving towards as a system which is to prevent reverts from landing on chain as well as always produce more profitable blocks than vanilla blocks so we released them as a pre-release so that the miners had a chance to upgrade to those early and it shouldn't have any consequences for for searchers it should just improve their their guarantees um but the remaining features we likely won't release them until uh the end of the month so we're still collecting feedback on these we'd love for you guys to come engage with us on the discussion boards and um and tell us what what we should build and how so that pretty much covers that i think on the engineering side so tina i'll pass it back to you sounds great um so um i have a couple questions for our captain here so um would you please share with everyone here a bit more details on the latest um pre-release and how it impacts the searcher and the uh and the miner because we have already seen um five out of 12 mining pools uh finished um adopting uh the uh changes that we have released in the pre-release two days ago and um they're very quick to uh make the uh changes so um so that those changes will quickly uh be reflected um if you run the bot um and to see the success rate so perhaps share a bit on how the the change that just got implemented will impact um two sets of the markets sure yeah um good point so let's maybe look at the bundle pricing first so the original formula was uh calculating an implied gas score for each bundle looking at i'm looking at the first equation up here so it's looking at v direct which is direct minor payments along with the summation of the gas price times gas used of all the transactions in the bundle and then it's dividing that by the total gas used in the bundle and so this gives us an implied gas price in terms of g way which allows us to sort the transactions and select the best one to to be included now there's some concerns around this because it creates an incentive for searchers to essentially accelerate their bundles by bringing regular transactions from the mempool that may not have been picked up by the miner or use some sort of race condition such that they're evaluated before the vanilla block is processed and this allowed for some less profitable bundles to end up landing on chain still within a very reasonable margin of error but regardless in an attempt to mitigate some of these issues we've effectively removed gas prices from the bundle scoring equation so at the bottom here what you see is the new scoring equation that only looks at direct payments over uh gas used so now any bundle that gets included will need to do a direct payment and only the direct payment is considered valid so this changes some things are on the searcher side for how they can estimate the amount of value that they are delivering to the searchers um if any i mean to the miners if any of the searchers are using purely gas price that will no longer be compatible and then on the minor side like like i mentioned this should eliminate some edge cases some race conditions where less profitable bundles so the second change which is on [Music] bundle reversions so this is an issue where there could be some undeterministic behavior based off of branching code paths i think robert had a great example of that of a sandwich trader being targeted by um both uh either salmonella tokens or uh i i don't remember what the the name of the second version i think the yolo chain token um they would both cause uh reverts in the bundles that were unexpected and weren't being caught through simulation and so this changed to the mvv guest level of the um of the system essentially prevents these kinds of roberts from landing on chain and thereby upholding the objectives that flashbots has which is to keep keep chain congestion of mv activity to a minimum so yeah on the minus side less reverts on the social side less reverts and that pretty much covers it um and same question applies to some of the um more i would say um interesting uh uh changes that we're proposing and collecting feedback maybe sharing a bit more light on the implication the the changes that hasn't actually been incorporated but is collecting feedback in my opinion are major changes um that uh affects both minors and searchers and including how you write your bots as well as how much your pool can make um so stefan would you like to also give more color on how the uh following uh five core v the 0.2 features that we plan on implementing but would like to hear from the community and how that impact miners and searchers sure yeah so there's there's a lot to go through here but i'll try my best to give a highlight of what they are and why i personally think that they're important so first first off is bundle merging um so up to this point the way that flashbots worked was a pure auction between all searchers for inclusion at the top of the next block that's great for um for for researchers that find really really profitable strategies but there might be searchers that are looking more at the long tail of strategies that are slightly profitable but aren't able to compete with some of the large the large transactions so bundle merging essentially proposes a method by which we can combine both of those uh systems now the open question that we have um at flashbacks is where should the bundle merging occur and there's essentially three three levels at which it can occur it can happen on mavgeth directly it can happen on the relay or it can happen on the searcher side and so we're still in the discussions of where exactly that should take place in the proposal what you'll see is an algorithm for how the merging can take place at mev get but we're concerned that there might be some inefficiencies in doing it there and it might bring in some some side effects and so it would be great to get some feedback on on at which level do you guys believe the bundle of merging should should happen and is there um any concerns that you have with the algorithms proposed for for merging on giga the next big change is the proxy payment contract so this payment contract would essentially provide a standard way for direct payments to happen for all uh miners who are receiving bundles from the flashbots relay the there's a few reason uh maybe a few design goals that we have in building a smart contract for rounding payments one of them is it provides better guarantees or better ways for the miners to quarry the amount of value that they've received from mev this has been a very common request because up to now the only way that they could do it is by either inspecting um transaction traces on the chain or querying our api where we essentially inspect the transaction traces on their behalf and provide them the uh the results um they were asking for a more native way where they could simply query their node to to obtain these values and this is directly enabled by a smart contract because we can we can log all the payments as events and they can begin query for those the other feature has been requested is splitting off the payments from muv to be separate from the payments for uh inclusion um so uh and particularly doing so in a trustless way so this new contract what it provides is a way for the block.coinbase address to specify a recipient that gets forwarded the meb payments um one way that i think is interesting to think about this is in the 1559 world post july um this allows a miner to uh uh specify who receives the base fee and a different address to receive the uh the tips uh the tips being sort of it is in this version of the world uh the muv flashbacks payments so the other third design consideration is not actually one that we rolled out in this version of the proxy contract but one that we would love to roll out in the future which is to improve the security of the chain as a whole by creating an economic incentive for um or maybe i would say an economic disincentive for uh preventing time-banded attacks so time-banded attacks are essentially attacks where miners see the history of uh of blocks on ethereum and they notice that there was a large muv event that exposed you know potentially millions of dollars in value but is vulnerable to being uh would have been vulnerable to being frustrated um so what the miner can then do is uh essentially start mining on an old part of the chain and start accumulating new blocks on that new chain um potentially hiring a bunch of hash rate or buying a bunch of hash rate on houston marketplaces and uh creating a multiple block deep uh reorg of the chain to be able to capture this immediate opportunity and essentially steal it so that's called a time-binded attack and it has some serious negative externalities on the network because it breaks finality essentially it creates creates what's called consensus instability where it's more difficult to know if your transaction has successfully been included in the chain because the chain tip always gets reorg um so that's the major concern that we have flashbacks have about the dangerous nature of meb i'd say one of the two existential risks that we've set out to to mitigate um the other one being centralization but these time-banded attacks can potentially be mitigated by having some smart contract that is able to spread the muv fees across multiple future blocks thus creating a bounty or an incentive for continuing to mine on the longest chain so that's something that we're looking to roll out in the future and the proxy payment contract provides the first step in that direction um let's see i'll cover the next three relatively quickly so full block submission on mev guest provides a way for the relay to provide a full block template to the miners and this essentially brings up uh the opportunity for us to do bundle merging on the relay side or provide searchers with the ability to do bundle merging uh themselves so it's opening up a path for us to be able to introduce those those new levels of bundle merging the next change websockets is simply to improve the performance of communication between searchers the relay and miners by routing everything over websockets instead of http rbc and then finally the strict profit switching so this has been to help further mitigate a potential race condition in which um the flashbots blocks get validated and processed faster than the vanilla blocks on on m b guess and in particular for miners who are running a second layer of profit switching on top of mbbgath they might not update their blocks as frequently um and so they might be mining on a sub-optimal uh flashback block for longer than they would otherwise so this just adds a config parameter to me guest that allows miners to uh specify they only ever want to mine on uh flashbots if they've already seen a valid vanilla block for this uh for this chain height um so it simply provides stronger uh profit switching guarantees for for the miners um it's an optional uh configuration which is sort of up to the mining pools to manage how they they deploy it and it shouldn't have an impact on the searchers so i think that's it tina back to you oh great um didn't realize i was on mute um yeah thanks for the presentation um and uh uh the explanation i actually have one more question for you i think everyone here would benefit from is the engineering update on um what's next on the roadmap definitely um so i think uh elejo touched on this earlier uh about how important privacy and and memorable privacy in particular is to uh the efforts that flashbots is trying to achieve um there's some level of privacy that we're able to provide in the alpha but it's privacy based on trust and that is not a stable equilibrium in the long run because the trust guarantees can essentially be can break down over time so what we want to do is get to a point where we have cryptographic guarantees as soon as possible and that's what the mavs gx specification uh aims to provide so it introduces the uh two two core properties one of them is cryptographic uh privacy and the other one is uh dos protection um for uh miners and under any the sgx world the uh flashbots relay doesn't need to exist anymore and it doesn't need to be a trusted counterparty instead anyone is able to build their own relay or connect directly with miners to submit flashboss bundles and then on the um [Music] on the spam side spam protection side um essentially uh the mavs gx also introduces this ability for um for anyone to make proofs on the value that's being contained in their bundles uh without having to process the ability of those bundles um and so uh it provides a way to scale um the the amount of uh inbound uh uh bundles uh without introducing a dos spectrum so really we're really excited about this um and uh this will bring sort of a truly decentralized private mempool to ethereum and will remove us as a trusted counterparty in the system um so it's it's really at the core of of what we're trying to achieve and we're making good progress on it so you can expect a proposal um to be posted soon with the details of of the specification all right so i think that's um all the content that we have prepared for presentation and next let's go into questions i know that we're coming up on time um so feel free to drop if you need to hop up to your daily work meetings but we'll be here hang out to take some questions here um and um just a couple additional notes um the chord uh the the core v 0.2 um there we have posted a formal spec um i think it's linked somewhere in here oh yes um the formal specification um is on the github um so uh definitely um uh read through um and post your comments by the end of this week um so that we can incorporate all of the feedback um um into our next major release and um and um for additional colors on mebs gx um the uh uh we had a presentation on it on march 25th uh at the mev roast and the uh content is already posted um the video and the slides were posted uh on the uh pm ripple so you can check it out for um to learn more about the architecture and how it works and um so let's move on to questions maybe um raise your hand or just directly unmute um if you would like to um discuss or share any thoughts and welcome anyone from the flashbots crew to share some thoughts in response so maybe one thing that we can do here is if you have a question drop it in the chat and then i can call upon you to unmute and ask your question and then we can we can discuss it um there was a good question from shane i think talking about the bundle selection uh formula so if shane if you're still here and you want to unmute and ask your question yeah i was just curious because the new formula is the amount that you pay to the miner divided by the gas used is that correct yes that's correct um and so you can imagine one bundle which uses a lot of gas and another bundle which doesn't use as much gas um like let's say twice as much then the one that uses twice too much has to pay the miner twice as much but from the perspective of the miner you know that might already be at a very high gas price so they might prefer the one that pays twice as much the one that pays a half so i'm just curious um if that scenario or how the formula deals with that scenario or how it could be you know possibly changed to deal with that scenario yeah i think that's a good point um it does create some concerns on like is essentially over indexes the opportunity cost of what you're displacing um because it incentivizes for uh for smaller uh bundles i think in general any equation that uh divides by the gas used is going to have this problem um we we're we're aware of like what the perfect system is right which is to simulate a full block with each bundle and then compare the profitability of the full block um but our expectation is that that's too computationally expensive to be able to scale well on the mev um death notes of the miners so um we uh we're concerned that it just wouldn't be feasible for us to do that kind of comparison on the on the minor side yeah thanks wow what a quiet audience today any comments in general just um i think just feel free to emu yourself or speak up or hear all ears yeah we should also welcome questions on the on the dashboard if you guys are curious about that i think for um because we uh the flash fast team has is pretty distributed and we have many work streams it's just amazing to see um every time during community call our progress from different front um come together so also feel free to uh if there's anyone who are impressed with um you know each other's work um give some comments and suggestions um on how the engineering side has been moving and maybe some ideas or thoughts you would like to share um on the research side as well i wonder if phil you have anything to share um with the community uh no not really really excited to see all you guys here um i think we we saw kind of the next steps in the research roadmap and would really love to get some engagement on asking these hard questions i think we're still like in a phase of formalizing our organizational design that's kind of what we're working on now so giving people easy onboarding into working on research and making sure that output is useful and people have a clear idea of kind of how the research we're doing contributes to the flashbot's narrative and contributes to this engineering side we've seen presented so i encourage you guys to subscribe and to join our research calls and continue participating in the discord i promise we'll have some more kind of formal process uh very soon in the next like month or two we're still kind of setting up the organizational back end we need to support all of that and very excited to share some of the things we're thinking through on that front uh soon yeah um thanks phil for sharing um we've been having a lot of really the reason why we started hosting community call is we take governance um of our project very seriously and we are happy and proud of ourselves to want to experiment with unconventional governance um that doesn't get isn't about um form formality isn't about what we show but uh it's a bit more about how it actually work um so um i would also um encourage the community um in in the future to kind of um share some of the best practices with us in terms of how we bridge the communication between the core team and the community how can we break the boundaries and how can we communicate more effectively for example if we within the flashbacks chord crew we encourage peer-to-peer communication rather than a top-down approach so if um all of us are in discord and you can see our color probably in pink or in some other color and if you would like to have a one-on-one chat with us i think we can always arrange either a call or essentially direct dms to incorporate some of the feedbacks that you may have about our community um of how you would like to contribute currently what the work we do is um uh is technical so um a lot more of the communication um will be more centered around uh technical contribution but essentially how you would like to partake in any of the open source repo or in any of the open research questions i think there's sufficient documentation around the flashbacks getup to get you a head start but always reach out to us on discord well um i think this is um near the end of our of our call i want to point to this exciting event that's happening um recently is the east global scaling hackathon i believe we're going to give a few talks and potentially host a special mev session where we dive deep into mev and scaling also some of our um community members from flashbots um are looking for teammates to hack on cool scaling solutions incorporating an ev auction so um also reach out to us if um in this court uh if you are interested in jamming and joining us in um you know working with any of the scaling team to implement um some kind of a prototype of mev auction on scaling solutions so that's that i i i guess we can end almost in a timely fashion five minutes over time four minutes thank you thank you everyone for joining thanks guys thank you everybody thank you thanks everyone thank you
