hi everyone I'm Tom I'm the GP at dragonfly we're crypto Venture fund for early investors and Flash models uh and today I'm going to be talking about um order flow living in and nud dystopia um specifically I think like the overview for this talk is um you know I think there's been a lot of great presentations so far and there will be great presentations later about order Flow Design Oracle auction design how to build auctions that have certain attributes depends that you like um I think this is obviously great research but part of the problem I think is actually um getting into a state where these auctions actually be in play put in place in the first place so a lot of the designs that we've got so far frankly Med related designs sort of operate in this kind of like environment and world that we live in right now where hey there's going to be all these transactions that needs public mempool and um you know everyone's going to want to auction off their order flow and how do we sort of design the crisis around that um my point and sort of this point from this block native tweet is uh you know actually a private Order Plan and private mempool so like kind of becoming a bigger and bigger issue so like what's the point of a good option design you don't actually have good inventory and good bitters um so you know um we're wrong um you know whatever is actually sort of this nice public overflow that people might want to auction off um how do we actually make sure that we can like uh have sort of the world that we want in a way that is doesn't you know sort of rely on finger wagging but actually incentivizes people to kind of do the right thing um and it's also supposed to be more like taxonomical so instead of walking through examples of where order flow is going today I think there's been a lot of great writing um so far about if theoretically how would you use your practice order flow or like theoretically what kind of service might exist um so like um Stefan Apprentice obviously a lot of great people wrote a really great then really get research for cockmatics in a theoretical concept but obviously as a PC I see a lot of different projects and a lot of different things that people are working on and so my argument is that it's already happened and so um it's not really good to think about oh you know in an abstract way what would a block Builder look like or you know hey Institute sort of work this way it's more uh how are how do things actually work and how do we like you know get people to kind of build things that we think are are sort of have a desirable in-state um so um you might also be familiar with this Mev supply chain um sort of abstract that is in in different circles um I think you know obviously this is this is great um showing sort of order flow or transaction flow coming from user to walk to Searcher to build it to validator um but I would argue this is almost sort of too simplistic I think there's actually like there's a lot of meat going on in here and I think it's probably worth sort of digging to what actually happens between uh user and the wallet because uh you get more and more leverage and more and more power as you sort of go further up the supply chain um so sort of high level overview abstract sense of what happened between that transaction life cycle uh adapt UI somewhere abstractly um sends a request for a signature for a transaction to a web free provider uh the wallet requests the user to sign it um you get one of these little nice pop-ups and then uh users on the transaction the wallet in theory should send the sign transaction to an RPC endpoint and it's a public plan pool and there's a maybe this relay you know whatever we sort of all know this bit and then it gets confirmed and then that UI updates um so I think you know for each of these you can sort of see how each of these are different camps they would sort of have the conception of um hey we actually have the relationship with the end user we actually have the order flow right so um yeah you know does the RPC standpoint actually have the order flow some people sort of think about it just the user just the wallet just adapt um and I think each of these cases for each of these camps has actually really good argument as to why they actually have a lot of Leverage and why they actually have a sort of proprietary access to order flow um and then we're gonna just get a bunch of nice little memes out of the way you know I got a yeah one of these and it's another funny this one's you know this was like you know I want uh yeah yeah this is fun and you know understandably Matt I think it's an area um so yeah I think okay let's like put ourselves in the in the yeah uh the headspace of uh people who think uh waterfall belonging to RPC providers right because like conceptually it's like transaction sign you get sent to sound you know RPC and then they are still the ones that sort of determine awareness routed um and truly you know sort of also makes you know it's easy to explain um and I think this is historically how people have sort of thought about it um but in practice obviously there's a lot of like hurdles actually getting there right um so you know who actually chooses the RPC providers can even choose an RPC provider historically you know so very recently you couldn't actually like select your ethereum magnet provider or RPC provider in metamask you can only do it for like new networks so you just kind of had to go with inferior until like I don't know two or three months ago um and even if you know someone does want to add a new network like the process of doing that is actually the kind of a pain in the ass and kind of scary um this is actually from like the flashbots website on like how to use flashback protect it's like four steps and you're copy pasting a bunch of scary looking stuff um it's actually really hard to get people to have agency over which RPC provider they're using and where their transactions are actually going um so the question is like even if you were able to say hey I want to get access to proprietary order flow um via being an RTC provider like how do you actually get people to you know give you their order flow given all these sort of hurdles and that they might not even be able to understand how to um and so the go to market I think tends to sort of go do a few different buckets um so one is sort of appealing to user security so like hey send me your order flow let me make sure you're secure um this is stuff like Harpy um again disclosure technologically do some really cool stuff um so you replace your RPC provider with heartbeats RPC okay intercept and scan every single transaction that you send them um if it looks potentially malicious uh there's like sort of a two-pack process or they send you an email you have to approve it and then it actually gets sent into the public mempool and so you can see how oh this isn't just like faster this isn't just like less censorship resistant it actually like provides this very tangible user benefit to people um which sort of incentivizes them to sort of switch over um I would say you know simulation tools are also sort of going down this path so I can Blowfish like a Stella or balcony also trying to think of hey what is like a real tangible user benefit that I can offer someone for giving me to order flow um another sort of approach of go to market is sort of this like ease of use idea so this is stuff like gas hog I would say flash Mouse protect uh one Intrepid holds your transaction apis which just came out it's basically you're adding a lot of nice just fewer ux benefits to um you know sending them your transaction like uh you know um they will basically hold on to your transaction until gas prices come down based on some modeling that they do so you can like pay less than you would if you send it off into the pool immediately um it can you know use Nano transactions so you can pay with a different fee uh you can you make sure you're not paying for any field transaction it's just like really nice sort of ux upgrades um in concept there's these all should be like no-brainers to adopt right like why would you send your you know transactions to inferior today when you could send them to any of these nice services and they sort of give you all these nice benefits on top of it um but in practice obviously it's like not really uh uh happening there and I think that's important because um you know the idea of like RPC provider is like a very abstract and kind of difficult to grac and many wallets aren't even really expose this idea um and so instead well you see a live RPC providers do is like sell directly to wallets so it's kind of like manifold and color heads with ideas basically hey your wallet you're trying to make money your Venture back and your VCS are you know telling you to make money um okay what are you gonna do well you could like add a metamask swap type feature but maybe you're not big enough you're not the right kind of user base at Could you actually go about um uh uh basically using these products as like maybe extraction as a service and so they get proprietary access to your order flow as a wallet they extract any view from all the flow the other users are generating and that's how you actually make money um and again this isn't even like um um this is even a concept like these kinds of things today I would say the other sort of uh fork in this path is stuff of hey give me your order flow and obviously give you a kickback directly as a user uh nectar is working on this kind of concept but the idea is basically um instead of giving you some sort of ux win I will actually like uh extract as much Med as I can from your order flow and then either give it back to the wallet or give it back to the user um so this is kind of why people think oh if I'm an RPC provider I can get all the proprietary order flow and that's going to be kind of like my my moat or kind of uh how this how this Market is going to shake down but in practice if you sort of go you know one level up the stack and one level of funnel wallets actually have like way more leoparditude right because again as you sort of discussed they can prevent you from switching the RPC like they can sort of have a really powerful default um or they can sort of abstract out or hide all this sort of stuff so wallets they need to monetize not everyone can have a metamask swap type product um they also tend to have you know really premium order flow um we sort of think about order flow again in a very abstract sense but like order flow from retail users who are like not price sensitive not time sensitive it's way more valuable than like order flow from like a Arbitrage bot or something or like a very sophisticated a Trader who's going to give you a lot of toxic flow and so wallets actually have like this nice sort of Juicy premium again sort of you know Robin Hood lighting that way um again also many walls do not allow users to switch up to see or the office gate out the RPC provider um this is actually from from metamask so for metamask swaps they have the standard feature of like what they call Smart transactions basically they do a lot of the things that the RPC providers that I just sort of went over do for you um instead of just sending your direct transactions directly into the mempool so nice toss minimize fund running uh you know they uh uh um prevent you from paying for sales transactions things like that so again it's like uh even removing sort of the possibility for choice um and uh you know if these wallets obviously they can do it themselves um it's a nice little Bert and Miller uh tweet over here um you know so rainbow obviously for for a while they switched into doing swaps more recently um you know it was like background and user trades and that was sort of nice modernization you know half of them um or they can offload it to a partner like manifold um or in theory again sort of the mental model operating is like oh did you just auction off the flow the question is like how do you actually incentivize them to do that when in reality like they might be making more money doing these other things um so you know it might actually be more profitable just to like have a swap feature rather than you know trying to sort of uh make money by auctioning off flow or extracting you know and if you control yourself um it also kind of presupposes that like wallets are responsible for receiving and and sending a transaction which is not always the case um as the example by like sort of intent-based transactions or like app specific transactions so um that's sort of the last bit here which is like uh in reality if you sort of go all the way up the funnel it's sort of the interface and sometimes like Gap UI that actually kicks off the transaction that argu has like kind of the most leverage um and we already are trying to see this as well um so right now I think about okay this app you know since transaction request and then they're sort of out of loop until between guys can actually gets confirmed in reality they don't need to like have the wallet sign and practice their transaction um they can just hold on to the transaction themselves or they can sort of have like the app specific transaction and do send it themselves to their own relay so this is exactly actually what Sushi does they have a partnership with manifold and uh when you go to sushi you can use the sushi guard feature you basically sign this like PEX it's a sort of off-chain order and definitely goes into like you know their their proprietary RPC uh uh um provider and then sort of their own little private in the pool so it's like you know even if you were a wallet here you wouldn't even have any leverage because you're not actually signing a transaction you're signing this like sort of app specific order at specific transactions so it's like everyone's sort of going up Up and Up further up the stack and trying to like pre-op the person in front of them um obviously this one's also somewhat confusing and dangerous because like you're just having someone sign this hex string and like you know it's kind of spooky so uh maybe not the best outcome um also again this sort of really heavily depends on like you as an application and your UI a lot of applications um a lot of the flow is coming from aggregators it's coming from third-party uis is coming from Bots um but for other applications you know such as unit swap a lot of the folks actually coming from their own UI so they have a lot of Leverage when it comes to transaction generation um and and whatnot so um this is like looking at a percentage of toxic flow you can look at sort of the user base and and where flows are breaking down into these different applications but it's not sort of one-to-one so you can't sort of apply this you know analog to your your specific apps um and then sort of this question coming so we're going back to the other uh RPC providers is like how do you then incentivize people to use your own proprietary UI versus like coming in through a third party it maybe this sort of goes back to this idea of like Kickbacks and red share but instead of going back to the app you're actually going back to users so and then yeah I swear I actually made these before the unit swap thing but maybe the answer is actually you know just do more vertical integration and you know make your own wallet if you're a map uh and now you have to worry about any of this sort of like you know these these adversaries uh intercepting your flow um so I think you know the purpose of this was basically to say um you know everyone is sort of acting very rationally right everyone is thinking about how do I make money and also provide a really good user experience I think even in life you know instead of children's talk about like you know Google and I would say uh uh digital ad uh at the auctions overall um it's like we didn't get into this end state by someone being like malicious or evil it was literally just like how do I provide a really great experience and inherently a lot of that comes from sort of vertical integration and that vertical integration sort of centralization and so the question is how do we not get mad at metamask for having their own private RPC how do we not get mad at that you know an RPC provider for having a sort of uh private order flow process it's like how do we actually uh achieve their own their own uh you know objectives which is like you know to make money um but also in a way that like uh has a sort of open private ecosystem that we actually you know want to create um so I think you know it's it's you can call these come in so you can be kind of mad at them but I don't think that's really like kind of kind of the best outcome the question is like how do you actually get them to um you know intentionally and by the their own inflation and open up their order flow um so you know how to make a plus CV uh even even you know uh it's basically a question of like how do you make it more powerful for them to auction after float um versus like extracting it themselves um and what that sort of Delta is um I think the other question that's sort of yet to be seen is like how users play into this um right now there are very few products that are actually offering you know uh Kickbacks to users a lot of the sort of perceived benefit from from using one of these things is like in you know better execution or you know cost savings or something like that but it's not really tangible people always like seeing a cash balance versus like you know being told to get better execution so I think there will be more um competition between these different sort of layers of the stack to ideally push more of this value back to users but it also depends on again how the stack forms and who's going to integrate and all that kind of stuff um and the last bit here is uh we need better data I think like yeah have a few sort of what Snippets of different snapshots of different parts of the stack in this in this deck um but we like don't actually have a really good visibility into um private mempools today and like where orders are actually getting sent before they end up on shame there's always like very vague like 70 of orders are going through inferior stack which is like wrong but it's a very outdated outdated stat so if you're interested in exploring some more data around uh private Ben tools and private order flow DM me email me working on some research right now so um yeah that's it foreign ers I um no I just I that was a block native screenshot but like that was like three months ago so I haven't seen their their latest data okay let's check it out yeah all right someone calling to ruining to get into ask this question I think jerus had to catch his flight I'm going to point to someone to ask him a question then yeah it seems to me like I mean there's like what like uh 12 level page now and there's probably gonna be like next week 40 the week after like a few thoughts on how we could create an auction for all about yeah yeah where is proliferation uh like should we incentivize as possible yeah I mean I think so I mean I saw it like stuff on the post recently on the different sort of like okay I think it was great right I think my point is like I don't really doubt that we can design a nice sort of like privacy preserving you know uh value maximizing um order flow auction the question is like um how do we prevent a world where um actually you know metamask has like 80 of the retail flow and they don't actually want to engage in an option because it's more profitable for them to just extract it themselves or extract the New Order pay permission third party um versus actually opening up into an auction and so I think that is almost more the thing I would like measure and think about maximizing is like the Delta between um self-extraction or like you know third-party extraction um versus like a true true like revenue from an auction or something like that so what kind of strategy getting importance to go stop other things because if it is very hard to make it useless yeah I think I am kind of focus on these like more like sort of threat to Consumer um plays of uh specifically sort of giving users like a kickback from their from their energy right like so far most of the order flow proceeds either go back to the Gap like the sushi or they go back to the rainbow but like basically no one's actually giving users take back or the two thousands becoming like a very abstract way or like price execution um and so I think it becomes more normalized for users to expect something like that then it sort of competitive pressure in the market I think if you see that a little bit in like you know something say like Hotel points or like credit card reports right where it's like these things shouldn't exist and they're actually like kind of operations or inefficient but the overall idea is basically to get great uh competitive pressure on providers to like give this sort of your perceived um uh consumer surplus so I think that's kind of American hindustanian versus like again relying on these providers to like you know do the right thing chemistry this might be asking foreign [Music] like that if all the transactions go through then next right they have yeah yeah I mean this is sort of this idea that like um oh actually like the person bidding on your flow is is like the ones to be paying the fees yeah I think maybe that sort of goes back to like this uh creating an expectation of around users of like you know getting referrals or getting or uh getting pickaxed right where it's like um you bet Chris apparently creates competitive pressure on providers to like offer that to them versus like uh not having that sort of Norm even if it's maybe less efficient than what it should be I think there are a lot of actions in deep phosphate or well pretty much hiding transaction right you have no guarantees on the actual value of your transaction right you have an intrinsic value that you prescribe that transaction but that doesn't mean it can be externalized to uh the importance of um provider right right and so I imagine sort of things like swaps that's a very easy bag calculation there are a lot of other things where fundamentally can um full price yes yeah feels like the dynamic because a lot of these um you know uh mbb infrastructure projects like Oracle auctions um is to kind of push the immediate value from the middle to either the user or the validator so I would like to understand what do you think are the sustainability for projects like Workshop what can you can rely on researchers in our share so like if you can't competing over 39.9 for the user or the validator yeah these kind of projects yeah I think I'll take a neutron though right search your marketing has been compressing kind of forever um I think you know for these Services too it's not so much about you know I don't know certainly the exercises of customers but like you have a lot of other customers to have more sassy and differences execution I mean again I think that the credit card examples app right where it's like we're in a really stupid like sort of equilibrium right now with like sort of points like this is obviously just like a tax and dragon system but it's a very tangible thing people like and feel and like we shouldn't really discount that so obviously people like it's better to have you know better sufficient more efficient more gas efficient um but like how do you actually feel that and see that and how do you put a meme around it and like it's just not as sort of you know tangible I guess so that's kind of my thinking on it it's difficult country though right yes yes it's the U.S specifically has a really weird thing but it's again it's like it shouldn't exist but it does and like um yeah yeah question oh just like a crazy Edge case like you know if the med from Easy transaction like forexes is it possible there's a world where wallets are kind of like extracting possible transactions from users like have them sign a transactions or signals extract yeah I didn't say anything bad about that yeah yeah yeah I haven't thought about that but that's interesting wives yeah I think uh I mean I think the gas hot thing is is maybe a little bit insane of like gas talk um it's kind of cool but basically it's like you are if you taxing the value from your lower time preference and like maybe they would be willing to pay you to delay your transaction so they can sort of capture more in that spread so what do you think about metamask and other wallets basically refusing to other guys who are signing consumptions yeah yeah I know I mean it was sort of like the the sushi thing um it's it's goofy I don't really know the reasons why honestly um because it is I mean it's like a native function in like web3 and ethers and yet like it's just kind of it almost intentionally broken so I don't really know the rationale at least for not Spanish yeah you could fix that yeah okay cool foreign ERS in this room why do you think about this in terms of like energy effects at all rather than just we're trying to get users this is almost all tax quality right yes so why isn't just we're just trying to get these shoes the best credits so I'm going to move back to like kind of what I was saying earlier right which is like um it's it's too abstract and like not tangible a a value for people who really appreciate it people like seeing like money in account they can point to and maybe we can actually present that in terms of like Savings in terms of access execution but like I think relying on uh yes all different providers here are like acting in their own interests but really what the user here that adds up sort of uh Market power investing power and so it's like how do you incentivize them to uh apply that pressure on their given provider so we should just like give you there's like really shitty prices and then like huge facts I mean that would be one way to do it right yeah um or you know what it sort of does um is like if you look at the Swap game you can think again between better prices or rebates there's sort of interchangeable but in different kinds of games uh the user outcome it could be like relatively fixed right very basic example is a uh Oracle object like the execution of the of the of the update might just be fixed and there's no notion of a better outcome institution but there's a reason and so there's a limit on what you can do with the output but you can maybe like okay so and in general they might be games where the action of One agent increases the welfare of many other agents that they'll be willing to pay for even though the action itself um and the potential outcomes of those actions don't actually do that much really great so that's a good example by I mean I do think like this probably sound like long tail and maybe created by you know I just feel like they're not submitting new Oracle updates through a while yeah like when users are creating Med I think the two examples I've heard are like it's sex trades and like and if you bet in your settings but those are also the best of Jordan right like I don't want to focus on prediction because it's like you know there's some non-zero assume I agree foreign factors or what people would like to know I think the user is going to win you just not Canada service provider sorry all right I think basically it's going to be so competitive to provide better executive users at the back of certainly as the accident Maybe I think he's going to go as it does like that's what happens in traditional Finance which I've seen kind of dystopian when you look at all everything but turns out which is a retail users have Penny spreads why that's I mean that's right now and I think most music will probably be awesome what's wrong a lot bigger what I think you know again in the sort of uh uh spirit of like moving further up the supply chain and having more leverage I agree users have a lot of Leverage but it's more about uh maybe helping them like recognize it or actually like to use it um right now even if you're a user like you don't have that much agency in terms of like redirecting your order flip I don't even sort of think about it so I think that's kind of more everybody thinking about is this like uh sort of creating competitive markets and Dynamics and uh you know is that just like again finger writing and so it's like you know uh how do you like did you get mad at any individual accurate there it's pointless because it's all being critically integrated and so really the question is like uh how do you sort of change transaction Providence and like create pressure to like not do this and that concern uh users in Market selection I was just asking if you think the alpha isn't like uh knowing the order flow or executing the product like it's it's in knowing to use its idea of less competition and execution um so like yeah it's kind of the point right it's like right now the order closed public and that's why you have like that's why you're not going to use one so you have yeah uh um surgeries but like in a world where like the order Club is not I'd like to any user have complete discretion and that's kind of like what the outfit is
