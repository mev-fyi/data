[Music] let me start by just getting a bit of a sense of the room i want this to be also engaging i i guess we have microphones here that we can hand out at some point for for q a um maybe i'll ask for your help with this um so show of hands who knows what mev is let's start with an easy one all right mev day i've got i've got i've got the right crew in the room that's good i've been to talks before where uh people didn't know and it was like you know three three little hands go up in the room and that was not that long ago you know like even a year ago mev wasn't uh it wasn't quite what it is today so it's super exciting to have my people um in here okay question number two who is an mev searcher who has done some muv trading themselves put your hand up all right all right all right some some hesitant hands you know everyone is worried about leaking their alpha but you know if you're aware you've got to look around who you have to go talk to um who is building uh mev mitigation solutions or some kind of product that has to deal with mev you know put your hand up okay amazing and uh maybe who is doing research on mev i think this is another big category we got a few we got a few hands okay perfect okay so you know the goal with this event was really to bring up a bunch of people in the mev industry that have a variety of different backgrounds get them connected get them talking to each other sharing ideas about what the future looks like and that's what my talk will be focused on is a mental model for thinking about the future of mev so without further ado let's get started there's this concept i've been toying around and and we've been talking about internally at flashbacks called the mev supply chain um so this we see as being a glimpse into the future of how mev will be expressed on all the various different domains that um that users are interacting with a lot of these actors in the supply chain aren't really known today or maybe some of them don't even exist but let me walk you through this supply chain and maybe it will start to click in your head about what these represent so the user everyone knows the user right this is this is the one that has been elusive for a long time on on blockchain but finally we're all happy that they've come and and you know users typically they don't really know how the blockchain works so they don't know the details of it and you don't necessarily want them to know the details of it but the users always have some intent they have some intention they want something out of the product out of the chain that they're going to use nowadays a lot of that is is trading or swapping right so user will have an intent like swap usdc for for eth um and they need help to express that into something that's actionable so they use a wallet or they use a dap or an aggregator all these interfaces that help the user express their intention into a transaction so i'll frame the role of this ui layer as being just that helping encode intentions into transactions converting what is sort of amorphous into something that's concrete and is readable by by the blockchain for a long time the wallets immediately sent those transactions into the transaction pool into the miner for inclusion this is sort of the mental model that we're used to right wallets interact with with a service provider or node to propagate the transactions for inclusion in an mev world there's new actors that that come into this this supply chain so even if the wallet sends a transaction and transaction pool it gets routed to a searcher a searcher sees that there's mev with this transaction whether it's a front running opportunity back running opportunity uh sandwiching they see it there's there's an opportunity here and they want to express it right so what flashbacks has done right is allow for these searchers to have a way to express more granular preferences on the way that they want transactions ordered and so we've introduced the concept of a bundle right so searchers take this transaction they add other other preferences on top of it and create a bundle and they want to have a way to communicate that bundle to um to to to miners for inclusion a new role that's just being developed now and we're in the early stage of seeing emerge is the builder so um vitalik will give a talk today about proposal builder separation and other sort of mitigations for how to deal with the centralization that can that can be brought by mev and a core tenet of that is separating this role of a builder from that of a proposer um so so in ethereum right now as a miner right the miner is both in charge of collecting the transactions putting them in a block as well as performing the proof of work and submitting that block to the network we're seeing that in in an ultimate mev supply chain world those roles will be separate so you'll have builders who are specialized at just aggregating transactions and bundles merging them into a block and then proposing that block to miners or validators for inclusion so here you have the final level of abstraction which is the block so you know this is framed as a supply chain it can be framed as a transmutation but really it's it's how you convert a user preference into a finalized block given all the roles and specializations are emerging around mev so this is a mental model now how does this fit into the idea of of mev utopia and dystopia right this is the the sort of the aesthetics of this conference we have we have the lightroom here we have the dark room on the other side what does it mean why why do we see thing as as being a light future or a dark future i think this is the core question that we've been asking ourselves at flashbots how do we prevent mev from turning into a dark future so let's explore what a dark future could look like with this supply chain we like to reference it as centralized block building um and you can also read this is tradify this is how things work in tradify so all of these separate components or different roles that i that i listed end up being vertically integrated into a single solution um hassu is giving a talk later today and he'll go in depth about this dynamic and what are the failure modes in which the supply chain you can have an actor that vertically integrates up and down the supply chain to create some kind of monopoly the reason why we don't want this is it's extractive right a lot of the monetary flows will flow toward this actor away from the users and it's centralized so you can create a censorship and you can undermine some of the core tenets of the blockchain and the reason why it exists today another thing that happens with um centralized block building is that it's very obscured so the users have zero transparency on on how their transactions are being used how the mevs being extracted etc so this is the this is the dystopia that that we're sort of trying to avoid trying to move away from we've sort of seen some hints of it already emerge in in uh in the ethereum domain and um we're seeing even more of it arise when we start looking at um at other chains i can give maybe some some graphical imagery of of what it could look and feel like if we end up in this future i think what we'll see is that there'll be a lot more co-location taking place amongst operators amongst validators who are operating on multiple different chains we'll have data centers where you have all of the nodes of the various validators on different chains they're plugged together on a single rack and maybe manage the majority of the stake on on that chain but they're all physically located in the same place so this centralization gets can can can end up being expressed in a physical way with having you know the majority of the validating power of a of multiple networks being in the same place um for the sake of being able to more efficiently extract um obviously that's dangerous obviously if something then happens that data center the whole network multiple different network can can fail and you have sort of cascading failures um so a lot of this hidden risk is sort of embedded into this the structure of centralized block building let's talk a bit about what a brighter future looks like um so this is the the vision that we have for how the mev ecosystem can evolve um and the one that that flashbots aims to build towards so we call it decentralized block building and it's basically the insertion of markets in between each of these these entities these logical entities in the supply chain that allows for modularity that allows for commoditization of the user transactions throughout the supply chain and fair payment for them so in in this world the user actually gets fairly compensated for the mev that they create um and the opportunity to create and all the other uh supply chain actors are collecting some fee for the service that they're providing in and pushing a transaction through the supply chain um so you can see here i've inserted sort of the the flashbacks products that we currently have flashbots protect which really is a layer between wallets and and searchers um the flashbots auction which helps searchers express their preferences to the block builders and then at the merge for proof of stake ethereum we'll have also mev boost which is for the separation between builders and uh and validators so our belief is that if we want to have a healthy future in which there isn't this co-location vertical integration monopoly we need to instead have markets that themselves are robust enough to be able to ensure separation between all these actors ensure that each actor is sort of open to competition low barriers to entry so there's new entrants that come into the market and are able to to compete with the existing players i think this is like one very simple way to think about okay are we more in the dystopic world or more in a utopic world that everyone can sort of get an insight for and it's does the majority of the value go to some mega hedge fund right like is the entity that you're transacting with some some big fund or is it some protocol is it some some system that returns most of the value back to the users this is this is i think the key difference by which we'll be able to tell if we're in a utopia or a dystopia how much of the value goes back to the user versus to to large entities so um right now right flashbacks is very focused on developing the system developing this future on on ethereum but we see this as being existing on all the different domains and so our ultimate objective is to work with partners in all these different systems to bring this approach to decentralized block building to other domains um so this is an effort that we're starting now to get in connection with various different partners that have familiarity that are already developing in these other ecosystems to uh to bring these solutions as part of a a holistic mev network so yeah if you're building in this definitely reach out and and we'll talk so this is my this is my final slide it's a bit of a troll slide that tries to make the distinction between the mav utopia and the mev dystopia try to characterize how various actors can be described in in in these two worlds and i actually want to open it up for for discussion and questions so that we can uh talk a bit about maybe the concept of the mev utopia what it looks like and dystopia and how it affects these actors um so yeah feel free if you have if you have any thoughts question raise your hand um a lot of the discussions will today will kick off of these these models and help expand you know what does an actual market for bundles or for user preferences look like what do mitigations look like on under the other domains so i encourage you to bring that mental model to those discussions as well any questions around the uh mev utopia and dystopia all right do you want to do mike we've got mike four you can just give it hi good morning thanks uh thanks for kicking off the day um my question is i guess as it relates to the bookends of individuals versus billion dollar funds um a mental model that i was thinking about is how you know asics and sort of the block production hardware of bitcoin is maybe something that is is a parallel where it's sort of um initially it was more individual but now there's economies of scale but still competition so it's like a weak form version or a hybrid resolution to the individual versus the um i guess heavily concentrated production side so how do you think maybe is that an avenue that's also open where it's a blend of individual versus kind of concentrated power as something that could also take place on the block production and ordering side yeah that's a that's a really good question i think this is a question a lot of people ask themselves like is it inevitable is it inevitable that as things become more specialized more sophisticated the entities become larger and i think to some level yes like specialization means that you're outperforming others it also means that you have more capital to reinvest but but our thesis that there's market structure items that you can tackle and you can strive towards to um to help uh mitigate that so i think you know everyone in this room knows utopias aren't a thing right uh there's no way that that we'll actually end up in an mev utopia but the best that we can do is strive towards that and and and take the steps that uh when when you have a decision on design go in in a direction that way so i'll give a few concrete example of what like design decisions look like that enable more competition enable more individuals to participate i think one of the big items on the future of mev is going to be risk management and inventory management when you're operating across multiple different domains right so if you just look at the way that traditional exchanges sort of work right as a market maker you're holding inventory on these different domains and maybe you're hedging on a third domain uh to to execute your arbitrage or or other strategies um this is incredibly inventory intensive you need a lot of capital that's just sitting idle ready to transact so if there are primitives that can be built that allow to have the same to target those same opportunities with less capital already that reduces the barriers to entry for participating in in that market so reducing the inventory requirement reducing the capital requirements um is sort of one design approach i think another one is trying to minimize the risk in execution so if you're able to convert a lot of opportunities that uh traditionally are captured in a statistical way in some probabilistic way into instead atomic execution where you can have some guarantees that either you get the opportunity or you don't pay anything then that also reduces the barriers to entry because then you don't need to build sophisticated statistical models to be able to participate in some mev opportunity but you can do so with with deterministic models um so those are i think some of the principles that that you'd look at for for designing towards a utopia thank you question here could you go back to the slide of mav supply chain first of all i really like this diagram i think it brings and explains really well how you should be aware of this part of stack a lot of people just are not aware of my question is do you think there are opportunities there or potential via deploying for example the launch proof schemes some part in some parts of this supply chain that could perhaps prevent the issue of mav this way and whether you will be in favor of for example going for some kind of like end to end fully private um like block building transaction building and whether that could be a potential solution like a way of uh just avoiding the future maybe dystopia yeah so let me rephrase the question you tell me if i understand correctly is where does mitigations fit into this and does privacy uh help mitigate uh mev in any way is that right cool um i think so i would say privacy is the biggest question in mev in particular uh transaction pool or pending transaction privacy so you know i don't think there's been a formalized model of like what private uh primitives are needed i know there's a presentation on this stage later on by justin drake that that talks about cryptography and mev and like what are the cryptographic primitives that we need but let me let me riff a bit on this and say like what i think it could look like so between the the relationship i think between the wallets and the searchers is one of the most important ones um it's the one where you get to define the boundaries on how user preferences are expressed you know right now you can you sort of act we see we see this acting in two models either the searchers don't see anything about the transactions that they're receiving and they're essentially cut out of this system or the searchers see everything and then they can do things like front running like stealing like what all the other bad things so we're sort of living in a world right now this dichotomy between okay maybe the searchers can do everything or the searchers can do nothing but really we want a world where the user can define and bound what the searchers can do so maybe the the user says you know i'm okay with my swaps being back run because that gives me back some value of the transaction the mev that i'm creating right when i'm creating a large swap on on on a dex it creates slippage it creates an arbitrage opportunity that right now the users are just giving to searchers that they're performing arbitrage if you uh go with a full encryption approach with a full obfuscation approach where you say the searchers don't get a bite at the apple right we push it to the next block we push it to the next transaction the opportunity will still exist right the user doesn't collect the value of the opportunity that med they created they just pushed it to a different extraction method which in this case would be like being the first transaction in the next block so we want something in between we want a solution where the user says i'm i don't want to be front run right i'm not okay being front run but i'm okay being back run so long as uh it transfers some of the value back to me something like that um and so i think the encryption primitive is critical to be able to uh or the privacy primitive is critical to be able to provide those kinds of guarantees and isn't necessarily something that that exists today you know another oh i'm getting i'm getting kicked off by the computer let me see this i can give another example like lower down um the supply chain which uh which doesn't exist today but but i think is going to be critical in the future so for searchers right like once they have um the goal is that they they're going to invest a lot in strategies that's going to be able to find um mev and and extract it um and that investment into those those efforts only makes sense if you're you have some guarantees that it won't be stolen down the chain so if the block builder here is able to see all the transactions of the searcher and just like take the best ones and like take those strategies and copy trade them this this model will never work right so you need some way for the builder to be able to assemble multiple different bundles and transactions into a block without actually seeing the content of those transactions and that's not uh uh that's not a primitive that that exists yet thank you all right another question any questions at the back i can see now okay very good cool uh thanks for the presentation uh you talked about in the builder block how it's important for those two roles to be separated out of risk of centralization could you talk about the uh like the incentives on why that party would want to decentralize those two roles the builder and validator yeah um okay so i think vitalik's talk after this is going to be focused on this in particular with regards to ethereum and pbs i can give my my perspective on why this separation makes sense so today um and and a lot of the reasons why sort of flashbacks got traction on ethereum was miners were starting to see that the transactions that they were included had a lot of value and they were still using relatively unsophisticated ordering uh systems right so we presented them with a model where that said like hey here's the concept of a bundle you can use a bundle to like delegate part of the ordering to third parties but they still have to do the process of ordering the bundles together and if they want to go take one step further into saying like okay how do i know if bundle a or bundle b or bundle c which are all conflicted on the same state can be included together i need to do a lot of simulation i need to do a lot of uh parallel execution of different blocks to try to determine like which block is the one that's the most valuable and that's just not something that can run on like a single node or a single server like you want to parallelize this across a a a cloud or a network of computers to be able to find the optimal ordering um and if we get into a future where like a validator can only produce valuable blocks if they are able to do that themselves then we're gonna say goodbye to all the the dream of solo validators and distributed validators right and so the incentive really that you want is for the entities that want to make the investment into doing this simulation work paralyzed simulation work to still be able to access 100 of the validators right and you want any single validator to still be able to interface with this large builder that has built all this infrastructure so you want to have this many-to-many relationship between these two because they're both incentivized so want to access the best that the other one has to offer okay one more question thanks for the talk as well uh maybe like a pretty practical question like you were saying about searchers being blind so when you compare for example from the wallet to the searcher step like uni swap with cow swap like on uni you can get sandwich for like 10 slippage what's different when you use cow swap in that scenario are the searchers blind then or so that's definitely a question for cal swap and i think they'll be they'll be here but i think housework is a perfect example of working on this abstraction right so as far as i understand and i'm sorry counselor people if i get this wrong i don't know if felix is here um but uh so they limit the set of searchers that can like get access to the the transaction so i think there's there's two principles that you can take here basically you need to say either these transactions are only routed to trusted counterparties trusted searchers that are going to abide by some rules and that you can kick out of the white list if you if they misbehave or you have some kind of privacy that's baked in where you say because of these cryptographic guarantees then you can send it to anyone and and you know they won't leak the the information that would allow for for for front running so um i think whenever we think of these models there's always a trusted solution which tends to be more centralized and then a cryptographic privacy solution which tends to be more decentralized and permissionless and i guess that's what flashbots is trying to do yeah yeah we want to build tools right uh that enable things to be more decentralized we're out of time 40 seconds okay perfect uh unless there's any other questions anything else then i think we'll make uh a little transition for for our next speaker on this stage which will be italic so uh hold tight and he'll be on [Applause] [Music] soon yeah
