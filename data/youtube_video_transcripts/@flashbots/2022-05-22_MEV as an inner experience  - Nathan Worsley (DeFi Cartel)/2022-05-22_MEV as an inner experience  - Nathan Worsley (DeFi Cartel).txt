[Music] hey everyone thank you for coming to my talk on the inner experience of searching for mev so i guess before we get started a couple of quick sort of definitions of the way uh searchers see mev from from their orientation so i guess firstly what is a blockchain well in my opinion a blockchain is a game and specifically it's a game theoretic system of incentives that is coordinating the rational and selfish behavior of participants to achieve some kind of socially beneficial outcome so one thing you can always rely on is that people will be extremely selfish and will act in their own best interests and one of the beautiful things about blockchain is it's coordinating this purely selfish behavior to achieve something for example payments with bitcoin smart contracts with ethereum and so on mev is the emergent value of this game so it's any financial reward which is ultimately available to the person who will be building the block and one thing i wanted to point out and push on is that mev is a neutral force it's an emergent property of consensus and it's not good or bad there is good mev and there is bad mev but mev by itself is neutral so an mev engineer often called a searcher is a player who is competing in a game with other players to capture this mev and they're usually doing this by building algorithms which is which are evaluating the state of the blocks that are arriving and evaluating the state of transactions that are arriving in the mempool and they're making execution decisions based on this uh why did i call this talk mev as an inner experience well there's a sort of trend at the moment in blockchain to think of mev as a purely extractive and profit driven activity and there's definitely money in searching but one thing i really want to try and convince you is that searching is not just about making money any more than poker is just about making money it's an intellectual and it's a sporting pursuit and if you're only interested in the money it's probably not the best pursuit for you if you just build something and get vc funding you'll probably get wealthier with a lot less stress than if you try to do the same thing searching for mev it's something that combines the intellectual challenge that you'll see in competitive programming with the financial psychology and the game theory that you often see in poker and it's often called the olympics of software development which i think is a very apt description so if you want to be a searcher there's a couple of questions that i would ask you firstly does the sheer difficulty of a problem excite you if you're faced with something you don't understand and it hurts your head it's so confusing are you filled with the desire to understand it to push yourself through that problem and get yourself to a point where everything finally makes sense is that something that you really get on board with are you willing to work across the entire technology stack as a searcher we we do everything from my new gas optimizations using assembly on smart contracts all the way to assembly level optimizations to save clock cycles on the cpu we do network topology we do hardware there's not really any any level of the stack that we don't touch as a searcher can you work quickly and can you work for a long time and under a very high amount of pressure and face a lot of failures before you finally achieve something meaningful as a searcher you fail a lot you don't start doing it and make a lot of money you fail you fail again you fail again you fail again sometimes you just don't stop failing you have to give up sometimes you achieve something beautiful and are you prepared to test yourself against some of the most intelligent engineers of our generation the other people searching are smart and you'll have to run very fast to catch up with them and lastly are you a team player can you be a productive part of a team which is greater than the sum of its parts so apart from just building software searches are also engaged in a sort of complex game of psychological warfare using various strategies to trick each other and this often plays out in discord forums twitter various searcher communities or even when searchers are networking with each other so a lot of alpha leaking is actually fake and it's designed to waste the time of the person receiving the alpha leak someone might want you to spend 50 to 100 hours engaging in some activity which is ultimately completely fruitless at the same time some alpha leagues are real maybe that person wants to make friends with you maybe they want to network with you it's kind of hard to differentiate sometimes whether the alpha leak that you're dealing with is real or fake and one sort of philosophy that we have as searchers is that everything can be an alpha leak you don't really know what someone else doesn't know so you don't know if you're revealing something that is kind of bringing them over over a threshold to something they didn't understand before but just for an example i was networking with someone recently and they told me their team size and blockchain and that was enough for me to figure out their smart contract strategy and everything so the smallest things can be an alpha league just what blockchain what strategy you're doing can be a major alpha leak apart from the outside sort of challenges of performing psyops on other people there's also a lot of personal challenges involved in searching it will push the limits of what you're capable of it will push the limits of what you're capable of intellectually you'll realize the limits of your intelligence that you're not the smartest person in the room and it'll push limits of what you're capable of physically the work often resembles a hackathon rather than regular work and as dean said earlier one thing that is guaranteed is that you will burn out you will burn out a lot can you push yourself to the edge of burnout but just not full apart completely and keep going and one thing i want to touch on is this sort of there's a spectrum that you can optimize for in life about and one side of the spectrum is people who are like very delusional and overconfident they have like a messiah complex they think they're the best thing ever and the other side are people who are very humble and in touch with reality and often in a lot of pursuits it actually makes sense to sort of optimize on the side of delusion people who are very overconfident often do things like start wework or become a great ufc fighter or whatever but in um in mev actually it usually helps to optimize on the side of being humble people who think they're smarter than everyone else tend to actually leak a lot of alpha without realizing it because they just don't think that anyone else is intelligent enough to capitalize on it oops so what does the state of the game look like today well there are some loan searches out there that still exist they're mostly doing very long tail stuff but they're being pushed out now by teams and the market is currently dominated by less than 20 teams three to four trad five firms some of the names you would recognize and some of them are probably sitting around you today and the rest of crypto native teams and the sophistication of searchers strategies is growing exponentially most firms and teams are now contesting the longer tail of the standard strategies so like the more esoteric types of art or more esoteric types of liquidation it's getting very crowded um the majority of searchers lose money when their time is factored in it's not something where you're guaranteed to make money most people would be better off doing another kind of activity uh one quote that a search i really respect said to me was i really underestimated how hard people will work for a hundred dollars a day there's people out there who will work 100 hours a week to steal that hundred dollars a day off you and that's the kind of competition that you will be up against cool so i wanted to i guess dive into a few war stories too so to give you examples of some of the games that you might find yourself in if you become a searcher and this kind of lifestyle appeals to you so the first thing is uh ddos attacks this is like a very common thing that you'll see as a searcher and the strategy is here is to disable competitors or create some kind of latency to slow you down so general generally you'll be running some infrastructure and the attacker will connect to you with nodes that are created for the purpose of ddosing you and this can be a very subtle attack sometimes they don't want you to notice the ddos they just want to introduce enough latency that you are no longer profitable and sometimes the traffic can be uh very deceptive it might be pings and pongs it might be transactions that have already been included in a previous block that are coming through the mempool it will generally be tailored towards the client that you're using and it's a challenge as a searcher to uh detect and drop these bad peers through all this kind of malicious ddos traffic and maintain healthy connections and a lot of people don't realize this is kind of like an undercurrent war that is going on on most blockchains at the moment uh websocket warfare this was an interesting scenario i was in a few months ago it was a evm-based blockchain where having a bigger stake as a validator was beneficial for trading and one of the big validators on the network had a websocket connection exposed on an rpc on a port an unusual port and they didn't realize that this was kind of exposed and there were a few searches that had scanned this validator and realized this port was exposed and dominating the met on the chain became a game of just gaming this validator when it would restart this validator would restart about once a day and every time the validator would restart it became a sort of war to just connect to the validator as quickly as possible open as many connections as you possibly can and that sort of gave you the advantage in the game because it was pure latency everyone's receiving the same information it was kind of interesting because restarting your bot here was deadly a lot of people their bots will crash and restart it's kind of like a normal part of operating a bot but if you restarted your bot wallet you just lost all your connections to this validator it was kind of like game over until the next day when the validator would restart so eventually the validator just like i guess discovered that we were just like massacring it's like traffic and internet with this like game that was going on and they shut us down but it was pretty cool well it lasted uh the next is another cool example the uh consensus leader strategy so prior to the snowman plus plus hard fork on avalanche um it was possible for any validator to propose a block so first of all it started off as sort of like normal mev extraction and then people started realizing that they could re-org the blockchain so you would capture some mev in a block and then the attacker would publish a longer chain of blocks with their validator and sort of convince the chain to that was a legit legitimate uh head of the blocks and then you would lose the mev and the chain would get real and this was really damaging the user experience of the chain and other labs at the time just like didn't care or they just like they weren't really interested in even talking about it or recognizing the problem so we created a coalition of virtuous validators with the idea that the virtuous validators would confirm each other's blocks more quickly and would discredit the uh blocks of the re-org attackers so when we saw a real chain the virtuous validators would try and uh basically create a longer chain on top of the existing chain to like discredit this this chain and this got really aggressive and the reorgans just got more intense uh we had to create more intense chains of blocks to fight back against the re-orgas and eventually overlaps did notice and um because the the block times in the chain was just exploding and they just hard forked the entire blockchain to fix this problem and shut down the the war that was going on uh inventory drain so here the strategy is to drain the inventory of other bots and normally this is draining gas from the sending addresses of the of people's smart contracts sometimes it's more direct approaches like salmonella where you're exploiting some kind of vulnerability in their contract to drain their inventory and this is kind of an attack surface is opening up from the generalized nature of people's strategies so normally this will be fake trade opportunities someone will try and figure out how you evaluate trade opportunities and put something in the mempool where you start spitting out a lot of trades it doesn't cost them anything you drain your inventory i've seen a few really unlucky situations where someone had an automated service set up to re-top-up their sending addresses from their smart contract so this inventory train which is like cycle through not only all the money on their sending addresses but all the money on their smart contract too they just like lost all of their funds and this is like something you have to be very careful of and one thing to point out here is sometimes the align between inventory drain and hacking can be a little bit blurry for example with the chum exploit recently someone was actually tailoring this exploit for every smart contract that they attacked so they would find your smart contract figure out and exploit specifically for your smart contract and i'll target you i guess in my opinion that's probably falling more on the side of hacking but i guess it's sort of up to you to decide uh where you are morally comfortable cool so i i hope i've done a little bit of work to convince you that searching is not just about getting rich and if you're just in it for the money you probably won't succeed it's a beautiful art form it has a lot of depth um it's rich you'll be reversing really intelligent people you'll fail a lot but when you do succeed it's one of the most beautiful and meaningful experiences that you can have as a software engineer what does the future hold for searches well i mean strategies are going to increase in complexity there's more of a need now for searches to do everything at the same time whereas previously searches would specialize more in one strategy there's increased competition from teams from traditional finance so as a searcher if you're crypto native uh you do tend to have a little bit of a moat but uh traditional finance is sort of expanding in this domain and becoming a lot more competitive and there's a move in the direction of more statistical strategies which are a bit higher risk and play out over multiple blocks and my hope is that uh crypto native trading firms will be able to sort of hold the fort here and become the dominant players in the next couple of years rather than letting this be an industry another industry that traditional finance dominates cool so i guess i'll see everyone in the mempo but i will take some questions if anyone has any um if you had to start all over again uh with what would you start if i was to start right now i'd say uh i would probably be looking to join an existing team i don't think i would i would go on my own i'll try and do something cool that would appeal to like an existing team and and join them so you would do more uh like general strategies like arbitrage and liquidation no i would probably be focusing more on the longer tail the the shorter tail stuff is very competitive at the moment a lot of people who have been you know trading v2 arbitrage for years for example and like if you're going to dive into that it's extremely difficult extremely competitive and like even if you are winning that it's really like not the profit opportunity it's probably not there like it used to be so i'll be looking at more like stuff that is like less notice and this is something that you like see playing out on the mempool people who have a profitable strategy are often taking steps to uh hide it so like one alpha league is to look for people who have reinitialized contracts because when you really initialize a contract it's actually like hiding sort of your transaction history on ether scan so like you know there's a lot of long tail people looking for these sort of edge cases here where the this alpha that is not really highly contested thank you yeah there's a lot of uh mev opportunities in nft unfortunately i've only ever lost money uh trading nfts there was um there was this like nft i think it was like black text on a white background or white text on a black background or something and um there was like a new one that came out that was just like the opposite like you know the first one was black text on a white background the second one was like white text on a on the black background i spent heaps of effort like just gaming the randomness here like try to get like a rare version of this nft and then i ended up holding all these rare nfts but like now you've got to sell them so you go like shield your bags to your friends it's not a very pleasant sort of way to end the to end the trade so i i'm not like there is a lot of money that can be made in nft mev but i personally have failed at it so do you actually code in the sonar or is that psyops uh well at the moment i'm not coding in the sauna because i haven't been able to find a laptop that can like withstand that kind of temperature but who knows i'll give it a try maybe it's uh maybe the storm is somewhere you should just be relaxing and like forgetting about the stresses of your life is there a skill cap and do you expect teams will reach a sort of saturation level beyond which they can grow and maintain alpha competitiveness or say like people forking off and starting firms that duplicate or something of that sort does it just keep do the advantages just keep stacking and when does the exponentiality stop i think there is kind of like a limit to like where where strategies can go like for example gas optimization at the moment there's a lot of work on like optimizing more and more with sort of standard strategies but there's like a theoretical limit to where you can gas optimize and at some point like most people are going to be pretty close at theoretical limit and like the same with like creativity of strategies at some point you sort of like done all the standard strategies you've got all the standard long tail there's sort of like not a lot of places left to go um i'm sure that there will always be like things that will pop up now and then but i do think that there will be a point in time where things are very saturated but i think we're very far away from that even if you're like just beginning to search i still think you've got like a good number of years before you have to worry about this sort of stuff i'm managing a team of searches yeah so i started uh by myself and um i was just like working 100 hours a week it was just way too crazy and i had this idea that okay i will uh like i will work less i'll like make less money and like sort of hire other people and share the profits but actually turns out that like as i said in the talk like a good team is greater than the sum of its parts so if you're like a solo searcher now i'd recommend looking for people that you're very cohesive with where you have a team of three or four people but you're so cohesively operating like a team of five or six and building and maintaining a good team is very hard to do i've failed at it before but when you can achieve it it is like a beautiful environment to work in how did the transition work worked out on your site when you work routine and stuff how did the transition go from solo to team uh it was it was bumpy so like uh sort of had like some failures at first but eventually found like a good uh cohesive working relationship with some uh really gifted people um but yeah like one thing i would advise if you are like solo and you're looking to join a team is like don't skimp on like the legal stuff like don't just have sort of like ad hoc relationships it's just like any other business right where uh like everything's sort of like fun and everyone's friends but like if there's real money involved then like you know it gets a bit more serious i recommend like if you want to start a team like do it properly start a company get agreements get employment contracts and so on uh you know you're setting yourself up for success doing that hey um on on the topic of contracts etc what'd you think about these teams being regulated i generally like from a idealistic perspective i'm sort of like opposed to regulation and hope that blockchains can like sort of self-regulate um yeah i don't i i guess regulators at some point will sort of step into the mev sphere i hope that they will do it with like guidance from people inside this industry um rather than just like doing like stupid stuff that they normally do where they just do it's like top-down regulation that doesn't make any sense but this is a very uh permissionless market anyone can do it it can be hard to figure out who the people that you're trading against are so regulators will probably struggle to um you know institute top-down laws thank you how much of the map that you see is actually um sort of traded against the centralized markets rather than just being on on the blockchain the distinction between like atomic and non-atomic mev i'd say like at the moment it's probably more there's like more non-atomic mev that's being traded i mean if you look at the biggest traders on ethereum the bulk of their profits are coming from uh like stuff that's between centralized and decentralized exchanges so yeah atomic is probably becoming less profitable especially on a chain like ethereum which is quite saturated hi hi nathan thanks for the talk just a higher level it seems to me that this very secretive game of cam mouse where you're incentivized to be secret uh is you know very exciting for the people involved but you mentioned some societal benefit at the top do you think this just like to hear your take on how it trends towards societal good over the long term mean i'd love to be able to give you this like beautiful answer about how mev is like the greatest thing ever for society i guess you could ask yourself is like poker the best thing ever for society it's a fun pursuit um yeah you could make the argument that you're sort of like driving efficiency in mev and you're you're exposing some sort of thing some issues with blockchain and acceleration a sense like maybe you're sandwich trading you're like exposing that that is a problem that needs to be fixed maybe you're targeting like a real strategy you're exposing that is like a problem that needs to be fixed but yeah i generally think most people are doing it for like the art form and the pursuit uh not like sort of to provide some value add to like society as a whole just a follow-up question do you think the technical innovations that mev searchers end up uh you know inventing actually over long-term kind of osmosis out into the blockchains that they are working on i would hope that they will eventually i think at the moment a lot of like some of the most intelligent human capital in the world is being spent uh getting like two extra gas saved on like an execution or like you know speed optimizations on like geth that never actually make it into like the mainstream client so there's like a lot of human capital that's being spent on these things and it doesn't really surface i would hope that though that there is a sort of like trend long term where some of this brain power does end up being put to a social use thank you cool if there's no more questions then thank you very much everyone
