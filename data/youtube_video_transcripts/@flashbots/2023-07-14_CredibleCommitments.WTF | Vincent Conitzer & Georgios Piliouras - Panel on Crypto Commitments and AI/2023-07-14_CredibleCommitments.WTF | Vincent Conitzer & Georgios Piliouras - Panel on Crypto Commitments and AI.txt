yeah oh actually first of all like yeah a couple of words about myself like hi I'm georgius uh you know currently I'm a deep mind I'm also a professor on live uh currently and I've been collaborating with ethereum uh back from around like 2017 so had discussions with uh you know vitalik and many other people vlads and fear uh virtual Griffith and and uh and this is the has been an ongoing discussion has been very interactive for my perspective because it helped me somehow you know coming from a background or after theoretical computer science it helped me somehow question hidden assumptions that somehow I was very myopic to you know treat it you know being uh you know emerging from a yeah theoretical area where you really like to prove things and you you tend to develop some house on myopia on hidden assumptions of your model right now you're talking to Vitality like oh yeah this is great great great proof it's not gonna work here's why you know like immediately you know and then somehow I develop a methodology actually I'm a morning rule in terms of like where where do these assumptions actually then okay and this I want to briefly share this with you and hopefully this could be valuable to your research too uh is there any way to do this whatever let me just take this off okay perfect thank you yeah all right so I will go over the uh okay so the word to remember is presto uh okay the t is NOT capitalized okay and then I will go through each of these letters you know and I will say like here's the related concept to keep in mind again so yeah and this is not in order again so we start with o all stars are optimality all right so this is this asks again uh how well does the system solve the problem that you that you're looking for you know for example let's say uh if we have your Global metric you know you think of your loss function or let's say I want to like maximize social welfare of my system you know my users okay how close does my solution come to you know satisfying this uh this data in the system okay uh the second e is for efficiency all right efficient instead of like okay in pursuit of my first goal of optimizing my my system is going to use a bunch of resources resources come in different flavors no resource can be time it can be spayed it can be the use of randomness you know it can be things like uh Network bandwidth and so on so forth right right and actually this is worth it actually computer science like leaves so you somehow we work on the intersection of these two areas you know if we only get up optimality with mathematicians but we don't care just for like finding Solutions of sad we want to find them let's say as fast as possible okay but yeah but then we just say like which is some some algorithms you cannot make them run in deterministic time you know all the time but maybe Randomness can be very very helpful and at the time these Traders you know we ordered let's say the centralized computation like what can I do if I don't have to like you know have all of my data in one space okay so this is what the theoretical computer science does okay I'm not actually not all computer types let's say people like myself and uh David we go further down into this uh into this uh world and then now we think about the SD which we call like uh stability or station editing all right so now we say like okay great you have a system your system is uh let's say approximately optimal approximately efficient now is it the case that the system in itself is an equilibrium okay that somehow the agents who implement the system they're not for somehow to participate okay but it's given the opportunity to participate then they will actually follow the system right and now this can actually come with many different flavors let's say from the classical perspective of mechanics design we think of stability from the perspective let's say of the of the users the user is like you know I'm coming in a participate in auction am I going to beat truthfully you know if the mechanism is let's say uh study proof that's that's the whole idea right that is in your best interest to to beat your true value but stabilities dictionary could also uh be applicable to other entities like the designer themselves right so for example David talked about credible mechanisms credible mechanism suppose I've used my mechanism of the perspective of the designer who the designer actually stay in this point in the mechanic space or they could deviate themselves right okay so this is already like put it back but we're actually not done okay suppose you've done this which is already you know pretty impressive so you create like you know credible super stable mechanism that's a fist in an optimal are you done well no Vitality said well this is where we start you know like you say what about robustness okay now this is actually a tricky concept it would say like to to talk about robustness you actually have to topologize somehow your protocol so your protocol think of your protocol Your solution has a point in some space okay so uh let's say yeah probably the easiest way to think about this uh but yeah let me yeah let me think about the the following okay so when you take uh let's say when you when you think about standard mechanic design like you think that let's say all of the agents are perfectly rational okay but now you could say like okay what if I allow and one percent of Byzantine agents okay now this is not in my original you know so I've expanded my space to sort of like invalidate some of my assumptions of the protocol so just I'm looking in the larger space and I'm going to try to understand how do my guarantees that I have understood before degrade as I move further and further away as my assumptions of my model getting validated okay so for example it could it be the case that you know if we have like three percent in agents or ten percent in agents like that at some point there's a violent phase transition right and your system performance goes from 100 to zero like uh Vitality you know say okay we have to think very very carefully about this right and then there's the last the last very last one to visit uh I call persistence okay the robustness in the issue about no cultivations okay so you say like okay look I've written a very nice mathematical model but there's always a specification on my model between model and reality investigations would be typically small because I've done quite a bit of work in terms of like believing my model make the model good okay so as long as this was my my guarantees are in that they the great gracefully then my system is robust but then like and recently come from metallic and blood and then this ethereum will think what about an Affairs entity that comes in and say let's say with the wheel to burn like a hundred million dollars to the store ethereum okay how would they do it so there you have to be forced to think about radically somehow moving okay if you're again in your parameter space here so this is your point in your parameter space now you've been moved very far away again right and now you want to think about it my action uh let's say system here my design system itself an attractor so somehow like if it was like valuing things to move away from its point of specification okay then it would actually self-organize to what I actually thought right and this time what reminds me of what uh Barnaby said about this point of last defense you know so you think about okay now you you really have to think very very carefully about this almost like Black Swan kind of events no because if you want to create something that has like true you know persistence in the real world like eventually something very very awful happened now clearly I'm not saying that okay you should create this list in the like select all of these boxes right but uh the ways to think about this more like a prior to Frontier so make your choices should say for example like you know I really care about you know this this and this you know 10 10 uh this is like maybe not not relevant to me okay but you but somehow at least being like going to the checklist you know and it's also like a pleasure like AI safety issues like you know I think this course will be useful for you uh yeah going to the search list can really so much help you discover this uh blindfolds right and uh if you want to look what more details about these ideas these appear on a joint paper with uh with Stefanos so the the way to Google this I would guess it would be Leonardo's Italian okay and uh so this is jungle 7us and with uh Daniel weisberger at SGD yeah so that's it uh yeah and I'm happy to take questions uh and kick start the discussion sorry you've been saying sorry this is this is the end of the monologue okay uh that's it yes um then Theory Matrix sorry to write I would worry if you went as far as actually like coming coming up with some kind of he met with all like useful right now to evaluate your research designed it so like I thought come to all of it but I think it's even our girlfriends further then evaluate the the world to be telling you well I mean I would ask it like into grades so like uh in you know in one says yes so I have done some work exactly at instantiating these things like like in a specific like formal ways but I would actually encourage you not necessarily but but you know in some sense I don't feel that there's there's a unique way of translating these ideas to useful mathematical Frameworks there there have been some ways that have been useful for my research okay but I don't understand hearing like Advocate like no this is the way to doing this and clearly share you know I mean like there's a lot of analysis of course with like what uh uh you know David was saying like this morning and this is not by any means somehow you know like I'm not gonna fight here like oh you just use my my terminology right all I'm saying is that like just this is something that has been useful for me like in my in my work specifically in blockchain systems to think about things that I take for granted okay and uh I would encourage you to yeah to try it out or develop your methodologies and uh and again like explore the literature we let it uh work okay that's it yeah I'm sorry was that a question to me I can't really hear uh I could hear George as well yes okay great um so yeah I can hear some people well and others not as well um but first of all thank you so much for having me here very much at the last minute I'm sorry to jump in uh remotely I'm happy to see some familiar faces I see David there I saw them get us earlier and George's of course uh so hi everybody um so uh my role in this panel first of all I'm not a blockchain expert I'm interested in it um but my uh expertise that's relevant here probably is coming a little bit more on the Cooperative AI side and in particular there I have more of a game theory view on that I run the foundations of Cooperative AI Lab at Carnegie Mellon University I also have a part-time appointment in Oxford but this is just this happens to be the time that I'm not there um so uh generally what's of interest to me is just kind of abstractly thinking about languages in which you can express very general commitments right so we're very interested I've done a lot of work over the years on commitment and Game Theory and mechanism design and now increasingly also in program equilibrium type of setups where we commit to a program in some sense um and uh so their commitment seems like it can be very helpful to attain cooperation and to establish trust in all these things at the same time we're also learning that you know commitment isn't always a good thing and there are certain kinds of commitment that in broader Society we actually try to avoid right commitments could also lead to things like extortion uh or collusion or vote buying and I imagine many of those are interesting to you as well um so that's kind of where I'm sitting that I I kind of want to think about well how do you structure things or did you get the good kinds of commitments and not the bad ones the ones that result in beneficial cooperation rather than collusion and extortion and these types of things I know Casper and Lewis I think are going to be there tomorrow as well and you're in good hands with them um and so yeah I don't need to talk too much um but if I can be helpful with anything that's great and otherwise again you're in great hands with customer and Lewis tomorrow foreign oh okay so can you hear us right now okay great by the way can you yes yes so okay nice so yeah we're going to have like a sometime maybe 40 minutes with uh Vincent and jewels go and sell some questions about uh commitments some of these questions were asked to you uh with this quadratic voting mechanism we got all replies so we have some data to know which questions are the most interesting to the audience um to us and so yeah first so one question that was seemingly very interested to the audience is easily that commitment devices what are their rules limitations and trade-offs and and specifically the question was both crypto and conservative AI have focused significantly on commitment devices a decentralized way of implementing coordination so how does we study in crypto blockchain and co-berry DVI relate to what we know from let's say traditional literature on the way to implement coordination with for instance mediators or mechanism design maybe Vincent can you take this question first yeah great I do think there's a lot of overlap again especially at this kind of abstract level of thinking about the languages in which we make commitments and the ways in which we make commitments uh and I think both Cooperative Ai and also blockchain have somewhat of a decentralized view that there isn't necessarily A well-established institution already in blockchain maybe you have a protocol but for uh but besides that you know things can emerge naturally and in some ways that that's a nice environment but in other ways there may be also things to worry about right that somebody gets some kind of strange first mover advantage that leads to extortionary Dynamics or other bad Dynamics and so how do you prevent that uh I think I don't have the answer to that at this point but I think that's a good thing to think about and one thing that seems to play a large role also is who has access to which information right that if we can have a private side Channel uh by within which we can also make commitments that is something that can enable collusion uh better than for example if everything is necessarily public but how do you keep things public if they can be encrypted and so on um so that's I think one aspect uh also from the mechanism design angle uh that there's a question of whether all the information is already included right normally in mechanism design we think about there are things like the Revelation principle which tell us that in some sense we can simplify the mechanism but in the end from the user or from whoever you we value we still need this input of what is it that they actually value how much do they value it and without that we can't necessarily play the game um and again I think in this context there's there are interesting questions about what extent is that private information already out there and can you commit to it uh to what extent do you eventually need to query a human being that you where you can't really monitor or make any kind of guarantees about what they might say and how does that play into these stories about commitments and cooperation um so I think that I just listed off a whole bunch of different things but I think those are some of the things that are relevant to all of us foreign but uh probably like you know uh from a somewhat different perspective I would say like the way I think of commitment um in blockchain is a very somehow like uh practical practice oriented like first approach you know okay so I'm gonna resolve like you know the issues of a resolution okay here's like a hard limit on gas like if your program like needs more steps like like tough luck right so on the other hand somehow like you know Vincent you know and and and and and his groups is then of course like very elegant like theoretical work of like understanding like you know uh very powerful like uh commitment devices and what they can't go to what you can and then and do with them and I think you'll be very interesting somehow you know to try to maybe follow kind of like gradient you know if I would go to the take a you know combine maybe like David's perspective here and I would say okay let's think of like uh suppose think of like you know how ethereum does um you know commitment resolution like today and then you say like okay what's the most promising Direction what's the minimum like you know uh minimum um capability that we can add to the system that's what they are like so that like they maximize somehow like the problems of the systems right so I think here's like where uh you know yeah and then it's not about like implementing everything but like somehow again like uh going for a minimal change okay you literally somehow like a gradual step so it could be very very useful if somehow like some of these rather general theory could say could be somehow like revisit from that perspective right and uh going at it gradually is this also perhaps a way to hedge against the risks that Vincent was talking about that when you expand the space for people to make commitment you might also expand the space so bad commitments that they can do with it and and perhaps going at it piecewise and just adding features one by one is is one way to kind of check that it works well along the way oh is that insufficient as AI safety point stands thinks about it which is bad yeah either you have an AGI or you don't have an idea and there's not really like a way to to be intermediate well okay if I if I would take this we can maybe part of my answer is already on the board like uh you know like it's always a good idea to like to move in small steps uh why because you know that maybe in a real world like most of the properties of most systems are like relatively stable so hopefully you know if you do like a small change in the system like you won't create like a catastrophe pattern okay like that being said you know we do know that that you know there are systems which undergo critical phase Transitions and I think like that's a lot where like the real like Theory uh comes into play and say like okay like do we have evidence to be leader like you know we're close to such a that's a um yeah that's everything uh and then you know we can try to yeah study this both theoretically and somehow experimentally right and then as long as as we don't see any sort of like evidence of course phenomena then nothing can be more confident a small step won't be the catastrophic one yeah I agree I think uh and this is a context where we definitely can do experiments as well right uh maybe some things fail but sometimes it's it's really good to see what actually happens in practice and some of these things are so complex to think about um Casper has some nice stories about uh earlier program equilibrium type of competitions and kind of Axelrod uh tournament style where at that point a lot of people were thinking about logical analysis of the other programs and establishing cooperation that way but it seemed that the competition just devolved into this weird situation that a lot of people put some you know keywords into their code that made it look like they were thinking about cooperation and so on but in the end they were all just affecting on each other and trying to you know in very superficial very superficial ways trick the other programs into cooperating uh could you have predicted that well maybe but you know in any case I think it's good to do those experiments and I think this is a context where we can have of Fairly you know not all too high of stakes experiments you know they need to be high enough that people are really motivated to actually try things and come up with uh you know for example if we're worried about the extortion being possible in this kind of framework we actually want to incentivize people to try to do that to the extent that we have an experiment and we want to learn what is possible and what isn't um so we need some sticks but at the same time the stakes can still be low enough that we can think of it as an experiment yeah speaking of stakes uh I think like ethereum you know like has been has offered like a good example of like of such a transition like in the real world right so the transition from proof of work to proof of stake like this goes back to discussions with like vitalik and Virgil like up on like you know around like 2017 we're like that's one of the first somehow like favorite color happened and you know we know that in theory this would work but then of course you start like testing it you know initially you have like computer experiments then you move to test Nets multiple test Nets developed by independent groups this gives you confidence on like you know that it's not a fluke and then eventually you know you you actually do like let's say it's in the main right so like you know there's not one step there's like multiple steps right yeah but you know for but this is actually like a great success story for Theory like this whole stuff that would like you know pen and paper arguments where we say like look you can do everything without Game Theory and not somehow like burning like you know millions of dinosaurs like per day you know so yeah so hopefully maybe we can replicate someone said yeah you know or other or other elements protocol nice yeah they really want to come back on the program equilibrium because this was something that was highly rated you know inflamor survey but before moving there there was a question about we often think of blockchains as their value proposition is really about being this available commitment device that is just sitting there and that people can deploy things to um but we have only recently been thinking about this whole strand of literature that has been existing for quite a while on the idea of commitments in games and yeah exactly this principal agent problems uh dark dowels of extortion The credibility of mechanisms as as a it's a practitioner of this field for for white or white um is there something that we should have on top of our mind when we're thinking about these problems like we're coming in with fresh eyes but yeah maybe like a critical learning from the field that we should be very mindful of and that seems to to apply in this situation maybe this was a question for Vincent I'm sorry I thought you were talking about blockchain practitioners which I'm not um devices practitioner yeah this is good so I think um in Game Theory and mechanism design right most of the literature on commitment is sort of implicitly in mechanism design that there is some entity out there that is in a position that they can commit to the rules of the game and they're often creating the rules of the game for other players right that in the end often we think about the mechanism designer or whoever's running the mechanism that's not really even a player in the game they're just setting up the rules and that's the way that we get commitment and that's the kind of commitment that I think also in these contexts can be helpful but at the same time here maybe we are thinking a little bit more about players that are at the same level um we were talking about program equilibrium then we're really talking at some level about this Mutual commitments right that's I commit to do something if you do the same thing and vice versa and that is in some ways very powerful to get things started certain to build up from uh from nothing but there are a lot of details there about how those commitment come to be and again like you know if you have somebody who is a first mover and who can commit to something before anybody else that radically changes things uh a lot of these program equilibrium Concepts actually allow for many different equilibria right and so that's another issue that there may be a difficult equilibrium selection problem again a first mover might try to take most of the benefits from uh from the cooperation and but at the same time that might also fail and somebody else might be trying to select a different equilibrium so at some level maybe you still need some kind of norms and expectations uh and because again there are so many different equilibria that you could have in principle uh that in the end there probably needs to be some kind of community enforcement of whatever standards we're trying to uphold uh to prevent things from going all to uh all too far in the wrong direction and so that's very interesting like to what extent would that emerge naturally and would that emerge in a good way uh or do we need to think about that more proactively beforehand and think about what should be the Norms what is the kind of behavior that we should be punishing and What mechanisms do we have to punish uh certain kinds of behavior or block it or those I think are difficult questions that again probably you know experiments would be very interesting to me to see what actually would happen um but I think we also still to some extent lack the abstract framework that's right so that you know there is now you know there has been for quite a few years this literature uh a lot of it gets very complex very quickly and we usually look at fairly abstract models where everybody gets to commit at the same time everybody gets to see everything and that's easier for us to do the analysis but may not really track the real world especially as there is uh you know private information that's being held somewhere that we can't see people move at different times we have Dynamics there's updates about the world coming in and we have to be a little bit flexible people are maybe not going to use every aspect of the language that you provide them with and so presumably again there will be some evolution of the kinds of things that people Express and that they know how to analyze and that then their programs will be looking forward to see so I I feel like there could be many different kinds of equilibria and Saudi the key questions are how do you converge the good ones uh to some extent we can try to maybe design the good ones or at least you know encourage people to use the good ones make those sort of very focal or Salient that like I'll go this is really the natural thing to do My worry is that things can go wrong in a number of ways if we're not Mindful and if we don't have the ability to to roll some things back some of the time is there something that the blockchain community should know about AGT that we're not paying attention to uh yeah that's a good question um doing I think there's uh at least for like algorithmic Game Theory I think that there's been like a good and I guess increasing communication between these two Fields so I don't think there's any sort of like real absolutely like hidden secret hopefully not you know like uh definitely not you know you know uh but I think what we should be doing more is I think like uh we like remove more silos right so nothing like this is something that's like that takes sort of effort and somehow even uh you know relationship between people in creating societies right and and then we'll be doing some of the work you know like I think for example EC has become like much more like blockchain friendly and like you know now of course there's a lot of professors in the area which are like with their students like doing work and you know and I think the maybe the thing to show like to see next emerging is I would say like a tighter need doing the academic Community starting commitments and you know like uh let's say maybe the more traditional ATT Community speaks blockchains right so for example like if I were to talk about this here's a good idea maybe like uh I don't know if uh you know Amos is the uh you know the the home base let's say of commitment uh theoretical commitment on Research uh but then collocating Ms and EC and having somehow like a tutorial by you know Vincent and David on this kind of issues could be really helpful to spark somehow like uh like you know to accelerate research like yeah and again somehow like the reason why I think we're doing uh again this work on why you see became a small blocks and frankly is because ethereum actually with italic you know there was this like big tutorial Park in 2018 or something in Ithaca and then everybody said oh you know look we can we can actually solve these problems we're gonna have like impact these are like real world you know and people got excited and I think here clearly there's an exciting interface and if we really start talking with each other I think we're gonna have like important so yeah so and I think you know thank you guys for actually making this happen like I I've never had this conversation before uh you know and I think it's like a useful step in this direction for sure yeah I agree with George's and especially this idea also of having these kind of workshops but also more broadly we could have workshops for example also at EC uh to allow right because usually these things are somewhat gradual that uh I think it's completely true that EC has become uh friendlier to this kind of work um but it's it's very graduates little steps and it's like okay here we can clearly see a mechanism design problem right so we jump on that where here's a very clear Game Theory problem uh where are some of the other things are maybe still a little bit more speculative and so it would benefit from having some kind of environment like this Workshop um but also maybe workshops with um like with submissions at EC or something to um to allow people to experiment a little bit and think a little bit more about what could be a contribution what could be a paper uh maybe some papers that maybe you know aren't technically strong enough to be at EC yet but have an interesting idea I think we probably need some more of those menus yeah there'll be definitely very nice um what is would you say the best approach like when you think about blueberry tvi and the questions that the new types of AI are kind of raising and when you think about blockchain of the new objects for this theory of commitments like like the way just extend the space beyond what the theory has been thinking about or the objects that you can somehow represent them in this already existing uh Theory and maybe this informs the way to talk about it to to people who are practitioners yeah I think I mean you'll find some people who say well basically everything you can model in Game Theory right and there's some truth to that game theory gives you this extremely General language for uh for representing these kind of settings and thinking about them um but in part because it's so General there's many things you could model within it and many things have been modeled within it um I think this interaction and thinking about blockchain specifically in this context will get people to think about specific model specific games uh to be played that we haven't really analyzed as such yet so I do think that yes like at some abstract level you know there's nothing new Under the Sun and we can model everything as a game um these specific setups we haven't really studied yet and I think there's a lot of value in thinking about that some of that can I think probably be pretty abstract some of it in some cases maybe it doesn't really you know either abstract analysis it doesn't really matter whether it's on blockchain or not uh you can you know represent it fairly generic quickly as a kind of commitment game or maybe some kind of program game where you can commit to a certain program that may then have applications on the blockchain in other cases I think there is uh you probably do need to know a little bit more about the underlying architecture uh and you can think about designing the underlying architecture in order to enable certain things that you otherwise couldn't do so uh so that's I think kind of the space to think about like you know but generally it's good to keep in my view keep things as abstract in general as possible without you know losing the important aspects but then also be able to go back and actually build these things and think about well what are the uh the fundamental Primitives that we need in order to enable uh these kinds of mechanisms these kinds of commitment devices and so on right and maybe Twitter build this and maybe to maybe to counter propose here here's something that something will be very very useful from the perspective of practitioners in the blockchain space is to do something even in a more formalized way of your presentation today or in some sense like I think you give like a very nice uh you know high like high level but but also like a good level of detail of The Cutting somehow like reality of ethereum ecosystem and in some sense like now you know I would like to create something I would like to see such a description that could almost act as a as an API you say like look you know uh now create some power program equilibrium specification that can actually talk to this abstraction right and this of course abstraction will not be you know of course ethereum specific it should it should be clearly more General right but I would say like look we're gonna create something that's like at least it feels more tailored right to the specific constraints and this could allow us to make progress right because it's exactly going to be these constraints that say like okay look we're not going to talk about everything under the sky foreign yeah I really like that perspective I think thinking about the apis or like what are kind of the fundamental abstractions and interfaces that we need uh to be able to modularize and and sort of say well you know I don't really care exactly about the underlying implementation as long as it gives me this right that's I think uh the level app which we want to interface between some of these Cooperative AI ideas and actual implementations on the blockchain uh and that's where we should have that conversation yeah because I do have a question as an expert in Cooperative AI like which are the like where's the dialogue on Cooperative AI happening nowadays I know this is kind of like diffuse discussion right uh and and uh yeah but like us like you know as an expert in the area yeah where would you go where you know where would your best ideas like appear and so on help us help uh so thank you for letting me advertise so we have a Cooperative AI uh summer school coming up in Oxford uh sorry I think it's in London actually um and so that's in July if I'm right uh so that's coming up uh so we're thinking about uh building up these events you can talk more with Lewis as well I think there's a plan for a neurops workshop um so I think uh for now it's a little bit of this uh special events uh I think some of the work right we we have a couple of itch guy papers on our work now that I think fits very much Under The Cooperative AI agenda so there are the kind of familiar uh candidates of you know the the AAA IH guy promises also ECS of the world that are I think are a good home for at least you know the more game theoretic approaches to this uh there are other approaches to Cooperative AI as well um maybe a little bit more reinforcement learning oriented ones for example that naturally would have homes at new rips icml so I think so there's that aspect of it like you know some of the technical contributions will just uh be some part somewhere in some session of some bigger conference but the kind of more dedicated events I think is also really valuable to think where can we really have the discussion about what Cooperative AI even is which we're all still trying to figure out at some level as well and so that's you know the the uh the summer school will hopefully set some expectations for that and then at some point maybe we have more dedicated workshops as well maybe we can host something at CMU at some point um so I think we we need some of those a little bit more dedicated events uh probably we won't have a whole separate conference like at the level of Amos or even a smaller version of that uh just yet I think it is valuable to have those papers appear in the more General venues and that way also get feedback right because sometimes maybe we you know we think we have an original idea but somebody else as well you know actually that's technically very close to this other thing right so you know it's important not to be too insular um but at the same time we're definitely thinking about creating more of these venues and places to discuss uh more specifically like what do we want this broader agenda to be what kind of topics do we see as fitting in there what's of interest to us I think probably like with any academic area that will kind of emerge over time and it'll be a little bit of a like we know it when we see it kind of thing um but yeah still very much in flux so we're we're being told that the room is actually closing and I think yeah at seven there's a bit I think it's the same slabs one question was really about the future Direction and and the ways to to take this further um I just read it because I think it was very nicely written how can the field of AI leverage the benefits of crypto economic commitments to address coordination and Alignment uh challenges and and what might be the biggest potential obstacles in implementing uh soaking of this type um are there fundamental limitations or in other ways how can blockchain be used to constrain the risks of alignment in the end maybe JoJo's can you yeah I mean it's a great question uh but I would go like once one level but you know uh yeah so I actually working somewhere on the intersection of this areas oh actually no let me rephrase this working on both areas so let's say of like blood blockchains and uh you know I would say game theories plus AI like uh and being on the Committees of a lot of like conferences uh uh in this area I think the intersection is like not quite there right so yeah so yeah for whatever reason you know like there are people could do blockchain and a lot of like distinct work people who do AI in some sense like the the computational constraints of these two worlds are like vastly different right and then somehow at some point you know it suits people like choose one of the paths versus the other right and uh so so first of all I think we need to make these two worlds closer together right so yeah for example you know yeah I did mind nobody said like hey Hydro just you know like extreme Community disability like this there's no there's no such urgency right so but people on the other hand like they care too much about like they care about AI safe quite a bit but somehow to the extent that that blockchain solutions would be an enabler I think that's large in the conversation right now okay uh I I would want to believe that like you know the blockchains and specific commitments you know for all the reasons that we understand from for example equilibrium and generally distributorial Cooperative uh uh systems should be useful okay but uh how to action analyze this I think we're probably gonna need a combination of things that like you know in some sense uh I mean we would like to try sector I think this idea of like how do you do put these two things together let's take blockchains Cooperative Ai and for example this idea of differentiability you know that that day we talked about you know if you can like uh describe this so it's not only that you have to put let's say Cooperative Ai and uh sorry Cooperative Ai and uh blocks things together you also have to put neural networks okay done I mean uh I mean I think it's important right but you see how how you know just doing two of them together you know you're already like in the issue when like no like breaking like new ground right so now it's about putting F together yeah good let's do it so I think it's exciting you know it's exciting it's definitely hard work and the way to do this to understand The Works that already done on two of the three areas and try to understand how to add the extra component actually okay so yeah and as I said like this this kind of conversation like is definitely I think a step in the right direction okay and you know we should start sword like that's the other things like I think a lot of time when people like talk about like you know it's about solving everything and I'm saying like no no just give me the epsilence that you know that I can believe in that does not scare me too much so I believe that like you know it makes some progress there so I think this is the interesting thing to do to go for you know what what are the yeah the gradient steps in that direction right so that's it and and uh yeah I don't have good ideas so like but uh yeah I would just I would say yeah I wouldn't I would invite all of you to try to you know participate in this discussion yes that's a so we have some good news we have a room for I think 10 more minutes uh perhaps I would suggest we can move away from the problem of meta coordination and dig deeper into the technical specifics of coordination and specifically programming equilibrium um so Vince you said earlier that there is a world by cash flow on um basically having a population of programs interact with one another and sort of selecting away what is the but we know of a dominant or evolutionary dominant program out of them it feels to me as I've read more obvious literature that the problem of composition of these programs or how different programs relate to one another it's very Central to the to the current state of the app so could you tell us more about what are the biggest unsolved questions in the field yeah very good and um so I I don't think any of these competitions or other things have had a clear resolution as that this is the right way to do it um but I'd say there's sort of three different approaches one is to look for identity and programs right like you're looking really for a very specific program uh that you're actually going to scan whether it's that specific program uh maybe the same one as as this program that the program that I am let's say uh that's one way to establish uh cooperation and so that's in some sense works very easily and is easy to analyze and gives you folk theorems about being able to cooperate and do other things um but it's also very brittle because this really requires coordination on one particular kind of language one particular kind of thing that you express and that might at some point fall short as the environment changes and you need something else or as you start to interact with another community that converts to a different equilibrium so that's where that one falls short there's this other one where people try to do logical analysis of the other programs and actually try to prove things about the program right so given a program expressed in some language we try to prove whether it will in fact cooperate with us um so that's a very interesting uh Direction and gets into lots of unusual mathematical logic results like Libs theorem and so it's interesting but also a little bit mind-blowing and hard to think about it hard to really get your handle on and and I think that's exactly what happened in this competition that I mentioned before and I think in some sense the most robust one that I know about now is actually Casper's approach that relies more on simulating the other programs right as opposed to trying to really analyze them uh just getting to run them now this is tricky because in some cases this leads to uh in some cases even an exponential blow up in the number of runs that you need to do that if I need to sim simulate both of your programs but both of your programs actually also you know try to simulate the other two programs well this is never going to end right at the end um there are some tricks around that and that we maybe randomly sample some programs to simulate and we end some things early so that's I think a little bit the the Leading Edge of where these ideas are going um but simulation in some senses are very powerful uh way to proceed because if nothing else like the thing eventually needs to be able to be run right so if that's the only property that you can rely on that whatever crazy thing somebody puts together at least enough or otherwise maybe it's just going to time out uh and then you know that it's nice to be able to build on that and get the cooperation that way so that's what I currently kind of see as the most promising approach especially as these systems would get more complex at some point right like at some point uh maybe you know and like they're all George's points that he just made about well the computational uh of what we can afford computationally is very different uh when we're talking about a foundation model versus something on the blockchain I don't know maybe one day that comes together with off-chain computation or something like that um and in those cases it really becomes hard to just analyze the product how are you gonna analyze the code of a self-driving car that that seems you know going a bit too far uh but at some level you can audit it you can run it and say like well I'm going to put it through this sequence the sequence of tests right the more I think we can rely on that that all we need to do is run the program uh maybe run it under different conditions that I think is probably the most robust way to proceed and that's a lot of what we've been working on recently that we just think about simulation access right and nothing else but just being able to simulate it and even that can give you cooperation in various contexts um so that that's where we've been focusing yeah so this would have been actually my my next question like how do you think about the developing and let's say deploying these programs in environments that are not only complex but maybe let's say I need to make a commitment but the environment in which I am playing it changes over time it has a lot of features that maybe I'm unaware of so are there results of Game Theory questions that look at how how should I make commitment or how should I deploy my program that plays on my guitar when I have imperfect information about the game that is being played I don't even know the full space or strategies or what other players might be doing um yeah is there something to be said about this setting yeah very good so I think uh in general you can think about Dynamic settings right there there's a whole literature on Dynamic mechanism design but most of those approaches do require that you have some kind of concept about the kinds of things that could be happening once you start going to really open worlds uh I I would worry about committing to certain things too much right and sort of practically in in human societies right usually we have ways of rolling back our commitments uh right that's uh our laws for example usually can always be overturned some things need uh you know maybe we require a larger super majority to overrule but things are fundamentally set up to be somewhat flexible uh and so now that also creates some tension right because if you can overturn everything then commitments stop being credible potentially as well so that's I think where you need to find some kind of balance where sometimes maybe you need to say like well uh we're gonna commit that as as long as things stay within you know sort of the parameters stay within certain intervals then we are in fact committed to do this but we have some Escape Clauses that have something really unusual happens then we can uh exit from the commitments right and I think that's that's what we see in human life as well that the circumstances get really unusual uh then we change the laws and we change the expectations and we change the Norms um now you can think about right like for example in in Ukraine recently like you know when uh when that started happening a lot of the laws were you know kind of put on hold and say okay we're not going to worry about people doing this kind of thing because it's now obviously not our normal situation anymore uh I think that's sort of a characteristic of how we as human beings handle this and there's probably something to that in any sufficiently kind of open world where things might really change drastically that you need some kind of mechanism by which the the to come back and say like well okay all these things that we committed to before made sense in the context when we committed to them but now that context has changed so much that we need to have some kind of Escape clause for that the there's something new that personally actually some thoughts I mean the thoughts that I was thinking about it's more about the um maybe a kind of like a communicating application on this ideas right so I think uh you know I think all of these tools are going to be useful and you know uh if they can show that like look the there's the the blocks in the world like before the introducing before the introduction of these commitment devices and they work like let's say after and now this this explicit new capability that people actually care about and use right like think of example like you know like let's say uh uh cities talk about like Define markets and like moving like two years of dollars well clearly people care about that and and then you can talk about like the basic the you know uh the capabilities that a lot of this happen now I think the good interestingly be something new uh you know some news that's market right that can only be built in the in the presence of more powerful devices and I think like uh I think that's fancy towards like in mind right because then you know we have a vision to actually like be they'll jump into this complexities and and struggle with them right so over the last two minutes that we have maybe I want to open the a lot of the audience if there's any question uh on the topics yes what question do you think we should have asked you but we didn't ask Paul uh what the meta question [Music] yeah so the question was uh uh what what question uh you should have been asked by the audience but we did not ask you always a good question but I think we've touched on what I thought were going to be the most relevant things right uh again like I really like the George's idea about thinking about what are kind of the fundamental abstractions or Primitives that we want to build off of uh that will what is what you know on the Cooperative AI side what is what we need and then what can be delivered uh on the actual implementation side I think that's a really nice place for us all to come together and think uh what those are and um so yeah I would encourage more of that yeah my ask to this would be more not the what but who like I think uh you should definitely ask like Barnaby like more stuff like like in some sense like uh like understanding the I think the more you know the more you understand like the the present capabilities of the econ you know of the blockchain ecosystem as a Computing formalizing like that should be the most useful thing to take home especially if you don't have a background in this okay so like you know something your goal after today is still like okay here's like my you know during machine abstraction of of a computer right but for the for that video and then somehow like if you can you know and then like if you can get uh if you're gonna go home with a much better approximation I think that's very very usual and asking about is the best or and the other practitioners I would say you know is my proxy for like you know uh all of the people who do the hard work you know uh okay that's it yeah thank you both it was a very engaging session and yeah hope to see you soon thank you thank you
