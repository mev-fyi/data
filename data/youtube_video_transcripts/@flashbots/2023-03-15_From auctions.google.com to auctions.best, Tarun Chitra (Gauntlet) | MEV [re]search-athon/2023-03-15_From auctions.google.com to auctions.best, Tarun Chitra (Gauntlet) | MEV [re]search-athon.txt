but Max and Elijah's paper is on is one form of censorship that auctioneers or validators can have against you this talk is going to be more about another form of censorship that has to do with the communication between the auctioneer and the bidder you know I'm sure many of you who ever submitted to relay no the relayers have a lot of power there's a reason I have a lot of power and there's actually some sort of formal math around that that's what this is going to be uh my other talk was really just like leading up to this thing so like honestly this talk is probably superseded so uh also work with Matthias at Harvard and Berkeley so one amazing thing about the paper was like the day we were about this day before we're about to submitted this conference the doj likes put out this thing against Google and it was amazing because it was all about auction manipulation in the style of the thing that we wrote this paper about um but if you go into the actual uh doj filing um Google looked at every auction they limited which advertisers could could bid so they mutated the communication so one bitter might bid Google would say okay these are the current bids but they would only send them to some subset of people so it's sort of they manipulated the communication of the actual bidding process um and then Google itself kept a a bid for itself at all times which it would either disclose or not disclose and it would use that to manipulate the office the simplest form of this type of auction manipulation is in the second price auction so say we have a second price option if the option here adds a fake bid so second pyth option you know you get a bunch of bids let's say the highest bid is ten dollars second has been five dollars the way it would settle is the person who bid ten dollars pays five dollars now if the auctioneer has a fake bid at 9.999 they effectively extracted some Surplus in a way but and it's not intensive compatible so that's actually explicitly what Google is Accused which you know I think was it was actually kind of amazing that the doj took 10 years to build this case up because it's not like there's a big red button that says like manipulate in their code base right it's more like they have some complicated strategy and for some parameters it just learns the greedy algorithm of like jumping into space workers um and it's not easy to tell you the user have to watch 10 years of options and like the drj basically got 10 years of data from different ad networks who cooperated with them and that's how they sort of realized that there was a fun running but it took 10 years of data to get to this so okay so the classical option Theory version of the world uh is this idea that you have a bunch of different individuals thoughts humans whatever and they each have a value distribution so you know this first person they have this sort of gaussian looking distribution symmetric the second person they have an accidental distribution you should think of the x-axis as the value and the y-axis's probability yeah the idea is that I don't know exactly how much I want to bid for something but I I sample from a distribution on each each time I make a bit so this represents sort of the space that did to do and you can see sort of this person's a fat tail this person decays quickly the case quickly and so the idea in in the traditional auction Theory setup is each person has a distribution um and there's two main settings one is the independent values scenario so each bidder draws a bit independently and the other is the interdependent values where my bids depend on everyone else's business um in most of this will be targeted independent values case um but there's another paper on how to deal with an interdependent case that we yeah so let's you know go through the the second press auction exactly the example I said before Alice has value 10 Bob has value 5. um you know and sort of this is sort of showing this this notion that bidders are incentivized in second price auctions to bid what they think that's this notion of strategy proofness there's no reason to to bid against that but as I pointed out the auctioneer can cheat against you not the other bidders and that's a totally different note to the nintendent for probability in the sense that the seller has to also have some notion of incentive compatibility and that is uh sort of exactly what happened and so Google interestingly enough was actually you know I think they publicized and written all these papers that that they have moved back to first-press auctions but uh they only really have this blog post from funny playing one that showed that they actually went back so they were still using the second press option and the doj's complaint explicitly points out that the second price option that Google would self participated was the thing they're manipulating so now we're at the point to talk about what it means for a seller to be incentive compatible um and the interesting thing is the set of possible strategies inside the possible deviation is extremely large and one of the reasons for that is bidders send their bids to an option the auctioneer but the auctioneer has a strategy space that's I'm going to censor sending some of these bids to other people to tell people what the current state is I am going to tell certain people who get a preference in the auction some of the data faster or slower and so you have to talk about the actual Communications between the bidders and Auctioneer to analyze them so we have an Auctioneer running this mechanism sell one item the let's just say spot Builder single auction there's sort of a expected revenue from running the Mac internet and a safe deviation is a way of lying to players lying to bidders in a way that they can't tell that they're being elected so the simplest example is Alice sends me a bit of five Bob sent me a bit of 10 I think whatever I put them on Allison negative 10 bought something identified uh and I I don't send each of them the others did I only send Alex all the bids and Bob doesn't know objectives so that's a safe deviation in the sense that it's a deviation I can do that the buyer can't tell they were were deviated against and we say that an option is credible or sort of seller and Center compatible if for all possible safe deviations um running the honest auction is higher at least is high Revenue so you can't you can't increase your Revenue via any of the safe deviation so now we get to the crypto part and this is and crypto for photography not crypto for prescription um so commitment fee many of you probably know what commitment scene is commence scheme you have a message you have some Randomness you're able to commit to knowing this particular message in a way that people can you can later prove that you knew this message at a previous time there's a few properties that we care about different commitment schemes have many different properties uh but the first one is the notion of perfect hiding and perfect hiding means that I if I if I have two different messages and I use the same Randomness they're identically distributed perfect binding means I can't easily Forge uh another message where the two commitments are the same no collisions and the last part which is extremely important and anyone who's ever been in Bitcoin land uh you know like prestwich and Georgios uh is non-malleability and malleability of signature is a very nuanced property um which basically says I can't take your commitment and apply a function to the message and Randomness and generate another commitment to something that looks that is actually something else so I can't like reuse your commitments for something else and this is actually very hard proper to ensure um the main way of people do this now are with VK so you should basically be thinking of all the commitments we're going to talk about in this talk as coming from needing some form of of their output so the interesting thing about trying to do an auction on a blockchain versus private communication is the blockchain reduces the step of safe deviations so you know in the in the in the the examples I was doing earlier I was talking about how the auctioneer might take in all the bids and only select arbitrary subsets with who they send it to but if you force people to commit publicly on blockchain the set of deviations that Auctioneer can make is actually much lower because anyone can prove that the auctioneer was centering them oh and and the idea is that if you can make it a cost something to post a commitment and B it's public and people can dispute it then the set of deviation goes down and this is something I think mechanism designers didn't really think about in in the sense of like most economists kind of assume that like there's not a notion of a public commitment storage place so you actually have these private channels every few questions do you consider coalitions yeah all the possible quotes so yeah this is why the state Space is really bad for this it's like end bidders I have to consider uh on end route on K rounds of communication every subset of the ambiters over k-step so you have to the nks possible strategies okay so now what is this commitment option and so you know we'll we'll draw in pictures hopefully it's kind of relatively straightforward.com uh so again we have these different users they each have a value distribution you can develop think of the value distributions in the case nav option is I see a sandwich uh and I I you know I know the math profit of them let's say ten dollars but I maybe how much I'm willing to bid to get that ten dollar profit is represented by the support of this distribution so we have two stages the first is the commitment phase so the auctioneerness uh said okay everyone now you have to commit to commit to your bid and the most important part is because it's posted publicly on blockchain everyone is supposed to be non-nowledgeable commitments okay blockchain the auctioneer can't send commitments differentially and only to certain subsets again because it's posted in the first round on pain and incl even the auctioneer themselves if they want to make fake bids would have to post those things and what what you do and this is sort of this is where the normal like economic option Theory stuff comes in is there's a notion of a reserve test for auction uh when you have independent independent value options and um the reserve price is a kind of interesting object um the idea is and this is sort of the Myerson optimal auction theorem is that there is a function you can compute called Phi which is a pro dependent on the cumulative distribution function so the integral of F and your density and this function if it has certain properties uh gives you sort of notion of a resort price the the first price at which you know your value is equal to sort of what's called your hazard or like the the all of the kind of the tail some sort of notion of the average of the size of the tail of your distribution so the nice thing is again the auctioneer can't tell a bit that the commitment phase has ended uh while the other participants know it's going because it's done in a contract consumption so one other thing I didn't mention is um this notion of credibility that we've been talking about um in 2019 uh economists sort of proved this trilemma which says if I have a an option that's credible there exists no options that are credible truthful so that means bitter incentive compatible I bid my value and have bounded communication complexity they don't need uh you know the number of rounds is constant in the number of business um and the key thing about getting around this trilemma almost exactly the same as the way blockchain like consensus algorithms get around the capture them is that these commitments reduce the strategy space in some sense right and by reducing the strategy space that the auctioneer can deviate you could get around these kind of possibilities there so we're doing all of this because sorry I should have motivated that in earlier so but that's really sort of what this is okay and then you have a second phase which is the reveal phase um and now the auctioneer can't lie the bits come out and then um you know the auctioneer the other thing I mentioned there's this reserve price in this auction we actually make the bidders post collateral equal to the reserve price so the reason for that is the auctioneer needs to have skin in the game on their fake bit so if the auctioneer is doing adding fake bids uh they have to actually put up some collateral and they don't get back that collaterals they don't reveal so the key thing to this setup is that the collateral is um only given back to you if you reveal and you didn't win and if you don't reveal the the auction takes the collateral so you know that's that's basically it I mean the math is kind of annoying for proving some of these things but we're gonna ignore that and go read the paper but main thing blockchains are public broadcast mechanisms it changes how the auctioneer can behave in a way that I think economists have never really thought about in this this cool doj case is the perfect example of that uh in the sense that if you were doing it in the set of credible manner you you wouldn't have the stuff you saw in that sense the other interesting thing mathematically about um this paper that you know is not sort of obvious from the stuff there is um my co-author Matthias he he a couple years ago wrote a paper on getting around this trilemma with kind of different commitment schemes but he was only able to show it for very very uh thin-tailed value distributions that they had to Decay exponentially or super exponentially uh and the interesting thing is with the public posted commitment you can actually have fat failed value distribution and we prove uh some notion of sadder Tales uh you can get almost all power law Tales uh uh in this which is actually really interesting it's the first time that at least that I know of where by using cryptography you actually change the economic the economics of the participants when you talked about the uh person provided a commitment needing to reveal in order to get collateral back uh the idea of show bidding kind of entered my mind so if you wanted it as an Auctioneer to kind of Escape prosecution for doing this you could just get an anonymous Collective of Shield bitters to do that so then it just has to be that the commitment is such that it's not worth it to do so is that yeah exactly that's how you choose the amount of collateral you you force someone to do because like give it given their values that would always positive they could never have positive values one thing that you didn't mention that I didn't understand is is this a Time limited auction because like I've seen auctions where they add Time online depending on yeah yeah this is this is time limited yeah that that's a good point you assume there's a clock because you could just imagine a behavior right that change the behavior for sure yeah that's a very good point yeah so this is a good question so right now it's exactly equal collateral not over quadrant um the real question and I think the the research that's open and notes and topic is with stronger commitments or maybe some more type of like thing where the auctioneer proves some properties to you in ZK about the partial evaluation of the option can you get number one and it's possible that that might be true but it's actually it's way harder mathematically to show that so this is a simpler result but yeah I I think that the goal is to actually be able to use the DK Refugee to get it because the idea is like the auctioneer would have to keep proving these properties to you um and any deviation basically anything that was under collateralized you could check from a small number so yeah just a question about Google why did they shift from the highest visuals so like the the you know as Phil oh yeah I guess it's not here likes to say uh you know uh economists memes their way into duping people uh with the second press auction because like buyer incentive compatibility is sort of actually in some ways much weaker than salary and you can show that these second price auctions have this this buyer incentive compatibility property and people were like oh that's great that means that people are bidding their real value and there's not kind of yeah the show bidding type of problem but of course if the seller is front-running you it doesn't matter like and then that that's kind of like and the seller was the one telling you like hey the second the boxing is good for you it's not some incentive compatible for people yeah it's very yeah it's very intelling probably Google and that's that's right did Google stop after 2021 did they actually go back to the topic they went back yeah yeah but but they had been saying they were doing going to do it for a long time but then never didn't actually do it with the acquisition about before 2021 yeah if they're the last 10 years because like basically what happened is there used to be these other AD options so when you go when you search a random website and you see those little like ads you know like a box like power type Google whatever there used to be like five to six years ago a bunch of other competing options for these Remnant ads supplies with like these like random other ads and those people all saw like all the volume move off their auction and so they started collecting data on all the bids that they knew of and comparing the auctions and then gave it to the Future so that's that's like the talk to the doj case that they all they all were like we're gonna go bankrupt for them but yeah you read the the the case like the they've clearly got a lot more like statistical information than I thought you know do you give a try lemon on this uh is the contention that we can use blockchains to escape Chris Brown I don't know is that too strong yeah no that's exactly this is uh almost like beyond the Google I don't remember where I saw some thoughts that uh online advertisers because yeah because there's also yeah yeah exactly it's definitely it definitely has have been kind of public publicized but yeah I think that the problem is sellers understand how to build a lot harder to analyze it's just think about this like when you think about designing a layer too it's it's easy to make a child proof it's hard to make a proof of non-inclusion right this is exactly the same problem you have to prove that the auctioneer and sometimes didn't include and sensor and different kind of uh if you use your knowledge okay it doesn't like how does the uh did I guess there's like back towards really the option you can still understand where the prices are no no the the commitment scheme means that the auctioneer can't invert the post yeah yeah that's something would you eat collateral because you you need collateral so that you're basically flashing them if they don't reveal so like yeah yeah exactly I just want to connect my third Point here um larger class of value distribution this is the distribution of kind of where they brought bids from yeah and then the the intuition behind how you can extend this just by convincing everyone to one communication Style so then yeah yeah exactly exactly exactly because like when you compute this like expectation or maximum over all the safe deviations it turns out the set of safe deviations shrinks over public blockchain which suddenly you can use to write out that the tail is founded you can basically do any parallel tail that's like one over R to the one plus Epsilon like slightly worse than one over R whereas the previous results were like monotone Hazard which is like exponential dependent do you have a parameterization recommendations for this on a bond to force your ability yeah yeah so so if you knew the value distributions as a formula yes correct correct correct but you know let's let's that's your job go go go figure them out on all such at the same time that's a good point probably I don't know how to the reason about that there is like the throughput of your blockchain first of all yeah so if this collateral is still a funny song like they don't really know the best wife and you have something like this has to be a problem if I do some computation for sure yeah this is what I'm saying like there's a lot of stuff you can do to improve this this will just it's much easier to prove to actually prove this value distribution claim with this assumption but like I that's why I think there's you can extend this result you know someone actually needs to have those working maybe this guy [Music] oh do we actually need slashing here is isn't the incentive to like means option enough for the right you know foreign and so that's really collateral requirement comes in but like like having things like unlock adding other properties you prove I think you can lower it for sure so wait that's because no no so this this is actually for each distribution there is American reserve and the Myerson Reserve is X is you can think of the value uh little s is the density capital F is the CDF of your valuation yeah and then it turns out that this is called a virtual value and the place for your virtual value is zero is like the minimum you're willing to pay given your value distribution cancer option uh up in the if it's uh foreign yeah yeah I'm not saying that that's going to say but without any other questions I guess launch time
