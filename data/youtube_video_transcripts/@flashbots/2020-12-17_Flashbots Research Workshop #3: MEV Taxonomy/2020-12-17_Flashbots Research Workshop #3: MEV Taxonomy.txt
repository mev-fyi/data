so hi everyone nice to meet all of you nice folks some of you i know directly or indirectly through various medias mainly i mean i'm interested in the in the topic in general uh of the front runners been playing around a bit with the the general ones uh lately it did some some experience with with them that i i'll be happy to share and just want you to to join the conversation and see what you guys are are all about uh so i'm here more of a lurker at this point but uh yeah i'm happy to to help and and see some of my blog posts have been posted in in the chat so uh it's nice to see that uh some of you found them useful so yeah awesome all right so um let's go straight into it um thank you guys um once again and i think today um we're going to have as our second research workshop and we're going to um do it in a slightly different fashion than previously so um i would make a couple of quick announcements just to remind the folks here a lot of us uh initial deadline for flashbacks research proposals will be um this coming sunday so if you would like like to qualify as a meb one of the co-authors um for um the flash splashbox research papers there are two of them um feel free to create a uh flashback research proposal frp following the examples and the template specified on our med research repo and so um so for those of you new here check out our research roadmap and grab a research question and um i think we today we're going to focus specifically on a i would say a gap that is necessary to address to bridge the research and engineering side of effort of flash boss research um specifically we have sent out the research question ahead of time and a lot of us have started discussing on the thread and that is the mag research issue number 24. and alex would you mind sharing your screen um alex has already also shared the um uh as well in the current chat and that will be the focus of our call um today and uh we will spend the remainder if we have time 10 to 15 minutes to address some of the open um unclaimed um research questions um that we would like to invite those of you here or your friends that may be interested to snatch these as frps so yep all right so um alex do you want to um host this portion of the discussion sure that sounds good can everyone see my screen perfect nice all right um so we want to spend some of this some of this hour on talking about mv taxonomy um tina has opened this issue on the flashback research repo which is which is public uh but also syria who's on this call uh and alejo who's not here right now but who's also who's also part of our research efforts have brought this up as a research issue that needs to be cleared up um and it is actually something that we want to i don't want to say solve but we want to have some consensus as soon as possible because as we do more research and you know uh we have progress on different fronts we want to make sure we're aligned on the terms we use uh to you know to make sure for the sake of clarity and rigor as as tina has has written here um there is a clear and academic definition to minor extractable value uh the term itself having been coined by by phil who's who's on this call hi phil um i i'm not sure it's worth maybe going through the definition again um but i assume you guys all are familiar with the definition itself so minor extractable value being a uh an upper bound or the maximal value that can be extracted by someone with by a permissionless entity within the protocol that has uh you know the most that is the most powerful in terms of like transaction ordering uh and so it's uh it uh it's a within this this entity you have subsets of other entities that can also extract value from transaction ordering but miners are in in the case of ethereum the most powerful entity again permissionless entity um there is a more formal definition that phil has filled in his paper clockwork finance that isn't out yet that tina has put here where phil defines extractable value within a block and then minor extractable value is just taking that extractable value and condition having a condition on it uh basically using the the miner's permissions as the condition on it um so that's that's i guess the crux of the problem here which i've outlined a little bit in my first answer to this issue is at least in our case for some of the efforts we're doing at flash bots and that i'm i'm kind of working on more closely i think this i've definitely noticed confusion uh in the term mev and also there is confusion because this is so new it's it's it's in kind of research field um and how we classify it and how we understand it um so yeah this is i guess the context on all of this um so tina if if that's what you had in mind for the discussion i can just quickly go through what i pointed out uh or we can just generally uh go through a discussion because i'm not sure it's worth just going through everyone's comments most uh i mean um i think uh i think framing it um in a way so that i think we want to arrive at a conclusion that is ex uh actionable um i wouldn't say um you know it's an i think it's a ongoing topic but i think we we should uh frame it so that uh at least the engineering effort um that we have will be um essentially yeah especially so i think the the the first issue that uh and this is talking from experience you know having written that blog post for flashballs and generally talking with the community the first issue that i think uh is a problem with the term mev is that it is used currently uh both to mean extractable and extracted value the actual definition is extractable right but when we describe for example the mev taken in that block we say for example the mev extracted et cetera and so that leads to confusion for what is mev so the actual definition of fmev is a potential value um and is not extracted and so uh looking to make that clear would be useful both uh for the for the public to understand uh what is actually meant when we're talking about a theoretical number versus when we're talking about what has been taken from that particular block related to transaction ordering um and so the my my first question there was how how can we better differentiate between the two concepts right so i mean one natural answer is just to have extractable and extracted more more clearly uh in the language of what of what we describe in a way that uh people can see that clearly um so i guess that's that's one one kind of uh issue that i pause it to this call um the the second one that i think is another big kind of misleading thing is that people expect that this value is extracted solely by miners whereas the term miners for minor extractable value refers to that upper bound in terms of the the rights that miners have as this most powerful permission entity permissionless entity sorry um and so that's also a little bit of a problem the term minor start the value itself is rigorous it is it is uh that's that's that's what it means right it's hard to have something else but it still leads to a confusion where people think oh miners are extracting this value when in reality at least today this value is being extracted by you know defy traders that are doing liquidations uh et cetera et cetera and so uh coming to to some more clarity there i think would also be great what coming to more clarity there i'm not entirely sure whether it's just generally having more notice around who is who is extracting this value or potentially again uh reducing the use of the term minor extractable value to more defined scopes rather than saying the mev extracted key or some something like this um the third point that again i want to pause it to this discussion or propose to the discussion is generally that uh people think that this problem is only uh valid in in proof-of-work based blockchains where where you have a a leader in in the consensus protocol um and so they think you know in in proof of stake for example that doesn't matter et cetera and that's because the of of the two minors uh so potentially having a broader term that is not minor factor value but i don't know validator extractable value or something this i feel less strongly about and maybe it's more of a long-term change that uh can be accompanied with more research uh and you know if you do introduce a term like this to uh include uh eth2 used to in that maybe you want that to be accompanied with research related to that where where how this values can be extracted um and then the last question uh which this one is a little bit more i guess broad and i'm not entirely sure whether we can come to a conclusion at this discussion but it's definitely worth talking about is you know once we do have uh some sense of you know clear language between extractable and extracted and a way to to kind of classify it at that level the deeper level then then becomes um you know can we differentiate between different types of value extracted so i wrote for example good or bad bad you know in that case maybe meaning you know a clear negative social impact maybe is there extracted value that is more desirable than others for example the extracted extractable value generated from you know a price um price difference on unit swap and and uh someone outside of unit swap you know snatching that arbitrage to rebalance the pool so that its price is in line with the other liquidity pools that are not not unesco that is mev right um well i mean that is extractable value uh but it's useful value because it's part of the system so there is a sense that should people understand what extractable value is it can be part of the tooling of mechanism design in general and i think part of having more well-defined terms around it means we can we can we can emphasize that more um and in our research and and any implementations going forward we can we can have more more of that um and one one last bit that i put there is is is whether extracted value only comes from uh meddling with transaction ordering or if there's other stuff there that is non-transaction ordering related extracted value um and whether we should differentiate between these things so in summary four things first one the problem of mev being used interchangeably for both the extractable and extracted second one being people thinking that mev is extracted by miners um and the third one being that mev is relatively confined to you know the reality of ethereum today and it's in its consensus protocol uh however mev applies to any blockchains where there is uh you know where there is a leader in transaction ordering uh so it is most most uh blockchains um yeah so i guess this is this is what's worth talking about today and in terms of reaching a conclusion at least for these these first two two points let's zoom in zoom in on them a little more um and so you know today on this call it would it would be awesome to talk about this more uh see see what people think and you know i'm i'm i'm expecting the the conversation maybe start a little slowly but then have back and forth one thing i do want to say is obviously you know we're here to uh exchange with each other and there's no you know don't be afraid at all of saying something that might might be wrong and things like this this is totally fine and the point is to really bounce bounce ideas and arrive at something that we we think make sense um so i'd love to hear phil's phil's view as as prob i mean the most knowledgeable on this call about this yeah i mean i think we have the same issues um or the same two broader issues i think i agree with you that the first one has ended up being way more confusing for people than the second like the def the distinction between what was actually extracted which is actually what we measured in flash boys as a lower bound for what could have been extracted um but yeah what could have been distract uh extracted is uh is uh kind of the security term that we introduced and like the attack analysis dealt with what could be uh extracted in theory and not necessarily what was uh so i'd be curious to just hear what different people here think i think one thing we're doing in the new paper to give a little bit of a spoiler is just like renaming things to extractable value we're still talking mostly about mev but we also have this thing we call extractable value which maybe is just a generalization and maybe we'll take off or not i think the debate on our side is like mev is clearly a meme it unifies people people know what movie is across various protocols uh there's like a trade-off between redefining also introducing too many new terms in itself being confusing and like taking advantage of the kind of brand recognition we already have while making it less confusing to people and like i wish i had an easier answer uh in all my talks more like bowled the able inextractable but i don't think that's like a good long-term solution that's just like the way i've been i've been introducing it to people um uh but yeah i think it is a real issue with the terminology and i don't personally have a good fix yet i'm open to what people think i will say that my favorite uh my favorite i guess terms all include some notion of ordering so like order extractable value or like uh something like that um sequence sequence extractable value not sequencer but like sequence i don't know but these are all kind of also like somehow less punchy than minor extractable value minor extractable values also like the scary meme of like the miners are coming to extract the value um and i think that has led to people actioning on it so yeah all to say i wish i had a good solution these are these are good issues and i'd be curious to hear what other people think what what what kind of confusion is uh do you usually witness like just just as a question like i know of course it is defined as extractable and not extracted but once you basically know more or less what it is so i wonder like what what are the kind of questions that were asked in confusion on this uh to maybe help think about it better yeah i think one of them is like um well the miners aren't extracting anything so like why not and like the bots are the ones who are extracting so why is that minor extractable value if the bots are the ones who are making the money so like people look at the game and they say like right now they're profiting that's just like on wall street it doesn't really have anything to do with miners except that the miners are prospecting the transactions um so why call it minor extractable value that would be like one thing that i've had asked um or i guess um yeah there are more subtle versions of this confusion just like when you show numbers and people are confused about like are the numbers you're showing you're showing like things that have been extracted or are you computing like the maximum possible reordering um so like exactly what are you computing the other the other high level point here i guess is that minor extractable values really the whole point was to have like a single number that can like measure you know everything which i think it is in theory but like in practice it's probably going to be really hard to measure at any given time so we're probably always going to have estimates instead of actual value and communicating where those estimates come from what the methodology is and like what the limitations are and how that differs from the actual theoretical number that is like measuring the security i think is also a heart related challenge um and i guess one thing i also want to say which is because i saw the chat message that said uh the the memphis expectable value i think that is something we can talk about although to me like that's a i don't know maybe it's a little bit of a subset because it somehow like reorgs seem to not involve the mempool um so like if you if you do like a time-banded attack i think that's also mev and maybe we want to split that off into a separate term of like single block versus multi-block med because they are also different minor games um that you would want to play and like it might be possible that we end up in a world where people are extracting single block maybe the mempool extractable value let's say all the time but no one ever does like a reorg on like a profitable period to extract like the full amount um so then maybe it's useful to have separate terms for just like the one block versus the multi-block um so i think these are all open questions that i'd love to hear got reactions too yeah i think other things i've heard uh other proposals are like sequencer extractable value which i think doesn't really solve problem a in our a b speed list uh but maybe does solve problem b um but also i don't know it might also be confusing right because like sequencers are something specific in like l2 context and then if we use sequencer extractable value to also refer to the fact that miners are sequences on l1 that might be confusing so also also might be confusing the previous point that you made that if there are no forks then maybe it's kind of a different so actually i think that memphis extractable is maybe [Music] better relates to what it means when you hear it for the first time at least yeah yeah i think i think it might be worth splitting off another term i don't know uh i think we don't want to we don't want to split our memes too much but like having a taste of mev that's like you know m prime ev them full extractable value i think uh and one epm bev which i'm pretty sure is like some corporate acronym in germany or something bought extractable value um so for even actually looking at the comments on the issues even within there there is a slightly different understanding for what this value is for example scott is mentioning he sees a minor extracted value i mean he sees extracted that how much the miner actually extracted when i see extracted as a value that has been extracted from transaction ordering right so it it it does feel like potentially taking that minor term away and just mentioning um like value extracted from transaction ordering um could could be like a nice way to to make it clear for people and then there's an implicit thing that who has the most power in transaction ordering miners do but at the same time it kind of hints at the fact that bot operators do have a say in transaction ordering and they express their their preference through gas right um ultimately it is the miners who who order the transactions of course but uh at least there is a sense of uh a transaction ordering slash transaction priorities prioritization is is kind of hinted at yeah i think i i like so i'm i definitely uh uh think that we should move to extractable value maybe i don't know maybe we should discuss whether order extractable value is more clear but like kind of the consensus i had with the co-authors of the clockwork paper was like extractable is is nice um but we still have to somehow communicate extractable versus distracted i guess and maybe that's like a communication thing or maybe we can make that clear somehow um like maybe maximum extract extractable value versus like realized extractable value or something like yeah i don't know those might be a little too financial to be mean but uh yeah i mean i i i like the the idea i mean i like the term mvv and i think it definitely resonates with people but um i like the idea of having a more clarity around where this value is coming from um but so is is like order order extractable value or like transaction ordering extractable value is that a rigorous term as in does it does it encapsulate all the ways uh although like different because i mean yeah does this order include censorship for example yeah that's a philosophical question and like if you want i can also go have this debate with a bunch of academics whether they like this or not like spend all day worrying about definitions uh i don't know i personally to me like ordering includes insertion between censorship because the value is still you know in like the sequence almost like a value of a sequence and i guess ordering is is could be argued to not include insertions maybe it would be the drawback but yeah i don't know philosophically i feel like if you're talking about the value you can extract from an ordering and you can insert your own stuff that's still like in scope i think that would be fine but that's just my own personal opinion people people like read about these things for like weeks so i'm sure i can engage in that useful but i'd also be curious to hear what you guys think yeah this is definitely a bike shedding at least in part but i think maybe max you know med for maximum extractable value versus ev for just extracted value could be a way of differentiating though of course ev has the problem of like being expected value you know typically though uh i guess it won't be it typically won't be confused for that right it's like a different setting but the eevee is very common you can have eb exactly your expected yeah your expectation of your extracted value yeah yeah yeah i agree overloading ev that's a good point maybe not the best one maybe we should go back to the uh i do like maximum extracted value maximum extractable value so maybe just change minor to maximum and then change and then have like um like past extracted volume i don't know pe something that's like what actually happened [Music] um i mean one one potentially good thing by separating the the term um from minor is that you you could still have minor extractable value and it would be one upper bound and then you could have like got extractable value which would be an upper bound that the note uh the value that can be extracted by different actors of the system one is a subset of the other but it would still be potentially interesting to have another limit to point to to say like as a ba operator does that and not a as a operator who's not a minor this is how much you can like uh hope to extract or this is like the the limit on how much you you can extract yeah or maybe yeah i i kind of like bot extractable value so basically we pay if we look at only actors without hash power who can uh yeah can although i think it would be like if a bot was perfect then it would be the claim so like yeah really bad extractable value is asking like what's the loss in like the communication between bots and minors that makes that yeah yeah true sure um okay so trying to bring back the conversation to uh some kind of actionable conclusions uh again because this would be you know we would use this term in uh i mean use this this potentially revised term and definitions for upcoming public communications and for uh generally communication within within our research efforts to to make sure we're like talking about the same things right um so how do people feel about like order extractable value or something like transaction ordering extractable value so something where the minor term is taken away so that leads to potentially less uh misleading led individuals when it comes to thinking that miners are extracting that solely miners are extracting this and at the same time it hints at that it's from transaction ordering which will make it a little clearer uh we do lose the fact that the having the minor term there sets a strict like definition of like the the permission of of of that entity that extracts the value but i guess there is an implicit link between uh transaction ordering and minors that people can make as they look into this more um [Music] so how do people feel about that [Music] probably around me they've been doing that every five minutes night and day sorry i'll move myself shower to the sound of roosters that's my kind of plate you'll love this place phil um so my straw man proposal would be um uh instead of calling out ordering to keep the mev meme and just change the minor to maximum in all our communications maybe even do like an explicit explainer page and then i don't i still don't know what the best way to talk about value extracted is maybe like then we just talk about bot extractable value bev extracted or something like or just ev if we want to overload that extracted or maybe we have like a special term like um uh realized value or something so we have like minor or maximum extractable value you know uh maximum realized value or something which is like the amount that was actually extracted um so just to change the acronym so then uh so is isn't isn't there a risk by doing maximal extractable value that people are even more confused because then they think it's minor and in some older definitions it'll c minor but then we say it's maximal as well so we like you know the m is being used for two different words that's that's a fair point um yeah i think i think there is a chance we could do a successful takeover but that is a good a good point yeah um all right all right i i like the idea of saying something like extractable value realized though or something or expectable value like profited i don't know like uh converted you know like uh exploited if you um overload the mvv acronym i think either way like you'll still have that case where people will see some and right like like uh transaction whatever right like tev and and you know they'll go back and say okay what is mev and how is that not tev or like i think that muv confusion will stay regardless but uh so yeah i mean i don't think it's it's actually it's actually that bad to overload maybe like i think it would just be it would be easier for people to like you know continue to like converse about it and not have to sort of constantly be thinking about how the terms you know how new terms are emerging yeah i agree um and we can do like a little podcast circuit to get the thought leaders or whatever where most of the people who are talking about med like on the same page about the new i mean like i kind of like the idea of upgrading it because now that we have real proof of stake systems starting to do volume uh it's kind of like the evolution of mev it still means the same thing in proof of work systems like whether you use maximum or minor they're equivalent for any old system but now for new systems we like gracefully upgrade the definition to still be valid um so that's kind of why i i like that takeover idea but it is practically gonna be difficult to like overload the definition that's on google and things like that uh so i agree with that concern for sure that's good no but i like the idea of like gracefully transitioning though yeah it's the proposal to transition like the minor is the maximum in like all old systems so the proposed evolution um the ideal concept that we evolved into is either maximal extractable value or i thought i thought we also there were proposals but wasn't discussed such as validator you know extractable value or transaction order extractable value those are uh i guess more generalized or do we pass on those already i think uh we we kind of um um there's a little bit of a pass on this because one the mev meme is quite strong and it would be like changing that um and two uh i think if you change it to maximal extractable value you you as phil said you know that that encapsulates like proof of stake as well for example uh and so in that case it's a much easier solution where we we preserve or retain the meme that is mev uh while at the same time uh you know encapsulate other um other contents protocols um so i kind of like that yeah i think i think it's i think it's very clean and i think that the one thing i'd have again like i like ordering because i do think ordering is like fundamentally important and people don't think about it enough so that would be nice to like call attention to it but i do think it would maybe confuse some people when it comes to like inserting your own transactions so like just a big defy hack for example like let's say you have a fat bzx hack it's not clear that that's like ordering extractable value even though it is but it's like clearly maximum extractable value so uh um yeah i like real i like rev also realized extractable value or um yeah yeah i think i think this is a very clean set of um proposals cool um i wonder if scott and scott and jason if you have any any comments on on uh these particular terms uh i i think the only term that i wanted to bring up that i brought from my comments was just there's like there's a third one um you know which is there's the maximum that could be extracted theoretically there's i mean we should look at how much is extracted and then there's the what the what the bots actually walked away with you know it it's a little less academic because it's not based on you know like a pure review of what's happening but i still think that it might be interesting to make sure that there's room in the in the naming of systems to kind of capture those three attributes so that so that would be a potentially like bought extracted value right so it's to be able to denote the value that can be extracted or it has been extracted by an entity within that permission a system that doesn't have such rights in terms of transaction ordering that miners have right okay there's bot extracted minor extractable and minor extracted i would make it i would make it bot extractable so then what i would say is like look this is the bot extractable value if you're a bot operator right and then we have another one which is just like bot profit we can just use the term profit which is like our usd estimate of like the profit and so you can see it as a business case where like for this value you can make this profit these are some associated expenses and like it's like any other traditional business where there's like written expenses that you have to factor in from like the the the bot extractable value is almost like your revenue cap and then how much that you can actually take home is like on you as a business basically yeah and changing market conditions you know if it gets more competitive yeah exactly yeah i see i see it i totally see scott's point though and that that goes back to the confusion right with minor extractable value when you talk about bots extracting that value having a term for that instead of saying no this is trading bots that have extracted minor extractable value is is is confusing right so if that's changed to maximal extractable value and then you have a subset of that that is bought extractable or bought extracted value about extracted value something like this we have a clear term to the to denote that value i think that will make it a lot clearer yeah i think i agree with all that um zero tx fees for who for the miner so yeah i think for the miner we have to assume zero tx fees but probably like assume also capacity limits of like the hard-coded gas restrictions but like anything they can do within that i think would be maximal extractable value the yeah the real bot profit will probably be where the dxv is lowering things i guess i guess a more subtle question is should we include like the opportunity cost of like them not mining other tx's in the mempool and i think that's also yeah we should all um jason do you have any any comments no well the name gives you something nice all right well uh we can definitely move on from this part of the conversation i'm pretty happy with what we've what we've kind of come to somewhat of a consensus song i think it makes a ton of sense it's kind of elegant as well i like the backwards compatible a lot a lot a lot um there is a challenge of uh minor and maximal being confused i do think we can do a good job at that and in any case because it is backwards compatible they're not like completely orthogonal definitions uh rather just just an upgrade um yeah we can have like a blog post like why are we upgrading it yeah totally totally or you know in a blog post about clockwork or something i can kind of spend a little bit of time on that um great so for the rest of the discussion tina either we can move on to other research related topics that are not related to the taxonomy um or we can go to we're not done with the taxonomy i think the the bulk part of it is actually uh about a taxonomy is actually what buckets things fall into yeah so that was that was my second second option before you can talk about all right all right so the the the now that we have somewhat of a more more defined and clearer terms that we we we plan on applying the other question is uh you know does right now we kind of encapsulate all this value as this one monolith when in in reality it can have a lot of different labels um and so thinking about what those labels are would be super interesting to be able to classify this this this value in a systematic and rigorous way uh this i expect is a much longer conversation but it'd be awesome to start talking about it now so i guess good or bad is is very subjective and i put that here more and more as as to to like taunt people a little bit than than as like a very very serious point there is there is an argument to be made here that there is value extracted that leads to you know negative social impact for example you know a hack or something like that uh that hack that looks like a structural art um i don't think uh in my um understanding of a taxonomy i think good or bad about uh imposing a value system on top of it before we actually kind of look at it more objectively in terms of whether there's other meaningful way of dissecting it like i i think what um the the the kind of sequence that um georgios is proposing is something that more along the line because before we jump into good or bad that becomes so subjective that we it's going to be very difficult to actually reach a meaningful conclusion anywhere but in terms of labeling um before we go into like labeling like kind of uh can we can we in some sense like um account for the different types um in other systematic way that doesn't involve uh value judgment [Music] yeah you're you're totally right um i let people kind of talk i'm i'm gonna share my my screen yeah i'd be curious to hear what other people have to say about this i think one related conversation here is also our data gathering of like making sure we have a comprehensive view on all the mev um and once we do that kind of breaking that down um i think there's some obvious ways maybe by dapps and maybe we can cluster it further so here maybe some um scott uh from your side um from classifying mev based on different types of dabs do you think it's feasible like how do we how can we do so so we arrive at a comprehensive set um and yet be able to label it like as good or bad you mean um not as good or bad i think we should uh visit uh revisit good or versus bad after we have um we should um i think we should first try to see if we can come up with an objective um kind of classification based on types of transaction activities or um rather than uh directly labeling overlaying value judgment on top of it so not good or bad but rather like classifying based on the different gaps or um i mean i mean how is that different from what we have right now oh i'm not saying different i'm saying essentially how do we systematically so that it's actually uh when we are what we're labeling is comprehensive or can you explain a little bit to the rest of the folks here who's not familiar with our mbbs effort how we are currently classifying it and where you see us limit is to um you know um the current approach um yeah sure i mean we we inspect the various actions that occur inside of a transaction and get an idea of how token flows are moving and what types of actions are taking place and we roll those up into a overall profitability and overall um type of transaction for instance there could be a liquidation it could be an arbitrage there could be um you know basic incentivized um like bot maintenance so for example if like uh uh uh like a cryptokitty birth for instance is not a um you know it's not an arb it's not a liquidation it's just sort of an incentivized bot activity i think you could probably file things like the keep the kp 3r system into these sort of things so just these classifications of basic actions roll up into a classification for the overall transaction with a profitability um attached to it it is limited by the very explicit things that we know about i think that's probably the largest limitation is you know we only understand the mev that we have specifically classified via its internal actions uh and there's there's a lot out there that we're not um for instance one of the things that we're missing right now that i think is gonna be really important because it's huge in terms of mavs probably larger than all mev combined right now is the uh the empty set dollar um redemptions those are just massive three times a day mevs and you know because we haven't written the code for that we don't capture that and that's probably about i don't know a quarter million dollars a day of mav sometimes more and it's and it's it's a good mvv right it's it's like some it's a part of the system behaving properly so there are things that are kind of easy to tell that they are you know quote unquote good it's kind of hard to classify things as bad unless you i mean are are are you know unless you've already classified them you've already understood the sandwich attacks of uniswap or these other systems yeah i think those are all uh good points um i think so i i sent a suggestion to the uh i guess inspect channel the other day that i think it would be good to cross validate using other sources like looking at mempool pgas and looking at mempool data just to see other heuristics for like this is a bot for example if they play in a pga or if they send spam during a block or something there's a high probability that they're a programmatic actor so we can just tag them and say see like what percentage of those kinds of transactions we cover and which ones we don't uh so i think that's one way to start getting the rigorous taxonomy and then i think you know like that's a lot of that work is uh is also a good start of like liquidations uh like crypto kitties like midwife pattern i guess is what it was called in the first i don't know what people call that pattern now where you like poke a dap um but yeah maybe maybe coming up with those patterns and like some fundamental differences between them might also be interesting on the research side so saying like for example maker liquidations are different from cryptokitties birthings because uh cryptokitties birth things like you want it to happen after some block because of the protocol and it like you want it to happen no matter what at some point after that and like the protocol will pay for that to happen basically um and uh like it's a different pattern than like a maker liquidation where it depends on like conditions in that block and like it may be an opportunity that's like ephemeral and it goes away at some point um or you may have like opportunities to rectify and like take away the mev it just seems like there's some differences there that we can kind of zero in on like exactly how are all these different patterns that we've labeled ourselves different um so i think that's the thing that still needs to be done those two parts of like the validation of comprehensiveness and then also like a more formal taxonomy of like the types of patterns that we're seeing is that consistent with i guess uh yeah yeah it's yeah totally it's i mean they're similar in that they are both actions that have been incentivized to anybody who wishes to operate them and need to take place within a certain amount of time but the the justifications and the way that they change over time is is different but they're both good right they're both intentionally created systems by adapt designers that not that are not only incentivized but systems fail if they are not executed yeah yeah and i think even for the good and the bad like it'll end up being more subtle than that so i agree with the suggestion to like call that out as a problem but like table answering it until we have a better view because like even for like a maker liquidation like it can be good if that position is actually unhealthy and like the person was just not paying attention and the price moved slowly and like everything worked as intended or it can be bad if there's like a black swan event and like the miner manipulates the order in this block to like push down the oracle to just enough of a price to liquidate before the user can respond and like also censors that transactions it's the same mechanism but i think like one actual scenario of it playing out would be good for the network and for users and another one would be bad so i don't think we can we probably need a more advanced understanding before we can start thinking about that i would guess um i want to quickly bring up the point that george has made related to that where the the current labeling is done for you know the a single single transaction and it's then when you when you look at uh on the multi-transaction context that you you can start having you know developing an idea of whether it was intended unattended and potentially good or bad so it's a it's in you know like a sandwich you need swap trades with large slippage and that type of stuff i like the idea of using labeling for a single transaction that is relatively simple like a trade an arb i mean trade in our business trade but are liquidation et cetera where it's relatively clear and then build on top of that where um well looking at it on a multi-transaction context you you can better understand the the impact it has had yeah i think that's a great idea i think we definitely need to generalize any work we do to like sequences uh i think the single transaction case is reasonable for like an estimate and a bound and a dashboard for bots but i think yeah eventually we should definitely think about upgrading that analysis and by eventually i mean right now all right so so maybe the the the taxonomy is a multi-level one where uh there's a level at the single transaction level and that's much simpler to kind of label and then the the real challenge will come at the multi transaction level where um in that case it's it's much broader but at the same time you definitely have ideas of things already that are uh net bad and net good um and these can be sequences that can be labeled or codified as as good or bad or i mean good i don't necessarily like good about maybe something more precise and less less subjective uh but intended for example could be another another word right some mvv is is is intended in the design of a protocol versus the unintended one that usually has negative consequences yeah i think in our taxonomy this single transaction falls better into bot extractable value because bots in the ethereum network can't ask for other people's transactions to be ordered a certain way that's like one of the limitations so in some ways they're like limited to the single transactions they can produce and like their extractable value their extracted value uh the realized bev or whatever the bot profit is going to be the sum of all of those transaction values that they made uh because they can't reorder transactions or do other things other than make their own transactions to the miner that's their only channel so unlike for minor or maximum extractable value where like the function is not going to be a simple sum of every individual transaction it's going to be a function of the whole set for bots specifically you can just sum because there's like some independence there between the transactions i think [Music] but we might be getting a little too into the weeds um yeah i would be i know we only have like a few minutes left and i want to respect people's time but i'm curious if other people on this call have any other comments or research items or blockers anything they want to talk about [Music] i want to hear um i guess tom coming from product designer oh sorry manager for meb explorer which will help essentially in these metrics to manifest into an interface that will propagate essentially the definition of means and taxonomy um you know what your take away from the current discussion is and how you think you know your any gaps in actually designing it or tweaking it yeah um i uh you know i have not spent as much time again thinking about this as other folks here but you know my bias is always towards uh you know reducing acronyms and reducing introducing new new new concepts and at a minimum not not overloading acronyms i think you know we're kind of doing right now um and we talked about this over last week when we went through the mocks for uh med explorer um where i prefer is just you know reusing um and sort of repurposing you know the keeper concept which is like getting more and more sort of popular in in defy people know sort of roughly what keepers do and sort of um the activities that they perform it's it's not you know one-to-one with um i think bots or or sort of sort of me or reordering um but it's like a reasonably good enough approximation that i think we can um uh reuse it for for um you know some of our our purposes so you know i i would say biasing towards like um simplicity versus like precision um i think is is the right move um in in whatever sort of scenario that we go down um so um a little bit a little bit hand wavy but um and i'm happy to sort of provide more concrete pieces of feedback if we have you know exact sort of you know an exact taxonomy that we're thinking about using but um that would be sort of the guiding principle when i think about this kind of stuff so um tom is my understanding in the sense that we believe that the keeper sets of uh terminologies maybe you can elaborate a little bit more because i feel like that's less um you know that has been not discussed basically in our current uh uh you know terminologies but i think we're aware of but i think you'll be good to actually just uh elaborate a bit more and i i know that we are running up uh on time um i do think we should continue this discussion um actually on this call for whoever actually on be on this call because i don't like to have our workshop to have no conclusion and i understand that a lot of times i think um a lot of research questions deserves a lot more kind of sharing of infor information so that it's actually very precise that gives enough information for other folks to really think about um so i want to encourage folks to stay on this call if you actually want to drive to a conclusion yeah but uh tom please uh go ahead and explain a little bit yeah i mean in terms of in terms of next steps um i mean i think yeah this kind of work goes better when you have a single point person who like does the draft and then we can review as a committee or review as a group but i think working as a group tends to be you know no one really wants to sort of you know put their foot put their foot down and um you know say hey here's what i think we should be doing and here's sort of the you know the fully baked package so you know in my mind what would be great for our next step is if someone stepped up and said hey here's what i think of v0io for like the taxonomy and the um you know sort of sort of preferred naming for all these different things is going to be maybe maybe um on next week we all review and sort of sign off and sort of edit that person's draft as a collective but um yeah i think you know that's why when i was you know sort of mapping out the box um i i'm trying to use uh again sort of like terminology and metrics and stuff that like are again focused less on precision and more on like um understanding like like like drock ability and people's ability to um um actually yeah sort of sort of intuit and understand what's going on and that often means sort of reusing your repurposing concepts that people are already familiar with and language that people people are already familiar with um can you share a bit more on the keyboard set of terminologies that you're specifically referring to so that everyone here can be on the same page because i think that's uh where most of us here are less familiar with the keeper set of terminology compared to a lot of the default traders yeah for the trader traders yeah um so i mean i think like you know what scott was talking about or like the esd bots for example um or you know a lot of stuff that's in either like keeper.network or keeper dao or like you know the maker keeper actual actual code base um it's like these um um things that that occur on chain that aren't about you know like like trading bots where you're not taking a um directional bet or directional position on buying or selling an asset or something like that it's literally about um capturing some sort of you know free money that is on change so that's poking something that's arbitraging something um that is doing some sort of you know atomic sort of transaction that that sort of guarantees some sort of sort of profit um and there's a whole sort of you know um i think like uh nomenclature instead of tooling instead of instead of folks who use these kinds of things and i think um you know the way this sort of wraps in nav is like well who is going to be you know um uh managing the keepers who is you know you could say arguably there is a minor and maybe the minor is also writing their own sort of keeper that is actually doing the the you know um sequencing and doing the transaction ordering but like it's it's it's it's like that that is sort of like the the level of abstraction and then it's kind of a question of like who is actually gets to you know fill that role who actually gets to uh manage that manage that that process is it you know individuals um is it is it mining pools um is it is it things like that so um that's kind of i was biasing towards keepers i also don't want to be the only person sort of pushing for this if we feel like you know maybe keeper is is not precise enough for our particular purposes but um uh you know that would be sort of my bias but um again i i think for like a next step we have a lot of really good ideas sort of floating around and i think um it's it's a little bit path dependent where it's like if you want to go down the keeper route or the bot route or the mev or the mrv route that sort of inherently sort of unfolds into a you know set of of terms and a set of sort of product decisions um and so it's like these things aren't necessarily mix and matchable so someone sort of i think should you know uh take it take a first stab at the spec and then i think we all sort of collectively say yeah we're cool with this make make a few tweaks um whatever but i think right now there's just almost it's sort of too much of a soup um and um someone needs to distill it i don't know what the term analogy i'm going for there but it is um but that's sort of sort of my read yeah so i think in that vein i would propose exactly that concretely which is like for alex to own this at least he can work with me to clarify any of his confusions but you know i think he's more than excited to own writing everything up and uh making it all happen uh so maybe he can do that first draft in talking with all of us and also with a bias towards as much simplicity and as few acronyms as uh humanly possible for this spec uh yeah and then i think there's also like a separate question of like in terms of simplicity like even if we have more than a few algorithms or like two or three algorithms or sorry two or three acronyms uh internally uh we we don't have to like communicate all those to the public so we can uh we can also choose separately like this is the one we want to focus on in our pr messaging and like the other one can really be like our terms for people to understand more specific things that aren't technically obvious um so i think yeah that those are all good points and we should make things you know super easy to understand maybe we should like also randomly get some people once we have a taxonomy done uh some like traders or minors and see if uh it's clear to them or if they get confused yeah i think that's a great idea yeah cool um yeah so i think the next step seems to be that we should um drop up some of the conclusions um and alex you got volunteered here so um i'm assuming that will be one of the comments on the uh the open issue right now and share it with everyone here and then everyone can continue to comment on the threat until we have good enough of a something that will crystallize into a blog pose into you know documentations um and also the other thing that crystallizes into it will be the design and the metrics and terminology that describes the metrics and the documentations are around the me the explorer i believe so essentially um i think we want to within the next uh week or so um have good enough of a conclusion uh so um based on our discussions on on this or you know um for this space at least so that we can start building the product and to you know essentially um elaborate on the meme cool anyone else has any questions or last words on this um before we hop off well doesn't look like it well then um thanks everyone for joining i will write us up and share it up i'll share with you and continue to common async on the thread please on this matter until next week and uh announcement once again reminder the deadline for uh flashback research proposal will be this coming sunday um so you can use hawaii time whatever but we would like to have a time where we could review the proposals um next week and we will make the announcement of the research fellowship um next week on the roast and the roast will be next wednesday cool and austin is presenting a proposal next wednesday on good or bad i believe or essentially a very interesting proposal um on the roast as well so stay tuned thanks for tuning in time everyone thanksgiving yeah thanks everyone thank you everyone thanks thank you soon you
