all right so um thank you guys for joining um and uh welcome to the ninth edition and the second one of the mgb roast um i am tina um from the flashbots uh crew and here with us on on the call there is phil alex obaria and um uh steph goslin and scott uh bigelow um we are going to start out with a brief intro of um flashbacks update from research and engineering side and then we'll leave the stage for um our uh uh roastmaster dan danny let's start here um who will first present a pleasant surprise presentation on a proposal um it's not um implemented by flashball's crew uh core but um it is an interesting early stage idea uh dan would like to get feedback from all of us here and um and then we'll move on to five very interesting and sharp questions that um we would love to hear everyone to uh dive in and share thoughts so instead of having everyone introduce because um uh yourself up front because we have a lot of new friends here let's leave that to the last part so that we get to hang out and for those of us who wants to um you know chat more about um future collaboration cool so um alex would you mind um sharing the link for our for our presentation that would be probably the easiest for everyone to see sharing the link as well as sharing um the screen if possible you should have seen this also in the agenda is it is included cool so i think at the beginning um i will uh share with everyone the tldr on we're going to skip the the basics um the the is please speak up and ask your questions and if you have any questions um you know um that you you can also at the same time send it in the chat um and um on the link that we um alex um just shared uh this is the slice also in the agenda um there are the links that uh you can actually navigate yourself so so these three links are um one is the medium post one is the east research post um which focuses more on our technical solution um and our proof of concept that has been implemented at meb get and lastly most importantly everything is on our flashbacks github we um commit to open source so our latest activities um can be seen on our github cool all right next slide so um as i mentioned there are three parts today i'll start out with a research research site from the flashback update and um next slide please alex next slide [Music] all right so um on the research update um we uh have received um five frps submitted in the past two in the past month and uh within the five frps received uh we have um been able to cover the paper one um that we plan to deliver which is a flashback white paper um the crypto systems paper um on um all three of the core research directions these um and on paper two um i think we have two submissions for the um from the imperial college researchers from uh on the topic of minimizing consensus harm of priority prime incentives all the ones all the research questions that you see unfilled are the ones that we would love to encourage um those of you on the call to take on or you could also collaborate with the or comment uh on the uh flashback research proposals the frps already submitted all you need to do is go on github um mbb research the repo and at the current moment all of the outstanding submitted frps um are in our pull requests and they will be merged upon review and lastly the best way to participate in research if you want to find out more information go on the github create an issue for yourself or comment on issues or frps and join us for our weekly every thursday research workshop um that said uh we will announce the mbb fellows um by tomorrow our research workshop um and so um can we go back one more slide another aspect of research update i will leave it to um alex alvaria from the um flashback court crew to give us um an update on a proposal um based on our previous research workout workshops uh last week's research workshops um uh conclusion uh or a tentative proposal on uh mbb taxonomy alex yes i'm here uh also also sharing the get up issue about it so it'll be quick but we noticed as we put out you know our initial content introducing flashbacks that there was a lot of confusion with the term mev and even within ourselves within the research organization um we were using mev to mean slightly different things and we also noticed that to a newcomer mev could have been confusing the term itself referring to minors when it was other people currently extracting the value and other such issues and so after the past research workshop last week on thursday and the github issue that i shared in this chat that is also mentioned here issue 24 we kind of discussed different approaches to solving some of this issue and one thing that we've kind of come to some consensus on is that that forms the current proposal uh i'm presenting now is to change the term mev from minor extractable value to maximum extractable value um the change would uh encompass other consensus protocols other than proof-of-work it would be it would be backwards compatible so maximum extractable value applies to anywhere where mev meant minor extractable value in the past um and with the introduction of maximum extractable value or the upgrade of that m we also uh would like to potentially propose i mean we'd like to propose the introduction of this this other term which would be a realized extractable value in that case that would be denoting the value that has been extracted uh relative to the potential value that can be extracted from a given block the main point there is there was confusion between extracted and extractable that was used interchangeably and when you use the acronyms you know the e it's not clear what it is and so having us as a separate term for that made a lot of sense to us and so that would be maximum extractable value rather than minor extractable value and potentially realized extractable value to the node um the value that has been extracted so in a way uh mev is the upper bound of rav on on a specific block um there's a lot more to the discussion on mv taxonomy this is really just the superficial side but then there's a lot of classification of different kinds of mev depending on the sequences of of transactions and building a better understanding of that is part of our research goals and something that we're actively looking to do but this is the initial proposal at least on terms that we plan to potentially adopt in our communications going forward as well as propose to the community as as terms to adopt that's that's it if you want to comment either here as tina just mentioned in the chat or on the issue itself it's open to the public and there's a lot of discussion there um dan just asked is rv intended as net or gross uh it's it's intended as gross i think net is a little bit more difficult because what do you what do you you know take away from from that is it just gas costs depending if you're you know about operator but it's also maybe set up cost if you have some infrastructure set up for that then yeah that's fair i think that that makes sense um i was i think like the simple thing would be just like subtracting the gas costs from it but it's probably cleaner just to leave it as gross also i mean um if you're a miner maybe you wouldn't necessarily pay gas calls if you're inserting their transactions right there very fair yeah um so these are terms we we propose uh and we would love to discuss it more really invite you to check out the github issue because there's a lot of back and forth between different proposals and some of them might resonate more with you and we definitely want to hear what you think that's it for for that update so unless you guys have any more questions we can move on yeah should i should i go to uh the following slides um hi um sorry i lost uh uh i lost it for a second um so any further questions on the um um rev med proposal um this is the beginning of our um discussion and proposal on the update of the mbb moon um it was a very interesting discussion uh from our last research workshop and a lot of us here on the call were part of it um for anyone who was interested in the discussion um uh on the github issue as well as uh you can check out on our um flashbox mbb research repo we also posted the discussions uh the recording um and um uh so you can uh find out more contacts um and yeah so um please uh comment and we want as much uh discussion on these um as possible this is um the mbb taxonomy is part of our core research questions and it um basically um uh is something that we will be addressing um throughout our paper one of the flashbacks research paper on our research roadmap next slides and then one after sorry yeah here um a quick update on the timeline so uh once again the mvb uh the our meb research timeline during the mvp phase which exit in q1 next year um is um uh pretty uh uh uh clear here and we have so far been sticking to the to to the deadlines so we're going to um on our deadline for the draft frp submission has been the past sunday and we as we mentioned five frps were received and they're being reviewed and commented um and we invite um um everyone on this call and who you think will be appropriate um to help review and comment on these flashbacks research proposals that has been submitted and um tomorrow the mbb fellowship grant will be granted and um there um we decided that um there's a lot of interest um uh to uh contribute for the flashbacks research proposal so we would like to make it a rolling schedule make it make the mpv fellowship a uh rolling grant so that we would like the next rfrp deadline to be mid january sorry there was a typo it's not december 13th as uh january 13th 2021 um so that um folks who's interested in these tackling some of the research questions can uh uh create a pr and submit um over the holidays if you um that's something that you are interested in doing and the grants once again is uh 10 to 20k usdc um and so yeah um that's basically it everything can be found on our github on the research side next all right i'll talk a bit about um how the organization is progressing so as the scope of the research and engineering effort grows we've tried to put together a structure that allows for um our coordination internally to grow as well uh and so the core dev work which was previously all done uh sort of in a in a single work stream is now being split up into various different work streams depending on the the phase of the project so if um if you guys are interested in participating the there's sort of a separate work stream uh for each different effort that flashbots is involved in and each of those are being led by navigators so i've listed here on the left side some of the roles within the organization that various different people have at different points in time the stewards are the ones are in charge of mostly administration and keeping the organization on track the navigators are in charge of coordinating the strategic decisions and execution of the work streams and the projects and then crew members are the ones who perform the tasks that are required to achieve the the objectives in each work stream so hopefully this is a structure that's going to allow us to work in parallel on these various different objectives while maintaining good performance and efficiency so all of the project plans are being hosted on github so you can go to flashbot pm to get an overview of what uh what we're working on and uh if you're interested in participating in any of those efforts uh i'd point you guys to the uh the discord uh for for discussion um we'll continue uh providing updates uh presentations on on these uh on these roasts so you can also catch up here awesome um next slide yeah steph do you want to share about this or would you um want scott our navigator to share more on the mev search doesn't make a difference to me uh scott do you want to try yeah sure so on the mbp search side uh this is what we define as the the actual um you know bots that are submitting various transactions to these bundle endpoints to be included in in flashbots blocks um we're making some progress today and we've actually accelerated a couple of the the timelines that we originally were were anticipating for some of our initial searchers so i'm going to start with the building open source searcher for bootstrapping we we're working on a very very simplistic arbitrage searcher that is going to do two-way arbitrage between between various dexas such as you know uniswap v2 and balancer or balancer and uh you know some some uniswap clone and we're going to try to get that out actually in the next just few days um the implementation uh yeah so we're talking about creating something that is there's a question that said what's the implementation uh i'm not familiar with cvx py but uh we we were talking about creating something that you the people that often write bots could um use as an example in order to write their own system that integrates with flashbots uh my previous experience has been in in typescript and we've written a typescript library that integrates with ethers that allows like high-level interaction with the endpoints and so this is going to be the first open source searcher that utilizes this library to interact with each send bundle without using raw rpc calls and um just just a really basic kind of you know matching searcher that can can do these things uh i think that there i imagine this thing you mentioned in the the question was a python system and i think that having a python one um would also be a a great thing to have i would love to have maybe some assistance there it's been quite a while since i've done any any python work but i think that's another very very popular bot operating language and the more we can have especially as examples early on it's going to help more people see how to integrate with the system and you know really outsource the searcher volume that we need to get in order to incentivize more and more hash power to be put behind flashbots uh so we're hoping to have that it's probably the beginning of next week and that's going to also use the basic searcher tooling and another thing there which is really just the uh the the library that allows high level integration one other thing that i wanted to mention is uh i found a ticket that covers uh transaction simulation right now neither gather parity have uh apis that are capable of doing a full transaction simulation based on an array of transactions at arbitrary block heights and i think that we can make some of those changes to either either geth or open ethereum to to allow this which is going to be really important for bundle providers since failed bundles don't land on chain it's very important that we provide simulation tooling to let them see what would have happened if they had succeeded yeah and thank you so alex just posted the the issue that talks about the actual change to the um uh the guest json rpc call that would support that yeah it would be i think this is something that isn't just isn't just useful for uh for flashbots this is something that that's that's useful enough that i think we could probably get this pushed upstream i mean right now uh like eath call and some of these trace calls just don't provide enough functionality to perfectly trace something and i think we can we can fix that i also created a survey so there's a link there that's for bot operators to volunteer some information about their uh you know the the bot they're running how often they replace transactions what languages they use again we're talking about that python question that came up earlier you know i'd love to hear a lot more about what people are using so we can focus our efforts on the examples that we publish and the libraries that we support initially in order to help these bot operators migrate sorry migrate or at least add flashbots bundle submission into their existing bots but i think giving them a demonstration of how to do that is uh is really important um and staphon we were kind of talking about this public from day zero that very first point um do you want to talk about that a little bit i think there was a little bit of i had some questions about that yeah sure i can i can touch on it um so the goal is to make sure that all the work that we do as an organization is in the public and so we're doing some testing to make sure that all the endpoints work correctly but as soon as there's going to be actual uh strategies available to be executed on then the endpoints were going to be made public we're planning on running a a proxy that allows for uh relaying all the bundles uh to all the miners that have enabled flashbots um and and making that open to the public so that that will come sometime in the next few months uh we haven't uh finalized the timeline but it will be it'll be made public as soon as it goes left um yeah and i do have a call to action there and that is that if you are a bot operator um you know we'd love to have more like you know as many submissions of that survey as possible and you know all the questions there are optional and we try to keep the ranges really generic so they aren't it's not really obvious we're looking for things like you know zero to 25 percent 25 to 100 like like very very granular so i don't think that you're be leveraging anything that's really you know de-anonymizing but it would really help us just to know like what languages you're interested in and what um you know like how much competition impacts your profitability that kind of thing cool um steph do you have uh anything uh you would like to add on the question we get a lot oh will flashbots um be running proprietary searchers will uh we become you know a provider hedge fund et cetera um and kind of our stance on um uh bootstrapping the mtv search um a competitive market side yeah sure so i can clarify that so um flashbots the organization itself is focused on research and so it doesn't have any plans to build a proprietary searcher and compete on the market the focus is really on providing the tooling necessary for others to be able to uh to participate on it and so when we talk about these industrial searchers they're considering building they are meant to be for bootstrapping purposes and and will be open sourced so that's that's where the the focus of the organizing well and also remember these are open source searchers that we're planning on releasing so they're going to be fairly simplistic but they're going to like if if we were planning on running our own searchers probably the worst thing we could do is like open source what we're doing because then we're just competing for for fees so that's not that yeah that's not really what we're what we're in what we're doing right now we're really trying to get other people to start tying into the system yep and by other people i think half of you guys here i recognize probably run your own bots so no flashbots as an organization is not going to uh compete with you flashbacks would like to get your input from the survey to create more toolings around so that you can have fun um playing in flashbots so i think that's the overall ethos of flashbacks our research organization on the mbb search side um and the best way to uh uh you know uh uh kind of uh take part of it is join our discord and um um ask your questions uh try flashbacks out we are at this moment not yet um uh onboarding uh uh hashrate aggressively we're still in the testing uh phase but we um would like to um prepare for it which will be uh in a couple weeks we'll be uh ready so cool next awesome um so um dan do you like to dan and austin would you like to introduce yourself a bit and and take it from here feel free to share your screen uh our screen yeah let me uh see how i can pull this up here um um then do you want to share your screen i think yeah that'd be good okay [Music] um is this uh is this coming through yep looks good okay cool um so yeah thanks so my name is dan elitzer um i um i'm co-founder of a fund called nascent which is is pretty active in the space and uh austin uh is is a longtime friend uh who is a security researcher at open zeppelin and we we were talking a few weeks ago and uh i came up with this this idea that we think might be applicable to a certain class of mev problems it's certainly not fully generalizable and gotten gotten some pretty good feedback from a few people but wanted to bring it to this broader group to see if um if others thought that there was something promising here and discuss what it might look like to implement on it on a practical level and so we've called this uh protocol rights tokens and another name considered was like highlander tokens there can be only one uh so you know to to emphasize overall you know we all know that uh a lot of mvv opportunities are just not really great uh for the network and for users a lot of ways but the first piece of this proposed solution is to have a single nft per protocol and the address that holds that nft gets an exclusive window uh on capturing some of these mmb activities and so after some kind of delay two blocks ten blocks some somewhere in that range probably anybody can capture that opportunity um so think about liquidations right the idea being that if uh a position is eligible for liquidation uh for the first two blocks or so that it's five blocks maybe that it's eligible for liquidation only the holder of the prt is able to do that liquidation after that window anybody can do it so if it is to really reduce back running spam this this idea of having a single address that is able to get a first shot at something like this was actually suggested to me by jeremy rubin um who's a good friend and and does bitcoin development work uh and then the idea to then add the nft uh to kind of represent that and make it a transferable right i think is an interesting addition to this but it allows anybody can still do this after that initial window so hopefully you cut down on spam worst case these activities still take place and there is a competitive uh chance for anyone to do it but it's just pushed back a few blocks um where i think this gets just really cool is what if you actually apply a harburger tax um a harbinger tax to this um so the idea here for those who aren't familiar is that the owner of the prt gets to set a price for the prt and they're paying a tax on the basis that of that price but the other piece of that is that anybody can then buy the prt off them for that price so it's in their best interest to price it at what they think is like a fair value that they're they're willing to pay and they can still be profitable um because they try to underprice it somebody else will grab it if they overprice it they're paying more in tax then the opportunity is really it's really worth to them um and so the result here should be that uh the prt ends up in the uh most efficient hands to hold it um and the the assumption here is that that would end up being roughly equal to what is currently being expended in total on um gas or other costs for for back running transactions in a competitive manner just a quick clarifying point just in case it's not clear the um uh the buying the ns nft above the current uh inferred subjective value price of the over the holder is is not something that requires the current holder's consent so if you think that the current holder is is uh under underpricing the prt uh you can buy it from them uh without their approval so that's a that's a key property yes yep that's that's a very important property um so that that's what makes it uh be efficient here right anybody can grab it from at any time and then also gets to a potential um kind of implementation uh question that that um we're gonna raise later um and so what this this does the the last thing is like taking the tax and actually how do we talk about value capture because i know that's something that has come up um a bit in discussions and needs to be figured out with overall efforts of of flashbots and of of this mev work is what what do you do with that value capture and so here because it's value that is being effectively extracted from use of a single protocol what if we just force that value back into the protocol that is creating these mav opportunities by saying that to these taxes are actually paid by burning the protocol's native token um so it actually the idea is that rather than having this captured by miners or validators instead the value is returned to owners of the protocol and so a way to help conceptualize this maybe is so first just just to recap it and then give an example so we're talking about a single nft per protocol that gets the exclusive right to be the first one to address these mvp opportunities uh the ownership of this is governed by a harbinger tax so anybody can buy the prt from the current holder at any time at the price set by the current holder but the current holder must pay taxes based on that price that they've set and then the value capture happens via a burn where this tax is paid by burning native tokens of the protocol so for example if you if you applied this to compound um you could upgrade compound make it so that only the holder of the prt token can liquidate positions for the first five blocks at the below liquidation threshold um anyone you just initially put it out there uh anyone can claim it and then just set the price initially so it's like free other than a transaction fee gas to claim it initially they set a price um they either periodically or on a continuous basis essentially are burning comp to pay the tax and then if they if they cease to pay the tax anyone can just claim it and and set a new price uh but this is a way of basically saying that the right to be able to do this liquidation then gets accrued to cop holders in the form of comp being burned uh for this right so rather than seeing it get externalized uh to uh ethereum network validators so the the like i said this is not fully generalizable um this is uh something that you need specific types of mev incidents they probably need to be relatively predictable and frequent because otherwise you don't want to pay attacks on some rights where you it's very infrequent and it's just harder to price uh the the incident the amount of value per incident needs to be high enough actually worth competing over um and then uh in a low if there's there needs to be low likelihood of negative impact if waiting for a couple blocks i'm thinking you know leverage positions so maybe like dydx liquidations or you know if you're doing like you know perps or something like that or you're taking 20x leverage you don't want those where you probably need to be a lot more aggressive in liquidations it's probably not the right place to apply this uh so it needs to be placed where you've got a little bit more lenient liquidation policy or or or mbv opportunity um and so here i'm actually going to pass it over um or we can either two questions here but actually i think maybe it's helpful austin do you want to do the next bet oh yes you actually have uh uh control of the slide so like the as far as the swap fee capture this is an idea that uh application of of this idea that mike has ultimately had so so uniswap uh if the governance ever manages to get together and and and flip the fee switch on uh it will result in uniform collecting fees and thousands of different tokens and so there's this question of how how do you then convert that value to unit token holders and uh it's it's like a non-trivial problem right like there's uh hundreds of potentially thousands of of these of these tokens you have to somehow convert that into um something that can be easily easily captured by the unit token holder so so micah's idea was that uh the so the uniswap factory contract has a fee to address which is the address that receives all of the fees uh so what if the uh the fee to address was always the address of the owner of one of these prts so as soon as the owner changes his hands then the the fee to address changes and the new holder accrues all of the fees that the unisa protocol takes while they're holding the tokens um and then the the uh the taxes on the prt would be paid in by burning uh uni tokens and then that way transfer the value of the uh the accrued fees and all of these potentially thousands of different small tokens in the form of uh reduced unit token supply so that was an interesting idea as well and he started to code up um implementation we found some like there's always you know devils in the details little subtle subtle issues uh some people have even pointed some of these out already in the comments of this uh of this call but yeah i thought this is another interesting another interesting uh application of these uh interesting rights tokens yeah and and so we capture some of our open questions on this um uh you know basically the the implementation of the tax to me feels very tricky um the uh we we also went back and forth a little bit on you know i think we got to a pretty good place in terms of thinking that generally it wouldn't be that tricky to be able to prove that the mev opportunities exist long enough but there is some question in terms of how oracles are used and and you know we're using an accumulator or how the how this is occurring to be able to efficiently um prove the it's been available long enough it's right so in some cases it's uh in the unislop case i think it would be like a really clear kind of easy fit without without too much difficulty but in the case if you think of like compound liquidations um so it's not immediately obvious how they would do this in particular um restricting the um the rights to the first let's say two to ten blocks of the token holder uh because like how how does the protocol know how long the liquidation has been available uh uh to be liquidated how long how long how do they know how long the account has been under water and the answer is like they don't right now so it would require like more fundamental changes to the uh the protocol itself you have to provide normal uh liquidators liquidators who do not currently hold the uh the prt some ability to prove uh how long some ability to prove that a given liquidation has been available for longer than the the two to ten blocks uh available which is not entirely straightforward to do um so yeah so it's not something you can like sort of easily or obviously tack on to every possible mev situation but there but there seemed to be like a small subset of them uh where this might be uh strictly better than uh what we have now with uh back running and flooding and um yeah and then uh i'm not sure if burning vertical tokens is the best approach to value capture um it seems like a relatively straightforward one but there certainly are other ways to do it um and and then bill just like where where is this potentially useful um so yeah that was that was kind of our our thoughts here um and then uh uh wanted to i'm sorry i've not been in the chat so i haven't seen uh all these these questions um let's see uh looking at where if we need to if people want to want to jump in with anyone i'm reading through them all now but if there's i'll jump i'll jump with one uh so i i think it's i think it's awesome i think it's a really really interesting idea and i did want to add some context here which is that um i i recently investigated the um the the cryptokitties system you know this this kind of old project by now that had this mev surrounding the birthing fee whenever you you know birth a cat you're you're due some small fee uh they actually recently upgraded their contract about i think it was about a year and a half ago that gives them the exclusive right for five blocks to be the only one that's allowed to to do this so they're able to do so with like very small gas and accrue that value but at the same time they justify it's still decentralized because other bots will pick up the slack after that five block window has has a lap so it sounds like there is some movement towards this very slightly preferential treatment of bot operators but i think this kind of decentralizes it further in a way that isn't just hard-coded which kind of feels a little bit dirty yeah yeah and i think i started off exploring this mechanism i think austin had looked at a project that was um had done a similar thing where it really was just like first person to get there but done done in a centralized way that uh kept it from creating a lot of on-chain spam um but yeah i think it feels better right to to just say we're gonna efficiently assign this um and reduce it to a single transaction in the majority of cases yeah i think i have a lot of specific comments maybe we can discuss offline because i think a lot of other people have more interesting specific comments but one thing i wanted to point out is uh i guess the nft bid reminds me a lot of work that was done like three four years ago around gas price futures and specifically like protocol based gas price features where the ethereum protocol would like issue a nft based future for a particular kind of slot in the future in advance and then that thing can kind of be traded on the market um and the protocol would enforce that the miner would allow the holder of that nft to kind of redeem their priority rights um as of some block so in general i just wonder um because basically this nft is is kind of like a future but like protocol specific like if we can use uh you know futures pricing and other kind of futures work that's been done in other commodities areas um to kind of understand how these things should be priced and things like that so that's just like a general economic research area i started doing it for gas but i'm not trained in like finance so probably there are other people than me who would be better suited to do the actual like analyses but i think it's a cool direction for sure interesting so so the idea there would be rather than kind of like having one like nft essentially you would have like tokens that represent rights for a specific like series of blocks that you could like be like for future blocks is that the idea yeah exactly that's that's kind of cool i i have to think more about that i think it could be more efficient or it could be less efficient and i'm not sure which it would be i also like the idea if you could like speculate this nft it's like you could go if you buy the maker token you could proactively buy it if you want to short eath i wonder if there's speculation there from even people who don't operate a bot sorry my thing was lagging um yeah i think it would be i think this is basically a permissionless version of that and that's why i think it's super interesting because it doesn't require changes to the protocol which i think was a lot of the sticking points on like the early work on uh gas price features you only need changes to the app level which maybe speaks to your next rose question about like how much of this should be at the protocol versus the app level i think it's the same question but anyway i'll stop talking now to give other people a chance i'm i want to bring up maybe robert roberts question in the in the chat uh some i'm going to read it out loud um does the hardware tax model with four sales push out all but the most sophisticated players as in others overpay for the air as ever as others overpay for the analytic ability or get bought out of the market by those with better analytic resources something robert robert is is asking if um this this kind of uh pushes out the smaller players because i mean the the one who will own that that kind of nft token will be the most optimized and so you're kind of encouraging uh the the like most sophisticated players to own the market in a way yeah actually stefan asked it better and simpler which is that like are you really incentivized does this give a lot of people incentivization if you think you're going to lose to the best player then does this mechanism kind of cause most people to not really try to bid on these prts so i mean i i i wonder isn't that already the case though like when people spin up bots like you're gonna lose to the most sophisticated players anyway and uh so i i don't know that it's strictly worse yeah so now instead of losing to the most sophisticated you're losing to the person who's willing to charge the least for their time i see that's interesting because i i i interpreted i i sort of assumed those were the same thing because but then again i assume that everyone who's running bots is running them very nearly optimized so at that point it's just a matter of who's willing to sacrifice the most of their proceeds to the miners um but yeah that i can see that there is i think technically a difference between those two things yeah it's a subtle distinction and potentially an important one um my intuition is that it's it's not worse it was more the nice thing about having uh the competition every every single time there's never the opportunity is like there's at least more than one player who's generally competing at each one and so it does create a more kind of like resilient safety net if if the person doing this who owns the prt is capturing it every single time other people are going to stop maintaining their bots or are likely to stop maintaining their bots and looking for these opportunities and then this person goes away it could actually create a problem for the protocol if there's nobody there ready to pick up the slack uh so that that is one of the risks that i i see to it yeah i think that's a good point and i didn't mean to like i i i hate being a person to point out something like i'm criticizing i think this is a really brilliant idea that that's why i brought it here yeah yeah we want you to destroy this thing uh if it's bad we want it dead sooner than later i mean i don't i don't know that it's a solution or not but like there is a property that is really good about the lottery based mining which is that as long as you personally are finding the value high enough you're not starved out of ever winning you you know win proportional to the work you put in and obviously it's not always possible because there are fundamentally winner takes all races like in high frequency trading which this is kind of the d5 version of in some ways yeah i think the the interesting thing here is it it changes the um who who what what capabilities are being paid right so i think to phil's point it's it actually moves the value capture to people who are better at pricing this from a kind of financial instrument standpoint rather than those who are uh technically equipped to win the bot wars um and so it does change who who is a kind of a winner here and the question is like in general i feel like we shouldn't prefer one skill set to the other it's really a question of uh what are the externalities on the on the ethereum ecosystem on the protocol itself um or the sorry the application level as well uh and if we can get better outcomes at the application level and at the ethereum network level we shouldn't have a preference between what skill set is being paid out yeah that is a good point i i do think that the there's a valid criticism there that um the the set of people who are trying to for example liquidate um uh will shrink and that's not good we lose some redundancy um so that's that's a that's a little i think that's a valid criticism i i wouldn't be so as long as liquidations are occurring it doesn't matter to me whether it's happening because the fund that can price the token the best is winning rather than the most optimized spot as long as they're happening uh in you know as long as they're happening very quickly or fast fast enough and probably they'll still happen even in the same block that they become available um i think that's okay um i mean as a bot writer i don't like it because i would i would rather get the money myself than have someone from a fund get it but you know uh from this from a protocol design standpoint i think it's um that's an acceptable outcome yeah and one of the areas that i i think would need to be thought about as well is um how can this be abused potentially by the the holder of the token um if you know that you're going to give yourself a window in which you're the only person who could liquidate a position can you do malicious things where you have a position that because you get that you know you're gonna get that leniency of an extra few blocks are there bad things you can do as a result um i mean your personal positions can go you know under collateralized for some period of blocks yeah so that there's there's value to that um and so that the fact that there's value to that it might not be a bad thing um but it's it does become bad if your position is underwater in a way that liquidates it out you don't you don't get it back up over and somebody else doesn't get a chance to liquidate it because you've then caused it to be under collateralized and it gets past that point where it's safe for the protocol yeah if you're so there's like two things there so one is is it the uh so it's important not to apply this to protocols that can't handle the um uh you know two to ten block delay to begin with like we talked to andre briefly about this about the uh using this in keeper um and he said that even like even like a few block delay would be too much for the purposes that people use keeper for so uh so it wouldn't be a good solution there but uh i think a subtle so there's one question of like does the protocol work in general if if the uh these actions are not performed uh immediately like if they can't wait two to ten blocks but then as a subtle difference that is does it work well when there's when there's exactly one player who has that two to ten block lead uh which is not something i thought about uh yet so that's yeah that's interesting cool yeah and i i think the addition of downsides um you know if for the example sasha brought this up if i hold the nft and don't take the opportunity that i'm punished um i we we hadn't discussed that uh i i think that you're kind of you're paying in in the it's just like lost opportunity cost um if you're not capturing the opportunities that are available to you then you're kind of overpaying relative to somebody who does capture all the opportunities available to you um but if you're thinking of it more in the malicious sense punish them because you assume they're being malicious if they don't um capture opportunity maybe maybe there's some way to do that um in in my mind it's a little more important to yeah to figure out um [Music] yeah i'm not too worried about them than missing it i'm more important like there's a malicious thing here rather than trying to just like punish them if they they happen to miss an opportunity oh sorry i was gonna say uh introduce some kind of um randomness to this uh maybe a way to help it if if there's a way uh where you know ten percent of the opportunities um are just like randomly made available to people other than the the prt holder maybe that's a way to add resiliency and make sure there is some redundancy there because uh this works in the majority of cases reduces 90 of the spam but 10 are still available is that enough to ensure there is some redundancy there with other people competing um okay if there aren't any other burning questions points maybe we move into the um the risk sections so i think as yes pointed out um yeah the first question is is directly tied to this concept um starting to think about how much burden of minimizing mav do we want to place at the network level versus the contract application level this proposal really tries to put it on the application level rather than the network level for at least a certain class of problems and so you know very interested in people's thoughts about what this might look like in the future one thing maybe uh to clarify here is i guess how do people see the responsibilities of the protocol like from a social perspective um because for example like it's obvious that if there's too much mev like way too much mev for the protocol i think things become uh very strange from a protocol design point of view so clearly we don't want like some absurd amount um so i guess at what level is it incumbent on like apps and users to be good citizens versus does the protocol need to like actively defend itself and how does the protocol defend itself against too much mev is it just by raising inflation is that the only way or are there other kind of routes yeah i my hope is that part of the reason for putting it back into the value capture back into the protocol token itself is that's the reason why like even they don't want to be good citizens if it helps number go up for their for their own token and it's a direct financial incentive to do so um sorry phil could you repeat your question i didn't catch all of that um did i have a question or whatever dan just responded to it it was uh more of like an open question about like like uh the uh how much expectation is there from the community at large for protocols to uh make good design choices and and not have uh create too much meb yeah and i guess also from like the layer one designer's perspective like what is the responsibility of the protocol um you know if if the responsibility of the protocol is to ensure its own stability for example if that's a goal then i think that the protocol needs to reduce the amount of mev somehow um maybe at the protocol layer or maybe through inflation i don't know i think those are two knobs uh i i don't yeah i don't have a real concrete question or answers i'm just trying to throw some fuel on the fire because i don't know i don't even know how like ethereum users see the role of ethereum and preventing these things for example i would conjecture that uh i would conjecture that raising the inflation rate is a compensation for mev and not a reduction uh and also that in any ethereum like system [Music] it's not structurally possible to eliminate uh mev vectors i mean even even this uh proposal doesn't like doesn't remove the mev because the miner can still just censor the uh prt holders transaction for two to ten blocks and then capture the thing themselves so um yeah this certainly isn't a uh a full solution by any stretch um yeah i i think your latter your ladder point was very interesting and also probably the more controversial one of the of the two that like in any ethereum like system it is not possible to reduce mev um yeah i wonder i wonder what people here think about that it rings intuitively true to me i mean anytime you have any time you can get different different results by uh transaction reordering i mean there's there's mev there so i'm i'm not entirely sure how to even scratch the problem of eliminating it actually that's what i mean this this may expose my ignorance here but um i would love to jump to maybe question four here so about the likelihood of advances in cryptographic techniques uh enabling a meaningful reduction in mbb versus you know we're primarily talking about game theory and economic mechanism design but you know using kind of zero knowledge proof secure multi-party computation type approaches or to aztec or or you know what secret is claiming they can do and things like that um are you able to hide enough information that it it makes a lot until after transactions has been validated that it enables you to eliminate a lot of this maybe um i honestly don't know um folks from some of those projects have proposed to me that it can and so i would very much value the opinion of folks here well i guess this is kind of related to the claim that i just made uh so i'll modify it slightly and say that um uh it seems intuitively true that uh like single block mev single block capturable or extra whatever the terminology we're using now is um like can be forced into like other modalities of extraction and but when i say it's not possible to reduce mev i would say that like changing the modality of extraction uh like the required modality of extraction is not equivalent to um reducing or eliminating that mev um and like secondarily um that like it's not possible to construct uh any in protocol um transaction fee scheme transaction uh ordering scheme uh or like regardless of whether it's a game theoretic um or cryptographic construction um which is able to provide iratable like an incentive that's necessarily proportional to mev or a countervailing incentive that's necessarily proportional to mev because any incentive that is necessarily proportional to mev is by construction itself mev yeah so i think i intuitively agree with all that and i have the same guesses and you know i think uh you know to use the i guess industry terms like leaking a little research alpha i think there is a like fascinating impossibility result that might be possible there uh but i wonder what other people think um like cryptographically i'd say there's certainly things we can do like you can slow down the propagation of information or you can prove that like you knew something before some period of time things like that um and i think in certain cases you can maybe argue that that changes the extraction process i haven't seen any convincing like reduction proposals that don't do i guess one of two things which is like either restructure the protocol that is exposing the mev uh which i think is a useful direction to think about but that we can't force people to do that um or um by kind of permissioning some aspects of the mev like cryptokitties did so like one of the limitations like mev is kind of intended to be this permissionless metric uh of value you can obviously always permission that and get rid of it so but i mean you might not even be reducing me in that case if you're permissioning it to someone who could possibly be the minor or could be cooperating with the minor which in a permissionless network is most people or everybody so probably unless you trust an identity system you can't even do it that way let's just kyc all users problem solved um okay so uh what what i'm what i'm getting from this and tell me that's the wrong conclusion is that the general consensus is that you can't likely uh eliminate mev through purely cryptographic means um or even likely make a a big dent in it is that is that what i'm hearing my my my gut says that i i agree with uh phil and charlie that my gut says that it's it would uh there it would not surprise me at all if there were uh impossibility proofs that in fact i would like that because then i can stop thinking of these uh theoretical solutions to this um that being said that that wouldn't necessarily rule out um uh practical things that could make it computationally uh very difficult for people to extract like you i mean you could imagine like uh something like ethereum but but running on on uh uh let's see if like fully homomorphic encryption and you can't see anything all you can do is check the value of your own account right so it's still it's still possible to extract value there but that's going to be very difficult um so yeah there might be practical solutions that can get us through but yeah it would not surprise me if there is a impossibility result because yeah again anytime you have any time you get different results from reordering transactions there's mev there and i just don't know how to how to get rid of that yeah i think uh worth noting that uh that's just so i think we all are everyone who's spoken at least and maybe if anyone here doesn't agree you should jump in right after i'm done and that would be really cool um but i think we all agree on this point i do think there are people who don't agree so like i know uh ari jules and co for example like are of the opinion uh and like as part of the chain link fair servicing kind of effort are of the opinion that if you could like make the order more fair that would in practice lead to like less profitability of things like sniping um which could possibly reduce mev if not from like maybe some theoretical standpoints in like practice with the way the the economics play out there will just be less of a profit case for for the mev but i think that's an open question and like i would love to i i don't know if anyone here is on the call who like understands or or shares a deep insight into that viewpoint so maybe i'll i'll issue an open call but it would be cool to get some perspectives like that at some point too yep cool so it absolutely absent someone you know speaking up right now uh let's say that there's not anybody on this call who wants to make the uh the counterpoint here um but i think that is a place where i'm i'm personally interested to hear what the the count argument would be um so maybe slightly slightly different topic um actually let's let's uh uh go to number two so people saw the the announcement i see most of it about like one inch now i guess routing transactions directly uh to these mining pools um let's try to stop them from being front run uh is that like near-immediate midterm should all high-volume front ends be doing this like is that is that like a good hygiene thing that they should all start doing well i i don't think that that one inch yet has 100 penetration so when when you use these front-running resistant places the trade-off right now at least is mining confirmation time which especially for very volatile markets that might not be worth it like especially if you know tight spread requirements you know yeah yeah so that's right just quickly to counter this point um i recently used uh tai chi network several times and my transactions confirmed almost instantly almost faster as if than i than if if i broadcasted them directly to memple which totally surprised me how many data points do you have for that uh only two so far but i'll have more uh on this friday they'd be very interested to know what those trade-offs are like because i i don't think that the tai chi network is forwarding transactions outside of spark pool but maybe they are does anybody know the answer to that their website says no yeah so it would be really easy to detect if they were sure we didn't see more data yep okay not a very interesting not a very interesting question i guess okay um so uh this one from from trent um was you know what what would be the impact uh if we start seeing more of the kind of traditional financial markets infrastructure make its way into crypto right if we do start seeing like payment for order flow type setups with wallets or interfaces you know those have proven to be something that is very commonly used in traditional financial markets will we start to see some of these intermediaries finding various ways to extract the value uh within our decentralized infrastructure as well yeah i think uh from my perspective this is one of the things that worried me the most about mev early on is its potential to create asymmetries between like uh sophisticated actors and everyone else in crypto so i worry a lot about that wonder what what everyone else thinks how do we feel about uh advancements in these fronts i guess and flashbot's role i guess in either in in and how this is going to play out in the future i think payment for order flow has the potential to be equally detrimental to let's say user trade execution price that um your more prototypical mev or mempool sniping might be depending on you know how quickly that the order flow is routed right to you know make make kind of a devil's advocate argument isn't isn't it inevitable though because there is so much money to be made from it at some point as crypto continues to grow and as there's more and more money essentially being left on the table by not doing that won't there ultimately be enough incentive that people are gonna organize companies are going to start doing this uh to their users regardless of what we think like ethically should be the right thing because clearly when you start having like billions of dollars online this infrastructure gets built and i would say it's it's not necessarily clear that it's uh always going to be a negative right so uh look at robin hood right i would say minus their shutting down and what that does to uh um their traders when they can't trade during those times um i would say in general fee-less trading has been a net positive for a large swath of traders um and so there are some positive aspects to payment for order flow uh that exists and so similarly we could envision a future where pm4 overflow happens that's then used to subsidize or eliminate gas fees for the users yeah i think that's the uh the analog and i wonder i think an interesting question is like how would it be different from uh you know payment for order flow in like traditional markets like will there be any extra transparency or is it kind of exactly the same thing and there's no difference at all um and how does the i guess geo-distributed nature of cryptocurrency versus like sending information to a single uh exchange server how does that change uh kind of order flow dynamics or does it not also change it at all yeah it's it's interesting because the distributed nature it feels like at the very least we're talking about additional players in the mix where whoever's paying that workflow is then also tapping into kind of private transaction submission services for various mining pools and addressing things that way so it feels like at the very least there's like an extra extra player in the process yeah so i think i think we all share this view at least at flashbacks oh i see alex raised a hand so maybe i'll pass it to him but i think yeah we we all we all kind of share this view that is inevitable and that's why we're building the tool the tools we're building i guess um yeah i mean i i just have a very brief comment this is alex here um because it i think number three relates to to my question on number five which just that to the extent that there is um capturable value right that that intermediaries can can take advantage of and that value can be concentrated in such a way that it becomes economically rational to regulate them right or to use those as as regulated points and their relationships minors as regulated points right you increase the risk of um basically turning validators and or the parties that direct closely interact with them into uh easy regulated targets right easy targets for regulators in law um and i think that this sort of speaks to a a broader point maybe that you know the the available value right the mav maximum extractable value and this sort of issue of a related issue of payment or payment for order flow um are probably inevitable but i do think that the way in which it is handled and distributed right is has is going to have a material impact potentially on how these practices are viewed from a legal standpoint in other words if it's very hard to aggregate and capture a lot of the mev in one way shape or form it becomes very hard to sort of point to individuals or entities that that look like rational regulated regulatory targets um you know imposing regulation on entities that that cannot extract enough value to pay for the compliance functionally doesn't work and as a practical matter doesn't really happen very often um but if you if you're ending up with a scenario where you know a combination of say traditional financial actors coming in working with large miners or mining pools or something like that um to capture a lot of this value and incidentally create the sort of consumer risks that are present in things like payment for order flow um i think that really creates or increases the risk that you're going to draw regulators attention to that layer of activity and conversely to the extent this is you know very ethereal discussion thus far so i'm sort of dragging it into the mud as lawyers or want to but um you know this is a a problem that might be helped if the tool sets and solutions to to mav and to the this capture of value are highly diffuse right if they encourage a lot of um distributed value capture rather than concentrated value capture it just as a practical matter becomes much much harder in my opinion to um assert regulatory control over them right it just doesn't work the enforcement apparatus doesn't line up with it very well and and lawmakers tend and regulators tend not to like rules that they can't practically enforce so you know i sort of a maybe a minor note at this stage for the the more ethereal problems that are being addressed and discussed here but i do think that it's you know all other things but equal solutions that encourage sort of diffusion or decentralization of mdv capture or related activities are probably going to be better for these systems one thing that is uh interesting to note is just like the i as a retail trader in the traditional stock market it's impossible for me to actually actually take ownership and interact with an exchange um as opposed to a dex i can go and interact personally with that dex and know i'm what what's occurring right um to some extent uh and you bring up this interesting point of this layer of um you know this these validators or whatever um being this point of potential regulation i think it'll be contrasted with uh traditional finance and that i as an individual can still go and interact with these dexes myself um so it's just interesting uh that that difference yeah i mean i think that that difference points to a really promising opportunity right which is you know i'm going to paraphrase the cftc here i think the regulators can imagine or at least the us ones can imagine a world in which they regulate market activity rather than market actors um blockchains make that a lot easier right it's it's fairly straightforward for them and even in this anonymous way to look at the market in a live fashion and see what's going on or if there's sort of systemic problems occurring um but they are going only going to do that if they think it's easier or necessary right so so if you can construct these systems one in a way that they are in a sort of self-regulatory way that they are more naturally transparent to than traditional financial markets you know reinforcing what they already are now right to brock's point you you are can directly interact with the decks in a way that you cannot interact with with nasdaq um that's you know the more you reinforce that point uh the the less likely it is that the policy concerns sort of come into play right so so i think you're right and in general um solutions that reinforce sort of decentralization diffusion and and also transparency on these processes right um even if there is mev being captured or surprised being paid to minors you know if everyone understands that and sees that up front without regulators occurring or sort of wading in it makes it a lot easier for them to resist the urge to do so basically yeah and actually i want to make a again almost like a philosophical point here for us to consider um is the infrastructure that we're building here to help uh solve mev or kind of improve the functioning of the network by having mev be less harmful whatever whatever how we want to phrase it um if in doing so we might also create infrastructure that makes it easier to then censor uh or or right or enforce regulations on various actors on chain and for a practical example of how some of the stuff can be co-opted uh in the the kind of bitcoin ecosystem remember back in like kind of 2015 2014 era um that there was i think bip 70 was um a proposal for basically communication between a payer customer and merchant to have better communication between them and pass information back and forth kind of external to the network it's kind of like a channel between the two to communicate and make sure there's no man-in-the-middle attack there was been a group of companies um that you know exchanges essentially that we're looking and saying hey can we actually modify this protocol and use it as a way of introducing travel rule compliance um to be able to exchange effectively kyc information between wallets of these exchanges to comply with the travel rule uh and so that's that's i think a very i don't think it ever actually moved forward at least didn't as far as i'm aware but that's a very concrete example of designing something at the protocol layer thinking about trying to make better ux for everybody and then it potentially getting co-opted for enforcement of regulations yeah i think that's a really important point right to the extent that you are creating tools and systems that look like and resemble the systems that regulators are used to right they will try to fit it into their framework right and the funds travel rule is a really good example of that and particularly timely again now yep yeah i think those are all uh very valid and deep points um i guess i would say that i see our role as an organization to uh be in some ways uh responsible for trying to influence uh the story arcs here and the various possible applications of this tech both in terms of like user impacts and regulation and things like that um and from that perspective i think you know my proposal my straw man proposal is that we all kind of do our best to uh you know stay educated and aware of these issues and stay engaged uh so you know thank you all for being here like right before the holidays also side note uh really appreciate that uh because i think you know we need to almost form an ideological like i use the word bulwark uh when i was talking to alex a while ago and he liked it so i'll use it again but like a defense system against both these economic trends and also um kind of to make sure that regulatory trends are are in like the favor of cryptocurrency and us as a community um like i don't think the the all regulation is necessarily a bad thing like it may be the case that regulation is what causes miners to think more carefully about extracting mev and actually like leads to something good down the line because we architect kind of the funds distribution to be more resilient because of possible regulation so those are all open questions i just want to put out or open i guess goals and ideals for this organization and curious to to hear how other people see like their role our role the intersection there etcetera everyone wants to fully abdicate all responsibility great hatership model no i'm just kidding well i mean i think we we managed to at least touch on um all these questions i think you know got some some pretty interesting insights here are were there any any final you know thoughts or questions folks wanted to raise um i think this is more or less the last agenda item i don't know if we've got any kind of like housekeeping final items as well yeah housekeeping let's do it yeah very simple um so uh the recap of this video um of the our discussion will be posted uh on our github and um also we will uh post a video in a series um on youtube uh shortly um later today um as well as the slides for all of um so like right now we're trying to figure out xander into a holiday season um the roads have been super fun and super uh insightful and interesting engaging um we've been torn between whether you do it every two weeks maybe at least or monthly so uh you know feel free to give suggestions in our discord uh on how to make it better we want to make it into a it's just a essentially a town hall for um folks who's actually doing um interesting research and experimentation in the space to share your insights and ask your questions um and um yeah and everything uh and we also use this opportunity to share a very brief update on uh where flashbacks um is as a project uh from research and engineering perspective however as we mentioned everything can be found on our github um yeah and alex you wanna you know just make a couple announcements on the uh other medium posts that were rolling out and some anything else that you would ask folks to chime in on i mean you did a great job there we are going to release more content uh to uh you know make the subject of maximum extractable value and related topics uh clear to the general community as we we've tried to do so with the initial posts we've released and so stay tuned for for some of that some of it will be explaining uh upcoming research some of it will be uh releasing some of the public tooling that we we mentioned for example uh a dashboard to that displays metrics related to minor extractor value that people can um people can look at and people can track over time to get a better idea of the activity on chain that's happening related to that so all of this is coming relatively soon in the next weeks and as tina said our most of our activity is split between discord and github and so both of those are public and we really encourage you guys to participate there on discord please ask any any questions and participate in any channel and on github look at the different repos uh look at the issues currently open if you want to comment on on any of them as well as open your own issue um cool and the as dan just mentioned in the chat the deck for the protocol rights token that they presented with austin has been added to the roast agenda deck um yeah and then the next roast as is mentioned here uh we haven't announced it who will be speaking uh if anyone is interested in in speaking as tina mentioned we have some people doing really interesting work uh on mev um the guys from block native and and d protocols so uh maybe uh let us know if you'd be interested and yeah that's pretty much it yep um oh sorry uh i forgot one more thing um we have three minutes and i actually would love to get all of the folks new first time to i mean heroes to just introduce yourself and your interest so that we know um and also would invite all of you to join us in the research workshop tomorrow where we will share um our flash possibilities from proposals yeah so maybe um i'll just um you know call out folks um sorry uh if you're uh so um daniel daniel marsack and maybe alex you have better connections so maybe you know just ask i would love to learn more about you [Music] hey guys i'm with uh block native just listening in for now and uh interested in the uh mechanism design portions mainly thank you um what about um eric eric tierney uh hey i'm hurricane i'm over at circle um i'm just mostly listening and i found this stuff pretty interesting awesome thanks um sasha um if sasha is not there yet maybe uh tessa has a help i uh i'm coming more from the trading side of things um so just listening in and and learning about as much as i can about nb and then pool so that's that's basically it yeah hi i'm your own from people to call so we work on something similar to what dan presented uh many to eliminate the competition layer in liquidations we believe the competition and in particular is not only arrested ethereum but risk to the actual landing platforms because eventually damage the liquidators we are of course more of a commercial project for the product of the project we are already live we are kind of a second layer the mission slayer on top of maker dao already with 10 million dollar of deposits and i actually would would love to present at certain point in this forum [Music] go 16 are you still there uh yeah sorry i have uh island connectivity i think we're at time um so thank you everyone really great to meet all of our new friends and join us for the research workshop tomorrow and stay tuned for the next meb rest and and and thanks to dan and austin dan for for uh you know leading leading this session masterfully and that in austin for presenting this great concept as well i think it's given us a lot of things to to think about i'm going to rewatch these videos and think about more questions so thank you yeah special thanks to you guys and thanks also to everyone who introduced themselves and uh came especially for the first time see you guys next time bye guys see ya later you you
