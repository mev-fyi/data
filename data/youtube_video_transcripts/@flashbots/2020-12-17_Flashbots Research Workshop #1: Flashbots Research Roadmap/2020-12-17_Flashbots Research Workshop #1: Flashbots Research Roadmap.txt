like what is a formal definition for a good um for a good auction mechanism and like you know how do we compare various mechanisms um i guess the emphasis was on good but like not in the ethical defense necessarily although i do think like when you're coming up with the formal definition for like what properties do you want there's like some notion of that like for example like you know the revelation principle or something like there's always some reason that you want such a such a property um so i think it's mostly on the like formal sps um yeah and as alex says maybe there's a few metrics that like we know what's bad in existing systems so that might be a starting point um but yeah i kind of originally intended that as a definition question of like how do we define good um in this context i see yeah i i know my comment so then my my my main comment there would be that uh so i see two big aspects to to the question and i haven't passed through all the little items there but so one aspect to me is uh about again measuring what's what's going on essentially and then there's a another one that's more related to to other other issues i think we're on the on the repository um which is sorry let me check so i don't uh there were some of the other sorry not the issues anymore but the research proposals let me check so there were some on the not the flashback design yeah sorry yeah this survey of the existing auction literature right that i think surya was in charge of so i think this is a bit uh so in order to tackle the good question like in terms of like how good of a mechanism it is i think that's highly dependent on this this other question like surveying what possible what possibilities are out there before we can say something meaningful so my main comment in that i think the component of understanding uh what's going on is fairly standalone and the infrastructure is there with maybe inspect and that can be quantified like separated into smaller questions that's has been done already in the issue the main other comment i have there is i feel this this issue is very much correlated with an understanding of of the of the literature of auctions and and mechanisms for doing this so we have a universe or a space to compare this to other things right yeah exactly it's like i thought that makes sense yeah so all right so go ahead no no go ahead okay so yeah so like but that was also something i wanted to point out as well where i think that there's a lot more to conserving options than just sort of theory right and so part of that comes along with trying to evaluate what kind of adversaries were dealing with like what what adversarial model should we make so like i think all those questions are wrapped into the into you know how do you define an auction mechanism that works and is good and so i think without first defining how we're going to say good it's hard to do it's hard to then choose one auction mechanism until we have you know defined our adversary and to do that context what is good yeah that makes sense so i think to me it sounds like you guys should maybe talk on discord async if because that doesn't make sense that you know some understanding could be one way to approach the definition of what good is so maybe a first pass could be even before we do like a full survey just identifying what various auction like adversary to definition mappings people have explored in the past are um and maybe that could be something that's like in between the survey and this question or it could be a starting point that either issue owner kind of takes yeah yeah absolutely that makes sense um yeah i think that's the only the only comment that i have one another comment more of a practical nature that i'm i'm uh i'm humbled that you like thank me for tackling this i think i i would like really enjoy doing this but i will be taking time off during december which and quite a bit of time off so i might be off for a month or more so i like i don't know if that fits the we can talk about this later but i don't know that that fits the agenda really so so perhaps is like i feel december is going to be a very active month for for kickstarting this and i'll be mostly offline so that that can be a problem so perhaps i should take a more uh side role where i can take some of the things later down the line but i'm not sure i'm the best person given that to coordinate this this question i don't know we can we can talk about that later but i do want to mention it um just because you're if you if we consider consolidating this plan i think perhaps i yeah i shouldn't take this this right now yeah that all makes sense i think it's best to coordinate with tina and alex i guess especially if anyone else has those kinds of concerns i would say that from my perspective like it's that like we have more of a long-term interest than a short-term interest so i think what we care more about is like long-term having the right people working on things they are motivated to work on in the problem space and be like enabled to do that in an effective way um so i think december like we plan on in many ways like formalizing some of these questions into more public digestible documents and maybe starting to have some idea of how we want to approach them but i don't think we'll like like this is uh probably going to be a many many year like scale of research effort if we're going to answer these questions like conclusively and if it kind of follows through to the end so like longer term that's probably more important yeah well i i think for uh with regard to alejo your specific liability problem [Music] because we chatted about this before the reason why um i think it's not big of an issue for the media because first of all the papers have a specific timeline associated with it but the paper is at the beginning of our research process right so like essentially the paper the papers should actually be working coordinating with the rest of our uh you know flashbacks contributor who's actually collecting the data on the inspector side to actually be able to answer some of the questions um us you know already so like um i think the paper uh what we should do is actually scope out with while you uh before you go on vacation it's really to scope them out so that the the remainder of the inspector team can actually um map their uh you know um uh map onto this so that's kind of like why um i mentioned it it's actually a better front loaded um um because uh defining these uh questions and refining the scope and and actually uh you know sit down and and answer exactly what we just discussed um is more important so that in fact it's not that uh it's not that alejo you are going to be uh delivering every single piece of artifact no that's a this is a collaborative effort and uh i think the role of a research fellow we want is to basically set the uh make sure it's not the high level direction but in terms of uh structure set the structure in place so that we could um have our collective mapping on and contribute easy easily and effortlessly and when you come back from the vacation i think a lot of the things should be there if we actually set the motion in progress that's what i meant but of course it's idealistic um so like welcome you know oh we should uh you know definitely chat more about how this could play into your schedule great sounds so before we we like keep going do you guys anyone else here have questions or uh things that aren't clear or concerns on what has been like discussed so far and like the structure of the the research effort [Music] all right i think we should continue uh with also diving because having uh heard from surya and in fact i think everyone here is uh paper one uh folks because paper two folks uh somehow are all on vacation this week for example austin and uh a couple other folks so uh and also like a few i think quite a few of the paper two questions uh we had interest expressed from the paradigm folks so dan was actually probably more relevant to the second question than a second paper than a favorite one but here's dan dan is back hi dan dan i saw you immediate yourself well i guess damn muted himself again we can't see you we just can't hear you [Music] well okay yeah looks like dan your mic is not quite uh working but speak up whenever your mic is working or type in sorry about that oh great hi sorry didn't mean to be disruptive had to drop for a second uh not not a problem at all i think well we we have come to like uh basically i think that uh once again like most of the folks here on the current call are um interested in uh jamming and contributing to paper one whereas paper two um where uh community and uh like the uh uh ethical check uh chapter has a lot more to do with i think both i think george charlie said him and georgios are definitely into kind of answering some of the paper two questions we also have austin williams who will join us next week um after he come back from vacation for for paper two uh discussion as well but i think um like kind of uh just in general like kind of dan how do you see yourself being involved in the research process and do you see yourself taking on a research question or more as a chipping in when necessary because there are a lot of questions here you can see from the you know yeah yeah um so i'm i think i'm mostly the question i'm personally most interested in is about sort of like malicious versus benign maybe um i'm not sure if that falls under the should we allow any immediate on the system or what that is exactly yeah um and basically the question is the detecting um one or the other how to distinguish them um but in general i mean i think charlie sort of take the lead on the research stuff from our side so i was planning to mostly just help him and uh um and georgios with whatever they decide to be to look at yeah yeah that would be actually i think that's one of the probably the most challenging question um on paper too and also most of most interested questions in fact we have so many uh research fellows all expressed that whether they are the research final for this question they would like to contribute to this part of the question or have a say in it so it'll be quite interesting of a process um cool oh okay so before we jump to uh uh that can we go back to paper one so um alex would you mind uh well actually let me um if everyone just uh alex can you click on the um pdf file that i shared with the mind map because i think it might be easier shorter to kind of uh look at yeah yeah but you have to zoom in a little bit sorry about that yeah so um with regard to paper one we we covered alejo's part and kind of like i think there's more things to be figured out there um i think um surya uh you you you mentioned here and there but i want to hear more about how what's your approach in terms of how you like how comfortable you are in um kind of handling these questions any and like you know um what what are your thoughts and plan plans in terms of going forward next step right so um i think the actual survey part is is like probably quite simple in terms of just sort of you know creating a taxonomy for all the sort of auction mechanisms out there i think the more challenging question really is um you know once we have this taxonomy how do we choose which one to go by and so i think the i mean so the actual like auction survey part i think is quite simple but i think the other question of first defining good and bad for mev and then in the context of that only then can we actually see the you know evaluate the different types of auctions so my plan going forward is essentially in the next uh what's the date basically this 19th right so my goal then the next two maybe three weeks has some sort of taxonomy created for the auction mechanism i've looked at so far i'm hoping in that time that at least through discord or something you know um a synchronously i can talk more with either alejo you know as long as he is around or somebody else who's interested in sort of talking more about the other question about defining a good auction or [Music] what mbb extraction and so i think that'll be my main approach for the next uh about two weeks probably cool so well that's actually good uh i think that works out well with our timeline um i think uh what we in the parallel are planning to do and that we also shared a bit with you is that we want to because the moment we uh post our east research post which is uh monday the release day is monday regardless what happens lightning whatever uh you know thunderstorms like you know uh the world come down no we're gonna launch on monday so that said um uh we actually have a call to action on our research uh is research post and medium house for people who are uh you know interested in contributing to answer github issues so i think one of the things also will be great too as you are thinking about these questions like add more github issues but not too many like don't spam the issues but we want to use get issues as ways that you can write out questions in your mind that you would like to jam more with you know the community you see what i mean like yeah so uh flash out like right now github issue seven um has like three um you know different uh breakdowns i think i would suggest personally us using the github issues as one uh one question per issue like oh sorry not one research question but one sub question that like for example and be very specific like at auctions other priority auctions like kind of be more specific with the ask so that people can actually answer these questions and it provokes answers so come up with good questions that um you know um feeds into each of the sub questions that you want to uh want to or what you want to do and also what you mentioned the taxonomy part i think would be great to actually um follow the format of uh so alex shared a little bit on our github we want to follow the eip process but yeah it's really about the erp like kind of a template because we like how clear it is in terms of outlining what you're trying to say so like kind of think about writing your outline but in the proposal format and that way um all the issues can all link back to the proposal um in the markdown so that's kind of like the the the simplest i think way for the public community technical community to be able to um contribute to uh these research questions but they're nice to have i would say that i think mostly a lot of these research will be dependent on the research fellows independent thinking um and discussions with other research fellows but you leverage github as a forum i think yeah i will for sure yeah on the issues that i had noted i think i think they would benefit from some connections a more explicit connection with the different research proposals so right now again some overlap directly because the title is the same but but there's no explicit mention in the issues to as of to which proposals they're related and perhaps it's hard to enforce that if we're going to have people opening issues freely but i think it would like it would be useful to have some some form of mapping from one to the other so that that's a little bit more organized for a newcomer so which for at least the ones we open and we know uh that are related to the different proposals i agree i think we uh that's i think that that's why we're having this call right now before uh we actually go to uh the public so that um alex i and i can work with you guys in kind of refining the questions and linking them back to the our like our piece and kind of draft a couple like you know dummy our uh not non-rfp sorry uh flashbacks uh like uh uh uh proposals um research proposals and to so that like kind of we we will probably dm you guys um i think and oh before the and uh before this weekend kind of draft an outline kind of like in your mind how you want to approach these questions at least we have a couple uh ones out there that could actually help the general public better understand what is our approach in examining these questions like once again the question research question number one is very well specified um question two is a bit under specified but it's still like kind of pretty well well well written and and so like um and i think us over the next so then like already we uh we should establish the connection um and flash out the question a little bit more um and uh with sorry to kind of have like an outline in terms of like the the the taxonomy or talking about your your mind um kind of yeah the process so yeah well that's that's good and what about let's go to the third one sunny sunny has very strong opinions sorry before before we jump to the third one can i uh a quick comment so sorry sorry i'll be i'll be happy to to talk to you about this these different mechanisms we can iterate on that i'll see how a couple of weeks before i leave so happy to do that it's perhaps one one question on terminology uh maybe the meaning we want for good in these first questions is more about efficiency right how can we build an efficient auction mechanism so i i mean to distinguish it from good in terms of like an ethical good where we want like any of the extraction that's not harmful or that's not i don't know uh yeah bad in some like ethical terms which is the the aim of like paper too and it's a much more nuanced question so i think the efficient thing will give us like a much more operational criterion to to work with but i don't know feel if like it's this notion of efficiency you had in mind with the with the good or there i think that's one key aspect i think for sure like it's valid to say something that's good should be efficient then you kind of have a more specific maybe issue of like what is an efficient optimization references like the what is the good option mechanism then there's like an open question is there something that is good that like maybe conflict with being efficient um like maybe there's a fundamental like impossibility between like balancing and vision for minors and traders or um once that actually is specified out or in you know having both efficient people miners and traders and uh keeping the gas low or something like that i don't know but there might be more to being good than just me but i think that's for sure part of it and required um and i think in general like my vision was that from these issues we would create more issues so i think that's like a natural example of how we can refine that and maybe it turns out that good and efficient are the same thing and then we kind of merge those into one issue but i think having that as a downstream question is one way to start specifying it and like we probably won't be able to answer any of these top level questions anytime soon i'll just keep generating more questions for now um and you know one of the things i maybe proposed before as like a shower idea is it might even be cool if we have like a graphical explorer of like the dependency graphs of all our github issues i think the goal that we want to set up is to generate more questions from every question we answer also um thanks guys everyone thanks yeah no problem yeah so i i intend it to be very open-ended if you want to if you think efficiently for sure [Music] cool um well um sunny are you there we'd like to move on to the third uh research question [Music] yeah so um uh sunny and dave uh uh i think uh they were already uh uh independent of flashbacks uh considering doing a survey paper um on um essentially meb across different architecture so um can you are we still sharing three sorry i lost the i lost the okay can you still see the yeah yeah so currently um this is uh this is what we have discussed in the past but this is a question that has been slightly under uh specified um yet this is more of a downstream question as well because it's answerable or from a survey approach so uh what are your thoughts on on taking question number three um what do you think you may approach it how do you think you may approach it uh well so what we're working on is not so much about sort of paper across an architecture it was more of uh what are the different formats that like what are the different figuring out what sort of information is needed by someone in order to do to extract med and then design an architecture to hide as much of that information as possible uh uh in terms of like this uh question so then i guess the key is to identify the overlapping and to see whether this question um you think is interesting for uh sikka to [Music] um i don't know the problem with this question is i really don't see much big differences between architecture like what what i maybe would look like in like most work at sneak architectures i think as long as you have a proposer who proposes the blocks i think like it ends up being the same um i really i guess really the only place that really matters is like leaderless protocols um just like avalanche style stuff um and yeah i guess you know i think that's an interesting question um and i haven't really thought too much about it yet but as far as i can tell proof of work stake system should not be that different so like with the vote and same with the transaction ordering system like i feel like the consensus protocol and stuff is like not what's relevant here it's like i think really this should just be redesigned for a question of like oh leader versus leaderless yeah i think that's fair phil any comments on that yeah i think that's a that's definitely a good way to clarify that question um i think the other the other related thing that i wanted to maybe discuss there is besides leader versus leaderless which i think is one of the main things for sure but also like maybe the impact of finality and like in practice how does that make a difference and i don't know if that's something we can just point out and like kind of talk about at a high level or if we can say something more precise um because it kind of seems like finality is like almost like some sort of like you know defense against long-term reversions i don't think it affects short-term mev i think we can like kind of make that case but like long-term mev probably will be affected but also there's a there's a game theory in pow that makes like long-term mev of like large reorgs probably unlikely just because people don't like accept large reorgs as legitimate in general so yeah maybe just something i wanted to touch on in addition but i think definitely also leader versus leaderless is going to be really important in down uh especially because i know for a fact when i talked to goon about mev like a few years ago he was like oh avalanche solves this completely it's leaderless so no issues um and i don't think that position is like written down anywhere nor is it the position of most people at navajo so i'm not trying to like forward it at like a straw man but i will say that like i think it will be important people will say that like oh it doesn't leaders like if there's no leader there's no problem and i do think that there's a lot to say about like what the prospects look like and how to design a good process in that context yeah maybe rephrase it as nakamoto versus bfp versus avalanche those three classes like i there might be like other consensus protocols as well but you know maybe by respecting it to only those three plastics that uh make it easier to compare i think that's that's reasonable and probably a lot of the nakamoto and bft style will be the same if his leader basically yeah [Music] yeah sorry go ahead alex i think alex is about to say what i'm uh going to propose is that um i think it's actually good to hear what everyone's actual breakdowns and like kind of thinking on your feet um like kind of if you were to take on the question how you would frame the question and approach it i think um the next step after this call what we'll do is that alex and i will uh ping each of you and share with you uh the exact link to the booth and kind of um you can take some time and articulate in terms of if this word an answerable question how where how would you answer it um but however the frp format is very much i would say up in the air and uh open for like you could just revise it to as you see fit because we don't i don't think we have a perfect template for it um but if anyone has a good template for this uh we're very happy i think that the key there is that um this is a document that is supposed to be a living document and working doc and is when that is such that it's clear enough that it structures the questions and break it down and your approaches and what needs to be done there in a more elaborate fashion like a one-pager um and um that until the essentially the drafts is uh complete or the artifacts are collected um the first like this will be the living document that actually feed into um i think phil you mentioned you would like to put things together um starting to do and focus on doing that in um mid december so essentially i think the rfps should be pretty much fleshed out not just questions but also some of the answers and approaches of course it will be continue going but like so that it would i i would hope that uh whatever we produce like this will be one like succinct summary on where things are um and can uh index a lot of the artifacts that it will reference a lot of artifacts as that's being produced along the way so that when you put things together like it will you it will be also easy for you to um uh to put it together but i i don't know how exactly we can make this as easy as possible for the research follows and for the community at large to understand um without misinterpretation um what are these questions and how to answer and participate and then yet produce stuff that you could we could use and put together phil do you have any suggestions what do you think about the idea of using these frps these templates to for the formulation of questions and for the outlining of approaches and for essentially flashing out and become a standalone piece that can be put [Music] together no just one quick comment i i think that's a great idea the only comment would be to make sure to i think it would be good to distinguish the questions from the answer so not use this space to uh to answer the questions but happy proposals be just that just proposals and then have a different separate space for the actual work and that might depend like the format might depend might be on github or maybe elsewhere depending on the different questions but i guess what i'm going at is that i think there should be like this should sort of consolidate with the questions and then the work should and then they should sort of freeze and then the the actual work in solving them perhaps it would be better to have it elsewhere i think that's practical um what would you suggest elsewhere and the reason why once again we went back to github has more to do with the fact that we actually want to weed out the non-technical contributors uh like at the beginning like not weed out them completely like if you don't take the effort of actually uh you know watching our the github and repo and actually don't take the effort of actually like you know read uh and look at the md and comment on the issues i think people are probably you know just not investing sufficient thoughts and interests in it that's why we want to really use the github issue to engage the community and also there's one single place we don't want to have too many different separate sites for this but i do agree that some of the answers are either going to be for example paper one uh question research question number one it would be a lot of what scott bigwell has been working on with the meb inspector team that could actually uh is already live on github and it's open source so that should be referenced um but i see like um i guess syria and uh uh you know it needs to be like if the answer lives somewhere else um where would be the most what would be the most comfortable way for you to collaborate uh like kind of if we use our uh frp as the questions like flash down thoughts proposals on how to answer these questions then where do the answers lie yeah it can be a github as well i don't like i don't have no strong feelings for platform i think each like each sub team perhaps will find a better place and then we can maybe consolidate i don't know if it had an idea for this but maybe another repo for the paper or something like that uh i i don't i'm sort of platform agnostic i think the github thing out we know non-technical people might make sense what i'm just saying is like i think it there would be a benefit from separating the question from the answer because otherwise if you start like mutating the questions into answers in the same document we might lose track of what we were striving to answer in the in the first place but github it's fine yeah but i i do understand it probably post a lot of like we can also link it to google doc that you because i know some of you guys prefer much better to work with blue dots which is definitely easier for a collaboration like we could have these uh you know our piece um you know posts and freeze there um and issues referring to them um and discussions for reference but then the living dog for like kind of the the the the the answers would probably be somewhere else it could also be in on your blog you know like because a lot of because i think it doesn't really matter where it is and we credit uh all of the research values and people contribute um in uh regardless so whose you know contribution charts and graphs and data gets you know used so yeah okay so i think that's um i guess we don't have uh uh we will go into uh a deeper dive into paper two similar to the format today um uh with the folks who come back from the occasion next week uh before thanksgiving but uh aside from that i think there's a lot to do um to sum it up it seems that we need to work with each uh prospect research fellows on refining the frp we need to um ask the research fellows to actually find ifrp in fact but we will work with you to help like see what is the best way to do it um and second is to um uh refine the github issues with also research fellows so that the github issues are answerable because a lot of them may not necessarily have github issues but they also may not necessarily need to have hit up issues for example once again like i think research fellows should create get up issues for uh that's associated with your frp in particular um so that's um basically it and the timeline um i also shared in the discord channel the estimated timeline that we hope uh we will freeze the frp we hope to freeze our property i guess then before we i wouldn't say freeze i would say that we'll have a relatively finalized frp draft for these questions flashed out by this weekend so that when we open source on monday um everything will be very clear and without confusion um as and the research question is also to be published before the end of the weekend um the second uh deadline is a timeline in terms of uh it also works with a lot of vacation schedule it's december 16 this is 16 or 15 or 17 i forgot um i i i started in the research discord channel that we would like to have the first draft of the answers uh i would say done so that then phil can go ahead and actually put together these um pieces um into potentially an outline and draft for paper one and see what we are missing um so those are essentially for december and i think phil should probably by early january will have a relatively more or less complete draft at the same time paying the research fellows for kind of things that are missing would that work phil yeah that works for me would that work for alejo and surya i think the timeline is relatively compact um um but i think yeah let me know if it works i think that's okay that's great um and uh lastly uh i think alex uh had raised a couple of questions about the in our research papers um there's no mentioning of economics research and governance uh and also i uh uh kind of identified that in our current research um roadmap there's no mentioning of any specific transaction encryption including sgx related research so my question is do we consider those items within the scope of the research at this phase phil this is the question sorry can you hear me can you say that again i said oh okay sorry my bad um i may be breaking off so um two questions uh two uh two uh topics are not covered in the research roadmap for paper one and paper two um because they don't really fit there but we think maybe necessary to for us to get some sense one is economics and governance so governance i think we can set aside because that has to do with some of the paper two questions but in terms of um um the profit distribution that has been uh between the miners and the searchers or ecosystem holders like that is an area of research that should probably start at some point but i the question is when does it start should it be in this space or should it be after we produce number one and two to be a subject um if it's in this phase it could be also independent as a research topic that's independent parallelization so basically economics and governance is not included in the current research i think that falls under what's a good mechanism i mean if it means economics is part of that and uh if it needs governance then you know what is good governance is part of that i think that also falls into paper too so you know if you want to specify those more clearly you know tina you can feel free to also add issues i think and i think those are valid other sgx and other methods of encryption i also think falls under a good efficient mechanism like if it needs privacy then what is the best technical way to accomplish that privacy i think is a logical follow-up um so maybe the question is too vague but i think those are all valid refinements of that question [Music] and as for timeline i don't i don't really have a strong preference i think it depends when we find people who want to own that and also when the engineering side needs things to happen by yeah okay i think the uh i think the uh within the flashback highlight i do think that economics question may uh need a bit maybe to be front loaded a little bit so that uh at least there is something that the engineering side can benchmark too or uh you know can provide artifacts that actually would answer some of the hypotheses on this but uh yeah let me think about it so uh because uh the first question good mechanism let me discuss with alejo like if you have any thoughts on on the economics question being part of the what is a good auction mechanism also i think um stefan who's done on this call he mentioned that he's actually interested in seeing the auction survey and auction section because he personally his opinion is that the auction mechanism will answer the other half of the economics question that at least more practically from the engineering perspective that they need input from so yeah so i think anything on this because it's not really within the scope currently yeah no but i agree with what phil said i think this we have to at least tangentially think about these questions when thinking about like what a good auction mechanism is right so we will at least think a little bit about these things and then we can probably define the the the question a little bit better cool and syria anything from your side that you think may be relevant to the added one [Music] um um awesome i think this is really productive um i think we have a next step to do a lot to do but uh anyone has any questions uh phil i can see your video thanks for taking the time everyone yeah thank you thank you oh and phil um did you um get uh to discuss with uh vitalik uh a bit about our research uh of our work yeah i'll i'll post in discord in a bit uh we'll talk about it okay he's pretty excited i think so that's good oh that's uh interesting that's awesome to hear awesome hey phil when are we getting your paper when can we do anything to accelerate it um we're going to write a medium we'd want to do it you know let's put it that way hopefully hopefully next week i'm hoping next week but you know we're just running the final experiments now and it's just a matter of you know getting everyone happy with the result really yeah oh alejo i'm so sorry i didn't i i i ghosted you on uh sending you the super secret draft of fails i forgot i'll send it yeah feel free to read the super secret draft just don't share it or you know anything like that that would be cool because uh it's not all my work so you know i would feel bad if the co-authors got but uh just read it and enjoy and uh but hopefully the the experiments will be much better in the final version i will say that disclaimer that the the super secret draft is has a very limited crappy set of experiments that were done on a deadline that we had decided not to meet at the end of it so awesome perfection is here yep awesome thanks guys cool yeah thanks so much guys see you soon thanks you guys too
