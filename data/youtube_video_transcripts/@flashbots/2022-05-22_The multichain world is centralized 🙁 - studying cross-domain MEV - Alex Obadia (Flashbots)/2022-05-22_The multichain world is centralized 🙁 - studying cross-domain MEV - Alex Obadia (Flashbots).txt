[Music] hey everyone thank you for coming to mev day and for coming to this talk for your time and for your interest i'm going to talk briefly about why the multi-chain world is centralized if you followed um phil's talk amazing thank you thank you um if you followed phil's talk earlier today he talked a bit about this i'm going to talk essentially about this paper that we released at flash boss research on like cross domain v and the risk of centralization and all that stuff and i'm alex i'm a researcher at flash bots all right briefly was a multi-chain world it's a world of many domains many layer ones many layer twos bridges which are also domains side chains etc it's a world where the same apps are redeployed on each of these domains so you have versions of unit swaps on each domain which we can see today unit swap is on many layer 2 same thing for ave and sushi swap and whatever and it's the world of different security so the security that a layer 2 has can differ depending on what type of layer 2 and its architecture and so to some extent we have to think about different security models right so immediately we what we realize when you think about this is there's a fragmentation of liquidity so if we think of that example with unit swap you have liquidity that's split in each of these pools in each of these domains and it's not linked at least not today it's a fragmentation of security assumptions across different bridges but also across these different domains and different asset representations as well right so you have ethereum layer one that people see as the canonical eath but you also have uh rbe up to eve hop if using the hot bridge et cetera et cetera et cetera um so again immediately these are new sources of inefficiencies from the lack of standards and the nation markets there where winning designs are still emerging for what are like the proper security models you should adopt and also the proper standards for how rbe should interact with opti and whether users should even know that there's a difference there and ultimately that's that's uh new sources of mev right because they're inefficiencies so um let's let's briefly go through an example and you're gonna get why it makes sense soon so we wanna execute an arbitrage across arbitram and optimism that you can see here and we start with dye on ethereum you can see that we want to buy ether at the 300 price we want to sell it at the 400 price right that makes sense arbitrage great um so we want to do this fast so how fast can we go right so in our first try we can try to do it as as trustless as as possible and using the native bridges we start with dye we bridge it to arbor trim where we execute our swap so we buy with our dye a bunch of eath then we withdraw that eath and we wait the seven week dispute resolution period then we port that eth to optimism we execute the swap from each to die and then we withdraw that dye back to ethereum again waiting the seven week dispute resolution period so this takes about like two weeks and ten minutes it's obviously too long so can we go any faster yes we can we can use non-native bridges uh and um in that case you don't have to wake the seven week dispute resolution period because someone is going to take that risk for you either by running fraud proverbs or by being happy just lending you money for some interest rate um and so depending on how fast the bridges we're using this is now reduced to 25 minutes which is great yay um however there might be like a faster way to do this and you have to think about how fast you can do this because if you're not the fastest you're going to lose this opportunity to someone else who's going to seize it this is capacity constrained so this opportunity will bring be brought itself back to like efficient prices when someone seizes it and fills it at its maximum capacity so the third try um is we don't even bridge right we just have assets on each of these domains and just execute both trades relatively simultaneously in that case um we're now like a few seconds instead of 25 minutes or blah blah blah and these other tries are like pretty much irrelevant just because anyone who has these assets on each of these domains are just winning every time and so the other people that are here like in try one and try to just are you know losing their time in doing this and by the time they arrive the opportunity is gone already the prices have moved so what do we learned from this right we learned that in this new world to seize a lot of these type of opportunities you have pretty high capital requirements this is a difference from uh the current kind of ethereum defy landscape you also learned that what we didn't talk about is when you do this like try three um sure you you can do a trade on each of these domains but then you end up with different assets on each of these domains in one place you have more die in one place you have more eth you need to somehow rebalance this inventory because you want to make sure that the assets that are sitting idled on this domain um can be used in like you know the most optimal way and so you want to make sure you have the optimal composition of assets and that's very close to what market makers do called inventory management the other thing is there's the reintroduction of lagging risks which didn't exist for a lot of atomic arbitrage right where you have these two legs of your trade and even though you can execute them relatively simultaneously there's still risk that the price is going to move against you or that there's even issues with one domain against the other similar to the legging rates that you have between centralized exchanges so um we can extend this logic to like think about this cross-domain world right where we have this asynchronous world where the most well capitalized players are the fastest and where others rely on short-term lenders so bridges you know just different bridges design but a lot of them just land you capital in order to move fast between domains so it's it's a bit sad because this amplifies wealth inequality right like the people that have a lot of capital can afford to seize these opportunities and the ones who don't don't really have access to them and also to more centralized and trusted infrastructure so if you want to move fast between domains you need to use these kind of like trusted bridges because right now there isn't like a good solution to moving like a latency minimized way between domains without uh trusting a third party and i'm going to talk about that more so why all of this is relevant is well this isn't great right uh this is not very positive but there's more um so is there an even better way to do this right because again as traders we're in the ever pursuit of like more alpha and so we want to know if there's a way to be even more efficient in this trade right so we started asking ourselves what if you control the order of both optimism and arbitrary so let's take domains a and b instead because it's a little simpler and we kind of evaluated if you control so this is what this inequality stands for if you control the ordering of both a and b versus if you control the ordering of only a plus the ordering of only b so you you can think of a sequencer of a sequencer of b and sequences that controls both a and b and we try to reason whether this inequality is true why is this worrying is because if this inequality is true there's a non-zero financial incentive for the sequencers of a and b who might otherwise just care about their own domains there's there's an incentive for them to collude they make more money by colluding than by just caring about their own chain right um that's problematic um so whether this inequality holds true all the time is difficult to say intuitively it does hold true for a lot of cases for the case of arbitrage it holds true but it's a little more complicated i won't get into it now but there are a lot of opportunities that are conditional on the state of every domains um and so you can imagine that they can be sequencer collusion so this is relatively worrying um and so you know as domain designers protocol designers in this room uh you should start wondering like whether your nice design that's been like thought about in a vacuum actually makes sense when you like consider this right like um do validator behaviors on your chain or your protocol changes is there a centralization of the validator set between parties that can collude more easily than others who will participate in validation in that case given the privileges that they have these are all relevant questions that you should think about as a domain designer but wait there's still more how do these sequencers trust each other right so let's go back we said sequencers can collude with one another maybe to make more money um how can they do so they have to communicate somehow the order of transactions to one another they have to split the profit at the end all of this is an economic cost right in a like permissionless system and if these parties don't trust each other uh there's like some overhead in being able to communicate in a relatively trustless fashion and coordinate um and so you can think about that cost in a more formal way and we use a result in the paper from another paper from mustafa obasam called sok communication across distributed ledgers where an impossibility result is shown there that cross-ledger communication cannot happen without either trusted third party or synchrony assumption beyond a synchrony in our case because it's a latency sensitive application you probably want to go with trusted third party because you don't want to have the synchrony assumption for this uh coordination between sequencers because it's time sensitive um so we've now established a cost to sequencers coordinating with one another colluding collaborating um one way to reduce the this coordination communication cost is just to be the sequencer in both places right if you own the validators in both places do you still have a communication cost but it's your internal communication cost of communicating information rather than this like more complex like adversarial environment and so why is that worrying well it's worrying because this is a clear incentive for the centralization validator set in particular for two chains there's clearly this pressure for the validator sets to overlap more and more over time that's extremely dystopian right um we're talking about a future where like the same validators that are very large and capturing all of mev i mean a lot of mev control most chains or validate most chains and have control over the ordering of most chains and there's an economic incentive for that to happen right now this is like what we talk about in the paper um so is the multi-chain world centralized well not not yet right at least not as far as i know but it's coming though the incentives are are set this way right now um and so we should start thinking about what to do about it um right so what can we do should we cancel multi-chain should we like i don't know do something else um i don't think we can i mean we're too far ahead in that process we have a lot of projects that have raised like hundreds of millions of dollars to provide like layer twos and they're gonna uh subsidize activity on their chain domains for a while most importantly we need it for scaling right like the the reason we're going this like multi-chain asynchronous world is because it is really like architecturally your choice to like have like higher throughput higher bandwidth um and generally being able to reach mass adoption so there's like a trade-off there by like canceling multi-chain whatever that means um [Music] um right so two things that we can maybe do um the first one is for people in this room and people attending this conference and also people watching later or now um we should think about this more uh domain designers should think about the incentives that are exerted on their systems from these other chains right we talked about uh chains cannibalizing one another or reorgs of the weaker chains and that type of stuff or like these type of double spin attacks you can do between different bridges this is all like relevant in the in this context um validator companies running on many networks which is you know already the case they should be aware of like the risks of their infrastructure being used to be to do this like cross domain collusion in a trusted fashion in their own system users should pay attention as well in the systems they use the security assumptions they subject themselves to um and most importantly why we should be aware of all of this is because before real solution emerges um [Music] it's it's likely that a lot of these like centralization vectors might also be regulated by social norms so it'll be about people choosing like no we don't do this because it's frowned upon no we don't do this because we understand that there's a risk involved in doing that and so um we want to be able to enforce these social norms create them and social norms are created with some level of awareness especially in crypto toy awareness number one number two to do more research right so uh the paper that we released is a work in progress you can check it out online but um there's a lot of measurement that still needs to be done there's a lot of assumptions that need to be um you know checked and double checked um and also to some extent it's a prediction about the future rather than a an observation of what the current system looks like um and so that's different for example from flash voice 2.0 whether it was somehow a prediction but as soon as they launched bots they could see this bot ecosystem emerging uh in this case this is more like predicting what this might look like looking at where the incentives are going so a few research topics there the cross chain md motivated reorgs that's a scary one uh potentially like standardization of assets and of bridges because the more standardization you have the easier it is to reason about the security and incentives of these systems as they are composed with one another how far can we reduce the communication slash coordination costs for cross-domain collusion this is also a big question right if the delta between this person owning many validators at once versus the validators on different domains coordinating with one another is small in the communication overhead that our solution that preserve the decentralization of the validator set might be preferred because the delta is small enough and it calls us willing to be paid and ultimately it's more socially scalable and there's a bunch of other questions in the paper uh and you should work with us on it you should ask us about it you should question it you should criticize it and all of these things to uh get us together closer to the truth um yeah and that's it 14 minutes nice um any questions i think we have four minutes five minutes otherwise you can read the paper you can reach out at these things you can find me at the event today i'm happy to chat explain any of this more um and if oh there's a question here hey thanks for the talk um so you presented the try like the second try and the third one uh where you can lend out from uh short term lenders but wouldn't those be the ones that are actually doing the arbitrage and try three absolutely so yeah the bridges who hold liquidity in many places would be the acting as these kind of market makers they also do inventory management as well and yeah the capital they would be lending you they have more information about the state of the world than than you do and they also have capital in these different domains so they would be harbing you right uh similar to how one inch is taking positive slippage on their users hey oh oh hey matchman hey hey alex um so you talked about and this is pretty scary that there's a force uh there's a force pushing validators to kind of like be all securing all all securing all chains um are you is there anyone doing any work into some sort of like the cost in the other direction like due to the economics of like validating on different chains being different um what like is it is it costly to be is it is it not cost effective to be competitive on many different chains at the same time with the same infrastructure or something like that um i don't know i remember asking the question a while ago on twitter and i got like a few different answers i will also say like there's another tension which is if there's a single party like at the most dystopian t infinity a single party validating all chains the system is very prone to regulatory capture it's very prone to censorship and ultimately it's not a system that users would want to use so over time they might switch to a system that affords them the guarantees that they would like right so there's like a tension between the two i mean the fact that the incentives are set up in such a way that this can happen currently for economically rational actors which i think is like the minimum we can assume for players in like permissionless decentralized pseudonymous systems um is is problematic so maybe we can like shift the incentives in a way that the validator sets can hopefully stay decentralized i'm next have a more more fundamental question how do you even track these multi-chain arbs happening right so that's one question in the paper right it's very difficult one it was like on a single chain it's much easier to quantify and we've released uh you know open source code on how to quantify me with an ethereum and we've released dashboards on it in this case it's a little bit more complicated especially because to some extent the qualification is also subjective it's also based on a global fair price that the the market maker would have and how they trade these assets and the amount of risk uh that you discount these assets by um so it gets a little bit more complicated but there's there's definitely a lot of intuition that it's it's a very large size we also know of existing players that uh have this type of behavior for example across centralized and decentralized exchanges already this this elusive something that feel referred to where even if ethereum is extremely centralized if there's like a chain with more value in it that's very centralized that is going to exert a centralizing pressure on ethereum and this is where you start thinking about this like dynamical system of many domains actually interacting with one another and this is where like designing your system in a vacuum becomes more dangerous in my opinion um so hopefully we can start the conversation on like how to think about composing different systems together even if you think your system is going to win everything all right all right thank you for the questions we have to move on thank you thank you [Music]
