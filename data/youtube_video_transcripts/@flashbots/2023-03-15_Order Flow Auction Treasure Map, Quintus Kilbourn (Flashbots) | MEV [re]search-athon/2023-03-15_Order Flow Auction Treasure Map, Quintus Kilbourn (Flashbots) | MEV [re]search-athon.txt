okay I'm just gonna get going okay what's up guys so uh okay there we go um I have a 50-minute talk and was told I have 30 minutes so there might be a little bit of skipping over things just uh save your questions for the end or like if it's like very pressing I guess you could just raise your hand throughout anyway what's up I'm quintus uh and uh today I'm taking you through a treasure map what does that mean well um the idea is that the treasure at the end of at the end of the uh or sort of on this map somewhere is some some improvement on the current Med landscape some some new design that that changes things in some way and we'll go we'll go uh into what changes we want but today I'm not going to show you where the treasure is I'm just going to show you what I think is the map and try and lay it out and the idea is that um hopefully at the end of the day we all have a similar idea of what the map is and in doing so can speak in a similar language and and hopefully agree or come to some like um yeah some agreement on what the what the best outcome will be and so this the store the talk is structured um sort of first looking at what auctions are very quickly why we care and a lot of that's been said already so I'll be quick about it uh and then like well specifically what order for auctions are trying to do then a couple of archetypes and and some properties of those that we care about so to start this talk I guess the question is like what is an auction and it's a bit of an annoying question but the reason I ask it is because um I think at least myself I often find myself with preconceptions I think an auction I think of like this specific thing with an Auctioneer doing something but then like Max pointed out earlier there's a um you know this you you call a central limit order book a dual auction right and so actually maybe a bit more than that and today I want to use a definition that an auction is a mechanism for Price Discovery uh through competition right and price Discovery implies that we don't know the price right so there has to be some some degree of uncertainty um okay easy why well uh if we sort of come to the like sort of fundamental uh interaction and blockchain we have a user and a blockchain here I put ethereum it could be any blockchain could be some collection of blockchains whatever the state of the world they want to change but um and they have some intent right some some desire change they want to accomplish but the blockchain is complicated right there's many smart contracts the actual workings of a very like impenetrable even for me you know I work in crypto I'd imagine for many other people it's even more impenetrable right additionally this process of interacting with um the blockchain is complicated right there's many other messages floating around the mempool there's latency that's made of an RPC providers A Reason about yada yada yada it's very complicated and so if you're the average Joe and you're not hyper specialized like with a fantastic unit pool and lots of advanced scripts and all these kind of different things um it's not exactly clear what you can get out of this what the satisfy your intent is right and so this uncertainty I argue is a justification for why we want um why an auction is appropriate right and so it's appropriate for kind of two things the one is discovering the price of realizing your intent don't trying to do something in the blockchain but what like what is the cheapest what is the lowest amount you can pay to do this right and a related question um which is sort of more like fixing the price you say okay well what is actually the best approximation of this intent right not every intent necessarily has a solution to it I just want to trade it the best price right how how can how can we get this best prices best best approximation of our intent um okay and so steps one and two are done um maybe I will finish in 30 minutes so so what are order auctions um and I I guess as a highlight supposed to indicate that uh in order to Define all the functions we should Define order flow and like I said earlier we're talking about these intents but another way to think about these intents is um credible commitments that's how I like to think about it um and so an example of this would be like uh a commitment that says I want to do something on chain right so like a transaction satisfies this obviously like um might do some things I'm calling a swap function with certain inputs um it could be an oracle update but it also need not be a transaction something else we can think of is like um a conditional conditional payment right if something happens I will pay an amount right this transaction could do this you could run the transaction and check the chain if something happened it'll pay um but really you could be running this in a different chain it's just a critical commitment in the abstract I'm trying to break away from this like very specific instantiation of how we think about things there are other ways of doing it having maybe like a payment conditional on some like variable execution right I'm wanting to give a tip for Price Improvement as a function of price Improvement or um something that transactions can't do at the moment is condition on state that's not available maybe like within an execution environment right if my transaction is like first in a block or whatever I'm willing to do something about it um and that's that's a rough idea um but so so what are all of the auctions then now that we have to find order float um price Discovery for order flows that the two definitions combining should make sense but again to be absolutely clear we find ourselves talking about this in the context of other auctions which exist already right we're talking about introducing one component into a larger system so what is this larger system uh you might be familiar with um you want to see this diagram before or diagrams like this like we have Mev boost where we have full disability blocks to validator to try and get blocks and chain and then we have additional auctions um researchers trying to compete to get bundles into specific blocks which then compete in a later auction but this is all sort of part of one one system um that um is distinct or a component of the system that is distinct from the autoflow auction this is looking at Value that um just looking at getting blocks on chain and competition to get treats competition over state looks for competition of a state and the value occurs to a proposal the order for auction right logically but not necessarily in the implementation can be thought of as preceding this right so you might implement this completely differently but my point is that the order flow auction um happens earlier on in the supply chain where um value accrues to users now here I've drawn one big green rectangle for the other effect but that's again just an abstraction maybe the OFA in the bigger scheme of things we would end up with ends up being like 10 different oil flow auctions each serving a different function and in aggregate doing this uh sort of value accrual to the user but maybe we end up with one specific order flow auction maybe it's on a separate component at all and it's an activity that happens in this in the space of this larger auction um again the separation is more to think about like what is the functionality here uh so hopefully that's that's clear um right and so so now we have a new paradigm of thinking before we were thinking about uh how to deal with competition uh over block space how do we maximize the revenue for the for the validator but now we have a component that is trying to do something else right it's trying to empower users which is not a very uh concrete term so maybe we can Define um user empowerment as their utility which is a sum of the function of the outcome of their of their um you know the satisfaction of their intent like how good is their execution or whatever and the payment right maybe the payment is then paying a gas fee but it might also then be receiving a rebate because someone wants the background them or or whatever it is um but I put two asterisk two asterisks here because um this is actually not a great way of thinking about user empowerment users I think many of us in blockchain agree um actually think about more than that for example uh users care about the security of the system they're using even if it's implicitly right if there's some small risk that the exchange you're trading on completely rugs you takes all of your money that should be priced into this right um latency should be priced into this and it's ux and all sorts of other other things that come into this so this is like a first approximation of what you can care about right um fun Okay so that's what one of the auctions are uh I I would argue and again the point here was to keep it as as abstract as possible as wide as possible um trying to take into account as many different uh approaches as as possible okay so let's move into archetypes and in in doing this talk Tina said Tina asked me it would be very useful if you could like segment everything into a couple of different archetypes um and then we can we can reason about just these like you know categories and um this is actually really hard or it was really hard for me uh and I've been I've I've been supposed to be thinking about this for a while um so hopefully it's hard for other people as well um and the reason is that I think the properties of these different auctions really depend on very small changes two auctions or two designs might resemble each other uh in many ways but small tweaks actually uh change uh you know outcomes and some certain dimension drastically I would argue so take what I'm saying with with a pinch of salt I've put things that are very different into the same category and things that are very similar to different categories but this is my my best friend so we get this kind of design which I call apriori right and the opioid refers to temporal component obviously um and the idea is that um the whatever the auction is deciding on has been decided even before the user intent has been like formed he doesn't even know what they're trying to do right so we see this in traditional Finance with paid for order flow agreements right um Robin Hood assigned a deal with Citadel or like they've opened office away before anything has happened um and uh nitesh couldn't be here like T flow is building something similar although the time Windows is a very much a upward event then another design which I've called auction house for a lack of a better term um and there are two two kinds of designs in this auction house space this is like the the thing that comes to mind when someone says auction right there's like something being sold a bunch of people like placing bids and then eventually According to some rule like maybe the highest bid or whatever has chosen and the allocation happens like that so um you can have the single transaction case like hey here's a transaction take all the bids for the transaction it's allocated um but this isn't necessarily that economically efficient um right because uh as a Searcher you might want to execute on multiple orders right in multiple intents match them together whatever um and having uncertainty because it is being auctioned off separately uh means that you can't bet as high as you would but so a different approach um which is quite well studied in literature although not for this application or combinatorial auctions right where you can submit a bid to a subset of of audits right so they're 10 orders and I can choose or you know for orders two three and five I'll pay this much and four three four and seven I'll pay whatever much um and Rook uh at least the last time I checked is an instance of this um another example which is actually like kind of related to the combinatorial auction is a batch auction and I'm distinguishing batches from cognitorial auctions in that batches are fixed right uh so like Council right um we have a fixed number of orders six set of orders and the allocation rule is like a one or done like I said one and done or like one or nothing one person gets whatever the allocation is and everyone else gets nothing um a final um I shouldn't say final because it definitely things outside of this but another archetype that we can think about is like Dutch auctions right we have a price that changes over time um um like like a fee escalator so the idea is that within within the semantics of an order of course you don't have to do it like this but an example would be within this semantics of a of an order like a little transaction or whatever we encode a price that changes with time so at block one I'm willing to maybe I'd require a payment of like five E for someone to execute this uh block two I require payment of three years maybe at some point I'm willing to pay for it uh the idea is that eventually you discover your price and there are many much discussion to be had about this pros and cons but that's like the mental model um and now after I've given you this uh I'm going to say it sucks and there's a reason that it sucks right um it doesn't take into account actually what is being transferred right it's missing a dimension actually it's missing a couple and one of them is like what is being transferred right so we can maybe break this up into into two questions right like what is being transferred from the the seller by either user to the bidder to the buyer and vice versa what's being transferred the other way um and we can give some like first first approximations first answers to this which is maybe what's being transferred to the bidder is a a right to control the the conditions of execution right someone is trying to submit a trade and you want to bundle them that's an example right um I want to like my front run I want to background or whatever and these conditions now become part of the execution of this transaction as I submit them to the rest of the sort of like any of the supply chain um that's one way of doing it another example of like the right to determine the aspects of execution is I can fold this right some someone is they put out an order they want to trade him to eat and I can I can um take the other side of that and we can we can compete for that that's another example um and an example of what's being paid uh transferred from the bidder is like a very obvious example would be yeah payments right and execution guarantees I'll pay you like 10 bucks for this transaction if I pay more than one else I get it or maybe I give an execution guarantee I will give this order uh execution price of at least six or whatever it is right and again no this uh this uh I think is is an answer that I give sometimes but I think we can actually be a bit more nuanced about it um or significantly more nuanced about it and in order to explain this Nuance I will tell you a story one and a half cats I guess um and so we have a box in the box we have an option here denoted by the hat and something which we're auctioning off right and now again we keep it very general maybe it's a bunch of auctions uh uh transaction orders or whatever maybe it's one um um we have this thing which one optionals and the outside of the box we have bidders right a bot is really about the the best mental model to use here um searches whatever and they're represented about here and the importance of the box is that schroding is other cat the auctioneer uh controls the parameters the perimeter of the box as a as a permeable barrier they control what information flows in and out right um so um what happens in this example is that um the auctioneer allows these Bots to send emissaries perhaps like clones of themselves whatever they're little little like people working for them inside of the Box putting on their behalf and the point I'm trying to but the point I'm going to be making with this example is that control over the the permeability of this barrier actually changes the auction and um you know having different uh rules for what can enter and move through this barrier changes the auction in itself and this is like a a privacy Point obviously so imagine this auction happens and you know plot number three wins place is the highest bid of course in within the Box the information of what's being auctioned might be completely not um but consider once a scenario in which only the winner is allowed to know about the information that um whatever happened in the box right so only the winning beta inside is able to transfer information to the outside I'm going to argue that this is a qualitatively different from a scenario in which everyone knows about this in which the barrier is like completely transparent does that does that make sense yeah everyone's nodding great so okay very abstract let's make it a bit more concrete um so for example let's say we have a really big trade and that people want to be be able to execute or whatever um and we and we run this auction and perhaps what the what how this auction works is that the bidders are offering some execution guarantee to say hey I'll give you this price give it that price I'll give you this prize um if it happens that everyone is aware of what information of what happened in the auction the winning bidder finds itself in a very different difficult position because everyone else knows about this big trade right this big trade that's going to move a price for example and they can act in this information as well they can price it in the Willing bidder now has to compete with all of these other actors to be able to to um uh make good on this offer that they gave within the auction the end result here is that the bidders have to price in this competition later on um in their bids meaning the bids will be lower right um which is different from the scenario where only the winning only the winning uh the winning Searcher is aware of of what happened inside the box right which means yeah yeah that's that's the example and so the user gets better offers in the system in the scenario where only the winner is aware of of what's being executed another example is an oracle update right and so some Oracle Updates this is kind of like not that obviously interesting for so imagine we have an oracle update with a sports betting platform and you know the game is finished and the Oracle is about update what the score was that's what they're interesting we all watch the game we kind of know what happened right of course there's like edge cases and maybe like oracles lying what what but maybe a more interesting example is yeah yeah go ahead so but when I better know it's key world so yeah everyone else everyone else know they didn't win and they know about the big trade right they know like every this barrier is like completely transparent no no actually in a case that you like yeah so in the case where it's non-transparent so the the like count you can do many things but the example I'm using is saying like Okay we make a rule that only the only information that's allowed to leave is allowed to leave um the only the only entity that's allowed to have information exit the system is the winning bidder right and so presumably what they do is they just give all the information they have to themselves in the outside world right yeah these people don't know about the trade at all unless they tell them which would seems like counter counterproductive yeah cool um so let's let's take a different Oracle example imagine that we have um you know like a couple of months ago a lot of price movement in a downward Direction and a lot of liquidations just may or may not happen perhaps in some like low liquidity tokens right and these liquidations can move the global price they can move the market price um and the Oracle update is coming in right on the right on the uh on the barrier um maybe it's a liquidation maybe there's not right in the scenario where um the auction is happening in the clear and there's this barrier is transparent every bit on the outside is aware of this of this information and they can they all have they can all act on it you know okay there's no liquidation uh you know maybe the price is like slightly too low I can I can activate or there is a Liquidation in which case you know chipped itself or whatever it is um of course the winning Builder can still execute the transaction and they can like have first execution rights on that specific domain as an example right but if this information is contained only to the winning bidder they have an additional an additional reason to bid right they have an additional additional value they gain from the auction which is Edge in the market they are the only entity that knows oh well not the only entity but um in this example they're the only entity that knows that this trade is out that this price oracles has been updated at this specific price um and they can there they can act with an edge over their competitors but everyone seems to be following okay cool I had like a lot of other stories but I told I was told they were less applicable so I took them out I'll tell you about my other pets um okay so how can we like what better answers can we give um than the answers that I I tried to give earlier um so what is being transferred from the user to the better or from the yeah the seller to the better um I would argue it's information and the ability to act on it right so yes it is about action it's about backgrounding it's about being able to execute in full disorder or whatever it is right but it's also about knowing that this is happening right uh um yeah that's that's a basic point right and what we achieve here we achieved protection of the user is that what the user is trying to do isn't broadcast everywhere and uh they're not insulting competition um but it's also a monetization of information the user has some information which might be useful to someone else and they can capture this value um what's being transferred from the bidder uh payments but and commitments right um which is I think different than um what I was saying earlier and I'll tell you why right so you of course you can have a straight up payment like hey here is my transaction and I if you after you have paid me like whatever I will offer you the transaction but in reality what many of the designs that have been considered and we've thought about look like is that actually it's just a it's a commitment to something right it's a commitment to pay or perhaps get slashed the transaction is ordered ahead of time and the question is what do the incentives look like of the auction um how credible is this commitment to for the payment to actually happen what if you have a very large a very large uh transaction being being auctioned off like very valuable perhaps it's uh worthwhile for someone to to take the slashing um and not and not pay for it uh commitment to execute perhaps someone is willing to pay and then censor a user right this is not something we we want necessarily how how credible is this commitment to share Revenue etc etc yeah a certain price um or something like that or you could just have no no kind of commitment whatsoever from the bidder and have all of the um all of the like auction logic be contained within the um the item that's being sold that's the fee escalated example afterwards if it doesn't make sense right and so when we look at these archetypes um we have to we have this like think about how within each category with within each design there's also this additional dimension of what information is being communicated what uh what's being transferred from the better to the seller as well um and so that's my attempt at communicating the archetypes um and like I was saying earlier we might want to posit that revenue maximization for the seller is our you know our our goal in the auction but they're realistically or other properties that we care about right and these properties are interrelated and so I'll try to highlight some of the important ones but but again maybe the the other ones that I haven't highlighted that are also important that I haven't thought about um so what are these properties uh so what what are the missable compatibility right um and I say civil compatibility instead of like civil proofness or civil resistance um because as we all know we operate in a world where we have cheap pseudonyms right it's very it's very easy to make a fake account a new eoa a new whatever and all of our auctions will exist in this kind of world unless we Implement some mechanism to prevent it um and so I say simple compatibility because simple proofness implies or has been used to imply that uh call actors not to creating symbols but that's quite a strong requirement I would say the requirement should be that the auction operates well even in the presence of of civils and I'll get into more details in a second right so one problem is civil bidders right you never know if all of these bids are coming from one entity or many entities um um but but another example another problem is civil sellers but right so it might be the case that the item which is being auctioned or that which is being auctioned off um was submitted by one of the bidders themselves right and then you might actually you might answer ask why that is a problem and I'll I'll Give an example in a second right so so what about like a sealed the first price auction which is like vanilla auctions right um I don't I think that's fine I think there's some results which is that's fine for the civil bidders case and for the Civil sellers case um I I don't think that anyone's gonna bid on something if they don't want to actually execute um but what about combinatorial auction actually there's a bunch of literature there's some literature on this I would say um and like one result for example is that we know that efficiency is impossible uh in the presence of civil bidders in a combinatorial auction right um which is not what do we care what we said we care about what we said we care about is revenue maximization so it's not a direct result but what this results shows is that actually the presence of civil bidders it's more complicated around this auction and we can't get the same guarantees but what if we add a civil Sellers as well right so for example the combinatorial auction if I I'm a bidder I can um you know the cow stop is an interesting example if I'm a if I'm a solver I can submit ahead of time a I shouldn't use Council it's a combinatorial auction I'm a I'm a no it's slightly different as well but um if I'm a common operating a combinatorial auction uh and I'm in a bitter I submit a a my own transaction assuming that as a seller of the transaction I will get some of the payout or some of the revenue generated by this transaction that instead of bidding on items a b and c which I care about I bet on items a b and c and my own transaction right and what this does is that um it makes my bid look larger but some of the value of it but it's actually flowing back to me and this this can skew the the um the results of the auction and actually um we know that this is a problem and Max who was here earlier is busy he's busy looking into this so I recommend speaking into him uh but it's not pretty and it's very hard to do so um let's yeah let's hope someone figure something out soon um batch auctions I don't know that's the cow swap example uh actually um and I have been back I don't have a theorem for you but I would imagine that it that this is like depending on the design this is a this is a problem you know and speaking to some some solvers like this is something that people have thought about at least um and it definitely adds like a a another dimension which the auctioneer has to reason about um and so we have to think about these things when we when we design our options and of course we can design mechanisms to resist sybils right but then if we require stake uh if we require kyc these kind of things these changes these change other properties of the auction we like perhaps it reduces the competitiveness uh perhaps it allows for like easier collusion these kinds of things another property which we should all be very familiar with uh is trust assumptions right um um of course and I think we get different flavors of trust assumptions right so of course the question is like on the very high levels like the auction is guaranteeing me like some sort of thing so some sort of property or cross set of properties um what trust assumptions do I have to make for that to be true right um one is credibility which tarun was talking about earlier right and what is the incentive of the auctioneer and here when I say Auctioneer um I really mean the auction system right perhaps it's literally like the flashbot server or someone server maybe it's a decentralized network of people maybe it's um some other mechanism that doesn't that the bootstraps like the existing validate validator set etc etc right um but what what is the incentives is someone actually gonna execute on on the auction as they promised um and on top of this you should you should think about how easy it is to deviate but um it does deviation require solving some like NP hard problem which only gives marginal returns or is it very like is it low pickings for this for this um for Google or for whoever right um then another question obviously the centralization the number of parties involved uh where is the Mev what can people do to to screw the auction um and then the failure models right if trust assumption a fails what happens do I lose all of my money do I get a slightly worse price you know can I tell can I can I can I tell um whether it did happen or is it very hard to detect um and so and a quick example to understand what I why these are important you can think of a trusted Auction House example right so there's one item and we have many better to be allocated and we have a trusted Auctioneer which manages the system gives a item to the hospital or we have in this example a fee escalator right in the example of a of a trusted Auctioneer um this Auctioneer can pretend it doesn't see any of the bids except one and have that one that one better briber on the side right allocating this item for effectively nothing and capturing money on the side whereas a fee escalator um where the auction is baked into the semantics of the transaction relies only on uh the this transaction being seen or this order being seen by multiple parties and the price discovery of the of the Dutch auction and um working and so the the first assumptions that you need for a fee escalator are much better than a auction house model with the question of how you implement uh privacy for the fee escalators of course much more difficult than for Mouse model and so these are things to keep in mind um yeah so a trusted each Auctioneer needs to collude with only one bidder whereas for the fee escalator to work um you need or afford to like completely break you need all of the competitive parties to to collude which seems like a much much higher barrier um and then of course there are other considerations when we think about this like an latency and economic cost right if you decentralize the system you have to expect that it's like somewhat slower than a centralized system right and there might be additional economic costs because you have to incentivize all these actors participating um great that's perfect timing um okay so properties of an owner of an IFA I'm just going to give you like a summary of things which I think are important from what I've said um and a couple of things I didn't I didn't talk about but I just want to briefly mention so the first property that I mentioned earlier is like what is being transferred right so what is the informational property of the item being transferred how General is the auction does your auction work only for certain kinds of orders like swaps basically or does it work for pretty much anything I think this is this is a philosophical question as well like there's a there's a degree of value in specialization now because Mev is mostly concentrated in swaps and whatever status quo um but like from my personal perspective you know a lot of the like value proposition of blockchain is that it's supposed to change many facets of life right introduce a like reduce trust assumptions and all these all these all of these different places we have monopolists and um like very powerful coordinators um and if if that's what we're trying to do then I think we should design auctions at uh as you know as much as the constraints allow sort of um a wide range of of possibilities because not only are we trying to improve what's happening to not only we're trying to improve the outcomes of users in the kind of current applications we're also trying to enable other and better applications to be implemented right security and Trust assumptions symbols fall under this Auctioneer like trusting the auctioneer falls under this revenue of course this is like one of the big things we care about um ux what latency is a user incur how much complexity the user have to suffer to um to to act with the system back in the system and in sustainability is something I didn't mention but I think is actually really important right Revenue relies on some degree of competition on the other side of the market right um if the market is um you know tends to centralize with time can you expect this Revenue to stay at the same level like if latency races are very important and we believe that latency uh rely winning a latency race relies on Hardware Investments and that these kind of Hardware Investments sustain only a handful of parties but do we expect the same degree of competitiveness in 10 years time etc etc but and then other other things I didn't mention uh truthful bidding right that's something that some people care about I don't know if it's that important um but it is you know it does make the playing feel much flatter for searches which does increase competition and then accuracy of redistribution right uh combinatorial auctions uh batch auctions all these kinds of things auction multiple uh orders at the same time right and there's some value allocated how do you how do you redistribute this value do you send it to like metamask do you distribute it equally among the different orders all of those actually have that were especially Distributing equally among the orders um has its problems um especially when it comes to like security concerns um so I'll leave it at that um and the the final message I I'd like to leave you guys with and I appreciate your attention given the sort of relentlessness of today um is that there's a pixelated Utopia uh that we're we're all we're all aiming for right and not only are we trying to sort of like mitigate things that we don't like about the current system but we're trying to design something that's like better than the status quo better than Triad file uh and so I think it really makes sense to really explore the corners the nooks and the crannies of the design space um to see what what what what lies outside of our mental models what lies outside of our assumptions yeah so that's that's the content of the talk and then I'll finish off with a very basic thing which is an illustration of the value of information sharing I present you with two QR codes one presents you with an opportunity to troll me the other is me trolling you uh and you're welcome to scan if you like or not yeah yeah um so so I guess this is an interesting question if you're thinking about just the order for auction component or we're thinking about the logic the question came up earlier like where does the value accrue you know how much how much value uh needs to flow to validate just for this to be like a stable stable equilibrium or whatever I think that's a really hard question but I think uh a heuristic for trying to answer this said okay within the with the order flow auction with some constraints on uh security assumptions and like generality of order flow uh maximizing for Revenue I think is like a really a good heuristics revenue for the seller obviously um especially because like uh Thomas working out um where you're competing with other other implementations we really might not like uh like for example you know the the people network chat file or whatever so it makes sense your Co-op code is uh permission oh really okay so it's only the I can only troll you [Music] for the upcoming Rose yeah so so that's something I was supposed to say um but obviously like as you improve as you improves as you like if you just really focus on including Revenue it's easier to make the first assumptions that reduces like cryptographic load you don't have to bring too many ashes whatever um but that's like that's the problem that we're trying to dance and part of it also is like is this like a feedback process between like block construction and the audible and ideally like the sauce exactly yeah the auction is happening with uh as much information as possible right foreign is different things yeah yeah leader takes all centralized so the awesome what is sustainable yeah right you know part of the ideas to come back yes so I think that the the very high level answers that you want the market to be here as competitive as possible over time and what that means that you won't have low barriers and entry and these sorts of things but you also want the rewards within the system to be distributed in a way that that um isn't just concentrated with from a single actor and so if you think about block building um which is really the other side um of the of the searching of the political alternative users and searches if you allow block will interview like a decentralized process where many actors are benefiting from it that's better than a world where only a single bottle shop is taking all the value of the things and because that value that they they extract implies that no one else is able to access it that is ready some researchers some sort of um 5-10 years are able to you know slip off their like very small margins yeah so so there's a notion in that Dynamics to still exist there even if it's very easy to get in right um yeah what you're saying is easy to get in but there's a huge Competitive Edge yeah yeah so uh I don't have a full-ons review but one interesting thing to think about is like what is the dimensionality what are people building is everything you bring over the exact same thing is everything like a swap and everyone just see people swaps yeah there's one problem or you can put everything like maybe and maybe a swap is already a kind of like a multi-dimensional path so if you think about these these transactions that happen way ahead of time what's your betting on the betting on the expectations right and expectation is a very like expectation of all things it happens it's normal conditioning you know if there's more information to bid on you actually have like a market with many different dimensions that people are competing on and that allows for niches to form a different type of activities by actors so I mean yeah
