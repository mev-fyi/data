hi guys hey everyone I'm just gonna wait a couple seconds for the stream to go live on YouTube before we get started all right good morning good afternoon good evening depending on where you're calling from uh we have Emmanuel and Juan here from zondax who's going to do a workshop on get started with final coin solidity library and Barracks Explorer if you have any questions feel free to send them into the zoom chat and our speakers will be more than happy to answer them and with that being said I will pass them the mic off to our two speakers okay I will start and I will I will manage the presentation the slides so first of all thank you all for being here and we are Emmanuel and Johan from sundax I will share my screen so you you can start with the presentation and I think you're you know you are you're looking at my screen so everything should should be ready to start so I want to introduce us as a company first because this is not saving we are we are a bunch of people that um we are distributed around the world I mean this this is part of the team that we have a meeting in in place something ago um we're a company that we work like with different um I mean we work with with a in the blockchain consistent from the late from the last four or five years we're actually working in really you know Innovative Tech solutions for the block for the blockchain system and we have been working we have been a partner we have a partner with five coin for for the last three or four years really close partnership so we have been like a lot of tools for for the ficon ecosystem and today we are going to talk about two of them two or three of them uh that are really really specific for this uh for this hackathon and I want to go straight forward to to them I mean we have three three books to talk about I've already about them today and they're they're I mean they are like two groups they're divided in two groups one of them is a solidity a state of solidity libraries that you we will see that the what they are for in the next flight uh but they're really specific or related with your smart contracts and your your code the way that you can drop the fighting with from your smart contract and the other one is a product called Barracks that it will allow you to to to to to see the historical data on the on the blockchain so anything you do or even interactive with an API so anything you do with your management tracks or accounts anything that's happening behind the scenes in the filecom blockchain you will be able to see and interact with them from this this specific product I want to talk about the solid libraries and John is going to talk about the barracks the product uh so I will start with a solidity libraries I think they're really I mean this tool is really really specific for developers and what do you what do you what what they are I mean there are a set of libraries of solidaries what I mean with that is function and types that will allow you to interact with uh file coin uh with the ficon features from the solidity smart content so you're writing um if you don't have these libraries you will need to you would need to to do everything by your own uh understanding how to call your the how to call the file connectors the Falcon functionality from the solidity from your Solita smart contract so we have created a lot of functions in top of unsolidity that um models all the types and the methods that all the actors in the file coin in the Falcon Network have so for us for you it's just going to be a matter of importing this package and using all the methods that you would find that you you can find on the documentation in the ficon documentation about the actors so if you want to to interact with some minor actor with a with a market to see teams to create a deal um I mean it's you are going to to to to do it really easy because everything is solidiful so you can see what is happening I understand the types and and match that with the frequency documentation so it was conceived to be easy to understand to use and deploy and what I meant with what I mean with with this easy to understand because it's solidity and it's a it's a it's a really there's a really close relationship between the the data types and the methods and the method names between the library and the five coin actors so if you check the documentation for the file connectors you will you will be able to understand what those methods and types are and and and do it's easy to use because as we're going to speak in a minute uh there is a npm package so you can import it on your smart and your IDE on your developer tool that hard hat Foundry remix and just importing it it's um you you will get all the contracts and you will be able to consume them and it's easy to deploy because there are libraries there are no contracts so they are completely available so it's going to be part of your smart contract when you compile them so there's no need to deploy them and and and fetch I mean and interact with with them through through an address in the blockchain so that's that's the main three points that we we try to to focus on when we were trying to develop the libraries as I mentioned before we have an npm package it's called Phi consolidi as you can see there in the images at Sonic slash file consolidity it has the entire set of libraries and you will see that there is some test libraries the libraries itself the types and there is some mocks libraries that don't don't do anything specific with the FICO network with the real fibonal but they have um some mock scenarios depending on what you pass to them but you will find everything there in the in the package we handle the version I mean it's easier to handle version in updates because we are using simple standards so breaking change uh new features and patches it's going to be easy to to see what is happening when we release a new version and it's perfect for developers because as you as you might know it's easy to to use them from as I mentioned before from Harahan Foundry remix with just a matter of uh naming them on your on your smart contract code and I mean remix will fetch the package itself for you and that's what I have to tell you about the solidity Larry we have we will try to vote to make it go through the library at the end of the presentation uh but I will pass the um the microphone for you on you're just going to tell you about the verdict CPI thank you hi everyone um thank you Mario I'm anyone um and I'm going to talk about lyrics uh so perix I'll explain two parts one is the API the other one is the Explorer uh what is the API so uh Linux API indexes behind and exposes it through the API um the filecoin data historical and real time next life is mrl uh what can various API do it provides information uh like transactions account information fees addresses uh and stiff sets next slide please where you can find it you can find it at docs.ch slash Barracks or just go to docs and you'll find it there okay we will go through all of these yeah at the end um there are two steps you have to get a free token and of course you must have a GitHub account first and then you can test it right here on top of that for developers we have an npm package that has the same benefits as the API um and it's in typescript perfect for Developers next slide please okay thanks for um next door is the platform for developers uh like a blockchain explorer that includes historical data real-time data streaming and metrics for the filecom blockchain next slide please uh what can you do uh besides searching like a normal Explorer does certain transactions addresses tip sets uh you can interact with the contracts you can call read and write methods and they'll see their decoded API upload your own uh see the byte code the op code of course for the with the right the right methods especially uh you will need funds for that and don't worry we have a faucet so we don't have to go outside come back in again and you can connect with metamask um we also have a mental view to check if your transaction got stuck uh where it went through and the metrics metrics uh are going to be inside the dashboard and they are going to come soon ASAP uh of course you can find it at there is that zone.ch next slide please and it has a nice feature because during these weeks we will progressively add more features we would really appreciate if you can give us feedback we can use the small uh at all on the right side it takes a screenshot you can draw on it and write a message and you can even ask for new features if you need them urgently for your project we will be happy to help um here is a summary of all the peaceful links you can take a screenshot take a picture and I'm sure you'll find this presentation after yes I mean we can we can share the the links in in the presentation we can share the presentation and we can make it available for you so you have the links and you can check them foreign yes yes yes we have a question there is ways value not supported on Breaks by default we have we have no to hyperspace because hybrid space is a the long term just net that was deployed like a week ago uh that's why but while we are planning to add the wallaby again in the verixa Square because we we had it like a like in two or three weeks ago so it's going it's going to be there really soon so I will start sharing is your turn yeah okay um I think it's all right can you see my screen yes yes perfect okay so we'll go first with the API uh see how you can get it uh key uh so you have to go to uh ch at um Scranton UC berries API or just type docs.ch Slash lyrics and here you can get the key see the docs and CDE APM package let's try to get a key okay um here you don't see it because I already have GitHub connected but you will have to uh have a GitHub account and accept it okay perfectly um it redirects me back to the documentation when it pops up here with my token don't forget to copy it and in here you can test it you can test all the endpoints um but make make sure that in case it doesn't like it gives you a 401 error make sure to replace this one in here with the new one and you press update okay let's make a try so let's choose the latest chipset this is the easiest one or one the same error so in case this happens you can go in here delete it take to one on top paste it and I think hopefully this time works perfect so here you can see the latest music information the same with all the others like account balance info uh transactions uh get all the transactions using Google from a deep set or from an address uh good let's move to the Explorer um here's the Explorer at varics.com.ch and you can see on the left side all the tools uh we have we have the home which is the search part we have the interact we have we'll have the dashboard zoom and the mempool and the faucet also is coming ACP on top you can select the network of hyperspace Mania developing Edison what I've said before we'll explain why we don't have all the beat active yet um a search switch the theme connect with your wallet to connect with metamask you'll have to use Chrome for the moment okay and here is the feedback tool that he's using okay let's make a test uh we are here in hyperspace let's you have three examples in case you don't know what to search you're you're new and just want to check it out uh choose one of them if you go to chipset you'll see the Deep set information and if you are a developer and want to see a bit more you know more Dev style you can go here on top and enable the dev mode and you will see the exact response on the right side you are able you will be able to see either the transactions but first you have to choose one from the table below make this one and from this table everything you see in blue is clickable and you can go inside it for example let's see this account this is the account information these transactions that came in and out uh perfect okay now let's check the I have it here coupon the interact part you have to you can use both the eth cycle address kind and a field and I check the contract if it exists if it's deployed view it's a bi by code op code and playground still some bucks to fixing the playground like in the playground you will you can call the right and read methods and you'll get the response down here okay let's see the mempool this is the current sample in the hyperspace um okay um I don't just want to mention that the gray ones are outside the manifold but I can just kept them there so you can access it so it doesn't disappear against nothing um and that's it for myself yeah thank you I will share my screen now I will give you like a quick go a walk through the repository uh um let me share my screen again uh hi my fluent controls okay so do you see my screen okay perfect this is a repository syntax it's a Sandbox file consolidity as you can see here there is a link to go to the web to the to the Lux web and here you will find a really a short description about it an introduction about the technology involved some assumptions that we did when we created the the library and you will find here a lot of information about an informals you will have all the methods that are Mock and the libraries and you can that you can consume again Mozart it's are like like like the same method interfaces that we have on the real library but we are not calling the actual five coin the actual actors we are calling we're responding answering to your request with a pre-loading scenarios depending on what you and when and what what you asked uh what you send and for the API you have a like a a little description of how you can deploy how you can use it as you can see here it's really short that it's really easy with an Indian package if you're using hard hat it's just a matter of using your ad importing them from the from the contracts and do a call as you can see here you you're more than welcome to to that we're going to invite you to to check the the website [Music] here in the contracts we see right they are they are organized in a way that we have different versions for different solidity compilers for now we are only using a zero point data I think it's one of the latest one and as you can see here you have all a lot of uh the solid libraries they're these ones that is a API one for each uh for each Act that we have Exposed on the on the library and maybe I mean if you go to the account API as you can see here is a library and you have three or two different in this case two different methods this is this authenticated message and universal receiver hook and they have different parameters these parameters are exactly the same representation or very much very close to the simple representation that actors in the file called in the file coin blockchain I have uh you can go to the types by file that you will find there are a lot of extracts with a with the description with each field that this this type has as you can see here we are calling where this is it they're really straightforward functions are really simple because we are only serializing the data sending the sending data to the actor getting response passing it and give it back to the to the insolidity in solidity code uh here you can find the MOX those those are again as I said before it's the same signature for each method but we are not calling anything we are just doing a acting based on your arguments uh giving you a different answers uh and here you can find some tests these are actual Deployable contracts because as you can see here there are contracts we are importing and in this case the the power API it's a library and creating functions for each of those methods so no now they are you can call them from this content that is going to be deployed on that or can be deployed on the network um what else what is it can can be useful to to be explained um what else uh here is the npm package uh says you saw before it's it's I mean it's this is a the classic npmgs registry um okay and okay I I display the documentation and lastly I want to show you and like I mean this is remix and I think you you're seeing my screen here um this is a test a smart content I created like like in remix as you can see here the only thing I did was to write that I want to get the market API library from uh from the Sundance solidity contracts ba08 and greater than in smart and and short contract where where I'm just creating functions that are public and I can call from the outer work and getting the response for in this case for the get deal labor or with a deal ID and returning the the label notification string the same for the get deal provider it's been compiled at this moment with the with this version of the compiler and if you deploy it as you can see here I have two two deployments here I think we can write to it it will take some time because I mean it will it will give me better Mass here I get some funds before I can confirm it and now I have to wait for the for the equation it will take like a minute because there is there are not many mine or something at work so it takes more time than what that it usually takes in minute but at the end you will have something like this you can execute here as you can see they get test get get the get the label confirm it and I mean I did it I did it like one or two minutes ago or and you have and again we need to wait here for for it uh but as you can see here it's it's just a matter of importing it or mentioning it on your smart contract and remix really really fetch the package directly from from the mpf JS that's why it's it's really easy to to use it and again for all the actors and methods that you see on this in on the different actors uh they are like like an example presentation the five coin functionality uh the native functionality so if you check the file con documentation you should find a better representation of what each actor does and its massive methods and everything else I mean for the solid Library we are not doing anything in special in in that sense so let's say I mean look asked before if if you can from here uh add some collateral to a new strategy or anything else we have a lot of methods here some of them are commented we are we are trying to comment uh documentable so you have more information on the contract on the library itself but for now if okay you can you can you can check the method that you have there and what you what what methods of different access you need uh in order to do what you want to do and see if in that sense it's possible to do it from the solidity from this from the solid the smart contract I know that there are there are a lot of examples of tools that Cyclone is is uh creating for you as examples using heart and everything else so we can point you to to those examples and and everything in a Discord and I think that's all for me too I will leave like a couple three or four minutes for any questions that I didn't see on the on the channel and the chat if you have any please feel free to to write them there and thank you thank you all for for your time it's been a nice experience to be here and and explain you about this these two amazing three amazing tools that we have we've been working on feel free to come off me if you want to ask your question live as well okay no questions I think there is a question um if we have support on the global uh yeah I mean we have we are going to be there as a helping or answering questions there so uh feel free to attack us there yeah I mean we we are going to be there and more and some others say partners for from uh from the company so feel free to to tag us there and we will be able to answer you support all right um oh I think you have a question how do you share respect people just I mean what we expect here I mean we we want you to to use their tools I mean the libraries are I I must if you want to interact with five coin features from solidity yeah if you know I mean they're a must because it's going to take a lot of time for you to discover how to call the pre-compiles that allows you to interact with the underlying filecoin blockchain so it's a really helpful tool if you want to do that I mean that's the the key feature of the the this evm this ethereum Builder machine running on top of Falcon it's solidity taking advantage of the Five Point features that you that that audio has uh and explore I mean it's it's a way for you to to interact because you have like kind of a remix uh section that you can fetch with another address and see they call the API and interact with it with your metamask run view and any other method and and even I mean change the state of your smart contract and at the same time you can you can see the mempool and you can see the entire your entire what is happening in the network the minute or in in a hyperspace all at the same in the same place so it's kind of like one of a kind tools because you have everything there the only thing you don't have there is like an IDE to write your smart contracts but I mean maybe in the future and the idea is for you to give us feedback because and we know that maybe bugs can happen I mean will happen and maybe Futures that you that you want to have there in the very Explorer too I mean and the API is for for any developer that wants to integrate your in in in an application not for not for for humans but that do something you can use first one but just for testing and I think I hope I answer the question all right I don't I don't think we have that if you have time on to to to translate the last the last one maybe we can we can continue on this corner I'm not sure I mean manual type uh feel free to answer that last one okay uh I think I mean when your type uh has all the the types the structures that defines uh different methods for the minor actor uh for the minor actor I mean the manual actor is is the one that is created when a new Miner is deployed on the network and if you want to know uh the characteristics the features the the values that that minor has in the network you can use it to to fetch uh information about it you need to pass the address of that specific Miner that you want to to interact with and you will be able to see here I mean I'm looking at some functions here get down here I think it will give you the the owner of this uh of that of that mine you can see yeah you can get they get to the sex the sector size the balance that it has some funds beneficiary I mean again this is pretty much related with the five coin Network and the documentation so you don't you won't find like a really big documentation about what it what is an actor inside the study library because that's part of the Five Point network but if you go to the five coin documentation and check there you will I mean it will allow you to have a better representation of what is a minor on the network and then you will be able to come back to the solidity Library understand it better we are working on adding more documentation on the solid itself but we don't want to be redundant between the solidity library and filecoin documentation itself uh but yeah okay I think we are ready now awesome anyone for taking the time to do this workshop for the space for hackathon um sincerely appreciate it for the rest of you thank you so much for tuning in um and as mentioned in the chat if you do want to look back on this Workshop it is recorded and on YouTube so you can access it at any time during the event or afterwards as a resource and with that being said see you all on Discord and also see you at the kickoff and Summit happening soon goodbye everyone thank you
