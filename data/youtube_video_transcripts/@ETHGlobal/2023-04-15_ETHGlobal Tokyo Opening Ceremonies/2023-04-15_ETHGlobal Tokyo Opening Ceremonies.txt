going Tess my name is kartik one of the co-founders of Youth Global and I'm excited to welcome all of you to eat Global Tokyo another Applause and all of you already tired but sadly this is when things actually start this is not a conference this event is a neat Global event and those of you who are attending our events for the first time here's what's different about all these things our goal and our mission is to onboard thousands of developers into the web 3 ecosystem and each Global does this by hosting hackathons and Summits eat Global Tokyo is a hackathon what does that mean that means we believe in three key things our focus is on builders for the whole weekend this is an opportunity for all of you to learn Mentor get help and grow as individuals and upskill yourselves and we really believe showing is more important than telling which means on Sunday no PowerPoints allowed you must show something that actually works and that brings us to what we do as it Global we've done this thing for the last five years all across the world from Buenos Aires to Cape Town South Africa to New York to India Waterloo in Canada London Amsterdam Mexico San Francisco India again last year with our biggest event ever and now we're excited to be back we're back it's like to be in Japan this is our first event in Japan and our first event of 2023 we have over 1500 attendees here this this weekend and I am super excited to welcome all of you here and to the web3 ecosystem please give yourselves a massive Round of Applause out of those we have over 10 1 000 Hackers from 59 countries and 35 of everybody here is new to web3 which is our core goal what does that actually mean it means that 35 of people here are existing developers in web 2 they're trying to learn and see what's possible in web 3. so we can't wait to see what all of you build over the course of the next 36 hours we put everybody on a map to see where everybody was coming in from these are 59 different countries represented across six different continents moreover about 40 of all of the attendees here are from Japan and astonishing 70 from Asia our biggest focus is going to be Asia next year and it's just amazing to see all of you here from so many nearby countries and cities so I'm excited to meet all of you this weekend and let's get started on top of all just the hackers over 384 ecosystem abilities are amazing developers Engineers product managers designers Founders from so many companies that you already know in this space 28 technical mentors who are here all weekend at the help desk upstairs to just help you debug any questions any bugs any problems that you're facing to really get your project up to speed we're going to be hosting and we've already hosted more than 20 workshops this whole weekend to learn about how different protocols work and because this is not a conference only nine talks we're going to cover all the key important research and things happening in this space all of that is going to happen tomorrow upstairs and on this floor and this becomes an opportunity for you all of you to learn what's going to be important over the next 12 months on top of all of that there's over 375 000 U.S in prizes which is 50 million yen so you have a lot of opportunity to win amazing amazing prizes from all of our partners and speaking of Partners there's 38 incredible companies here all throughout this weekend to help you really build everything that you wanted to build and really build something successfully so I want to give them a big big shout out for supporting this event so please give a big round of applause for all of our amazing Partners we have one inch we have metamask noses chain Taiko uh toku polygon me now World coin lens protocol air stack file coin Uma Ave Grand style curve grits safe ethereum Foundation the graph cello ZK Bob apecoin hyperlane superfluid and Max unusual Foundation huddle of One Secured Finance quick node buns lit mass network scroll mantle push reason Neath Life beer cismo and Quantum so many incredible companies building in so many different spaces all of them are here to help you be successful so I know we're running very late in terms of this night and all of you want to get back to building your projects so before we go all in focusing on our code let's cover some key important pieces for how today tomorrow and Sunday is going to work I want to talk about how this venue is set up how you can get help all the prizes of course we're going to talk about some workshops we're going to talk about how judging itself works and everything about team formation in case you are still looking for team members so let's talk about Security First of all do not use any hot spots we have a very dense set of people here in these two floors and we're all trying to share the same 10 gigabyte ethernet the way all of our routers work and I really stress this very much your hotspots under your phone are on the same frequencies as the access points so if you feel like the internet's slow and you turn the hotspot on you make it worse for everybody else near you because you end up interfering with those waves so if you think the internet's slow do not fall back to turning on your data hot spots because it perpetuates the problem we are we're monitoring everything real time and we are rearranging the network layouts to address it if the Wi-Fi is slow give it five to ten minutes as we rearrange the network layout or do not use hotspots because that makes it worse for the five people next to you on top of that everybody must wear their wristbands and your badges this is the security control here if you do not have your wristbands on you you will be not allowed on this floor especially or any of these floors especially after this ceremony and if you cut this off we will not be issuing you a new one so if you go back and utilize this is you know something take this you want to take this off and you come back tomorrow without the wristband you will be not issued the next one and you will not be allowed to enter back at the venue so please keep that in mind no wristband no entry on top of that do not leave your belongings unattended we have security here we're making doing our best to ensure that everybody can safely work in both of these floors but do not fall asleep or just leave your bags or your laptops and just leave the venue take it with you please if something gets lost we are not liable for any of those things but there will be a loss and found people to misplace things from time to time and we'll collect anything that we find but do not leave your valuables unattended how is this whole weekend set up there's two floors here this floor is going to be used for oh actually let's talk about the fifth floor everything is happening upstairs from food to all the hacking to all the workshops we have two parts in the building on the fifth floor that's where all the hackers are the registration was upstairs as well the three rooms at the back are for workshops and the catering is going to be on top in addition to all the snacks and a lounge space this floor is going to be used for all of our talks that are happening tomorrow and on Sunday for judging and the closing ceremonies beyond that there is nothing happening on this floor so everything remains fully upstairs we also have a lot more things going on so there's some late night snacks for you here they'll all be served at midnight and this will happen tonight and tomorrow in case you are all hungry and you're less that you want more than the snacks that are available uh don't forget to take a selfie at the booth it's right behind the registration desk if you want to get a digital photo of you being here with your team you get to do this as part of our amazing design for this event and there's also going to be a workshop on origami for the infinite Garden journey and that's happening tomorrow upstairs on the fifth floor from 3 P.M to 6 p.m conducted by ethereum Foundation let's talk about all communication there's over a thousand of you here and we have to make sure that we're streamlining all of the important information we have to tell everybody as of this moment everything that we're going to talk about for this event is going to be on Discord which means anything that's happening or not happening or if we're running late or something changes we're going to post all of that on Discord you can join the Discord from your hacker dashboard by just logging on to ethglobal.com and if you are a hacker you'll be automatically given access to all the channels for this hackathon which means that you'll be able to see all the other attendees you can message all the other sponsors and our partners you can message all the mentors you can ask any questions if you're stuck about how to use a specific protocol and all of our official announcements will also be on Discord and remember that you are here in person you can just talk to each other if you have a question about a protocol go to that protocols table and ask them that question instead of typing on Discord or hoping that somebody answers you online or on Twitter and everything that's going to be happening over the weekend which is all talks all workshops anything in between all of that is going to be listed on the schedule page on the website which means whatever the website says this is what we'll be doing if something is late we'll be updating the website so the website is the source of Truth and in case you want to know what the website is it's eth global.com Tokyo so how does this hackathon work you can start hacking officially now you can start working on your projects you can work on your projects with your team you can work individually as well you can have a team of up to five members on your team you don't have to use a team you can individually submit projects as before and you have 36 hours to hack submissions are due at 9 00 a.m on Sunday April 16th and after that we're going to start judging all of the projects that come out of this hackathon what are the rules of a project you can work on anything you would like as long as it's related to ethereum but everything that you do must be done from scratch which means you cannot work on something you were doing before today you must start all of your projects as of this evening and only rsvped hackers are eligible to win prizes which means that if your team members are not listed on your team and you win a prize only people who are listed on the team will be getting any of the prizes and of course if you have any questions about pre-existing work or can I use different Frameworks that can I fork off a different project please come and ask us you can obviously use open source tools you can use existing code that's already on GitHub from others that are that's already open source and we're happy to answer any questions for you and this event is designed for a lot of beginners and people who have been in this ecosystem for a while you can learn from so many different people in this space there's a lot of workshops here if you are unsure of how do I start something on this topic you can check out the infocenter which is on your dashboard to learn all the resources on a given Topic in this space or how everything is going to be work is going to work how to think about submitting a good project what is a good way to structure your demo for the project all those things are listed on your hacker dashboard on eat global.com and also everything is going to be recorded and live streamed which means every anything I'm saying any workshops that you missed today you can go to eth global.tv and watch the Youtube video and you can go back pause and check out any of the workshops that you couldn't attend earlier today and if you are still looking for a team we're going to be doing a workshop right after I stop talking in one hour that's a lot of talking I know it's going to be upstairs there's a lot of people who are still looking for team members a lot of people who want other people to come join their team we're going to be doing that as a workshop so you get to be in the same room and talk to each other and help find other team members so you can just go upstairs at 10 pm and get potential team members or join another project there's also a amazing tool that we have on your dashboard where you can find other people who are looking for teams you can search people by different skill sets if you're looking for a designer if you're looking for a smart contract developer if you're looking for a front-end developer you can put all of that in there you can press the search button and it'll show you who is here in the building looking or has that skill and you can find team members you can message them on Discord and you get to work on some incredible projects together let's talk about submissions and judging submissions are due at 9 00 am which gives you exactly 36 hours and two minutes I I jumped the gun um and the way it's going to work is as follows the second you submit your project you have a choice to think about how you want to be judged there's a main judging track and a partner judging track the way judging is going to work is that if you want to be one of the top 10 teams you get to select the main judging track and if you don't want to do that and you want to only be eligible for partner prizes you you just don't select the main judging and you just submit your project for the normal judging process both of those judgings will happen at the same time which means once you submit your project you will be assigned a room you have to go to that room and demo your project to those judges after that you have to go to any of the sponsors who you are applying for a prize and go to their table and demo your project now this is going to be very complex for you if you have a lot of projects or a lot of prizes which means if you apply for five sponsor prizes and the main judging you have to go to main judging and then each of the five tables for sponsors and demo your projects six times so be careful about managing your time be careful by not selecting too many bounties and keep track of how you want to split your time and how you want to get to demoing all of your projects you can decide which order you want to go to which means that if you realize that you want to talk to all of the sponsors before you can do that and then go to main judging or if you're not doing the main judging you can just go to all the sponsor tables and start demoing your projects to them one by one after that we'll be collectively looking at all the winners and talking about who's going to win the prizes and on Sunday we're going to come back and announce who won what prizes so this is how the main judging works you will have four minutes to demo your project and two minutes after that for questions so in total you have six minutes and you have to just show your laptop and you get to demo live to the judges on what you built we recommend that you record a video of your demo in case something goes wrong during the live demo this way you can just switch and play to the video or you can do a live demo and if they have more questions something is slow you get to show that as a backup please please please please please please please do not do this last minute it will take you at least 45 minutes to submit your project you have to write how you built everything you have to show your code we will ask you where are you using which company's protocols in what code it will take you some time and if you're going to record a video you want to add some time on top of that so please bucket a lot of time and then you can submit don't do listing five minutes before it will take you more than five minutes this is how partner judging is going to work on your hacker dashboard you have to tell us which prizes you are going to select if you don't select those prizes we have no way of knowing that you have to present to that partner and the second you select the prizes all the partners will get a notification that they have to expect you so when you get to a partner's table a sponsor table they will know that you are a team that they're expecting and they'll know how to look at your project and really give you the scores or decide if you are winning their prize and as I mentioned before you can do this thing before or after the main judging so if you are trying to do both you can go to the partner first or if you're going to the judging you can do the main judging first and then go to the partner so some of the other key things code of conduct this is an in-person event so all of our rules and code of conduct applies you can see all of our rules on eth global.com rules and the rules are very simple which is please be respectful for to everybody in this space harassment of any form is not going to be tolerated if you are misbehaving we will kick you out and anything that you build is going to be owned by you you own the entire IP neither 8 Global nor our sponsors no Partners nobody else has the rights to what you build you get to collectively do whatever you want and the entire team is going to be an equal shareholder of that intellectual property that you build if you have any other questions come talk to me come talk to anybody wearing a need Global t-shirt and we will be happy to answer all of those questions for you enough of the logistics I I kind of appreciate that you've been carefully listening but I also don't know if you're carefully listening or you just don't care so if you heard me and you are good with it please give it a big round of applause there we go let's get some energy back into this room so what we want to do now is want to call up some of our amazing Partners here to tell you who they are what they're excited about what they want to build and what they want to see uh come out of this event I'm going to get some of them here one by one and have them share their excitement of this event so first off I want to call up gleb from one inch to tell us everything about them so please welcome glad uh thank you [Applause] yeah uh hi everyone uh my name is glad I'm from one inch and uh uh first of all to thank organizers of this amazing event and so uh a lot of people here probably know who we are and one inch itself um was built at the ethereum global event like in 2019 so I hope and I wish that at this event we will see even more successful nervational products being built so um what else um uh for those who doesn't know one inch like name cam comes from uh the famous Bruce Lee one-inch punch the most effective punch in the martial arts they were a big inspiration for our Founders and um so essentially like the effectiveness of the is the philosophy like the behind our products yeah and that's what we focus on what we built our new products new features and um so um well so and um yeah um so we expect projects to come to see check our bounties and uh if your wallet or a dow or an exchange or like if you want to do any like if you like if your project requires any secure asset operations and um like if you want to build a new version of decentralized funds protocols please come check our bounties we recently released one inch Fusion it's our new major update uh that is um like bringing a new user experiences for like end users so if you want to build the products that will allow like a new million of users being on board at an ethereum in the theorem ecosystem like uh the users that want to pay guests or don't know how to be protected from Sandwich attacks and other stuff please come check it and uh I guess in a way that's it um thanks so much to the organizers once again and I wish good luck to all the builders and the hackers out there and please have time and build something great thank you so much amazing looks like we're having some heavy difficulties well why wouldn't we tell a joke how do you uh how do you differentiate between an introverted developer from an extroverted developer foreign developer looks at your shoelace is while talking to you this is really hard to debug and tell a joke so I'm going to focus on panicking here while our team fixes what's going on with the live stream or the SlideShare all right looks like we're making some progress aha and now the tough part is I close the tab I shouldn't have no no that's not it this that's definitely not it all right we're going to take is the old school way which is we're going to do it live no that's not the the right way thank you hold the mic there we go thank you glad next up we have Francesco from metamask please give him a big round of applause awesome awesome whoa whoa so he talk you guys are you guys ready to hack yeah wait wait oh okay are you guys ready to hack hey awesome awesome so this will be literally my fastest keynote I have literally two minutes so I will run through super fast but uh guys we have 15K bounties so obviously this is not just winning bounties but his experience we want to build this weekend right do we want to build or not hey awesome awesome energy I know he's late but hey we'll start to build so uh three main bounties how many heard how many of you heard Linea let's see a couple of people hands oh cool cool cool but literally we those are the zkevm from consensus called linear and uh I don't want to bore you but uh hey we have some Bounty for you and uh we launched public test Netflix so everything is going so fast in this industry I'm feeling old right now but literally so 7.5 K literally whatever you build you Deploy on linear right and you will be eligible make sure you just put uh I think we have a cooler in the in your read media just put keep calm and love Tokyo so well well done well done uh second Midwest SDK how many game developers are here some some Unity but long story short we have 1.5 for any Unity developer they want to build a game with our SDK so as you care literally native integration uh on your uh game and we have also 3K for General SDK application so think about bad transactions a bunch of use case second I don't know how how we're going in time but snaps I hope someone heard about snaps yeah yeah awesome awesome but literally for anything that you think about extending your functionality on on top of metamask think about snaps so any developer out there can build snaps and bunch of people build I don't know no evm compatible snaps and literally we want to stay very open this time and build your best snap that you have out there and yeah we're very excited about that we we push also some some resources if we want to scan this QR code but we have a cool Booth we have a bunch of people actually supporting it Tokyo for the first time we're very pumped about this maybe raise your hand if you are in their room so you know who will Mentor you in the next 48 hours so no sleeping guys please and yeah I just want to thank you again it's Global for this and we are super excited about the next 48 hours awesome thank you thank you next up we have Daniel from Tycho please give Daniel a big round of applause thank you unlike a one inch and metamask taco is new so I'm not going to talk about our bounties I'm going to talk about the tiger project so um we have layer tools we need to build another layer too right because fundamentally we believe in the following scenes we believe that leader tools that are not decentralized not permissionless are not going to replace the ethereum as the application layer right so we want to build decentralized information list later too secondly we feel like in future other layer tools we will share a comments back and we believe the type one thing like the ethereum developer experience is going to be very uh very close to the Future standard so we want to got close to that standard as soon as possible and then we also believe that one single layer to Canal scale ethereum maybe only layer series can truly scale the ethereum so we are not going to build just one single layer too so Taiko is not one single layer to you find out later so what is tiger technical is fully decentralized so all the blocks all the other blocks are proposed by Anonymous Builders and is confirmed by ethereum validators not by any type of special roles right so just injury called it based the roll up and the journal improve are also uh you know generate by anyone so if you have the hardware you can just prove the blocks and then it's type one basically we don't change anything that any assumption that you have when you program on ethereum will cap be kept the same right all the paycheck the signage algorithm everything is the same except 1559 and the 48 44. that's the two exception because Taiko has a wearable block time instead of has like constant block type all right and the first third thing is really cool um we have this concept of inception layer you guys know the movie Inside right where you can have one dream inside another dream so Taiko you can deploy tiger on top of ethereum to become a layer two and then you are going to be able to deploy on top of layer 2 to become layer Series so when Taiko goes online as a midnight launch you know we are going to have a bunch of layers the cool thing is it's all the same code base only configures no changes and that's it everything is the same all the other technology is the same and another thing is is great is that we have this built-in signal Service uh as part of the core protocol so you can send any message to any chain no matter later to our layer 3. so you can use the same mechanism to verify something happened on the other side of the chain and you know so you can see in Siri you can pass any information around those multiple like layers so that's Taiko so it's a new project hopefully you can you will have interest to learn to learn more we have 20 Engineers here in in East Tokyo so um Thai colors are you here okay so we have 20 people so find us and I will talk more about tiger and talk about our bounties offline all right thank you thank you Daniel one of the the cool things about these events is that you get to test out things that are just about to become ready and just people are building and researching on and productizing that research so next up we have polygon and without further Ado I'd like to invite Kevin on stage to talk about polygon thank you Jim Jim everyone wow super excited to be here I'm Kevin from the developer relations team from polygon Labs so we build blockchains for Mass adoption while the energy in the building is crazy we're super excited to be in Eve Tokyo right now I just wanted to very quickly go through some of the uh challenges we're issuing to all the uh hackers here today some of the things we want to see you guys build and super excited to see so we have more than 20 000 total in bounties so that's some amazing amazing stuff you want to see from you guys first there's going to be five thousand dollars for the best cross chain hacks with polygon ckvm anything that's cross chain across polygon ckvm polygon POS and also ethereum any interesting use cases would be eligible for this that's also five thousand dollars for the best use of polygon ID uh polygon like this verifiable credentials to preserve user privacy so what we're huge in self-server and identity so really hope to see some interesting use cases using polygon IDE and then there's also five thousand dollars for of course the probably the hottest Topic in the room for sure uh for account extraction or gases transactions there's a couple ways to do it and we love to see some use cases on that front so the best team will be eligible to get five thousand dollars and also we would love to reward our Builders who are essentially building a polygon so as long as you deploy either polygon POS uh or polygon ckvm whether it's testnet meaning it doesn't matter just uh make a treat and you'll be eligible to be have a share of this five thousand dollar post so this is to reward all the builders who are building a polygon super excited and we would love to see uh all kinds of interesting use cases and different different interesting stuff coming out from this hackathon yeah if you need more details we would strongly recommend you to scan this QR code that's going to have some of the examples some ideas maybe uh and the detailed description of all these bounties so good luck we look forward to seeing interesting projects from here thank you thank you Kevin right next up I want to talk about toku and whatever would you please welcome Dominica is yours um uh it's great to be here it's great to see you all here in Tokyo my name is Dom I'm a co-founder of Taco at Taco we work with organizations across the Spectrum from some of the biggest companies that you heard of protocol Labs hedera noses safe to smaller companies and then teams of two and those who are starting just like you guys we make sure that all of our partners and all of our clients legally and compliantly can hire anyone anywhere in the world and can compliantly and legally pay people in tokens pay their team in tokens anywhere in the world we handle all the tax compliance exciting employment laws and token compensation laws in 60 plus jurisdictions globally so that so that Builders can build um you know it's very exciting to be here we actually started the company in Tokyo it's been about two years so it's very special moment to see a lot of other people choosing Tokyo as a as a place to build and I know that a couple of people don't want to leave so I hope that after the hackathon you will you will stay around we are here to help so if there's anything that comes to your mind that that we can help with please feel to reach out we want to make sure that the ecosystem is growing that people are staying compliant um and looking forward to chatting so if you want to reach out we are at taco.com or you can find us on Twitter at use Telco or you can find us at some of our cool events thanks and looking forward to hanging out more uh have fun hacking and gambate [Applause] amazing thank you all right next up I want to talk about Mina and to introduce what Mina is please welcome Mangus GM GM hi everyone my name is Angus and I'm going to tell you about Mino Mina is a ZK L1 blockchain ZK stands for zero knowledge and Mina is built from the ground up using zero knowledge proofs that's cool I've got some good news for you know you can build things with zero knowledge proofs on top of Mino as well with snarky JS it's written in typescript so it makes it easier for developers like you you may have noticed that I am wearing a pickle costume there is a reason for this snarky JS gives you access to the recursion layer of mina which is called pickles so what you can do with that is infinitely recursively prove ZK snarks or or zero knowledge proofs so you can put proofs into proofs into proofs and collapse them all down into one fixed size proof that you can verify quickly so that's really powerful we're looking forward to seeing what you guys are going to come up with uh building over the weekend we've got prizes available eight thousand six thousand and four thousand dollars available for first second and third prize for people who build projects that use nike.js and there's also a two thousand dollar public pool for people who build a project but don't make it into the top three so I also want to tell you today about a program we're running called ZK ignite there's a nice QR code up there that you can scan for more information it's a sort of Grant slash incubator program where you submit a proposal for a project that you want to build there's a kind of fundraising round where community members vote on the projects they want to see funded and then you kind of start with a bunch of other projects and go through the process together you get some funding but you also get Hands-On support mentorship connections with people we really make you part of the amino family so I we've got a new cohort starting in May May the 24th so if you're interested you can scan that QR code or please come and talk to us at the booth I'll be wearing the pickle suit until at least tomorrow morning I don't know how much longer it'll last also thanks very much to everyone from if Global you guys are awesome and yeah happy hacking everyone glhf this is the last slide of mine so thank you I guess that was great maybe I should do this one day and just to see if the crowd is it's gonna listen to me more all right our last partner I want to bring on is World coin and without further Ado want to welcome Miguel to talk to you about worldcoin let's give a big round of applause [Applause] so yeah everyone I'm Miguel I'm here to talk to you about ballcoin and normally I would start this by talking about civil attacks and how they're bad but I feel like everyone kind of knows a story now um rabbit room and also something happened over the past few months which was like all of these AI explosion of us realizing that like maybe the whole like telling humans apart from machines machines is a little bit harder than it seems and that has led to a lot of like really cool and interesting questions um we're gonna run some of those but we do have something called wall ID which is going a little slower than I thought um but basically we built this protocol to anonymously verify that someone is a real human and that they're doing an option only once so this action could be anything from building a Discord Channel minty Nifty bologna governance proposal claiming wall coin tokens that's a thing and the way that this works the way that we power this is we have these orbs you may have seen some of those of those upstairs these orbs use Iris scans and serialized cryptography along with a bunch of other really cool technology that if you're interested in you can contact to us about to basically verify that the person in front of it is a real human and give them uh their wall ID a private key that they can use to generate your knowledge proofs to prove um any of the things that I mentioned uh this works on saying and obtained and it is really really easy to interact this is about all of the code that you actually need to make any uh civil system it's literally five minutes so we have an SDK I give a skip widget you can get this you know it's approved you can verify them until and obtain with taking care of all of the hard stuff for you so you can just get it take care of actually making your app civil assistant making sure you're interacting with humans online and whether you're using this for some nft stuff or some like completely unrelated AI the stuff that you somehow figure out a way to shoehorn into the crypto hackathon you can get it you just like render a QR code on your website username we get scan it with your phone verify phone you know it's your knowledge proof sends it to the website you send it to a contract or something else it's all taken care of for you and as I said before this is really really powerful it has a lot of usage in governance making actual quadratic voting for once social media with all of the cool incentive the lens program and other things have and a bunch of other stuff uh if you want to learn about the other stuff or about the protocol role we have some really cool docs including a use case page with a bunch of ideas on what you can build um and yeah basically you will find all the details about how to build with these story kits example applications all that you need on the docs docs.walking.org and we also have 20K in prices I'm not going to read through all of them because they are in this Global website and also all of you can read but yeah we are excited to see what you can do with it I added this slide when I thought that this uh kickoff was a few hours ago so this already happened but uh you can go to with global.tv and actually see the recording of This Workshop which is even better because you can skip through the volume parts and yeah I'm excited to see what everyone can build with this uh there's a link there welcome.org slash is talking to me three you can just use that to get access to all the resources that I mentioned much more uh yeah come see us at the booth come look for me I'm pretty easy to spot and have fun building thank you so those were some of our amazing partners and one thing that we want to do is obviously talk about all the other prizes that are here I'm going to definitely spend a few minutes covering all of that but before we get into the prizes we want to really take this opportunity while we have a thousand plus of you here in this room to get to know about what this ecosystem means to us and what it means to everybody else that's been in the space for some time I want to focus a lot more on the culture of ethereum and how we think about the future moving forward and how we think about web3 ecosystem and how we would like it to uh the direction we like it to be in and that's all under the theme of the infinite garden and to talk about the culture of ethereum I want to bring on a very special guest ayamiyaguchi who is the executive director of the ethereum foundation to share more about the culture and what this ecosystem means to all of us so please give a big round of applause to Aya okay hello everyone oh wow it's it's already late I know you're tired and I'm going to give a Japanese lesson next 20 minutes just kidding um I'm thrilled to be here at the first theater in hackathon in Tokyo at this scale it is it is very big for Japanese today I'd like to talk about the power of open learning in the infinite Garden I want to share with you how ethereum is revolutionizing the way we learn and grow and how you can be part of the reparation by becoming an infinite teacher and how many of you have heard of this infinite Garden oh okay say thank you so this is a vision we use that at the interim foundation and we're hoping everyone to be part of this infinite garden and I'm going to explain again a little bit about this infinite I came up with the idea inspired by the book by James cross the word infinite is from infinite games as in his book finer and infinite games in a finite game the games ends when someone wins as in normal like sports games and others while in the infinite game we play the game to continue the game with changing rules and players the vision of the infinite Garden has the word infinite from this inspiration as I believe it describes the beautiful culture of lithium at the merge last year for example do you know do you remember the merge do you still remember the merch well I guess we had another uh big milestone yesterday that kind of finished the the Pluto steak work where ethereum finally shifted from proof of work to proof of State last year there were more researchers and developers outside of the ethereum foundation that were involved in the execution of this enormous amount of work all the devs from different client teams work together ethereum understands the importance of client diversity and did you understand that it's more important than having only one big team succeeding that is a perfect example of an infinite game and those who participated were all infinite players are all infinite players so how can you play in an infinite game at this hackathon I understand there are places here supported by great sponsors just who just presented and I think that it's great to motivate people to build but I would like to suggest something new today let me ask you questions please raise your hand if you identify yourself as web3 developer okay thank you please raise your hand if you see yourself as brother a beginner two by three okay thanks for being honest please raise your hand if you think you are new to web3 but have expertise in some specific domains other domains some programming languages security privacy ux okay okay you're very humble please you raise your hand if you are here to learn all right I see almost all this yes so we there are many who are here to learn I'm also here to learn East Global told me that a lot of skilled Web Two developers come here to get into web3 a hackathon is a great place to learn I believe there is something unique about hakadandini theme that makes your learning experience more special because this is also a game that is happening in the infinite Garden I know you will be divided into teams and there applies it but it will be and it would enrich the quality of the game if each player improves their skill by learning they will also be mentors and speakers who will teach you new things but urumbee also be fun if hackers here teach each other wouldn't it be fun if teaching Learning Happens regardless of which team you are in that is an example of an infinite game too so can you be an infinite teacher in this Garden I bet this has been already happening at the ethernet hackathons and that is because I believe ethereum has the culture of open learning ethereum as a platform is an open source project so it is naturally more open being open source makes the project more inclusive and transparent from the learning standpoint anyone can look at the code and learn many different things but what I want to talk about today is about how the culture of learning has evolved in this theme also how the culture of openness is making learning more effective I like to call this open learning and I strongly believe this is an important part of the infinite Garden for example there are multiple Dev tools that have been built by community members and are widely used and some of them are built for learners scaffold it how many of you know scaffoldiers oh wow a lot of a lot of awesome yes [Music] it gives you instructions on how to build an ethereum step by step our dear friend Austin Griffiths are you here is there yes but this originally for himself still on board devs that are new to web3 and he started offering speedland which is he he provides a class where he goes through each separate step together with a new learner now there are many debts to learn with this tutorial what is interesting is those who learned through it became more interested in building learning tools for others to learn so Austin and his people started build Guild a community of Builders were building learning tutorials there are a lot of Stories on how ethereum learns but I would like to use this community as an example so it is easier for you to see the open learning culture the first story from this community is about an open learner an infinite teacher Chef I also heard he is here I hope he is here somewhere he learned um he learned with scaffoldiers like one of those people who learned through it and now he is building scaffold it too how amazing is this yay it's like I think it's people really tired oh yes he's here okay he's here so you can hear uh the story from him I'd love to actually also hear the story from YouTube awesome and another great story from this build community is where a builder from that Community learned from another open learning community Calvin from built Guild went to the Xerox Park Community a community facilitated by the Xerox Park Foundation now that is not only supporting different applied GK project but also helping people to learn about ZK he then came back to the girl and built a three-part series to teach the next Builders how to use a DK circuit with a smart contract and what is crazy is Austin the original teacher said almost 90 percent of what he knows about zika apps are from him using these tutorials made by Calvin I used to be a high school teacher and I have seen maximized learning experiences when a teacher lets the student become a mini teacher but the power of open learning in the same Community is even more than that one teacher does not teach everyone that he they teach their students how to teach and they become the teachers and good teachers also learn from their students by keeping learning tools open we can have all different types of learning tools and you are more likely to find something that that fits your level and learning style going back to open learning hackathons I believe hackathon represent the open learning culture of the Italian Community why because you are here to learn and teach you're not here to make a perfectly complete project within three days the project might be a startup something important in the future but the most important part of these three days is that you get to learn something you did not know before and to share what you already know with others the knowledge that you gain and give well lipo outwards into the future and might help others on a similar Journey so let's think about how you actually learn then here first by making mistakes I believe true learning can only come from having experience you can read a book and stuff online to gain knowledge but you do not leave return until you try it yourself and the best way to learn is by making mistakes I know this is a very tough one for Japanese people as fishery I also have suffered myself by being trained to be perfect if you're a Developers you probably have experienced the importance of making mistakes ethereum's protocol design also had this experience many times initial shouting and proof of stake designs were attempted to be implemented within smart contracts only when the researchers got into the architecture they discovered the limitations in efficiency and expressivity of those system level contracts when Dany Ryan shared this story with me he said that throwing away 6 to 12 months of work is always coupled with immense learning it informs not only the immediate next item but research and design on project for years to come the beauty of a hackathon is that you will not be punished by making mistakes so make lots of mistakes and believe that is only helping your learning next you learn by working in a team obviously building something by yourself and building something in the team are very different experiences here some of you will work with people you've met for the first time each person I believe offers very different values to the team decisions are not easy to make when working in a team but that is why the learning is stronger you learn more when you need to balance multiple perspectives you see from all the dowels up there and how hard it is to have a good decision making system even with the additional support with technology there will be more than 200 teams made out of all hackers here so if East Grove I'll combined all the earnings from teams at all the hackathon they will have probably a great data set for that research soon yes yeah okay and lastly you will definitely learn from the experienced mentors experts there are many amazing experts here you know depending on your interest like some sponsors also presented their expertise uh from yeah for example Peter Marius and some others from the guest team are here you have an obstruction team is here Austin I just said he is out there but he also his people from build community are here too so you should definitely talk to them they are expert in in being a teacher and as well as other mentors that are here to support you do not forget though that you as a hacker can be a teacher because everyone has a unique expertise skills and even personality that may Inspire others and with the spirit of open learning of ethereum allow me to try to to try and experiment through this hackathon this is this is like a new thing we are trying we want to ask you to let us know about your learning experiences here and let us know who was your best teacher they can be mentors and speakers here other Hackers from your team or other teams working towards the same classes I would like to call them infinite teachers in the infinite Garden the ethereum foundation will try to share the outcome in some way to recognize infinite teachers the learning does not have to be technical learning you could receive some amazing wisdom to cope with the pressure or stress of this happen or how to maximize your focus even if you're new to the community you can already be an infinite teacher too as well as we all come with the wealth of experience and knowledge that influences how we collaborate to solve problems here's how you can help please save this on your phone and answer the survey that asks who is your infinite teacher submitted by the Ender back then end of Sunday by participating in this survey you will receive and I learned from an infinite teacher nft that's designed by our designers and um and then we also have the EF booth so you can if you have questions you can ask questions there too as another message from me this is the last one I also like to encourage you to challenge yourself to write something a little bit out of outside of your comfort zone there are many Japanese hackers here today who are locals here okay okay uh yeah I heard like 40 of hackers here are workouts which is uh the size of hackathons are very rare in Japan so 40 is pretty impressive um how many then okay like how many people here non-japanese feel have a connection to Japan do you like anything of Egypt about Japan you raised hand most quickly what do you like about Japan yes culture language do you speak Nyong'o so this yes I actually I'm always impressed how many people actually uh are interested in learning Japanese because I don't know how useful it is um and then I even within the ethereum foundation we have actually have quite a number of people who can speak Japanese which is surprising I always wonder where do you use it but anyway um you know some people might like food ninja Nintendo anime um so there are things that Japan can be part of it seems like but I know one thing that Japanese people tend not to be good at they are not good at telling you what they're good at we Japanese are trained not to do that from the very early time of our childhood Japanese people here may not call themselves an expert forever however if you find Japanese hackers tonight I encourage you to invite one or two of them to your team if you find someone who has a background very different from yours I encourage you to invite them like whether they're Japanese or not the reason why I think it's a that's a good idea first in the case of Japanese you might discover some subtle talents something that others do not have for example by being born and raised in the country I was trained to drop intuition um you know the English expression read between the lines in Japan reading between the lines are is is very very basic we have an expression called read the air you have to read something when there are not even lines or words and that is considered as a common sense so gradually you become very good at reading people's mind and things around them this is also the reason why they can be good team players next uh what other Japanese or not there are many studies that discover that more diversity leads to more creativity one study tested college students creativity at the beginning and the end of the semester they found that students who had dated someone from another country become more creative have you experienced this week there are people who are raising their hand you said no you okay so um you can't help like if you have experienced this you can't help but reflect on different circumstances that have helped shape the other person's views and by looking from different perspectives you end up developing creativity you also take things less personally when you know that blockers are due to different backgrounds so of course I'm not only talking about Japanese as they're more diverse set of backgrounds here I love to see mixed diverse teams during this hackathon if you have not teamed up yet it would be great if you find new friends and build a team with people with different backgrounds that is it uh to summarize my two key points today open learning opportunity uh find your infinite teacher please scan this ql and save it and let us know who was your infinite teacher and diversity in your team for creativity thank you very much and hope you have a great learning time happy hacking everyone no marigato thank you thank you so much it's a really important and amazing message and uh and that's exactly how this entire Community is set up one thing that uh surprises us but also something we're very happy about is the fact that most of the mentors that we get for youth global hackathons used to be previous hackers they get to see the joy and how they can contribute more into the secret system and get hundreds and thousands more people to be part of this space and stay in this space and that is the actual Network effect that if Global has which is it inspires more people to contribute and give back to the community whether it's through being a partner or being a mentor or even volunteering and this message and the way this whole Community plays an infinite game is how we get to be even bigger as a ecosystem so thank you so much Aya for those amazing thoughts and the last thing I'll do is talk about all the prizes that a lot of you've been waiting for so let's get right into it 50 million yen in prizes that's over 375 000 of money being given away just this weekend from all of our amazing Partners so let's talk about

will be receiving 2500 for the first place and one thousand for second place and the most fun bounty and the most protocol economic related hacks will receive one thousand dollars each then we have polygon you already talked I saw a lot of the prices from polygon but just repeat them the best cross chain ZK evm hack will receive five thousand dollars the best project that uses polygon ID will also receive five thousand the best public goods leveraging account abstraction will be receiving five thousand dollars as well and there's a full prize of five thousand dollars for polygon which means that any project that deploys on polygon whether it's the ZK VM or on ID or just on mainnet we'll be splitting five thousand dollars equally next up we have Mina so the best ZK apps built on snarky JS will be receiving eight thousand dollars for the first prize 6004 second place and four thousand for third place and there's also a pool price which means as long as you experiment with snarky JS and build something and deploy something on top of this CK protocol or this SDK you will be splitting two thousand dollars equally then we have World coin so the best overall hack on
