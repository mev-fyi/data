hey okay welcome everybody to the hacc file system hosted by eath global we're going to get started right now um so this event had 650 hackers from 61 different countries in 18 different time zones and the way we're going to judge today is four minutes for a demo three minutes for questions with the judges and a 10-minute break every six to eight teams um and the criteria is pretty simple we're going to be judging on technicality originality practicality the ui design and the wow factor of course i'm just noting that this is not a competition we're just here to learn and to explore what is possible and we're not aiming to we're not aiming to become businesses and hackers are here to get feedback from the judges um now i'd like to introduce bernard and emmanuel as our wonderful judges um they will be giving you feedback today and if the first team is ready we can go ahead and get started hey mike we don't have audio would you mind sharing that again the value of an nft is derived from its unique story that story includes how the token was minted press about the artist or team trading and on-chain info certifications related items and a lot more but right now there isn't a way to provably tile of that data to the token that's what fungi proof is here to solve fungi proof is a grading and enrichments platform for the metaverse that enables nft collectors and creators to aggregate and show off everything about their token that makes it stand out from the rest it does this through a user-friendly experience that lets anyone upgrade customize and continue interacting with their nfts long after they've been minted over the last few weeks our team has combined many of the amazing platforms and technologies involved with hackifest to create our first functioning prototype for nft enriching let's check it out the initial screen for the enrichments demo is an nft wallet dashboard the demo is built on top of the mumbai polygon testnet so first i'll connect the wallet to the mumbai network and connect to the dap once connected the wallets nfts are retrieved from the covalent api and cached into a textile threaddb collection all the tokens displayed in the wallet were custom built for this demo and minted on mumbai clicking on a token grades the token if it hasn't already been created and takes you to the token's profile the profile view displays the token's grade the token's image wrapped in a paper case enrichments which are available for purchase and the token's event history once the token's been graded owners can encase their token encasing a token places all the tokens data into a ceramic registry file and ensures the information about this token will never be lost in case tokens can further be enriched in this demo we've implemented the ability to upgrade a token's grade by backing up its assets directly to filecoin and tying that back up to the original nft through an enrichment contract once enrichments have been applied to a token we can view all the tokens data the data includes the hash to the token the token's registry file its grade including all of its upgrades and all of its associated enrichments we display the event change log containing all the events that have occurred to this nft this event log is made possible by querying all the ceramic commits made to the nft's profile and outputting the change in timestamp that occurred for each commit lastly i'm going to talk a bit more about the tech we built that powers this dap the first is a new contract standard we're calling a non-fungible enrichment nfes are an extended erc 1155 where the 1155 token can be bound to another nft once bound the owner relinquishes control over the token and gives it to another nft the second is our ceramic registry the registry acts as an nft index where nfts are stored using their did as the key and associated ceramic tile for each nft's profile the entire registry in each nft is pinned and once it's available it'll be archived to filecoin to ensure the data persists in addition we plan to use the nft did provider in the future to enable the nft's profile to be editable only by the nft owner for our data backup upgrade we combine the power of web3.storage and our non-fungible enrichment to create a backup for nfts which is immutable and provable we believe this functionality is critical for the nft space to prevent lost nft assets and rug poles thank you so much we'll be moving on to the q a and feedback with the judges all right well uh i guess i'll just shooting a great this looks awesome this is obviously a very relevant topic uh you talked a little bit about new standard and uh how you tie that to the nft can you elaborate a little bit on that and how you see that standard being adopted by others sure yeah so the idea is that we basically can take an 1155 nft and be able to mint various different types of items things and we're starting out specifically with cases and then the backup to kind of prove the concept but the way that it works is it starts out as a regular 1155 and then we added an enrichment method and a couple other methods to the contract when you call the enrichment method you pass in an another nft so probably like a 721 for example or another 1155 as long as it's non-fungible and then when you pass in that nft it binds it to that nft as the parent and then it actually burns it for the original owner so the idea is that the owner of that non-fungible enrichment is then the nft as opposed to the personal wallet address i think i could definitely see it being adopted by other platforms especially gaming platforms or other marketplaces and you know we could we could see the ability to tie all sorts of external information and certifications or you know really any relevant information about an nft to an existing nft um and it's just something we don't see or we haven't seen yet so i think it could be really useful or helpful for the space yeah very cool thank you amazing one guys i think it's really interesting for me to see that you walked across some like very extended time zones and i would say kudos to you on that for pulling this off good one guys good one awesome thank you so much um we'll now be moving on to team mdtp you're ready to present please share your screen all right sounds um this is our presentation on mdtp so our team is comprised of myself and christian both long-term friends and crypto enthusiasts right our inspiration for the hackathon is million dollar homepage.com it was created in 2005 essentially as a virtual ad board where the creator sold one million pixels for one dollar each in 10 by 10 pixel blocks it went viral at the time was a huge success however the internet has come a long way since and so earlier in this year during the f global nft hack the idea for million dollar tokenpage.com was born which for brevity we're now calling mdtp here we represent the ten thousand ten by ten pixel blocks with ten thousand erc721 nfts which can be bought sold and traded through open seas marketplace as with any other entity owning an nft then allows you to update its image and content on this large content board as often as you like our vision is for mdtp to be a long lasting project that takes on a life of its own through the community we want to support the site for as long as possible until one day ideally outlives even us for this to happen we need to decouple as much of the site from our servers as possible mdtp is primarily a front-end and blockchain based app however we have our own backend for performance reasons such as caching the content data up until now we've also kept much of this data in our own s3 buckets but in this hackathon we've made it such that all our content is now stored on ipfs we've uploaded both the nft metadata and the grid's default data to ipfs and pinned this using infuria meanwhile for all user uploaded content we're now making use of the web3.storage library to send it over to ipfs2 so enough chit chat let me run you through a demo right our basic motto is interact trade and share as you interact with the site you can select token and view its content on the side panel you can then mint new ones or bid on those that have already been sold and update any that you own and through our handy little menu here it's super easy to learn more about the project to share it or join our community channels so i'll run you through an example of minting which is what most new users will do remembering that we're still in beta on and running on wrinkleb so to begin with you can select any token um and that's yet to be taken such as this one and then i can select mint and either mint a single one or minter group minting is as simple as just submitting this transaction but i'm actually not going to do that because i don't want to wait for the transactions to go through instead i'll just jump down here where i've already minted a group of tokens to and set them to jay-z's crypto punk updating them into tokens is then dead simple you just fill in the fields that will show up here in a sec um the title the description here we go the title the description i'm going to set the height and width to all nine tokens change it to keeping it real with f global upload the image just to make sure it's the right one and select update and we'll have the transaction go through now all this content data will be uploaded to ipfs through the web3.storage library and our backend will simply cache it in the background while we're waiting for that to happen i'll just roam around a little so that you can see other things that we've got on the site so far it's mainly f global projects and oh okay and if i go to the token you can see there it's updated keeping it real with global right so now that you've seen the demo you can see that the site is almost finished we're working on some final touches and hope to launch your mainnet by the end of the month our key focus now is really on building community and considering we're both devs there's quite a learning curve here but our goal is to make a long-lasting and vibrant community and we're certain then time will get there take note that what you've seen is just the start we're hoping that the community will actually do all sorts of creative and exciting things with this virtual content space and we'll continually adapt and build tools for their ever evolving needs so yes thank you for listening please follow us on twitter jump into our discord channels and try out our current beta by simply visiting the site remembering that it's on rinkerby we're giving out free nfts for those who mint now while we're in beta so please jump in now and invite your friends and followers thank you all right we'll be moving on to the judges feedback thank you very much mdtp thank you man while you go first this time yeah um i was hoping you would have a question for axe because um i just want to confirm that you mentioned you started building this as um the nfps the end of this hack right okay great just that a great ui by the way amazing impressive yeah it's actually the ui has been the majority of our problems uh the the nft stuff is relatively straightforward oh okay great great great all right very cool guys this is awesome um i've been a big fan of the original so uh uh i think you're doing an amiable job of uh approximating it if not exceeding it which in it by itself is an awesome feat question for you guys how do you see this project going on as a community project for example to change to to make multiples to have dao is basically create new virtual spaces based on your contribution yeah take off from there very cool actually this is one of the things we discussed the most internally with me and nasra um and what we're starting what we're hoping to start with is like a space for nft owners to to show off their nfts right so there's a lot of these new animal based uh um my favorite one is the camel so far and the animal based ones so then hopefully we're hoping to create a dao around that right so like once the tokens are taken up then we as a group decide like what features we want to add and like what the direction is next i think one of our strong thesis is like the nfc world at the moment is this kind of like collectible and artwork there's like two two things happening but as time goes forward it will be very much like we see it going into many more um kind of real world use cases and how that reflects onto here i think is something we can't predict so really the answer is i don't know but the answer is very much to make it a part off the of the ownership of a token which is why one of the reasons that we're where we we are quite limiting on how many times people can mint how many services people can make and how much you can own within a block like we want there to be lots of ownership and lots of ideally different types of projects on there so that uh it takes an interesting direction rather than just you know just being collectibles but that is where we want to start very cool very cool i'm gonna keep following the project for sure very well done thank you very cool thank you all right thank you so much we'll be moving on to team nifty if you are ready to present please share your screen nifty is a geolocation media anchoring dab leave favorite memories in emotionally triggered locations digitize your tying capsule to future loved ones to one cover graffiti your name your favorite print for others to mesmerize let the physical world be your showroom it's where pokemon go meets facebook with nifty you can explore a digital layer on top of the physical world around you it's a decentralized application where you can explore the metaverse of creators mapping their digital content art or media to physical locations by way of gps coordinates for digital creators the application will allow them to clean a gps coordinate and imprint their favorite media it's like graffiti but for digital content but unlike graffiti it's a clean way to express oneself and unlike graffiti you can sell buy or market the content earn an audience likes views and clicks and monetize these statistics by receiving a share of advertisement revenue for digital billboards placed in close proximity for consumers nifty will be a physical media platform where entertainment means traveling with friends and strangers to discover new content and a place to earn and speculate on nft treasures it's decentralized and sensor resistant nifty is built using decentralized technologies so that no one party can hold a claim to the infrastructure and content nifty allows creators to make digital content as nfts through user smart contracts the digital content is forever stored on ipfs by way of nft storage the geolocation gps coordinate layer is stored on ceramic for geography proximity mapping and filtering fluence is used as the compute layer superfluid finance will be used to rent billboards here's a short demo of the front-end application built with react to use the application you will need location services turned on we'll see three views explore feed and mint explorer is where you see all the entities around you feed is where you see the actual content of those nfts around you and you can also interact with the content uh view other details descriptions and titles then you have the mint view where you can mint a token right now we're minting with metamask wallet in the covalent network what happens in the back end is that the image is first stored on nft.storage then the nft is actually is mint using the uri of nft dot storage in the covalent test net which is going to be polygon next then after that ceramic is holding the gps location and then we'll use fluence to retrieve that gps data so that we can map it in our explore function and also retrieve that feed content as well thank you okay we'll now be moving on to the judge's feedback thank you very much very cool interesting super interesting project i got a question for you explain to me a little bit how do how that billboard rent the rental it's gonna work you're new mike can you hear me now yeah sorry about that uh the the rental is still on uh uh i still thinking about that but it's gonna be uh with superfluid finance i think um the way it would be basically the uh what i think is the advertisers would choose the location where they want their um their their advertisements to be placed they're able to replace uh they'll be able to see the statistics on the entities around so they'll be able to place their statistics in a gps location they uh will mint that uh woman to nft for them and then as long as they pay their uh what's called their cash flow on the continuous basis then they'll hold that spot then from there um once that cash was paid out to the application then the application will distribute those funds to the nft holders in the surrounding area as well does that answer your question oh yeah absolutely very very cool so so that's just that's the potential of the project moving towards yes very cool okay gotcha awesome very cool thank you thank you yeah i think the only thing i want to add is pretty impressive that you pull this off during the course of the hackathon and uh kudos on that great work on this man thank you and you heard me checking my doors here to see if this was real those are opening and closing oh sorry no it's fine i'm just saying from the demo video there was the sound of closing and opening doors oh yeah no uh yeah sorry about that uh yeah it's just fine man it's great yeah great job man great job thank you yeah thank you so much nifty we'll now be moving on to team 2c publisher if you're ready please present okay sounds good yes we can hear you okay so let's get started welcome to bio publisher bring your own front end and publish it political regulations and censorship have no power here or at least this is what we want to believe truth is our beloved web 3 ecosystem has serious blind spots in regard to true censorship resistance interacting with the blockchain is not a trivial task that's why why we are putting all efforts to bring great user experience through our front-end applications however a big part of the architecture of many dapps requires traditional web 2 centralized solutions this is potentially a problem that could affect thousands of users if a restriction policy is deployed this is bad news but there is still hope my name is alfredo and it's an honor to present you the bio publisher theme confirmed by alonso vargas roy rivera and alvaro grant a team of costa ricans who want to make the web a better place for all of us where no one can harm our right to participate in it inspired by web3 storage and ceramic idx we design a concept that allows the user to upload their front-end and dab files to ipfs making them available to everyone everywhere but at the same time giving them the capability of being signed by a trusted demo developers with bio publisher you can use your own user interface to interact with any smart contract out there by using web3 storage platform to host the static files of adapt for this hackathon we built a proper concept for file uploaded functionality so users are able to upload and check the information of their dabs in an easy way making them ready to be verified by any identity management system such as ceramic idx in the future bio publisher is intended to be part of a suite of scripts that will allow the users to securely identify any published tab by a trusted network making it easier to choose which tab is a good fit for them for any inquiries feel free to contact us at hello at 2c.io thanks for your attention thank you very much we'll now be moving on to the feedback portion ben you can go first please okay uh very interesting very interesting approach i really like that uh uh taking the blind spot out of web3 that's very much needed can you expand a little bit on uh on you sort of get how you get the interface bindings to all these different smart contracts okay so right now we are leveraging the web3 storage to communicate with to fpfs and that is happening via the corresponding api that is being integrated into the front end to by creating an extra layer the to make sure that we can save the metadata accordingly and that by itself it sounds like a file uploading tool but the purpose is to integrate with another um solution that would make sure that we can get a trusted resource based on on using idea ceramic and graphs okay uh sorry so so how do you how do you get the uh i'm just so interested how do you get the the trust that the saved interface is actually the appropriate interface okay so right now this part is part of the of the next steps the future uh projects but yeah right now uh the purpose is that we will then have uh like a using the idx and ceramic um have an another solution that will be presented by another team so that we can have trusted groups based on um on the on the different brands each user it belongs to a specific group and that group will be then select the furnace that is secure so basically a way to make sure that the front end that we are presenting is is secure enough and we can once it deploy yeah it's it's that's it thank you yeah i think really for me just to confirm that you've been working on this um for a very long time now like giving just beauties for the hackathon only right sorry you can't repeat the question you've been working on this for a while now right yeah we have to work in this great great great work man pretty impressive well done thank you hello everyone let me share my screen hello everyone so today i'll be presenting caravan.org a modern scientific publishing platform based on ipfs so about the team i'm hugo rocelle a french cyber security student based in luzan and solo team since all my friends were implications um so since i'm about to graduate i spent a lot of time on archive.org this summer and i realized that it was platform that had a lot of problems so first off as a little bit of context archive.org is a major player with 1.2 million visitors a day top 2 300 websites but with centralized servers and a review process that is non-transparent there are also concerns about censorship so i put two articles here um nicola jason from university of geneva wondering about whether students were being blacklisted from the platform and also a personal story by friend joseph stone the whole press cleaner in physics whose article was kept in review for too long and then misclassified so as a solution i present kaibab.org we where we can host paper on ipfs so we inherit all the very nice properties of ipfs like called resistance and everything and the review process is community based a bit like wikipedia with funds with staking funds for civil resistance and things like cooperative funding to avoid people with too much capital being able to vote too much and also potential for experiments in new forms of scientific funding using nfcs for example so what has been done during this circuit uh parse the scientific taxonomy and create a modern web application so the interface is 30 year old so it was not that hard to create something a bit more enjoyable to browse um so upload 1.9 million metadata of articles on ipfs and index them correctly to display them on the website and download all the scientific papers starting from 2000 to 2012 and being slowly uploaded to ipfs and an experimental feature made to paper so what's next uh i grossly underestimated the time that it takes to upload uh more or less one terabyte of data of source and pdf files for dfs my connection was bad at the summer and one had a better connection it was already too late to do it in time um we should define and deploy community-based reviewing process and improve the web application so let's jump right into the demo here you can see that we have the taxonomy clearly laid out so let's take a look at computer science for example photography and security here you have a little explanation of the category and then you have the recent articles that were appeared so you can expand as a pragmatic solution since not all the papers are uploaded on ipfs you can check them out on archive for now and you can browse by year and by date quite easily so in conclusion the application is itself hosted on ipfs for fleek you can visit today at caribat.org my github is here stars and prs are welcome it's a difficult problem i would gladly welcome some help thanks a lot all right we'll be opening it up for questions with the judges and feedback yeah i mean just feedback yeah super intrigued by the sleek ui right um that's just it from this end really really impressive i'm really grateful that you focus on the simple stuff and just made it very beautiful and i'm a fan of tailwind as well so great choice using that thanks a very interesting project uh obviously uh very relevant these days so i got a question for you right now as you're setting this all up you're in the mode of basically you're sucking in all this data but ideally you'd also be like the pusher outer right i mean eventually you want to be the decentralized distributor how and how how do you see that like how do you see this going forward so i think what should be done is basically you have one thing that follows archive and the pre-print platform that exists today and one that is community-based so you have like community-based paper and official paper so on the community based paper you can vote and you have like this wikipedia-like process to a vote a bit like reddit you can vote down vote with different so all of this is quite a complex thing with like game theory behind it and everything but you could have this review process done by the community and you could have this community paper and then it's cool to have this platform where you can discover papers before they are even in preprints which is which is nice and but the the everything it should have like the normal one like official and community one leveled like this is a community paper we don't know the quality it might be something erroneous and uh yeah very cool very cool project thank you that's awesome thanks okay right we'll now be beginning our 10 minute break we'll be back very shortly thank you okay so we'll now be resuming our session judges when you are ready um and also enter a protocol when you are ready please start sharing your screen but i would like to confirm with both judges see if they are ready to begin again okay looks like it you could go ahead great yeah i'm sorry if my sound of the video is a bit quiet i recorded when my son was sleeping so let's shut up for a protocol a place to request and brainstorm for nfts that don't actually exist yet how it works is you you have a person in mind who you'd like to ask for an nft from them just enter their name look up a person on twitter or instagram select the person then we run a credit check powered by covalent protocol you can see that i have 50 usd and i have some wrapped heath and dye this is the maximum amount i can pledge for an lft i don't actually lock up any money at this point we wait for the creator to come back verify their identity upload their preview and then everyone can actually lock up the money that they they'd like to pay for an nft so what i do is i go continue and this is the place where i enter text the request i would like to ask from a person and uh token where this request will be based based on i'm going to enter 0.01 of if here we have a rewards table this shows you that if the nft sales on the sales later on an open auction for higher amount than you pledged the person who pledged in various places here will get a reward so if the sale is above one thousand um for example one thousand dollars in an auction the person who plays the highest will get 125 dollars and this is for the higher amounts so i can submit a transaction and actually everyone who pledged would get a part of the reward after the final sale the highest pledge will actually get an nft if the nft fails to sell in an open auction so let's open the transaction now prove it in mid meta mask and after it gets confirmed it should be shown in the list here final stage looks users can go to each page share it and other users can add to the pledge which creates that baseline price and gives them the rewards so how is this implemented so we have a front-end application that has a credit check with covalent on the front end there's additional credit check on each transaction via a chain link api oracle to covalent because we check the 24 hour price ago for your credit so that we make sure that the user didn't just get a flash loan to cheat the system then from the dub we we call file coin through web3 storage to store immutable content of the actual request the textual content as json and then we have a sub graph of the events emitted from contract that we use to populate the front end that's about it this is ventura protocol thank you all right judges you could go ahead with your feedback thank you very much bennett do you know go fast sure sure all right uh very very very nice uh this is this is clearly this is the the nfc is the theme of the year so this is it's cool to see still individual valuable variations on that theme so that's fun by itself i have a question for you as you do you have a way to curate requests because i mean requests could be just like all over the place right and then it gets very fragmented so how do you curate or funnel that yeah so um the protocol itself will be kind of unsensitive but there will be a lot of bad content i imagine people will submit because it's so cheap to on polygon the transaction costs a low so people will spam it and things like that so curation is difficult but i guess we could sort by amount of pledges based on that idea indicating that many people think the idea is cool and we can sort by that and only show that content from that will be basically moderated but the protocol shouldn't be because it's a protocol so each whoever builds their front end will have to moderate it in some way cool i like it thanks yeah okay i mean you uh well i'll just say the big ops on using the covalent api right and uh yeah really proud of you for doing that and you do know you could um you know pass the data to the front end using the nft's metadata endpoint yeah and then um using a bunch of um our nfc endpoints i do know but at this at this stage nft does not yet exist so we we could create a nft for representing the non-existent it's just representing the idea i guess but um so it's kind of that pre-stage it it's inspired by previous project in hakmani which was irrevocable and they have this idea of backing at the auction with some base price where the if auction doesn't sell the base price will be paid to the creator but i would say about covalent fantastic up api um especially the 24-hour balance we found we found really useful because actually and also cross-chain credit check so imagine your own polygon and you want to pledge a huge amount or for a for an idea but you want to use your balance from the main chain not to lock up but just as a credit check so to say you have the money to pay if the nft is made so covalent just across all chains can just build up that credit check and be able to basically say yeah this is like a whale or this this person will be able to pay this so the creator knows oh i can actually produce an nft now because there's somebody interested so amazon man i mean shameless floor big ups on using corvillen good one thank you yeah thank you very much ventura protocol we'll now i'll be moving on to team sdtd or sttt sorry about that hello we would like to present you uh our project trenton me and brahma did it's about certific certification of impang impact and retroactive funding i will share a video on my screen hi everyone my name is trenton gaddis and i am the founder of digital discrimination out of singapore so for this hackathon what we focused on was certification of impact so businesses are typically well funded uh for things that you know have value right however what's not so easy to fund are r d uh efforts and so what we're trying to do with the certification of impact is to fund you know good work that's already been done and document this with a nft using the zora framework minted on ipfs um to open payment channels using superfluids erc777 standard well integrated with ceramics digital identity solution brahma will talk more about our demo thanks hi welcome to certificates of impact certificates of impact is about funding for research and r d after the fact after the work has been completed the idea here is to propagate goods that has been done by showcasing the good work done by creating the nfts for the good work done and then maybe you open a auction house or make it high quality such that we attract people create a community and flourish the good work being done so what we have done is we have already created some nfts for this particular account as a representation of good working done and these are all the ones i just loaded this particular one just four minutes back we can we are using jorah ipfps flick to load the nfts into the system we have not implemented the auction house yet but so we can add certifications if we want we can and then we can select a file and then i can just mean that to create that energies now if somebody somebody were to fund this particular project so we can go to retroactive funding now i already have created a funding so that's why you see the flow from the sender to from this address to the 509 address that i'm logged in right now if i enter the address for the user that i'm logged in so this is basically coming back the certification is coming back that we just loaded now i go back to the retroactive funding again this is the energy just got loaded so if i go to retroactive funding again i will show the reward for which this let's say suppose this funding gets done we can also see the flow from super fluid dashboard as you can see here for this account is showing one dollar per month as a token now also we can show the user profile that we are using using ceramics that will show the person's did decentralize identifier any other profile information that we can maintain we can update that information as well so in nutshell this is about creating nfts for a good work done using jorah ipfs flick graph and then maintaining the user profile the good work done in the ceramics and being able to point through super glory thank you thank you so now we'll be moving on to any feedback from the judges and questions you know you can't go fast all right all right okay let's just go with it uh thanks that's great great presentation loved it um i got a question on decentralized identities and how you plan on using the ceramic did to integrate it in your overall self-sovereign identity framework or while you're looking for the unmute button uh yeah sorry how does it bubble up how does it bubble up um i think uh trenton are you there ah it's all on you this is his part the the i think it's better trenton can you hear me yeah yeah now we hear you now okay um so what we plan on doing is integrating a ceramics digital identity solution with d fly uh platforms like yearn.finance and badger down because i think it's quite clear that kyc is definitely coming to dfi and so we plan on ultimately using you know providers such as civic or perhaps another platform to the kyc so we're looking to provide a comprehensive solution uh for self-sovereign identity gotcha thank you really impressive um i just took a brief time to look at your source code here and i would say really great what you could accomplish given the limited period of time really really impressive work thank you thank you all right if the judges have no more further questions we're moving on to team filament finance if you're ready please share your screen hi i'm going to try sharing my screen hi welcome to filming money had gone digital people began storing their cash in their own wallets and managing their investments themselves and don't worry about it for mortgages transactions using super history possibilities metadata so i should explain that originally i had a teammate on this project who was going to be doing the technical stuff but unfortunately he had to bail so i continued solo and i'm just presenting thinking there's no code to look at yeah i mean i i did notice that when i took um a look at the user story i mean it's pretty impressive giving um the proof of concept and what you are trying to achieve with this and i would say really kudos to that for um making the effort and you know making me to the presentation at the end of it thanks yeah definitely and very ambitious so that's good i like ambitious that that drives things forward uh how do you see the implementation happening though like uh i mean not just from a teammate perspective but where do you see yourself sit in terms of a a back end from a blockchain for example well we we envisioned uh a future where banking is all done via cryptocurrency and that means you would have a banking app which is basically a crypto wallet and when we considered that we ran into a number of uh a number of issues including uh kyc and we also had this experience with nfts this is definitely the summer of nfts and we realized that we could reuse what we did during hack money and solve this problem of the the future payments but in terms of implementation it's uh it's a lot of work that has yet to happen great thank you thanks yeah thanks again good work okay so we'll be moving on sorry we'll be moving on to the next team um just sit tight as i get the link from one of the team members to present i'll be drawn right he's you juan he's already here with us yeah are you there by any chance i wasn't notified at all that we had to share your video but we can always do that right here right now let me share the screen and i would play it it was a little bit low on volume but let's give it a try okay hi cool okay i want what hello my is called dx aggregate this name what i want to address well i want to address market data prices usually market data prices are getting from centralized sources such as bloomberg and you need to pay for a data maintainer that gets the data and provides that to you a possible enhancement for this issue is while trying to get this into a decentralized into this decentralized ecosystem sort that into ipfs or some service or you can get that more easily what is it will uh well i created a compulsable price aggregator with using fluence and ceramic so it's a service that gets the data reads data from the market processes creating a market data bars and stores that into ceramics let me show you a little bit how this works well here we have i have to space this into the screen here we have before running this test i was not able to play yet because some issues but i want to show you this how this works um here we have a bar we have high is 300 300 here we have a test that will run which caps a new price push that into the processing service which is running in the fluent smartphone after this we have a new volume into the ceramic stream that has the new high and close which are the future steps for this well right now this service can be split into smaller services because it's a service that performs all the data processing also i cannot add more data cleaning uh function all we do have a dependency on ceramic client because i need to install that into all the nodes that runs this so that's another room for investment to simplify deployment and we can create a custom stream slide thank you very much was a pleasure bye sorry hey yeah not singing hello yeah we are here yeah i i can't share the video i don't know why it seems that the part of the screen didn't go out in the video ah that's okay um thank you very much um if you have no further comments we'll be moving on to the judge's q a and feedback sure all right i'll go first uh uh nice very nice work quan i got a question for you when you said you can split things up into more streams on the price data how would it actually work like how would you have like one ceramic stream for each price feed or would you have like one ceramic stream for all the price feeds and it's just within the document that's a great question because honestly you would probably need one per instrument or an exchange probably because the more granular you have that you would probably be able to reuse it more efficiently those the streams tends to generate a huge amount of data so then you can rejoin them if you have them separate so i would rather have one stream per instrument and exchange and so i can then reuse that easily cool very cool thank you yeah i mean thank you thank you for explaining that because i wanted to understand that as well i'm really impressed with the project it's so um i think we would have loved to see the demo too as well but it's fine i guess yeah sorry for the terrible demo let let me know yeah it's fine i mean the source code is there i can always get to running locally so good work impressive work man okay thank you very much thank you thank you much more good work thanks thank you very much we'll now be moving on to team nf trail if you're ready please present please share your screen yes can you see it okay uh there's just to be some kind of audio please because i can't hear anything hi you can't you can't see the audio oh sorry i have to i guess i have to reshare classic oh yeah i'll stall three time and yes okay so uncheck now when trading physical assets such as cars reader state or artwork on the secondary market buyers often face different types of in transparencies and information asymmetries nftrail tries to fix this by creating an on-chain document tray for these types of assets this consists of minting an nft for an asset using a unique asset id verifying this asset id using an external data source oracle and loading external data based on this asset id and then after minting letting the owner upload and attach documents to his token this can then later be used by anyone to verify all different kinds of asset properties and can be used to support all kinds of transactions generally this applies to all different types of assets but for now we're going to focus on the vehicles use case vehicles are particularly good use case because the used car market is a real textbook case for information asymmetry and adverse selection also for vehicles we have the vehicle identification number finn which is a globally unique and standardized asset id which we can verify using public apis and even decode to retrieve weaker data now i will show a demo based on this use case if you open the application you are able to register a new vehicle using the vehicle identification number and a picture of your vehicle this picture will be uploaded to ipfs and then the cid will be connected to the token that you're about to make then all you have to do is press mint and you have minted a new acetone once you have minted vehicle token it will appear on the left side of the screen and you can click on it to view further details here you will see the vi en that you provided and a bunch of data that was loaded from an external api through an oracle using this video furthermore see the ownership history as well as the number of attached documents down here you can attach a new document for this you have to add a new name and upload a file that you want to attach now it's uploaded to ibfs and with attached document we will attach the cid to the contract and thereby connect the document if if you want to find a vehicle that you're not the owner of you can do so using the search function now you will see the data for this vehicle including documents that were uploaded by its owner nf trail is built on a combination of different technologies we use web3.storage to store various data on ibfs chain link to access an oracle to verify the pin and decode it polygon to host all of the smart contracts and the covalent api to query ownership history of the token nf3 is very much work in progress so there are a variety of different improvements that will need to be done to really leverage its potential but i'm looking forward very much to continue working on it thank you very much thank you so much we'll now be moving on to judges feedback and any questions that they have for you so another question here but basically just to cheer you man and say this is like really impressive i can see the immediate use case right especially um coming from a terrible country myself we are um having trail on um an asset such as a vehicle could prove very very rarely banned for buyers here because you don't want to go purchase a stolen vehicle or vehicle problems and all of that impressive work man and super impressive that you've integrated equivalent api as well great work yeah and if so sorry there's also for example there are even apis that you could use this vehicle identification number also to retrieve like um information whether a vehicle was uh reported stolen i didn't put that feature in but it's like potential extension sorry yes exactly i know very cool i'm a big fan of digital 20 implementations and it obviously uh has its place there so i have one question for you how do you plan on resolving the the gap between between the owner identity and the asset identity or the asset ownership how how do you prove that at the input stage yeah that's that's one of the issues that's what i uh what i said is with the dispute mechanism so right now obviously um there's there's nothing stopping anyone from minting a token for your vehicle if they know the identification number and maybe have a picture of it but yeah potentially that could be like once you have a community around it there could be like some kind of dispute mechanism where you could dispute uh ownership and maybe provide documents uh or other other ways of of proving that you're actually the owner and um maybe that way that could be one uh one way i guess right but i mean so so uh registration or what is in germany such as something like that and uh but that but then you still need to tie to to eventually it always comes down to egov that's where i wanted to go because even if i have registration i still need to align it with an identity right um yeah so obviously i think there are other upcoming uh so the identity of your owner is in in this system is just like represented by the owning address of the token of course there are like upcoming solutions for for identity and if you have um if you have uh like some proof of humanity or something else connected to to this um to this address and obviously it could be integrated here very cool very cool great thank you great work man awesome thanks thank you so much so that was actually our final team thank you everybody for participating in hack fs thank you judges for your time for your feedback and questions um and that is pretty much it thank you for coming yeah thank you yeah thanks thank you better take care guys be good good meeting you email bye
