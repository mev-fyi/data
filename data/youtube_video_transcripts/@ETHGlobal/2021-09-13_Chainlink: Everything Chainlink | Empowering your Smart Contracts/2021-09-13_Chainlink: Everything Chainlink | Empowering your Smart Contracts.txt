everyone for joining us give it one second while we've lots of people welcome to the welcome to the chat welcome to the workshop everybody get 30 minutes of information daniel was looking forward this to this talk well awesome well really really glad to have you here thanks for coming yeah and luke whenever you're ready i will uh i will jump into the prez well as i said before thank you for everyone for joining us today uh thank you patrick for what is i'm sure going to be an incredible workshop as usual um i'll let you introduce yourself and probably do a better job than i can but uh patrick's a good friend of ours um thank you everyone i'm gonna give it one second i think we should be good to go and the stream is live um you want to take it away it's all yours awesome well thank you so much hi everybody uh really excited to be here um thank you look for that for that introduction yeah i'll go a little bit deeper as well um really excited to be chatting at eat anybody who follows me on twitter or or has listened to me speak before you global always does a phenomenal job with these hackathons and you've picked a great hackathon to attend so uh really excited to see what everybody builds here see the amazing projects people do and uh and the likes so for those of you who don't me know me uh let me let me actually share my screen um and we'll uh we'll jump into it so for those of you who don't me don't know me uh my name is patrick collins i'm a developer advocate on the chain link project um we're gonna be talking about these hybrid smart contracts in these decentralized oracle networks um that's me uh you can find me on twitter on linkedin on medium find me all over the place in the discord stack overflow you know et cetera um and uh for those of you who are in the chat here let me open up the chat uh let me see everyone i feel i i love making this collaborative so if you have questions or if i say something that you know you want to touch on or you want to need to extrapolate on you know please leave a comment and my camera has overheated um so that's i'm just going to go away for a little bit so it's fine we're sharing screen anyways um but uh yeah so feel free to jump into the chat and say anything there i love making this collaborative and really uh really chatting so so let's talk let's talk about smart contracts let's talk about blockchain we'll talk about oracles and we'll talk about you know building these insane projects that we're looking to build here at youth global so in order to really understand chain link right and really understand why we're doing all these smart contracts while we're doing everything that we're doing we first want to say okay well what what is the blockchain what are you even building on right these are these highly secure reliable uh decentralized networks that aren't controlled by a centralized authority right and it's important to to keep this in mind because when we're building these smart contracts we want to keep in mind okay like what is the purpose that we're even building them you know why what are these smart contracts why are we building them on this blockchain right why don't i just do this in python what does that say what is the advantage that i get here right so when we're talking about contracts when we talk about smart contracts we really really want to just kind of think about okay what's what's the definition there are these binding agreements right or it's this this legal document and these contracts and these agreements that we've uh that we've been creating have changed over the years right we've gone from you know uh telepha fax machines to digital agreements and we finally arrived at this world of smart contracts these digital agreements now it's it's we want to keep in mind though okay well what is the advantage here what do these smart contracts actually do for us what is this what what is this thing now one of the best examples of what these smart contracts are doing for us what these decentralized agreements do for us is we can actually look at a recent event that happened with robin hood right so what happened with robin hood recently robin hood painted this picture saying hey come use our application we are democratizing finance look what you can do on our platform they painted this picture of this world that was better and you can do all these wonderful things but when push came to shove um they ended up being this centralized intermediary that had a little switch that they could flip and once you started doing something they didn't like they flipped the switch and stopped allowing people from buying specific stocks right so there was this there was the centralized intermediary who was incentivized for whatever reason to not have you buy these stocks so they flipped a switch and they turned it off right essentially removing access to these global financial markets removing your ability um as uh oh wait was nobody able to see before no uh okay everyone was able to see before okay cool um removing your ability to uh freely enact with our free markets right so this totally removed this quote unquote free markets it was it was free it was a free market only by um uh theater right it was a it was a free theater basically right you didn't actually have the ability to interact with these markets as you wished so obviously a huge point of ish a huge failure point for us as an entire ecosystem because there's a single actor who has control over these markets right and we are not truly free to engage with finance the way that we wanted to um this leads us to this the advantages of these smart contracts right instead of having this centralized group that we make an agreement with that can flip a switch off we can interact with a smart contract that we don't have to trust is going to act poorly right because everything instead of being written in in an agreement in something we have to trust it's written in code right we don't all we have to do is trust that one plus one equals two because this smart contract is this self-executing contract right now these smart contracts are amazing um they run on the blockchain they run in this decentralized networks and that's what that's why this blockchain is such a big deal right it's because smart contracts they run on the blockchain uh and there's these superior digital agreements they're superior to these kind of old brand based agreements they have more security guaranteed execution they're more transparent they have this trust mineralization uh they're also more efficient but this all culminates to this main issue right especially with what we saw with robin hood where we move away from these paper guarantees right we move away from hey trust my logo to these cryptographic guarantees so instead of saying i'm gonna trust robin hood's gonna do the right thing we can now just trust that one plus one equals two and that the math and the code that we write is gonna execute um as intended we remove this counterparty risk which is the likelihood or probability that one of these involved parties um [Music] in the transaction might default on their contractual obligation so this is a huge advantage right now where does this take us this is great so we can do all these cool smart contracts we can build you know token transfers and stuff however as we know blockchains in order to have this high security they are deterministic they're deterministic systems by design this means that they actually can't interact with the real world they can't digest real data they can't do any external computation and this is what's known as the oracle problem these smart contracts are unable to connect with external systems like data feeds apis existing payment structures are really anything else and like i said this is because they're deterministic if you try to introduce variable data into these blockchains consensus can't be reached right and this is a huge issue because if we want these smart contracts if we want these agreements to replace our old brand based agreements then we're going to need a way to actually interact with the real world we're going to need a way for these to make sense so the solution to this is using what's called an oracle or a blockchain or a blockchain oracle it's going to be any device that interacts with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts now the problem isn't totally fixed there though right because if we use a single oracle this is going to be a single centralized point of failure or if we use a single data source or single computation you've done all this work to code your smart contract on a blockchain you've done all this work to make this decentralized logic layer if your data layer is centralized then you're no better than you know you're no better than running on robinhood right it's no better than being part of this centralized organization right because you need both your logic layer and your data layer to be decentralized in order to be a truly decentralized smart contract so this is where chain link comes into play and provides a ton of value to enable these smart contracts to have a real effect on the real world and on what we do in real life and actually replace these old brand based agreements with these more cryptographically secure um smart contracts so chain link is a decentralized oracle network for providing data and decentralized external computation to our smart contracts here's a little example of what this looks like for providing uh pricing data to a smart contract so you have a network of chain link oracle's off chain all reading in the price of of an asset from different data sources each one of these chain link nodes is a decentralized independent entity they reach a consensus off chain and then in a single transaction with each node cryptographically signing their answer they send it on chain and now we have access to the real world and real data so a quick question in the chat any resources to make our own custom oracle with apis oh oh yes there is and we will get to that in just a second so um these are known as hybrid smart contracts so these combine this on-chain and off-chain systems to create these hybrid smart contracts which have unlimited customization since we now combine the prowess of of our on-chain blockchains with really anything off-chain right uh keepers random numbers data you know etc um a simple data flow for something like weather weather data would look like this which would enable people to you know build crop insurance applications and arbol is actually one that's doing exactly this so you get your data sources like rainfall temperature you know et cetera they go through a decentralized network of chain link nodes which goes to these um to these weather contracts um on chain that will do the insurance for you know whatever clients have subscribed to the smart contract all that being said um we can now hop into some of these kind of decentralized out-of-the-box applications that we can just hit the ground running somebody has already done all the work for us to set up these networks and all we need to do is just click a button or change a config and we can now use these networks in our smart contracts to uh to get data or do computation and the first one we're going to talk about is chain link data feeds um and these are a huge absolutely massive in the world decentralized finance so for example as we know d5 is this insane um insane industry that's come about due to our our blockchain and smart contract use which allows for us to engage in finance without centralized intermediaries um and in order to really do a lot of what we do in this default world we're gonna need the price of assets in our smart contracts it's really hard to build some type of financial instrument that has no idea what the price of the of the underlying assets that it's working with are right and we see this time and time again you'll we'll see in a second that you know the biggest default protocols right now are all using some type of pricing data right and the way that it works is uh similar to this image here we get data from these exchanges um and from all these different sources that go through this uh this layer of decentralized chain like oracles and they get posted on chain uh and then all these different users can then use that data now that they know what the price of this asset is in the real world and if we head over to data.chain.link we can see in here we have just a list of some of the different um networks that are on here we can look at like fusd for example which is getting the price of ethereum in terms of usd we can see all these independent node operators that are providing data and providing pricing information for this um for this answer here we can see kind of different trigger and update parameters uh we can see you know the history here and all the different oracles that are responding but this allows us essentially to get the price of ethereum in usd uh into our smart contracts right and so that's a visual is that that's a little visualization that allows us to see kind of all these different uh all these different data feeds and you know what they're doing and what's going on so doing it in this way kind of creates this community good of this asset of of these assets here that allow people to access this data access this information and not only is it more secure more decentralized but it's also cheaper since we're using uh this network as a community and it's incredibly powerful and here are some of the protocols using it right now these numbers are already outdated um but we have giants like ave which is carrying 11 billion dollars i think that's actually closer to uh 24. actually you know let's even just d5 pulse real quick let's see ave okay 14 billion um 14 million step protocol sushi swap for you know margin trading synthetics for pricing the underlying collateral so these data feeds are being battle tested and securing some of the biggest protocols in the space and it's the tool that you know all these giants are using to create these decentralized protocols right and i love talking about d5 because it is so early still there is so many protocols yet to be built if we look at the overall cryptocurrency market of like you know maybe 2 trillion or something like that right now versus the d5 market of like 50 60 70 billion it kind of keeps fluctuating um it's d5 is like four percent of all value in cryptocurrency so people always ask hey like what's something really cool i can build d5 is is here and it's just a fraction of where it could be and where it's going to be so um these price feeds out of the box incredibly powerful really uh credibly battle tested um just an amazing way to get data into your smart contracts so that's kind of the first out of the box you know ready to go decentralized uh feature that these chain link networks uh uh have so another question here what is the aggregation function average median it is the median uh great question here sorry about those calendar notifications let's see if my my camera wants to turn back on hello hello camera all right it's back on now okay cool hopefully it doesn't overheat again apologies on that uh next let's talk about randomness on-chain verifiable randomness using chain-link vrf and i only have 10 minutes left so i'm going to try to get through everything here malicious rng operators are a risk so as we know like i said blockchains are deterministic what does determinism mean determinism by definition means that randomness cannot exist so if you know a lot about computer science you know that when you do like math.random on your computer you're really getting a pseudo random number you're not getting a real round number it's looking at some place in memory and going this looks random enough i'm going to use that as my my random number if you do that on the blockchain it is then easy to game very easy to game so we see a lot of people with a with a naive implementation of getting a random number they'll use like block.difficulty or block.timestamp or something but all these values are predictable and influenceable so if we use these we're basically giving control of our smart contract to whatever minor mines our transactions and for those of you who have heard about minor extractable value this isn't some hypothetical mysterious thing this is something that really happens and is happening right now um so we want a way to get provably random numbers into our smart contracts and to do that since the blockchain is deterministic we need to look outside the blockchain so chain-link vrf or chain-link verifiable randomness function has a way to do this and give us this truly random number um and in fact it uses crypto cryptography to prove that the number is actually verifiably random excuse me verifiably random so we can keep this cryptographic based smart contract and that's going to be a key uh it's something all you always want to think about when you're building these smart contracts is this cryptographically secure and this is a solution to get one of these provedly random numbers in here and we've seen a ton of different protocols using this in particular with this nft craze we've seen uh chainlink vrf explode in use especially for those looking to get random stats for their nfts because using a true random number you get provably rare and truly unique nfts because you don't have to rely on the contract creator kind of deciding what the market cap is you can have these these truly random applications here we've seen things like pokemon axi infinity board apes recently was one that started using chainlink vrf um but there's just a ton of ton of ways especially in gaming you can use chain-link vrf4 is anyone planning to do stuff with the uh havoks i'm not sure i totally understand the question daniel sounds like you're asking if people are looking to sync on chain-link chats yes there is a chain link discord um in eth global ethonline uh definitely jump in there if you're looking to chat about shane link a lot of the other chain link developer advocates are gonna be there oh looking for team members daniel's looking for team members go say hi to daniel um jump into the chain link discord or the eth global discord jump to that chain link channel and meet some amazing developers there so um so that's chain link theoret the next out of the box decentralized ready to go is this newer feature called chain link keepers network and this is something that i'm incredibly excited about because it's incredibly incredibly powerful as we know doing triggering things to happen on chain or making any type of state chain in a blockchain needs a transaction to happen somebody's got to spend some gas at some point right so you don't want to be the one behind the counter you know making these transactions every time ideally you would have a decentralized network that's going to do some type of event-based trigger right and that's exactly what what keepers is so there's this network of chain-link nodes that are checking this keeper's registry looking for triggers looking for event triggers for them to perform some action so it reaches out to the registry checks that says hey is anybody eligible for uh for an upkeep once a contract says hey i'm eligible for an upkeep it responds and the chain link nodes will be the one to actually perform that upkeep spend the gas to um to do this event based decentralized computation uh which is incredibly powerful and i'm really looking forward to people building more with this because this is really new and it the the use cases it enables are staggering and outstanding and we're already seeing a ton of people look to use these more and more um and really excited what people here are going to build and at the end of the day these are kind of these these amazing kind of out of the box ready to go decentralized applications but uh if you want these chain link oracles and this chain link technology really allows you to do anything that you want to take any input get any output do any type of external computation do really anything that you want to do now that sometimes takes a little bit more effort you know building your own chain like oracle building your own functionality but we have seen a number of projects take this uh this ability and really do whatever you want to do so in the documentation as well there's a this kind of unlimited customization feature falls under this uh using any api so you can make get requests http post requests whatever you want to do and obviously you can just host your own apis to to interact with these uh these applications right so like for example if you want to get the data from some http get call into your smart contract boom you know this is how you get some of this data into your smart contract here so unlimited customization here with chain link and using these off chain oracles so uh definitely head over to docs.change.link uh whoops docs.chain.link um it has pretty much everything that you uh everything to teach you here if you've never done anything with smart contracts as well there's a basics tutorial random number tutorial there's videos api calls if you're looking to learn about chain link and how to use all the services this is where you can live this is where you're going to want to live for example price feeds you can jump to the price feeds the price fees documentation there's even usually a little button like deploy this with remix that you can click it'll bring you right to a remix application and i'm even going to do a little demo here uh and we'll go into samples docs to change the link samples price feed price consumer it gives us all this information gives us all the code here i'm speeding a little bit because uh we're going to be a little short on time but let's go ahead and even deploy this contract right from the docs i'm on the coven test net here so i do need some covent link or excuse me some coven eth if you ever need to find a faucet just google link token contracts scroll down to whatever test night you want and boom typically you know the faucets will be here uh if you want to test that link or test on eth uh it looks like i am deploying this contract still but once i deploy this is an example one of these price feeds contracts and we'll be able to pull see exactly what pulling the price from one of these contracts looks like so we can see the contract here we said this get latest price boom this is the latest price of eth in terms of usd the question is oh well why is it why is it such a big number that looks so weird um solidity doesn't work with decimals so we have to actually multiply this by a number uh and this is multiplied by one two three four five six seven eight eight decimal places so we know that this is three thousand two hundred and twenty dollars for the price right here so that's kind of uh an example of using these um using the docs here there's also vrf like i said keepers some of them are a little bit take a couple more steps so you can always go through the tutorials at the top um to learn everything as well if you're looking for ideas 77 smart contract use cases naval action inc is a fantastic article that will give you tons of insight on some of the different things you can build it's a constantly growing uh dock and you should absolutely take a look for those of you who are new to either chain link smart contract development you're obviously asking the question where should i learn we just went over the docs blog.chain.link developers tab has a just tons of tutorials ipfs nfts um build your own um a defy application whatever you want uh gaming raffles etc chainlin youtube there's a ton of chain link tutorials on the channel youtube there's engineering tutorials developer workshops both fantastic if you're working with brownie truffle or hard hat head over to the smart contract github repository and there's demo repositories for all the chain link features in for brownie for hard hat for truffle and if you're doing smart contract development and you're not familiar with brownie hard hat or truffle i highly recommend checking those out because those are game changers that make your life a lot easier if you're looking to learn more you're looking to get help jump into the discord there's a ton of vibrant community people there i've met so many people with the discord who i'm still friends with today um the github is a great place to go the documentation is great place to go if you have a question get familiar with stack overflow and stack exchange ethereum these are perfect places to ask questions and join the community and get answers back and obviously if you want to jump on twitter say hi to me say hi to anybody on the team we're very active on twitter as well and i do want to plug this this other video as well if you look at free code camp solidity this just came out four days ago uh i'm incredibly proud of it it is a if you're like i have no idea how to block chain that is a not very flattering face here this is an end-to-end 16-hour course i know it's long i give some tips on how to how to break it up uh on literally everything everything that you need to know uh it's got a little uh little course contents in here um starting from scratch um doing incredibly incredibly advanced things in here so um just anything on smart contract development this is an absolutely fantastic resource and uh we're coming out with a page as well um in our docs very soon on your recommended boot camps because there are some fantastic boot camps out there some fantastic sources to learn more so oh share the link okay sharing the link in the chat here and i know we're at time but i will answer a couple questions in here how to secure how secure is using external api to pull data on chain what a fantastic question amazing question so when you're pulling data right price feeds is obviously you know going to be the most secure the most decentralized because we're pulling from a contract that already has this aggregation done for us this is why i said you know doing this any api feature it takes a little bit more work because pulling from a single rogue api means that once again you're in that centralized area right you have a single api that's going to control your entire application so the reason i say it takes a little bit more work is because you want to to make this really decentralized you'll want to you know find a network of chain-link nodes and sync with them so that you can get data from multiple places and multiple nodes um if you're looking just to build you know an mvp a minimum viable product or or some type of demo this is still absolutely perfect to use right because you'll be able to pull this data on and do some type of proof of concept really easy but absolutely great question i love where your head is at yes that is the exact type of question you should be asking good question uh any other questions here great okay should the link okay cool well i do have to jump off now but uh thank you everybody so much for attending uh and i hope you all learned something uh really excited to see what everyone builds this hackathon um like i said i i absolutely love youth global well we we love the hackathons that they put on um you're literally you know at a phenomenal time uh to be coding we're like we are the pioneers of this space we are building this future uh and you get to be a part of it and i'm i'm so excited that uh that i get to be you know helping you along the way and uh and seeing you all grow and build amazing things well thank you so much patrick this was an incredible presentation and you said it better than we ever could that's you know that's everything that we do here is for the reasons of growth across the entire ecosystem so thank you to everyone today for participating and being part of that in a small way being a little piece of history that this is as he said you can continue the conversation in discord we look forward to seeing what you guys build with that and make sure to check out the prizes page to see what chain link is offering uh the specific prizes and um obviously follow up because if you have any questions uh we'll be ending the stream right here uh but thank you again patrick thank you again to everyone for joining us um and we look forward to seeing you in the next session oh i should have i should have mentioned our prizes too apologies yeah we're doing ten thousand dollars in link um to the top a few projects i think the prize page has the actual number but um yeah really looking forward to seeing what everybody builds and uh and getting a chance to win some fun prizes uh although to me the real the real prize is the the amazing learning experience but you can also win some link friends you made along the way i gotcha
