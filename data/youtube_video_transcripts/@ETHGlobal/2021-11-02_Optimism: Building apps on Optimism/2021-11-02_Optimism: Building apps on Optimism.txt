coolio move this out of the way hey hi everybody um welcome to the building apps on optimism workshop we have kelvin here from our sponsor optimism who's going to be leading it um and if you have any questions during the duration of the workshop feel free to just pop them into the chat all right counseling get started alrighty um cool so hello hello i am kelvin from uh from the optimism team and uh we are very hyped because we are moving to the new um ovm v2 system and the ovm v2 system is about a million times easier to use than the ovm v1 system so yeah we're just really excited to show you exactly how easy it is because it is super easy and you basically have to do nothing um and we want you to try it as part of of unicode so that you can get used to deploying stuff to layer two because it's as easy as deploying stuff to anything else here i've basically just used i've set up a scaffold eth and all i'm gonna do is deploy scaffold eth really quickly because i kind of assume this might be something that you're familiar with uh already so all i've done here i made i had to make a small change to the hard hat config to uh to get rid of something specifically let's see if i can undo it let's see if my diff will show it yeah look at this i had to get rid of this and this because uh we don't need it anymore because this was a holdover from ovmb1 and i actually just made a pull request to scaffold east which just got merged so you don't need to do this i just had to do this so you can totally ignore this file the only thing that you would need to do if you wanted to deploy uh your project to to this uh and use scaffold eth is first of all of course you gotta install your dependencies all i did here is just download uh scaffolding i already installed the dependencies so it's a little i'm kind of cheating here and then yeah all you need to really do is deploy network command optimism that's it it'll compile it uses one of the biggest things you'll notice of course the differences between well it already let me let me delete this because i already did this once let's delete the artifacts and the deployment just do it from scratch one of the biggest differences you will notice as part of ovm v2 is that there's no more custom compiler there's no more uh yeah no more custom solidity compiler so we're just using the standard no more no more of this uh you know eth optimism slash hard hat plug-in it's just straight-up solidity you could use viper you could use any program any uh evm programming language that you want and then yeah so you just deploy your contract like you do i guess normally you might do this during deploy but specifically want to deploy to the covant optimism network and then the only other change that we have to make is making sure that we are actually deploying to the co-man optimism or that we're going to use the covam optimism target network so if you open up scaffolding react app app.jsx and you just change this to networks.coman optimism this is the only thing you have to do in the scaffold east and now you're deploying stuff to optimism so if i start this it's going to tell me i have to run it on a different port blah blah blah so here we go hopefully uh people can see my little come on all right this takes a second to start there we go come on and there we are okay so we have this application um i didn't have to do anything at all it just works it just works like you would expect scaffolding to work uh and as you can see i connected to the optimism covan network there are instructions in multiple places on how to connect to this network but i can i will leave those instructions i guess on discord or you can go to community.optimism.io and get those instructions but basically i have just connected to a custom network in metamask see if i can show you the exact network details here all right so this is my my my network name my rpc url chain id and currency that's it i have some covan eth add some optimism command eth and there we go and so then just like i would in any other scaffold well i guess i don't even need the string so i can execute a transaction just like i do on ethereum right this completely different and it's much well look at that that's fast that's speedy that is speedy and uh i can do this over again um this is wild exclamation point exclamation point exclamation point send that same thing there you go this is wild right so it's just like using ethereum just like using ethereum and this is really the magic of the obm b2 is that we have completely redesigned our system from the ground up and it really is just running death under the hood it's it's that's basically it it's just guess so it works just like ethereum works um and uh there you go so anything that you could possibly deploy to ethereum you can deploy to optimism and it'll be a little faster too just because look at this look how fast it goes boom boom look at that speedy and that's because of the magic of the sequencing node um but basically you don't do anything it just works if you want to get another important thing is that you actually have to be able to move uh you move assets between layer one and layer two sorry i'm talking a bit fast but really we just got through the most important stuff here look at that that's it that's it you don't do anything you just deploy if you want to yep if you want to if you want to do this you don't have to do anything but let's talk about the the act of getting assets between layer 1 and layer 2 because that is an extremely important part of actually being able to develop an application on optimistic ethereum because you will need covan optimistic ethereum eth in order to pay fees on there too because we use eth to pay fees and in order to do that all you have to do is get to the gateway so gateway dot optimism dot io right so we're at the optimism gateway and the optimism gateway is very straightforward this at this point we are connected to optimistic covan but let's say that you are a developer and you would like to try out optimism of the optimistic covan network you are going to need to deposit funds into covant so how do you do that it's very straightforward you just click deposit it's going to switch you over to covan because a deposit is sent being sent from covant then we are going to set an amount i'm going to submit a one each deposit i'm going to send one each over to maybe i can make this a little bigger i'm going to send a one east deposit over to covan i'm just going to confirm that so here we are waiting sitting here and we're gonna just have to wait a little bit it's it says five minutes but that's not actually how long you have to wait on covant it's much less than that but you basically just wait here for a minute for a optimism an optimistic ethereum node to pick up your deposit your deposit gets picked up and then your funds appear on layer uh layer two so let's see that happen you can see here is my covan transaction i sent one ether over to the bridge contract this is our special proxy system chug splash um where are we here we go so this is the bridge contract this is what allows you to send east that allows you to send tokens over to kovan or optics over its optimistic ethereum there we go look at that uh we got a bunch of confetti and our deposit is now complete on optimistic covam so if we then open up our wallet well let's let's switch i'm going to switch over to optimistic covam by clicking on withdraw just to see and we should have there we go one eats more than we did before so we got one each on optimistic covan so this is now i have the money uh to be able to deploy apps to optimistic ethereum i can also then withdraw things from optimistic coven if i wanted to so i mean i could put a 0.1 east with a draw so withdrawing on optimism currently is a two-step process you can use alternative bridges like hop to simplify this but if you use the official bridge it's a two-step process where you first hit withdraw and so this sends a transaction on layer two and um then after a period of a minute on kovan or it might be even less maybe about 10 seconds on command and a period of well seven days on oops that looks a little weird a period of a minute what is this no that's a deposit where's my withdrawal come on now maybe um maybe etherscan is having some issues right now um well looks like either scanners have forgot about this yeah etherscan is having issues right now so we'll get this fixed in a minute but basically after a period of time which is called the challenge period uh you will see this little withdrawal here that says okay it's ready to be withdrawn and then you would have to execute that withdrawal you would have to finalize the withdrawal back on covan so again on on uh on our covant testnet deployment we use a period of 10 seconds between when you trigger the first transaction on layer two and when you trigger the finalization transaction on layer one but on mainnet part of the security mechanism of an optimistic rollup requires that you have to wait a bit longer on mainnet we have a seven-day withdrawal period so you have to wait a period of seven days and then you can execute that second finalization transaction back on uh ethereum if you use uh something like hop you can make this much faster so i would recommend that you look into alternative bridges that use some cool economics to speed up the time that it takes to withdraw funds out of optimistic ethereum cool so that is really the basics of of optimism an optimistic ethereum these days um it's very very straightforward it's just like ethereum the only complexity is moving assets in and out really besides that once you're on optimistic ethereum it's it's uh pretty much identical um and the the ovm v2 is not only sort of identical on a um an api level so it's not just uvm compatible it's what we like to call evm equivalent which kind of goes above and beyond what you would think of as as compatibility and it's really just under the hood it's running guess which means you know guests with some very very minor modifications um which really just means that not only do do high-level tools like you know metamask um or you know scaffolding or whatever not only do these network these tools work but very low level tools work too right so anything um like anything that relies on uh using like transaction traces things like tenderly tenderly works very very well and we use tenderly a lot to debug things if things don't look like they're they're behaving correctly we tenderly gives us a lot of information and that's because it's very very easy for them to integrate with something that's basically just guess so all of your favorite tools should just work if you have questions you can always ask me i would love for people to try deploying viper contracts because we have we have really it's we've been we've been so stuck on the solidity uh because of the custom solidity compiler so if people could deploy viper and mess around with brownie that would be fantastic um and if there are any issues that people are finding during the during the unicode hackathon i'd love to i will i will be around and people can ask me questions about pretty much anything so yeah that's the tl dr this is you know it's luckily it's much much easier to build on optimism now than it really ever has been in the past if you want some more information community.optimism.io is a great place it's basically got all of our documentation i would take a look at all the ovm v2 oem 2.0 documentation which will tell you everything you need to know there's some very minor differences very minor chase on rpc differences that you really don't have to think about just because don't worry about it and it tells you all about how you can connect with metamask how you can deposit assets into optimistic ethereum how you can withdraw out of optimistic ethereum and um it even gives you little tutorials that you can use so great first place to get started community.optimism.io or sorry need some water um or you can also just take a look at the github if you want to get more familiar with it and take a look at the regenesis 0.5.0 branch that's the ovm v2 branch and we've got this very nice readme if you'd like to try to contribute to optimistic ethereum we have lots of good first issues we try very hard to create a lot of good first issues we would love for you to be a contributor to the project and we really feel that the ovm 2.0 code base is is really our cleanest and most accessible code base to date so we're really happy with it and if you'd like to contribute or you want to build a project just just hit me up on discord i will be around i can give you all the support you need yeah and uh i hope it's i hope this is much much easier to build on than the uh than the 1.0 system was uh we're really excited about it so yeah that's really all i got if people have questions about um anything i guess now is the time but if not i will be on discord and feel free to hit me up it's that simple easy build stuff on optimism save money all right it looks like we have a few um questions in the chat if you want to take a look um i think there's some more that are just popping in right now yeah absolutely i'll just kind of go down the list okay so eath let's talk about eth really quickly in the ovm v1 system the uh we basically made if an erc20 so in the lvmv2 system we have kind of temporarily disabled this functionality eth just behaves like eath does on layer one we really wanted to minimize the differences between layer one and layer two and as a result we have let's i'm going to share my screen again really quickly so you can i can just show you where you can find more about this but as a result uh there is east and then there's wrapped east so the bridge does not take care of wrapping that eth but you can do it yourself by interacting with the wrapped eth contract you can find more information about the differences between ovm and v1 and v2 at the ovm 2.0 change set page but as you can see east will no longer be erc20 compatible we are kind of making that executive decision for the meantime while we just make sure that everything works as as we expect going down the list alchemy has support for optimism so you can just go to alchemy and so does quick node and infura so you can go to either of those node providers or you can use the open and accessible covan.optimism.io rpc url and on the community hub you will also find a page that says that's community.optimism.org you'll find a page that says networks and connection details and that will tell you everything you need to know to be able to connect and deploy stuff to optimistic ethereum cool and uh as i did i did forget to mention this but the gateway does support tokens so you can deposit any erc20 that you want to deposit you can also deposit eth of course and you can withdraw so i would highly recommend that you just try that and give it a shot and have fun and cool so as far as an example app goes somebody somebody wrote a question about an example app i would recommend just using scaffold eth if you really you know you can basically just deploy any application that you would normally deploy to ethereum if you are interested in kind of working more in the layer one layer two communication space where you wanna have applications that interact between ethereum and optimistic ethereum then i would take a look at the community hub and look at those those tutorials um and the uh is and then this question you know is optimism live on mainnet optimism is live on mainnet the mainnet version that we have right now is kind of a restricted thing while we're still getting the the 2.0 system up uh but it will be much much easier to deploy as soon as that mainnet deployment is or is the main upgrade that we're uh that we have scheduled for november 11th is complete and uh another question here about do i think that seven days is too long to anticipate a denial of service attack um seven days is being safe i think this is um one of the you know one of the more frustrating things with layer twos is this seven day uh window but i think it's really important to be safe in these early days right uh it's you know maybe over time as things evolve we'll sort of start to reduce this time period but right now it's more important that people don't lose money than for everything to be as efficient as it possibly can okay so to be able to bridge a token from a contract that you own on ethereum would you also need to deploy that contract on optimism you can you can basically bridge anything that you want you in order to do this you would need to deploy any erc20 representation of your token on layer 2 and there i i believe that one of the examples on the community hub covers this so it'll describe that process of creating one token on layer one creating another token on layer two and then sort of transferring it between layer one and layer two but yes you would also you don't necessarily need to deploy the exact same contract but you uh you do need to deploy some erc20 representation on layer two um and this then there's a question about you to swap b3 being on optimism but not p2 i'm not sure what i don't believe that uniswap b2 has deployed on optimism cool okay if there are no more questions for kelvin i'd like to wrap this up thank you so much again kelvin um and the optimism team for sponsoring unicode this year i want to encourage everyone to keep this conversation going in the sponsor channel which you can find on discord um yeah have a really great day everybody bye all right peace i'll see you on discord if you need help let me know and build us up on optimism it's
