everyone this is our last workshop of dow hacks at last sponsor workshop of dial hacks um and we're excited to have leyving here from covalent who's going to be doing workshop on building dow transparency dashboards with one unified api so questions if you have any go in the zoom chat um and leaving will be more than happy to answer them and with that being said i will pass the mic over to leaving hi guys hi everyone thanks for joining us at this um final sponsor workshop of the day i hope you guys are having fun hacking away i'm living from convenient i'm from the developer relations team here at covalent and unfortunately leilani wouldn't be joining us today because she's uh on a holiday so i'm very envious of her but it'll be just me today and we'll have fun here while she has fun somewhere else okay guys let me go ahead with the presentation we're gonna cover four things today um some of the data trends in web3 what is covalent api and how we can use our api to access dow on chain data right or any other kinds of on-chain data that you want to build so the bounty that we have for this hackathon for you all would not just be limited to douse there are it is a very open bounty you can work on d5 you can work on nfts you can work on uh other kinds of dashboards hold on my alarm is off suddenly just give me one second sorry guys i am back so yeah you can use us for all kinds of launching data and then i'll just give you a quick run-through of the resources as well as demos that you can use for the hackathon so as you know um within the last two years crypto adoption is on the upswing right we saw fintech and crypto merging right a lot of big players suddenly entering into the game we saw brands like crypto.com blowing up and booking stadiums and changing the name of stadiums to their you know brand and we saw government initiatives all over the world right and in terms of kind of the history of the option of this technology we're still pretty much on at this infancy we at kovalev believe that by 2025 there will be millions of critical information on public blockchains there will be dozens of you know single or multi-use blockchains that will power thousands of dfs just like how we are using you know thousands of web 2 applications in our lives right now and more than one billion users will be unchained and we're very close to this kind of vision already now there's a problem with that vision because um each blockchain is this contained ecosystem which does not necessarily talk to each other right um and as we have seen in the last few months bridge technology can inherently be rather um insecure it is still pretty much uh in its infancy as well blockchains produce lots of data but these data is not as neat as our traditional relational databases like in sql right they are often very disorganized because of the decentralized nature there's no uh standard data structure it is pretty complex to understand and also very difficult to stop so there's a huge data problem in terms of accessibility within blockchains as well so what is the covalent api right um we are a data api service where we expose neatly packaged blockchain data from all 26 20 27 chains that we index into a standardized query format right so for instance if you want to get the token balances of someone in the ethereum chain it will be the same query that you use as the query that you use to get token balances from avalanche chain for instance you just need to change one chain id and i'll show you that later you can query it from all kinds of environments you can query it from your terminal using code you can query it from the browser you can query it uh from a your code right front end code or back end code because you know that's what apis are they we make the data public for you so you don't necessarily need to code to be able to access the data we have the ability to export the data in csv or google sheets format as well for you and all this allow you to get multi-chain data across lots of the major chains right within a couple of minutes even seconds if you know how to set it up it's really simple okay so we make the data of blockchains easily accessible and transparent where do we fit into your crypto stack you may ask right because you know blockchains themselves produce the data and the data is hosted in nodes which are typically exposed as json rpc endpoints right if you we are not the proprietor of this data by no means right what we do is that we aggregate the data from all the different nodes so that you don't have to make individual queries to each of the nodes to get the data that you want and that's typically very useful if you want to build a multi-chain applications we see ourselves as the data layer um where we like i said aggregate the data package it into formats that fit easily into different kinds of use cases for instance if you want to build a wallet if you want to build an nft gallery if you want to build any kind of analytics and charts or any sheets all you need is just a couple of endpoints to power your applications so some of the users include analysts data analysts research analysts and also crypto developers and our projects are being our api service is being used by a lot of developers and projects in the ecosystem today [Music] so and here is the exciting part what bounties do we have for you guys for this hackathon for dell hacks we are offering a 4000 usd price pool for projects that makes meaningful use of the covalent api to build any web3 project including dial dashboards including uh if you even want to build a dao tool right or any form of two for dowels that's possible if you want to build an nft tool or an nft idea that's possible as well a default idea we kept this uh bounty open up to you guys to build any kind of web3 startup idea that you want if you need on-chain data to get it done covalent fits into the backend oh i didn't change the amount here let me just quickly change the amount so it wouldn't be misleading 4 000 there we go yes so what does price pool mean price poo means that let's say we have 20 projects submitting to the price pool right we will be splitting the price pool up evenly across 20 projects after taking into consideration the different tiers of merit so that's the other thing um because often we receive projects that some projects put in a lot of work some projects maybe put in less work and some projects are really really solid ideas and some projects um uh we can't really understand the use case etc right you can find more bounty right up in the uh and the price page that eath global has for y'all so and because of that we often give different peers of merit so for instance uh some projects will receive uh 300 some will receive 400 it wouldn't be too drastic but there will be a differentiation because we feel it is only fair if the projects they are more deserving gets awarded a little bit more right so there's a price pool that we have all right let me just go through the hackathon resources that you guys can use the first one obviously uh would be our api reference and this is the most important one here on number two here uh in other places it's called documentation but here it's called api reference so let me just click through and share with you what this looks like there you go classic documentation on the product that we offer we have two kinds of endpoints that exposes different kinds of data for you the first one is class a endpoints the second one is class b endpoints right class a endpoints are on chain data they can find across all chains for instance this is a list of chains that we support right ethereum polygon avalanche bsc moonbeam phantom [Music] and you can find this kinds of datas across all of these chains for instance there are data specific to balances you want to get the balances of my address on rsk you can use this if you want to get my balances on ethereum or polygon you can use this as well what does this look like get token balances for address this is the query string right and you can often run run it to take a look what the sample response will look like and when you run it we give a sample demo address for you to run and see what it looks like so this is your response this is the product this is the data response that you get that will be integrated into your code right and let's take a look at what the response looked like for balances we queried this sample address that was provided in this example and this person has lots of tokens actually he has 125 uh tokens different tokens and we are querying the ethereum so what kind of tokens does he hold he has a d-y-k-y-g-y dot token which is the erc20 token and this is the balances that he currently hold for that token why is this number so big because it is denominated in a way as these data go in blockchain even if you use uh uh web3 dot py right the other service that allows you to access on-chain data through notes it will also be denominated in weight so what you need to do often if you want to get it in si unit you take this number divide it by 10 to the power of the contract decimal all right let me repeat that again if you want to get in uh si unit for instance in eth or any other in this one in kydy right token in its original unit you get it you take the balances divided by 10 to the power of contract decimal you can find that information more of those information in i believe this part when you view view responses here balance the asset balance use contract decimal to scale this balance for display purposes all right okay so that is this endpoint and you can also get the historical value over time so why is this very helpful if you want to chart what are my trading patterns for any anybody what am i trading that is what is a trading pattern of this trader right you can use this one to get what are his historical holdings over a period of time of 30 days you can get all the token transfers for a particular address right and you can see the list of uh balances endpoints here it's very helpful for building any kind of uh the app and i'll show you some examples later you get nft data right you can get the nft tokens ids for one particular nft collection you can get a global market view and this is a new endpoint it's really powerful it allows you to at one glance get the market cap of every single nfd collection within an ecosystem let me let you have a look now if you click run here right it will return you the market else every single collection within these nft marketplaces on ethereum bam there we go the top nft market cap and it is sorted according to market cap it's wearable and this is his market cap in way then we have a very popular collection called town style apparently nowadays and fantasy island sandbox and i'll show you what it looks like on the front end when it is all displayed right so we've got nft uh data we've got transaction data and this category we've got base so what base refers to is a couple of foundational data that you can get for instance get block types a certain date range you provide the start date and end date for instance i want to find how many blocks are being produced on the ethereum chain today maybe there's no easy way for you to find that right how are you going to query that so if you click run you'll be able to see that i don't know which dates they use for this example you can click open tab here which will open you to the actual request itself and it is quite useful so they use the date the first day of this year 2000 first of january to third gen and these are the blocks that are being produced right on ethereum chain and there are total of 13 000 blocks okay so really useful um stuff as well you can get log events of any contract address that will allow you to get the more granular data of every single kind of log events if you're familiar with this that's emitted from the smart contract all right and class b endpoints are protocol specific endpoints for instance unison unit swap is available on a couple of chains right and this allows you to get the number of pools in unison uh the [Music] the addresses exchange balance right and x y equals the k endpoints lets you get the uh dex pools for instance of any kind of unisof clone or any fox with unison for instance on a hero mainnet you can use x y equals the k endpoints on sushi saw sushi salt quick swap on polygon you can use this endpoint uh on spirit swap on phantom right so all these are very popular daxes whose data might not be easily visible or transparent but with this xy equals the k endpoint you can get access to what's really going on how many people are doing what kinds of swaps right of which kind of liquidity pairs that's the most popular in these endpoints [Music] so yes all these are currently available as class b endpoints all right now [Music] okay before i end this let me just give you some quick ideas of what else you can build um what else people have built in particular dial tooling systems right so this is a dashboard that was built at the previous hackathon it is um a dial transparency dashboard so if you go to the start it won the price for the hackathon that we participated so the problem statement that we set for that for that hackathon was um you know there's lots of dowels out there right but there's very few ways that people can gain insight into what happens behind us how big is the treasury um how many proposals they put up uh yeah so the idea of a dow is all transparent and decentralized but really how decentralized or transparent is it right what is the token holdings of the members of the dell so we want to see how people can use the covalent api to build a dell transparency dashboard and let's take a look at it in action let's say we want to analyze this dial called bit dial [Music] there we go it computes the transparency score this score is computed using all these on chain data that is provided from covalent api for instance the dow treasury the amount in this treasury is 2.1 billion this dao holds 2.1 billion of on-chain money right they have a token which is a bit token and this is his token price all this can be gotten from corporate api as well and if you are familiar with dows and snapshot platform snapshot is a proposals platform for dolls to be able to get their proposals through with their community right and this is their followers i don't think this is provided without api though so the rest is so if you take a look at it um the get historical portfolio value endpoint is used to generate this chart that gives you the dial treasury over month which is used to calculate how much the strategy changed over the last month it also gives you this top bit token holders we have this endpoint right uh get token holders if you remember get token holders as of any block height right using that endpoint we can see that this is the top bit token holders and you can do that for any coin and then when you calculate it against the total circulating supply of bid you can see that this address holds 30 of bit right it's a whale in there in uh in terms of the token holders of this and then this other address goes 20 and so on 11 9 and then there are all these smaller fishes what i like to call them that also hold this token and that's gotten using the get token holders endpoint and yeah what are the other treasure other tokens that is being held on chain in this treasury these are the tokens and that's gotten using our get token balances endpoint okay so all this information is being used to do a calculation and produce a transparency score let's take a look at another one really radical yeah so a smaller treasury here a smaller transparency score less decentralized this top address holds 51 percent of the token for this dao and these are the currencies that it holds mainly concentrated on usdc and if all right so this uh interesting example of a project that you can use to build for dallas i'm running a little bit out of time so i will be oh oh god sorry i think i opened that meeting and hurt myself through through the youtube which scared me a little bit um i'll be opening this up to q a right all the best with your projects and if you go on the bounty page you can find more information on resources okay i've got one question here in the chat how does covalent compare with graph or morales great question um the graph uses a graphql to do its queries we are quite a fundamentally different architecture i believe um you can think about it this way we the data that we get is like casting a net a huge net into the c right to get lots of data if you saw an example of a response it's very it holds lots of information and with one query you get uh you basically can power a page of your application whereas for the graph you get very specific granular data it's like phishing in some ways you get very specific data so it really depends on your use case right um we do not need you to write sub graphs that differs for every every single uh on chain platform you can simply for instance you want to get token balances all you need to do is change the chain id to get different token balances of different chains and that allows you to on onboard and build the apps really fast right i would say as a dev you know try out all your options and compare and see which is the use case that you know is really suitable for your app uh what are the rate limits like for covalent beyond a certain number of api calls do you have to pay so our product is entirely free for you to use we currently have a rate limit of five requests per second so that actually means you get to call around um you know more than more than 10 000 requests or 20 000 requests a day i think so which is uh currently you know pretty sufficient because of the the kind of data that we have right one page of the application only requires one call most of the time or two calls and um currently we do not offer a paid tier right everything is free for you to use and try and we are thinking maybe in the future of implementing a paid tier where you have a higher rate limit but so far we don't have that service for you how do i convert this data to meaningful ui or react a sample tutorial on ui integration yes we do have this one on raplet nft market cap so let me just share this on nft let me just drop this in a comment here so this is an example of a page that's built in react if you see here you know how do you integrate it in the front end you call excels right typically this is what you'll be doing axis.get and our api request string and then you get the data which will come in response and then you get the data you want it will be stored you need to analyze a little bit the data structure to pull out the data specific data that you want and then you slice and dice it to fit whatever you need and what this looks like is this page all right you'll be able to find using the nft market cap data this very useful information on the top performing entity collections of the chain like for instance this is polygon chain and we have the top performing one which is that horse with a market cap of 46 million and encrypted unicorns avocado chicken derby etc what's very useful about this is that we also have the uh average price for the 24 hours right and the total number of transactions that ever occurred on this collection and the number of wallets that currently contains zed horse or crypto unicorns according to unicorns sit in 3 000 wallets for instance and when you click through you get to see the price floor another super relevant and hard to get data point just give it a sec for it to load and there we go we see the price floor for the last 30 days and you can change the granularity here but as you can see it's currently going down a little bit right and this is what the unicorns look like i don't think they're hatched yet yeah so is there any more questions i think i'm three minutes um you know past my time anyone else no worries awesome yeah if not um yeah i want to thank all of you for coming and i can't wait to see what exciting projects you guys will be building using our api and all the best and have fun for dell hacks awesome thank you so much leaving for hosting this workshop um i believe it's really early in the morning for you right now so um thank you yeah i know i'm kind of i'm kind of used to it and thank you so much anna for having me of course and um as that being said um feel free to contact the discord if you have any questions throughout the rest of this weekend um and with that being said i hope the rest of you all have a great rest of your friday or saturday depending on where you are yes all right guys you can find me on discord in the channels take care
