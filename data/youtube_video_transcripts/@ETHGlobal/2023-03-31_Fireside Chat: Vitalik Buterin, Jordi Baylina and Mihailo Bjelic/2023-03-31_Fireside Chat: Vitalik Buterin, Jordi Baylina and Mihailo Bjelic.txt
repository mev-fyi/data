foreign [Applause] [Music] so with that and with this excitement we will continue with a five side chat and we will invite now vitalik and Jordy to stay in and no better person to take this fire chat on than mihilo take it on thanks a lot Grace I'm not sure that I'm the right person to do this now given a house that's a super exciting and super fun uh and yeah actually it turned out very well uh yeah hi everyone again uh I'm very very uh excited and and honored to have a very quick chat with two people that I tremendously in fact and I think without further Ado Let's uh go into that right uh so I I think maybe we can just start emotionally if that's fine then we can attract to rational conversation so just tell me how do you guys feel about what just happened uh just do you have any any current emotion that you can maybe share and what do you think about this event is it really uh an important Milestone as we believe and is it really a gift of to the to the community just any anything that you can just share about how you feel about very happy and uh you know excited for what's to come it's uh no the the whole ckvm thing is just something that I think we've all dreamed about and talked about for such a long time and so like actually seeing it happen um you know on Main net and seeing all of the Pieces come together and just work as like just you know so amazing yeah for me it's um okay it's a it's a strange feeling because uh and I have been like dreaming for this moment for two years okay but uh at this point uh once you get there and you know even the days before I'm more excited for the for tomorrow for the after tomorrow and what will happen tomorrow the day after tomorrow that's that we will plan but we are going to do next and uh who will build and we have a lot of things in the in the backlog because in the last three months I mean we have been working but inviting security and not doing like anything new just checking and and checking the code many times and all that and we have a lot of things to improve and and to do it better and so on so what's for me the most exciting exciting one of these event is that okay we will finish this space and we will continue building and improving this is just a milestone I think it's an important Milestone because it's having something that was impossible okay no it's here it's a game yeah I mean it's possible we can build that but but it's a long path for escape we are just starting to escape this is just the beginning and now we need to really scale we need really need making uh many transactions going faster and this is and and this I think is quite an important step for because this will really scale uh well this is a it will start this this edge of scaling uh uh a 31 we finally will see applications that were not possible because it's getting no make them possible with the security of ethereum so that's that's I I think this is a really important moment for the space thanks so much guys for sharing this so okay let's switch back to the rational conversation and maybe a little bit more technical but we can start for the sake we have more than 10 000 people I believe signed up and hopefully hopefully yeah that's very interesting so that we got from from e-global uh friends and hopefully a lot of them are new cameras right and you want one board as many newcomers as possible so for for their sake and everyone's sake maybe if you can just uh just recap again what is the importance of this layer 2 Solutions and ZK VM itself just briefly in your own words just for everyone maybe it's it's always useful to recap yeah so I think for the almost uh since uh ethereum launched I've been talking about scaling as uh you know one of the most important problems for ethereum to solve and I think uh for me at the beginning like for the first few years of ethereum's growth that was definitely pretty theoretical right like we we knew that ethereum had to scale somehow to be able to serve um you know future millions of people user base but like at the time transactions were cheap for the users that ethereum has ethereum worked fine uh but then uh especially yeah in the last few years and then like the last bull run like it just became queer how expensive the ethereum main net is right like I remember the like visiting Argentina and just like seeing how everyone is using a binance account right and like from their perspective it makes perfect sense because Finance the binance transfers don't have fees but uh at the same time you know I think uh as a crypto ecosystem like you know we will we do wants to ultimately yeah move Beyond to the centralized approaches and I mean I'm I'm sure even you know a lot of people in binance feel that I feel that way as well right but uh you know me take something that's uh decentralized and uh hard for and easy for and practical for people to use at the same time it's just like so much harder than uh you know making something centralized and easy to use right and uh then you know last year we saw it the FTX situation and we just like keep seeing all of these incidents that just remind us um you know in a very real and practical way wise yet decentralized access to the chain being possible and be in a reality is just so important because if you don't have that then you know you have this kind of like centralized centralized on top of decentralized Frankenstein that seems to just like sometimes be even less secure than just doing the whole thing centralized top to bottom right um and so I think uh you know scalability age yet and desaturalization at the same time is like this really I see which really important thing and uh like for the last couple of years I think the ethereum ecosystem has been focused on Roll-Ups as a primary strategy for scaling uh basically just because uh ethereum core developer time is limited uh the ethereum Network's ability to handle complexity is limited and so we did it once to kind of give every responsibility to layer to the layer one and we wanted to leave open some room for Independence Innovation to happen and so uh you know we've recently had this sell Layer Two ecosystem uh start to emerge and uh well I think these days dollar or two-weeker system has existed for some time right but uh for me like 2023 in particular is uh in this year when I wants to see the way or two ecosystem really mature and uh for me like a big the biggest part of maturity is like where two is becoming actual layers right in the sense of like you know you don't just have like some um you know claim that like oh you know we're going to have a proof system in the future and like actually we're just now multi-sig like I know you have proofs right and you know you have a system where the your coins in the lawyer two are like actually protected by Math instead of being you know protected by some you know group of like uh you know five out of nine people or whatever the number is where if they uh wants to um you know go and grab up here uh 29 million uh dollars and uh in enjoy a retirement in some tropical beach country that's not Montenegro then you know you don't really have much defense against that uh so it's uh you know seeing I think you know oligon may cry so much progress uh from uh just in terms of improving its security waddle over the last couple of years has been uh truly amazing and it's uh something that I am you know look forward to seeing the the rest of the layer 2 ecosystem to us while bread and uh I mean yeah I'm just like excited to or see um you know scaling not just be this kind of theoretical thing but actually be something that ethereum already has solved in practice such against me thanks so much well it's a magic of engineering engineering's I mean we we are not real so we are not that theoretical we are just taking the theory are just bringing to the role solve real problems and uh whenever when I entered the space you know it's just for me was amazing but because okay this this you can do so many things but actually when you want to do the things you get you just start discovering the limitations of the street so okay but I want to use this because I think it's amazing so uh this is what that was actually working on is okay what we need what we need to put this amazing technology in in in people's hands and and and extend that to that any anybody in the in the world can can use it and and well you see there are many things but security uh I mean uh usability but but skimming was fundamental if you can do uh just uh I don't know 30 transactions per second and this is not enough it's not enough for the world but certainly not even for us a relatively small community so how how do we have to do I have been thinking a lot about that you know State channels we think about the plasma there are a lot of Air Force happens and and when growups you know remember this people uh just working on they say they are happens okay it's like we start seeing the light and it's like okay this is a it's a path there okay at the execution department and and and okay it's all off bath but but we just took this part now with your foundation I think he's doing a great advance in the uh that availability yeah and so on and the the the the ecosystem is also working out on these Roll-Ups and these layer tools and and everything is looking that but everything is looking that uh we in in in in in in no in few years we can have this uh uh this technology available to to the to the peoples and and that's I think that's that's what's about foreign guys this this was really great uh maybe let's go just a little bit deep a little bit more Technical and and uh as we see uh recently there there have been multiple projects that started working on ZK VM and we have polygon and I'm sure italic as well we are very happy that that's the case but uh that uh introduced the need for a little bit of clarity uh ideally what ZK vmes are there some different types of zkavm and italic recently introduced talked a lot on that front by publishing what what was about four different types of ZK VMS in basically that we're introducing at least some initial nomenclature for for this great technology and I wanted to ask you guys a little bit more um about that you can chime in both you vitalik and Jordi first about as polygon ZK VM varieties which type of ZKA limit is uh what is going to be in the future and and maybe about the nomenclature itself metallic if you were now from this perspective would you consider changing anything in the nomenclature and uh just generally how you feel about about the whole Elementary basically does it mean for example that uh the type 1 is by default the best solution or it's not that black and white uh chat about that a little bit in the context of polygons and in general about uh nomenclature objectives and then maybe you already answered the polygon question first yeah I I mean uh we are I think that was is this this blog post about classifying I think this clarify a lot of things because at the moment there were a lot of different Roll-Ups doing different things you know the marketing people just putting things and bringing and this clarify a lot because at the end from the technical perspective is is what it is and and and and the things in the case of the polygon we Define ourselves as a type three I think we feel very good in the type 3 and we are going in the direction to be a type 2 that's a little bit uh the path that we are so uh the idea is to get closer and closer to ethereum we want to implement uh some break compiled smart contracts that are not uh ready yet and there are some I mean some small details uh uh you know this new type of transactions and there are some of the things that we want to get closer uh to that to that to that truck we are going in a direction and I think this is a good this is a good uh activity the fact that for example in your system the people don't have to bring use the don't have to reuse the the tooling so they'll have to produce a different tooling so they can reuse all the ethereum tooling so you just use a solid your nutrition remix or just use and you just build that you just connect with the human you go there this compatibility uh it's really good for the end for band user so I think this is a good uh compromise uh for having a lot of users using that's it yeah so I guess so from my perspective like the way that you would so that I would summarize the type system in like one sentence is basically that the the lower the number of the type is the closer it is to a like basically being an exact copy of uh ethereum CVM and uh the higher the number of the type is the further away from that idios but the reason why you might want to do a higher type evm is because either it's easier to develop or because uh if you would make Duo some things that are a bit different from the evm then you can get some efficiency benefits that they get that you can't do otherwise right so like the difference between type 1 and type 2 for example as type 1 requires like perfect compatibility to the point where you can verify ethereum's existing execution layer and that involves some like very fairly snark unfriendly things like uh potentially verifying a huge amounts of catch act right um and if you want you could go and like replace catch up with some more Stark Stark Stark friendly hash function right and that's something that's possible but and like is probably is the correct thing to do for earlier twos today and like five years from now probably will be even the correct technician for the layer one uh but it's uh it does mean that today you're not going to be the same layer one anymore right um so I think like my view of what the ideal is is I think the ideal for sdkvi implementation is for it to be configurable and support all the types right like I think in a DLC KVM would have settings so that if you want you can turn it on to run with a you know catchy Miracle Patricia tree and that it can verify ethereum blocks or you can set it to run with some more ZK optimized stuff and uh you know it'll be more efficient for you it'll have like it might even have different breaching piles and you know depending on what you want and you'd be able to kind of choose you know how to what extent you want compatibility and to what extent you want efficiency in like that could be a like that should be more of a project by project choice and uh I think it should be possible to make ckvl implementations that kind of like make it possible to um to hit all sides of that and I feel like it probably shouldn't be too hard to do that if you're like starting from the higher types and moving toward the lower types right because you uh like you you had your previous code anyway right so you just kind of make it open either way I did myself the exercise to say okay you get all this technology because what you're doing this if you haven't learned a lot it's just a challenge every every week and it's like okay with this technology it's if you want to do okay forget about uh big ethereal compatible and let's try to do a a deficient role and listen let's see how we would do it and the interesting thing is that I would not change many things uh you know the the way that we were able to optimize them there are things that problem yes I know there are things like memory alignment things that are a little bit tricky in ethereum and and probably I would remove some of these pieces but not that many uh uh you know the way that we are Computing for example or even uh adiabatics in different bright Fields the way that we are Computing ketchups or whatever we've been putting hash vultures the way that we are uh working with the storage the way that we are executing the programs and uh yeah I mean yeah it could be some differences but it should not be it's much less that I could I was I I you may think when you stop it uh and that's because the the great of optimization that uh that we get just and be compatible so for us it's the requirement is okay we want to be ethereum compatible uh so uh that's the specification so let's see what we can do with that and and we know that much in in this process that so we we come up to some really good tricks and really good algorithms that okay this is even better that if we were but if we were doing something different to that so that's a little bit the the conclusions that that that they're getting there of course I mean this is Delphi exactly it's a spectrum of things which should go like piece by piece but in many pieces is uh it should not be very different thanks a lot guys I would have so many uh questions if you listen to this but make let's just touch on one and then we can slowly wrap it up because we have to adhere to this thing I guess uh so um we are very happy that we deliver this right and we uh have we believe we are the only minutes ready right if you have a multiple external mode it's multiple internal audits Bishop test net that's just been running for months and and uh all of that uh but still it's very important to say that this is very complex technology this is new technology that hasn't been delivered before and uh it's important to be responsible all right uh with that in mind uh Vitali published another post version where he speaks about uh proposed basically milestones for for zkv and roll ups or Roll-Ups in general when it comes to introducing or slowly removing some sort of training wheels and security measures so I know we have a basic security Focus panel in a while uh but if you can just one in one sentence maybe share thoughts also about maybe this italic uh proposed uh roadmap or or model and just anything in general about the KVM when it comes to this responsible yeah sure um so I think uh like that that block or well magician's post was also motivated by just like seeing this kind of confusion and uh you know definitely this kind of like weird marketing situation where there are you know a lot of different projects in this space so that uh call themselves away or twos and uh you know they're like people don't really understand like what actually makes cellular tool here too what makes it not only or two would be accelerator to a decentralized and like and all of these things right and that the goal of uh the poster was basically to kind of you know help people sort of like zero in on like the thing that matters which is security right and uh the thing that matters insecurity which is basically this kind of complicated trade-off of uh you know when do you trust put more trust in the people and uh when do you put more trust in the code right and it said it's like a complicated trade-off to navigate especially because we're dealing with this uh you know fairly young technology that's uh in fwa house bugs and uh probably is going to continue to have bugs for some time uh but basically yeah you know the challenge is like on the one hand um you know we want to actually get start moving away from um you know just that systems that clean to be aware too is but actually just like require it completely trusting some small committee right like we don't actually want to set somewhere a yet four or seven multi-section that you know run off with uh 29 million dollars and have a vacation in a tropical island country uh but uh at the same time like you know we want to try to do it responsibly and that if you kind of you know on day one uh just uh just to get ahead of everyone else um you know push out a release and say okay guys code is one um and then uh you know people uh throw in 29 billion dollars and then it turns out that there's a bug then like that's pretty bad too right and so I think that what I tried to do is kind of uh structure things and uh identify a couple of uh middle grounds right so the three stages that I did that identified well I call them stage zero stage one and stage two and Stage zero is basically like full trust the people right so basically something that has kind of like the scaffolding of a roll-up and uh you know you get some insurance actions you have backup channels you have all these things but at the same time you know there is some kind of override mechanism and like ultimately the override mechanism can decide where the money goes with a 51 threshold right so it's like a full training wheels thing stage two basically says you're fully running on the code now there is like kind of one to once that I did I'll kind of allowing the stage two definition which is that said you can what you can do is have a mechanism where if someone can prove that the code disagrees with itself then you can flip an emergency switch and uh what a yeah uh you know humans come in right but and like could disagreeing with itself could happen in two different ways right like you could have two different ZK VMS you could have one ckv admin the switch would be like if someone can successfully prove two different state routes for the same data like you know there's lots of different ways to do this or on the other side if no one submits a valid thing for an entire week right that might that would also suggest that something is broken uh but other otherwise like if the code is uh but the idea would be that if the code is running correctly the humans have no ability to over uh to override the code right and like that's a long-term goal but that like requires being like pretty confident in the code and the code's ability to not have like certain kinds of really serious bugs stage one is this kind of middle ground right where basically it's kind of like halfway in between right where for stage zero you need 51 percent of these humans uh two uh you know override and move money to wherever they want for stage two you need a hundred and one percent of the humans right 101 greater than 100 so you can do it and then for stage one you need 75 percent of the humans uh so the uh the thing that I suggested was uh at least six of eight where there's uh enough people in that multi-sig that are outside of the organization so that the organization by itself can't just uh go and move the funds were over at once so um and uh with this kind of threshold like you still have the ability to intervene if things really go wrong right and like I've uh like I've been in multi-six a lot right and like if really serious stuff happens then like you know generally yeah you you pretty quickly can get almost anyone right it's like almost everyone especially if their professional but um you know at the same time it's like uh like getting to something like it's much harder for 75 percent of people in the code and decide to go to a tropical island than it is for 50 right so you know it's this kind of middle and my goal for 2023 has been that like I want the layer two ecosystem to basically move to at least the equivalent of stage one and I think it's okay to stay in stage one for a pretty long time right because I think you know we do wants to be confident that the technology Works before we put even more trust in it but like if you don't have like like if you're in stage zero then you're basically not like really yet giving any decision making power to the code at all right and like it doesn't really matter if you're SDK Rob or an optimistic roll-up or what kind of roll-up ultimately you're just a multi-state controlled by the security Council so in stage one you're basically saying okay well you know we have an actual proof system and the proof system has actual power but we don't necessarily get it'll quite give it all the power and you know if uh there there is room for some Security Council if there is like the strong agreement inside it to override what they had what the proof system says in case of a bug and so I think like stage one is this nice middle grounds where you know we're not just talking about these very centralized things that we've had so far we're talking about like actual proof systems whether they're optimistic or ck that have teeth and that actually have like a a strong influence in what happens on chin but at the same time you know we leave some room for error and uh we don't kind of trust things fully and like this is something that I think should be achievable for um you know but uh at least many uh both you know ZK VM and uh opposite optimistic evm projects this year right like I've I've also talked to a couple of a couple other ones and like I know arbitrum for example they want to like open up their approved system uh real really soon and um I think they have some uh um Security Council parameters that are like even more stringent than uh what the yes what the stage one requirements are um so you know I would love to see polygon you know really join the stage one Camp soon as well and uh you know really yeah I kind of set the standard for like hey you know you have to have an outshopper system the proof system has to actually run in the proof system has to actually have some teeth but you know like still in a way where we still have uh you know we're not kind of like starting the trust over from zero to 100 from day one and we and you know we can be a bit careful and uh still uh you know how kind of screwed for a couple of years while we yeah make sure that everything really is completely safe and then we keep going forward from there the just to make sure here that in polygons uh well it's a stage one actually we change this morning it was foreign and uh but we are the cool thing is that we are quite preparedness of the cold perspective uh to the unit H2 actually we could be a stage two if you what of course we don't read to be before until we feel safe and we want at least uh but one of the pieces the pieces that we are missing to be a stage two is well first of all we need to enable the we need to enable the the force transactions we will probably will uh in a few weeks because it's an important Mega Millions but this is something that uh we disabled the last we need for some issues but we will enable it uh two in two three weeks probably there is another thing is removing this skill switch this is probably the the hardest part because I mean we need to think comfortable that uh that the security is there so this will probably stay we are setting that I want to be running the the uh the system at least six months without finding any critical uh issue at least so that's so that's we will take a little bit while that and the other is the the the time log for The credibility red bow is the days uh with the two uh increase that to 30 days but this is So the plan is there it's more about getting an uh comfortability we will continue running you know about multis and probably some upgrades in there so we'll stay here for a while yeah no I mean yeah I definitely really appreciate the commitment to security and I'm like you know I'm so happy that uh you know we finalize him you know have a way or two with teeth are running on mainnet now so you know Victory graduations there thank you thank you so much both again uh I can just share my humble opinion I totally agree uh as we saw like as Robbie said uh polygons is formally I guess type one um sorry a state a stage one when it comes to these wheels and I totally agree with that uh um this targeting uh basically stage one for 2023 as as you said vitalik is the the Rises the the optimal and responsible approach because we really want to uh uh transition to to full safety gradually right and full permissionless uh Solutions um great this has been a fantastic discussion thanks you guys thank you guys so much and just if you have any posting messages or anything that you would like to share with the community any sort of message or or advice or anything and then we can slowly wrap it up my site is just give a try I mean just uh it's a network a new network there it's a ckvian there so if you are a developer if you are a user and just make a try and see how simple it is just to to build on top of uh on top of the polygons again yeah yeah I mean I I mean I have tried like sending two transactions and it's been pretty easy so far so you know I do recommend um I think Sports race rules digital
