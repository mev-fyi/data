[Music] [Applause] [Music] um so next up we have a amazing panel we're going to talk about komorevi fund and how everything that they're doing is set up from anywhere from logistics to the divisions and the goals and just the overall history of starting uh the fun so um with us we have three amazing panelists we have monty kenjo and metta who are going to be talking about how they got everything started and without further ado we'll uh we'll welcome them on stage and i think we're having a slight technical difficulty with one panelist so we'll be able to loop them in and put them live in about a few seconds but uh in the meantime i'll welcome all of you thanks karthik hi thanks so much for having us uh monty's just joining her laptop just died so she's joining from her phone okay um i think we can kind of preface this by just saying um today's all about thousand governance and uh we've kind of covered a handful of things around how those are set up from a legal standpoint to the the aspirational standpoint of like cool things that they can do to bring on people together and i think you are in a pretty good intersection of doing interesting things that tie both the real world and the crypto world together uh primarily funding people reaching out to an audience that either is underlooked or just that doesn't get always like the right channels to kind of go into uh to be successful and and on top of that there's a whole set of world around tooling and logistics and how do you manage something at scale the way everything is set up so there's like 50 different topics here um and i think maybe uh the best thing to do would be just to start off by telling everybody what the fund is and how it got started and in the meantime we hope that once is able to join um that's how we get going so from here that sounds that sounds great um i can kick things off so thanks for having us today we're really excited um my name is kenjal i'm an investor in the broader blockchain ecosystem at blockchain capital and earlier this year i kind of had this um just revelation that i wasn't meeting as many female founders as i wanted to and wasn't investing as much into that cohort of founders and so i started hosting office hours um and so every month i chat with you know anywhere between five and ten um women i actually just crossed 50 um sessions this month and it's been honestly one of the most rewarding things that i did this year and so i was super excited to start connecting with more women um and then an opportunity came along where i got connected to meta and monsie about actually going the next step and starting to invest in women and so um that's really how we got connected and started to think through the formation of komoribi and well we'll talk a little bit more about that but but that's my my um sort of beginning in formation cool and yeah i'm glad monty could join um we're just going over introductions right now so i'm meta um i spent most of my time in the blockchain space as a developer working on the cello ecosystem um but when i first joined the space around 2016 2017 i think it was like very very apparent then that there just weren't enough women or underrepresented minorities in general in the space at the time so very similarly to kindle like i wanted to do something about it so me and my friends back in college alexis galba and sarah reynolds we decided to make shoe 256 which is a 501c3 nonprofit that's dedicated to increasing diversity in the blockchain space so we do this through like a variety of different ways mostly around mentorship community building and educational content and so this did a lot of stuff around increasing the top of the funnel and increasing like exposure to the crypto space and bringing in a lot more women and underrepresented minorities but it didn't really necessarily tackle issues with women that were already in the space and so that's something i was really passionate about especially as i spent more and more time in the space and i met really cool women who were doing cool things but constantly cited things like you know finding it hard to get funding finding it hard to hire and recruit other women and things like that and so it had been in the books for a really long time for g256 to explore something like a venture fund to invest in female and non-binary founders but we kind of just always put it on the back burner and didn't like think too much about it but then i think in the past year especially with dows and stuff exploding i think we just realized that this could be a really cool method to just jump start this whole initiative and we got connected to kim joel and monsi who had really similar views um by ian who runs syndicate um and we just realized that we all care about the same things and it just like made sense and so this kind of just started from one call a couple months ago maybe at the beginning of last year and spiraled into this like whole thing and we ended up raising money and creating this entire collective where we're able to pull in kind of like crowdsource not just funding but also the resources that all of our dow members bring into the table and um kind of created a venture down which we can kind of go into the structure a little bit more later i think i missed the initial part but we are doing intros okay yeah yeah just introductions and and kind of how you uh came to this yeah yeah i'm having terrible luck with laptops today but i'm here um and glad to be here thank you for having us um at eat online my backgrounds you know in mostly in the traditional finance space um having worked on wall street um large banks um and as i was transitioning into the crypto space you know very similar uh experiences like what made i mentioned um i realized quickly that we were repeating a lot of the mistakes and biases that the traditional finance base has and in terms of just you know lack of diversity lack of opinions from different people and realized there was a need for um you know an organization where women can come together learn about the space just feel empowered to contribute uh to the crypto space and so you know i'm mission at women in blockchain which i founded around 2016 um is pretty similar to what cheater 56 is doing and that's why we have a lot of alignment but we really want to empower more minorities um to join the space and contribute in meaningful ways and again we do that through educational initiatives and one of the things that we've worked with sheet of 56 in the past is a beginner's guide to blockchain which yeah you should check it out if you're new to the space um but today we will be talking more about komarabi um i won't repeat most of the things that neda said i think you know uh really we wanted to make an impact not just in the founding landscape uh in the crypto space by funding um female founder companies but also the funding landscape how can we get together really smart uh talented passionate women and you know enable them and empower them to become investors uh in their own right so that's that's where our mission is um at komaru we will be talking a lot more about that but i think um it wasn't last year we i think started talking about it just like maybe a month or two before we launched it so that just talks you know how crazy and how quick the setup for a dow can be and compared to a traditional vc firm uh where you know the setup process the costs are prohibitive um and we went about doing this i think in less than a couple weeks the fundraise was maybe less than a week it's it's uh insane how much styles are enabling these days but i'll i'll pause there yeah i think it's maybe a good segue just to talk about the differences between doing a venture fund versus a dow like i think the cost is a big component but i think the second i think bigger conversation is really around governance and user contribution traditional funds are structured in a way where the folks giving capital typically limited partners um are kind of handing over the rights for for investment they're saying you know here's some capital and i trust you my gp my general partner to go and invest that capital into a given you know with a given mandate whereas in a dow it's much more structured like not only are you giving your capital but you're also given a sort of seat at the table when it comes to investment decisions when it comes to the governance of the overall organization um it's just i think a slightly more involved path where it's it's much more oriented i think around like collective investing rather than delegated investing um and so that's to me that's like the main difference is that a lot of the you know not a lot of every single person who is a part of komaribi feels really excited about our vision and about this mission and wants to contribute to that in more ways than just capital and also you know play an active role within the community um so that's kind of i think that the clear differentiation from my perspective in addition to cost as well and just being able to set this up super quickly um what do you guys think yeah um definitely agree on all of those funds i think one um additional advantage for dao structure is just the you know being able to leverage the collective intelligence um we have some really talented folks on our tao um i don't think in a traditional ec setup we would have you know we would be able to kind of dip into this pool of um founders investors um builders in the space i think you know that's beneficial from an investment decision making perspective but also from a portfolio support and um just the kind of support that we can provide to portfolios um you know they're not getting a single partner at obc firm on the cap table they're getting these in our case 36 members that they can really leverage in terms of you know help from fundraising to tokenomics to building to deploying to user experience and i think that's that's really powerful with the dao another thing that i've been noodling on um recently is this uh concept of principal agent problem where you know kenzo tell me if i'm uh incorrect here but in a traditional vc setting there is a principal agent problem where you are managing someone else's money um and that we've seen things go wrong in in various ways where there isn't really as much alignment as we see in terms of skin in the game um in terms of a da where you are really managing your own money and there is a lot more transparency in terms of decision making which you know reduces kind of the areas where people can manipulate the system um and then final component i would say is you know accessibility is really key um traditionally we see returns have been enjoyed by a certain section of society um and really hasn't been accessible to this broad swath of individuals and i think that's really changing now with investment dows yeah no i think i agree with everything you guys said i think the community aspect of running a dow is really fascinating and that's something that we're still trying to understand how to completely tap into because it's just so powerful we've invested in about two companies so far and the things that we can offer our portfolio i think grows exponentially with how big our dow is and i think those individual connections are super super exciting especially because everyone in our dao if you look through the list i just posted um is in very different fields we have a really cool group of investors of crypto native like operators of founders and they're all in different niches um and so they can really give advice to a lot of our founders that i think you know isn't as possible when you're just um getting invested from like a venture fund um so that part of it is really cool also before we move to the next topic i just wanted to say like feel free to ask questions in the chat we'd love for this to be super engaging and like a conversation so if you have any burning questions about komorubi's or taos in general or about us please ask them here yeah absolutely um maybe this is like a good point for us to like talk a little bit more about how we set komoribi up and um certain challenges we might have on the dow side or areas that we think have been like gone smoother um yeah maybe just like thinking through like some of the the practical like logistics and formation of it um do you wanna start do you wanna start go for it yeah um i was gonna say one of the things i found most interesting was that tech wasn't the biggest issue so going into it i thought in running a dao the tech would be the biggest inhibitor like we need to set up a dow and then figure out like you know how to do like token disbursements and like do we want a token for the down things like that but i realized like which made me really happy as a developer that the tech has at least gone to the point where we can abstract away a lot of the crypto and that is not the hardest part at all like you can create a multi-sig safe really really fast we use gnosis there's so many other other options as well um and basically have everyone set up with a crypto wallet so that they can be a signer and in the most bare-bones sense that that is a dow um but i think what i didn't expect was like the human coordination aspect of it to be so hard so like everything from like rallying votes to like communication so just basic organizational and governance government like makeup so you know kind of how do we divide up the votes how do we communicate decisions and make large decisions while still making sure that we've reached quorum how do we um get everyone to be super engaged um and also how do we enable people to i guess um you know enable their passions but also in the construct of like the bandwidth that they have so everyone joins a dao from their free time right now right like especially komoribe it's completely volunteer run and so we want to make sure that people feel empowered to be able to contribute as much as they want and as little as they want while still maintaining some form of a structure so basically we kind of evolved to have this core and larger member structure so there's five of us that are core members so like three of us on this call as well as eva and christy and so the five of us basically just make sure that operationally we're running we're like um talking to founders like all of our like um the pipeline is set up so that everyone in the dow has access to all the same information and things like that and do a lot of the communications and then the broader dow kind of has like the most information possible to make an educated decision once a company comes to vote on whether we want to fund them or not and that has worked out quite well the past couple months but i can see this also being iterated on the next couple months as well yeah i would just say i think like there's a question here about our investment process and how much you invest um i think one of the best ways to leverage the dow has been helping with deal sourcing and just like having so many different experts around the table we've got folks that are at other funds we have folks that are in d5 that are in the nft space that are on other chains you know ethereum solana whatever it might be and so it's been really interesting to just have like a broader group bring in referrals for deals for you know companies that you might want to invest in i think we've um our pipelines we've since we've launched we've probably chatted um with a few dozen founders and we've probably had like 50 or 60 um potential opportunities coming through the pipeline which has been really really amazing to see um and then sort of on the tail end making sure that we have all information available for the broader dow to help vote and make a decision on and making sure that the core team is kind of lazing in the middle there to help out with diligence and help out with um founder conversation so i think that like um you know broader at the top and at the at the bottom structure has been really useful yeah and just um reflecting on what meda said in terms of challenges definitely human coordination but um i think that's a challenge across all dao's how do you ensure that members are contributing to the dao what are their incentives how do you design for those incentives um and something that we've been talking about internally as well how do we motivate our members to meaningfully contribute to the dow i think you know given this this is a hackathon that's something i would encourage people to think about is tooling um you know since we launched definitely the tooling in the space has grown um in terms of just managing the operations in terms of managing voting and governance systems and then also um engaging the community members but i think that there's there's still a lot of room to grow um and a lot of opportunities to kind of build in that segment um [Music] yeah uh in you know in terms of we kind of spoke through our investment process i think that there is a range across us our dao is you know so relatively small we are 36 members um there are doubts out there with hundreds and thousands of members and those challenges kind of grow as uh dao's scale um so that's that's i think one of the biggest things that we are thinking about in terms of just how do we get members actively contributing on an ongoing basis and i don't believe that everyone will contribute equally and that's i don't think that's a possibility um we just need to identify who are these core members how do you incentivize them how do you kind of um motivate them to continue contributing in a meaningful manner i think um maybe we can talk a little bit about like some of the investments that we've made so far or you know kind of how we're thinking about investing into the future um so we've made we've made two investments one one is public apricot finance which is founded by cecilia who's a amazing founder they're a lending protocol built on solana that i think is going to be doing some really innovative work in the lending space we're really excited about that and then the other protocol is um actually in the dow tooling space but uh we haven't disclosed it yet so we're um not able to publicly sort of share that investment but i think so far we've been we've been thinking about our check sizes as being kind of like a larger angel size check so we're writing at you know anywhere from like 25k to 100k check sizes and then i think you know as the dow scales over time we'll think about like how our potential investment you know amount might scale as well um but the process i think has been really straightforward just in a sense that everybody has different strengths and different areas of expertise and so we're really leveraging everyone around the table to make sure that we can um diligence opportunities appropriately and then kind of move forward with an investment and we're you know investing both on the token side as well as in the equity side so there's no real limitations on that front and we're open internationally as well so we're really um flexible when it comes to geography as well anything else i'm missing guys on the investment side um no not at all i i was just going to add that i think this is another benefit of like our kind of like general fund approach we're able to be super chain agnostic but um still get money in a very like crypto native way and i think that's super cool so all of our investments so far we're actually in the final stages of our third investment they're actually all on different chains which i think is so cool and i haven't really seen a lot of venture funds do um and that just goes to show like i think there's so many cool women and non-binary folks working all across the board on very different niches and we just haven't tapped that market yet so it's cool seeing all the steel flow come in that you know spans so many different niches looks like we have a question about legal structure oh sorry go ahead go ahead monty i was just gonna go back to the earlier question briefly before we jump into the legal question um around you know how do you think about setting up a dial and i kind of think of it as a four-step process and let me know if i'm missing something the first is just identifying what is the mission of your data what's kind of the objective for your data and we've seen arranged you know dials that do collector dials which are you know just focused around nfps investment dollars have their own motivation grants focus does um there's a whole range of those social doubts um so you know first and foremost is just identifying what's that objective and then recruiting a community that's equally passionate recruiting a group of people that really believe in a similar mission that you kind of stacked out with um the second component is fundraising everything needs money um so just you know being able to bring in these passionate folks investors who are willing to kind of put money where their mouth is um that's i think the second component the third biggest component is governance and i think that's where the dow space i think is still evolving a lot um you know how do you do about go about voting how do you go about decision making being proposal process um and then i think the final component is you know once you've identified and set all of this up it's just delivering and you know staying true to your mission so and that's how i think about setting up my dao but let me know if i missed anything yeah no i think that that covered it um yeah i was just going to go to this legal question it's funny you mention it because when we talked about struggles i think kendall muncie and i all agree that the hardest struggle is probably the legal aspect um i think yeah like definitely a lot um especially because it's just there's so such few lawyers in the space who will like not only understand crypto but understand daos in particular and can help us with disney's questions like this whole space is an experiment but daos in particular are very very new um and also because they're like organizations and kind of trying to rival things like companies and llc's and things like that it's getting harder and harder to kind of um get the regulation to a point where it's caught up with the technology so i think in the next couple months and years we're gonna see a lot of changes in this so like what we say now is probably not even gonna like make sense a year from now but for us at least we wanted to be as protected as possible and i know a lot of dows have taken different approaches to this um some have kind of incorporated in europe or latin america where the regulations are different some have not incorporated at all and kind of just function on chain and kind of hope for the best but we wanted to be as protected as possible especially because we were investing in companies um so we actually ended up incorporating like we have like an llc that basically encapsulates all of like the dao's work um and then everyone who's in the dao has signed like an operating agreement to be um someone who like works in the llc or works with the llc um and then beyond that all of our agreements are very standard like similar to just how a normal venture fund would um get token grants or equities so like we've invested um i think safe so far um but it kind of just depends on the the standard that the company is using to raise um but i think what i would say is the hardest part was like um kind of like the accredited investor piece making sure that we like are not just one entity but every single dow member falls under this category um and things like that i don't know if you guys have anything to add there yeah and i just i just want to say that um i get the irony of you know dows being for everyone and then us having an investment hour only accredited investors are our members um and i really hope that we get to a point you know where where this is much more of an open standard where investment dows are um brought much more broadly applicable but i think it's going to be baby steps in crypto you know there's definitely going to be um shades of gray when it comes to the regulatory landscape and just kind of understanding protections and so in this particular instance like this is definitely an experiment and so we're trying to ensure that everybody um around the table has you know full protection and and therefore that's kind of the path that we've chosen um maybe i guess we can there's a couple more questions coming in so there's one question that's asking about common observations as we've taken pitch meetings maybe is there a difference between talking to a pitch um for the dao versus for blockchain capital um i guess like the only thing that i'll say and this is a blanket statement for broader just just the industry in general and across many different industries is that um there's definitely a confidence gap and women are so qualified for the roles that they're going for and come in and i think there's just i think a little bit of a difference in some of the confidence that i see where somebody who's like incredibly qualified might still not be 100 sure if they should take the leap and start the company and so i love being in that position where i'm like you know i've talked to hundreds of founders like you can do this this is absolutely the right you know like you're thinking about about this the right way um so i think that's something that i've noticed in conversations a little bit more on the dow side but in general i would say the process is run very similar i think the founder conversations are very similar um everybody is um yeah it you know we're we're all kind of working towards the same goal of building the future of this space so i think it's been pretty it's been pretty um apples to apples except for that that one thing which i think is a broader observation yeah and just adding to that i think um at least personally i've noticed um female founders being a lot more comfortable um in pitch meetings with us um you know as they see you know female visas that they are talking to um and i think that's reflective in the numbers right i was speaking to not gonna name names but i was speaking to a large investment friend in in the crypto space and i'm just talking you know sharing notes about deal flow um and like kendra mentioned we've already seen 50 plus companies come through um to cover ib and they haven't seen that much deal flow in two years which we've seen in i think less than three months um so there's something you know there where we've set our mission we've been really intentional in terms of what we want to fund um and that has attracted um the right to right people yeah i really like what you said monty around like seeing like female faces as like the check writers so when we were looking at the data for all of this apparently 65 of all venture funds um still don't have any female czech writers so no like female vc's so not only is there a problem like you know with like we need more female founders but there also aren't enough female vcs and that's for like many different reasons um but i think these two stats are very very tied because for example female vcs are twice as likely to fund another female founder so i think because our like well all the core team is female but also our dao is more than 50 female um like on the much higher end and i think that just makes us way more well positioned to be investing in female and non-binary folks um i think people do feel a lot more comfortable with us and i think what's cool is that a lot of the times we're the first check going into a company or the first check in their bigger round um and so i think the onus is really on us to give these founders a good experience and to show them like crypto is for you you can found in crypto and be successful and i think that like because we're such a early precede fund um we get that cool opportunity to meet these founders and continue to push them along um so that they're able to raise like a c drought a series a series b all of that yeah absolutely um and i guess in terms of finding vc funds that are compatible with your your project and vision um i think the way i think about it is uh finding a venture investor is kind of like dating a little bit you're probably gonna have a lot of conversations and ultimately the partners that you choose are um going to be with you for a long time right this is like a long-term relationship that you're building oftentimes your investors are with you for you know five to ten years if not longer and so i think like it's super important to make sure that you're having as many conversations as possible i think aligning early on on what's important to you as a founder and what your vision is and how you want to see the company kind of evolve over time or the protocol evolve over time is important um i think like a lot of a lot of venture funds have so many they have just so many different um perspectives to offer right on the table there's there's many different partners or you know just investors in general and so i think understanding who like your um one or two or multiple people are within a fund that you really connect with and that you feel like you you have a relationship that you can build over time i think is is super important um i'm sure there's more to add here but curious about what you guys think i think um you know i agree with what kim joel said i think one thing that we've actively done again is but i mentioned leveraging our current down network to identify you know um i mentioned we have founders angel investors we see funds within our dao community um and so what we try and do is make those connections to condos that we've identified that we want to invest in and that's how you know really finding those mission aligned vcs is um but we would love to extend that i think that's a conversation that we are having with syndicate as to how can different taos kind of come together work with each other leverage each other's networks um doubts that have similar mission um you know especially investment dials how can they work together i think you know that's what's exciting about the crypto space in general is that the space evolves so quickly and there's just so much experimentation to be done um but there was there's this one question i wanted to get there was um you know what do we think about taos disrupting vcs i think that gets thrown a lot around a lot um i can quickly determine um you know as to what i think i i personally don't think that taos would completely disrupt overseas um in the traditional form i think there is space for um how vcs function right now but i do think that there is um you know we are at i think eight billion dollars in dallas right now the space is growing and there is um definitely a tension that we need to pay uh towards uh the investment dial ecosystem um because i think more and more the deals are going to get snagged especially in the crypto space by investment dollars and there isn't going to be a lot of allocation left for traditional ec so if they really want to get involved in in the crypto space i think that's that's going to be uh definitely a competition that they'll see but kendall peter what do you think about disrupting these um i think i'm more on the extreme end like i think vc is going through a fundamental shift right now and i don't think venture capital the way it exists now will exist in the next 10 to 20 years um and my vision honestly is for the way vc works now especially in crypto to just not exist i think um i don't know if it's daos that are the future or what but i definitely think moving towards a more like decentralized way of funding protocols just makes a lot more sense and there's just a lot more value um and i think you're seeing that already with things like komaribi where you know we have like a cool pool of investors who have their own funds have their own projects maybe your founders but are able to pull in their money and their experience to help kind of the next generation of founders and i think that honestly is going to be the future and um similar to what kim joel said like i really hope we get to a point in regulation where you know the accredited investor stuff is less of an issue and kind of who is able to invest in companies um like the barrier for that goes down a lot so now anyone is able to invest um and i think we're already seeing this in the traditional world with like angel syndicates becoming more and more strong um you're also seeing even just in traditional cap tables like the angel allocation is going up a lot more and you're seeing like multiple lead investors in every round instead of just like one big name for clout um and i think people are realizing that it takes like a village to build a community and a company and so like you know having one venture fund is maybe not the way to do it um but yeah that those are just my thoughts i think yeah i i think i tend to fall on the same side um of extremes as as you're saying i think like just one other point um that i think is interesting about daos in particular is and and like the broader crypto ecosystem is that um you know traditionally in tech you've you can join a company you'll get equity in that company and you're kind of ex you know your equity exposure is limited to one particular um entity and in crypto you might be able to contribute and be a part of multiple projects whether that's via dao's or just you know from an engineering perspective joining protocol teams like whatever it might be i think we're starting to see this like portfolio emerge where you're not necessarily limited to like one company at a time but you might be able to contribute to multiple projects at any given time and it's like you know that's your portfolio of um investments right it's like you're contributing with your time your capital your effort everything all together um and so i definitely agree with the idea that like angel investing is becoming more and more common i think the barriers to entry there are getting lower um and i think like individual um angel investors are really proving out like what value can be had from having a single entity on your table on your cap table like a single person versus like the fund value prop and so i think we're going to see that perpetuate a little bit more into the crypto space where um you're going to have like dows with like a very specific offering come onto your cap table and provide that service like you know we are like the i don't know we're like the design dow and when we invest in you we also provide you like design services or we're you know we invest in xyz and like this is our core focus and this is how we contribute to you so um i'm expecting all sorts of shake-ups i'm really excited about it i think it's gonna be really fun to invest in the next 10 15 years of the space and just um be a part of this entire you know ecosystem yeah i know i love that and i also think there's something to be said about the human aspect i just feel like at least in my experience dao's seem to be more approachable like as a venture fund and they're not as general i think crypto funds are a little bit different because they're very specific and a lot of them have specific niches but vc in general i feel like they're so broad that it's almost hard for you to help even if you want to in the way that a company needs versus a dow kind of to the original question asker's point like they can really reflect your company's vision and your project's vision in a way that is very like bespoke to what you're doing versus like a kind of like one-size-fits-all venture fund just might not be able to like they can provide you money but that's like kind of it and so i think we're going to see more and more of that like angel what you're talking about where maybe you go to a larger investor for like purely money but you're going to these dows specifically for kind of like a give and take like yeah you get money and investment but in return you also get um this entire like suite of services um like hiring is another one that i've seen is super popular there's also like a marketing now um there's like so many other models that i think we just like haven't explored yet um and then going back to the human aspect i think it's so much cooler to be like oh we're like talking to these individuals who happen to be a part of the style but are also just like cool people in their own right and are able to like help me run my company in this very specific way um which i've just noticed those those like human human interactions facilitated much more via dows than a traditional fund yeah and i think there is you know the recent growth in just terms of um diversity diversity intensive contributors to the crypto space that we've seen um you know initially it started as this like niche cyberpunk moment elite crypto nerds coming together and working on this technology because it was really technology first i think we've seen that shift from like really technology focused to human focus with nfps and dials and i think a lot of the recent growth in terms of you know just new people artists creators coming to the space we can attribute to um just um the idea of nfd is the idea of taos where right now we are focusing on the human aspect of this technology so i'm super excited in terms of where we are in in the whole crypto ecosystem awesome um this was a really good note to end everything on i feel like uh through a couple other things that are some of these some quicker questions but i'll actually not ask that what i'll do is i'll ask this question which i've been asking everybody here today is um not even specific to coma rebbe but what are some tooling that you think will be super helpful for you to make your lives easier to manage the fun or anything else that you're part of as we kind of do with dao's what are some things that come to mind or what are some obvious pain points i can i can start um one thing that i think about a lot is like the like the value chain of um getting into a dow and then some of like the action items that you need to do so getting onboarded talking to members connecting with members um i think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit like this is super simple but i would love if there was an easy tool where i could see what dao's a person is a part of like you could filter by person and say oh like they're part of these three dows like i'm literally talking about like a directory here that would be so cool um or like a really great way for me to like share um like a dallas holdings and be able to look at like okay what does the treasury look like um i know you can go look at like a gnosis but i think if there was like a front end that you know you could track over time and there's different tools but you know i think a lot of this is happening very um you know like ad hoc i think uh it's just there needs to be a little bit more cohesion yeah um so i would just say like think about the steps it takes to like get involved in endow and then like what is like what are some of like the the quickest and easiest wins that um i think we need in a space that we're yeah that i think will improve like the overall ux yeah and just um expanding that directory idea and it'll also be cool to not just see which you know taos uh particular person's involved with but what their contributions are it essentially replaces the traditional resume right um to being able to see what they've done in the past as you are kind of on boarding them to your dial um so that's one another thing that i mentioned briefly initially is just uh how do we incentivize down members and tooling around that like it would be really cool if a dow member is contributing and we can drop an nfp as an appreciation token or um you know contribute to you know just tokens within the dao ecosystem so you know anything that helps incentivize contributions and building around that would be exciting to see come out of keep online yeah i agree with all of these i think it would also be cool to this is like so simple but like an off-chain voting mechanism that's specifically created for daos because i realize most decisions actually happen way before you even hit the multisig people don't want to do on chain voting it's like too high friction so either a way to lower the friction there or just like yeah make it easier than like a telegram poll to make off-chain decisions um also just like on the whole cap table management thing i know syndicate is working on this but basically a way for a venture now to see exactly how much of the fund you own which assets you own um how much of the fund you own just like a basic dashboard but it basically pulls in on chain data using your um your ether dress or your gnosis safe address and things like that would be really helpful now that's that's a really obvious good one because uh i'm kind of drawing some parallels on the fact that we had a similar conversation about a year ago with d5 wherever it was okay all the stuff is on chain let's put a dashboard and just do basic reporting so we can see what's happening now it's at a different scale and a much bigger problem but now it's a lot more specific so uh there's a thousand people working on this hackathon i'm hopeful that some of them will tag a lot of these problems but i want to thank all of you today for this amazing conversation one last thing for everybody how can people get in touch with the fund and and you and what is the best way to ping everybody about the next steps yeah maybe we can go through each of our like individual socials and then i'll figure out our link for komaribi um but for me i'm really active on twitter and telegram they're both just my name at maida kotari no spaces or dots yeah same here super active on uh twitter um and my handle is underscore kindle bishop damn we are all living and breathing on crypto twitter as my handled mansi my first name uh elve and bora so you can find me there you can find me on telegram um if you want to get in touch with uh komar raby our handle is komar at komaribi fun and again i just posted yeah i just posted a link to our web page so there you can it's basically a web page hosted on syndicate because we are a syndicate dao and you can actually pitch directly there which will send you to a forum where you can like um insert your slide deck things about your company things like that um and you can also figure out more about our thesis and strategy on this page amazing yeah we just shared that with everybody on the live stream and uh thank you so much this was awesome awesome thank you thank you for having us [Music]
