i mean for me personally i think everybody at the teller would have a similar story in in the fact that they were into something sort of unrelated uh or not developer related before getting into uh crypto but uh me it's even more so like i was a i studied art in in in undergrad and so um how did i end up here it was kind of a a winding road but basically i for the early 2010s sorry we got lights shutting off here at the office uh in about 2013 i started working as a consultant for a a local in baltimore maryland bitcoin startup called bitsy they didn't last very long great guys they were doing um they were creating like merchant services for for local shops in baltimore to accept bitcoin you know they were like really real evangelizers for for for crypto uh um but they were way too early for that it uh was a uphill battle for them but for me they they introduced me to to bitcoin and ethereum uh and uh i was they were paying me in bitcoin which i and i didn't even know at the time i i was just upset at the volatility of this stuff and i wanted i couldn't sell it fast enough because i you know i had to pay my rent uh in bitcoin and and so or i didn't pay in a bitcoin but i had to cash out and i remember waking up one day and i was just furious that it dropped like 20 and i was like this is a rip-off but um but anyway i i end up keeping some of the uh i don't know what's going on with the lights here they think anything again but um yeah anyway i ended up keeping a little bit of it uh enough that it drew my attention um it drew my attention uh to the fact that this this bitcoin was not worth something and so what i did was uh i started to look into it and that's kind of how i got into crypto i think a lot of people got into it through trading as well and so i started to like look at other cryptocurrencies and i dug into ethereum and all the tokens that were coming out in 2017 and 2016. and um so i guess fast forward um i in late 2017 i met my uh would be business partners uh and uh it was someone from my local town and uh he was hosting uh the local bitcoin meetup you know one of these really small town bitcoin meetups that five people show up to have a beer and talk about  coins but i found out he was a developer and and he was just started to start up and wanted to do something with decentralized derivatives on ethereum and i was like whoa what is that you know like oh you can actually do something more than just trade these things around like that was uh at the time was mind-blowing to me and really interesting and i i was a consultant for for small businesses and entrepreneurs and so i loved uh i loved that sort of that whole spirit so i ended up going out for a beer with him and then you know he said i just you know started working at this office this one right here and um i just brought on my my first you know my my friend brenda and she's gonna help out you should come to the office one day and so uh and that's kind of how it started i showed up uh and they had just started this thing called decentralized derivatives association and uh we're building this this derivatives protocol on on ethereum and uh i sort of just stuck around it kept on coming and and worked for free and um i don't know if i'm over answering your question but this is totally leading into the history of teller uh if you want me to go there yeah no i mean that's exactly leading okay yeah yeah i think that's perfect i mean it sounds like sort of you were in a way very early uh member of sort of what has become d5 right in the community and you know being able to have all these different derivatives and things yeah we were really early it was way we like to say we were in d5 before d5 was cool exactly that's true so yeah so you know we'd love to kind of hear about kind of that yeah the rest of that journey i guess yeah yeah yeah so this was um early 2018 now and uh we got an ethereum foundation grant which we were running on uh you know that was our our raise so to speak that's that's how we sort of paid the bills um nick uh so it's nick brenda and i that started teller but we also the ones that started this previous startup i'll tell you a little bit about them they both left the government they worked there we're all from the dc area and they both left the government uh doing uh brenda was doing uh you know uh you could say data science and nick was working for the cftc the uh the derivatives uh regulator regulating body of the united states and so and he was doing research on cryptocurrencies for the cftc and um and they both have they're both economists so they left the government uh as economists to start this startup um in early 2018 and we all got this uh we all sort of quit our day jobs and got this ethereum grant to say like let's make 2018 the year that we make this thing happen um it was originally called dda we rebranded to dxia and um so what we were doing was uh we basically created a protocol where you could lock ethereum into a smart contract and it would issue out uh these tokens that would represent the short and long side of that that asset it could be bitcoin for example so we did short and long bitcoin tokens um and they would last these derivatives would last a week and so at the end of the week the contract would uh well it needed an oracle as you can imagine where i'm leading to but at the end of the uh at the end of the week it would it would settle out and uh those tokens would then be uh you could um redeem them and then that smart contract that was holding the ethereum would divvy divvy the right amounts out to the two parties so at the time you know we were using a centralized oracle and there's a company called oracle eyes uh well actually they're called provable now formally orcalyze and they're a great centralized oracle they it worked really well but for us you know we were saying at the time we were the first decentralized derivatives protocol on ethereum but wait a second are we can we really say that it kind of really stuck in our in our sides a little bit like we we sort of we couldn't stand at that we couldn't solve the oracle issue and uh there wasn't a good option chain link even even chain link wasn't live yet at the time they were just a white paper and they were on test net and um we sort of dug into it and it it wasn't going to be right anyway for us we didn't feel like it was central we thought it was centralized and um so we sort of went to the drawing board uh there was a hackathon uh in summer 2018 in dc called angelhack and we decided to to hack up an idea um i think we were inspired by there was a project called if you guys remember 0x bitcoin that built a sort of bitcoin protocol on ethereum and so that kind of got our wheels turning about making a minable oracle token and and that became like this thing called the proof of work oracle and we had the after that hackathon we had this sort of rudimentary bones for what would later become teller and um but you know we did that in the summer and we didn't really know what we had with it you know we just we knew that if we couldn't find a better oracle provider like we had this thing we could we could launch with but it was still just a hack so we just kept on being daxia and we were trying to raise money and uh it just wasn't successful we were having a hard time raising we were running out of money and at the end of it was the very beginning of 2019 we had like one month left we're all like okay guys we're all gonna go get jobs again and do daxia part time and like we're gonna make this work it was really depressing and um that was around the time that we we heard about a an opportunity for um this thing called binance labs uh which is binance's uh incubator accelerator program thing incubation program and uh we met somebody at defcon devcon4 in prague that uh later on tipped us off about like this opportunity he's like i think you guys would be good for this and you know maybe that oracle idea you're talking about would be something you could do and so uh we went ahead and applied and we got in and we weren't like teller wasn't even a thing like once we applied we were like uh okay we better name this thing and give it a brand and a website so we came up with teller and we put together like a really crappy website and wrote a white paper and you know turned ourselves into a project and we got into we were so surprised that we got in and that's how that's how teller became a thing and um i could i could go back into i could go further into uh you know everything from then till now too because that's its own story we went out to berlin for you know the incubation program was in berlin germany for three months you know we left our nick's got two kids i always had a pregnant wife and and brenda's uh sweet dog charlie we all just like uprooted our lives to go to a foreign country to to build this project uh it was a really cool time yeah i think we'll definitely get to talking about that too um i guess it's it's kind of you know funny to think about you know 2017 doesn't feel that long ago but really that the difference in what was available then and now um i think especially along that line of decentralization versus like decentralization um is it's pretty stark right like there's a lot of new things that have come out in the last three years that have really enabled kind of full end-to-end decentralization within an app right as you know notably oracle's being you know big piece of that puzzle right um i guess sort of you know going back to um you know when you were kind of working with daxia and like kind of you know thinking like are we really central or decentralized or or you know what are we like i guess what was sort of like for you maybe the motivating factor for um making sure that you really were decentralized the whole way through like why was that actually important right i mean that's what motivated building a teller eventually like you know why is that the kind of mind mindworm that stuck with you yeah so like we always have been this group that are very philosophical philosophically i can philosophically conservative in these regards you know we um we have a strong set of values uh and we've always been like no matter what we build it's going to be uh decentralization first it's going to be about censorship resistance uh even with daxia like we wanted to be you know even regulatory concerns we had you know we wanted to make sure we did things the right way and um and you know we didn't want to we didn't want to be like one of these ico projects that were coming out because at the time if you recall it was it was a it was it was crazy 2017 was nuts and we saw all these projects raising money and we we knew that they were junk because they didn't have anything but a white paper or an idea you know or even it was just a bad idea that you know we just didn't want to be we wanted to be different and at the time being different was actually being standing up for something and and uh wanting to be truly decentralized and not just trying to do a money grab it was hard it was hard to um not fall for that because we were trying to do like i was saying we were trying to raise and we couldn't raise and we're running out of money and you see other projects that were doing something similar but they would do have one thing that would jeopardize our values that we couldn't do but they could and they're so they win um you know like we weren't going to create a token project that would end up having 60 or 80 of the tokens held by a couple of vcs and us because it doesn't matter how amazing your protocol is you're it's still centralized because all the power is in the hands of a few so like um you know when we designed and we didn't have a token with the axia so we didn't have the problem but when we came to building teller it was going to we needed a token we actually needed one to make it work we were like okay so how do we do this without you know doing the ico boom thing and so we did no pre-mine we settled on we're not going to do a pre-mine and we're not going to do an ico no pre-sales no ieos which became the thing after icos it was ieos initial exchange offerings um which are similar i think but um they all come down to like how can we get a bunch of your tokens in the hands of investors early on for way cheap and then dump them on everybody else and okay yeah the project gets to raise a lot of money and that can be useful because now you can be become a business but uh but then you're a business that almost can never get out from under the shadow of your your raise or your your launch like how now it's called a fair launch you know like you can't sometimes you can't escape that and what incentive do you have if you're like everybody's a multi-millionaire at the company before you even done anything right so um that was a really long-winded way of answering that you know we just we found these you know we got into crypto because yeah it's cool tech and it's you know you know cutting edge technology and and it's just fun to be a part of a new industry like that but also because of the values behind bitcoin and ethereum and about creating unstoppable applications and uh censorship proof uh computers you know those kind of things you know what defy is supposed to stand for you know um so we didn't want to lose we didn't want to lose ourselves and it's easy when you're like just starting to say like i'm not going to lose my values but when you're running out of money it's like maybe those values aren't so important but you know we still exactly we stuck to it we stuck to it oh yeah it's good to hear i mean i mean for those here on the call who you know weren't around in 2017 you know it wasn't a crazy thing to have people raising you know tens of millions of dollars on white papers right yes uh which was you know is insane right it was really truly insanity um so yeah i mean to stick to your guns and that sort of atmosphere i think i think that's that's very noble right and i think kind of continuing on on that trend i mean talking about sort of like where teller is now um i mean tower also has a workshop that they had at youth online so if you want to take a look at sort of how everything works under the hood that's probably the best place to do it uh but for this call i mean i'm kind of curious about sort of decision making um that that you're making at teller right so i mean you recently you guys launched your v2 um which was you know very exciting a bunch of kind of great improvements there around scalability and that kind of thing um but also uh i think you mentioned that uh also that you burned your admin key recently as well which is i think kind of fits really nicely with this narrative of you know uh you know very decentralized censorship resistant um so i mean love to kind of chat a little bit about sort of the thought process that went into uh actually you know burning that key losing access to sort of the thing you've created in a way um and and sort of you know just kind of the process of actually doing that what was that like and um why now yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so an admin key for those who don't know is like uh it's like this master switch that that we could have in our contracts that allow us to to make any changes we want to it um but what you use it for is to upgrade to make upgrades to change your contract and so but it could be used nefarious nefariously if or maliciously uh it's all powerful basically it's important to have that uh early on um you need to be nimble and you need to like things break you know you launch the main net and it's like it all could break and you want to be able to quickly make fixes and you don't need you don't want to have to wait for this uh decentralized governance that doesn't exist yet and you don't have a community yet and and um and so it's okay to have an admin key most projects on ethereum actually have them i think the problem is is that if there's a lack of transparency around the fact that an admin key exists and what it can do and not do and also if you hold on to it too long so there's a period of time where like it becomes natural for an admin key to to be removed and um so we've been talking about it for a while we've been around for we launched to mainnet in august 2019 and um we always said that when we had demand on our oracle or we got to a certain point we we made the you know enough updates we thought that we were you know we've been on mainnet long enough nothing is broke or if anything broke we fixed it and we made you know some updates that we we now feel like our oracle is is ready you know and and doing good on its own then we'll burn it we no longer really feel like a need that like we don't think this thing's gonna break and we've been around for a while so uh we thought after v2 launch was a natural a natural uh good spot to do it because v2 was a big upgrade and and uh we wanted to probably wanted to launch that on our own and uh and so yeah we just felt like we've we've grown we've matured enough it's you could still argue it's early it's really scary to burn it because um you know we still haven't uh we haven't really established ourselves with a huge user base yet and so what the questions that you have in mind are um what if you have to adapt the protocol as you get data from your from your customers you know like you're in the market and you learn from the from if there is one or not and you you can change like oh you know we found out that people wanted faster updates and so that was something we changed in v2 make our oracle a little bit faster things like that you want to be able to collect that data and make changes but now you know now it's going to be slower it's going to be a more decentralized process the way that upgrades will work now is it goes to a token token governance vote and that's you can imagine for anybody that follows ethereums like eips or you know it just takes a while the community has to discuss things and they have to go through this draft process and finalizing and auditing and everybody's got to vote and you got to get people to vote and those kind of things but we're excited about that challenge too because now now it's it's we have to be um stewards of the community and we have to be you know we actually have to further develop our community and um and help help that foster that growth so that you do have an active engaged community that can vote uh on the upgrades of something like teller that ultimately holds quite a bit of value um in its market cap and what it does for other other projects and that sort of goes back to why you want to build a project the right way um because eventually you want to get to the point where your project your community is important to you and so you want them to be really interested in you and not just speculators although speculators aren't important but you don't want a community fully built of just token speculators that don't even care what you really do um and so building a community organically uh having a token project that's very organic uh and it can it can be tough to grow a project like that but ultimately we think it's gonna benefit us now that we're here and fully decentralized we think we have a great community the great uh foundations of the community um so yeah cool um awesome yeah i imagine you know as like a software developer myself you know sort of in a way like pushing the code onto the cd drive and then shipping out the cds it's like kind of equivalent to like burning the admin key you can't just the code is shipped you can't touch it right um yeah that's it's pretty terrifying to me it was a fun day too like we we had we invited some of our um associates you know people that have helped us on the protocol in our history you know not a lot of people but for this tiny office like we were it was packed six people was a lot of people for us but so like you know we had champagne and everything like that and so it was like a big drum roll and when you send the admin key to the zero address like it's gone no you can no longer call that upgrade function and um and but nothing broke everything stayed working and uh and here we are the real test the real test is going to be v 2.5 and i know we didn't even talk about v2 and we can if you guys are interested and uh we also never didn't really talk about how teller works so if anybody doesn't know how teller works you can ask and i can give an overview of that it might be um maybe you all already are very familiar with us which would be a good thing but so b 2.5 is coming out we have these it's not as big as v2 it's um but they're important uh updates into in terms of how our mining network functions and getting those details but the point is is that this is going to be a teller improvement proposal a tip and so we're gonna have you know we've already written it up i think tomorrow actually we're gonna submit it our plan is either tomorrow or early next week to submit that tip um it's actually uh i believe it is already on github but we're gonna like share it with the community and then it'll go through this this process i don't know how long it'll take whereas we you know get community feedback on it and it goes through an audit and eventually we'll go through a boat so this will be our first upgrade that we're going to do that it's it's it's going to be it's going to take us all you know we like to say we are teller and like this is our first time we can actually put our our uh you know walk the walk about yeah the first sort of full end to end yeah um experiment basically that's very exciting awesome um cool so yeah i did drop a note in chat here if anybody does have any questions uh we can either do them live or if you just want to drop them in text we can do that too um so maybe i'll ask one more question while people think if they have any questions um so yeah so see actually going back you mentioned kind of the start um in a way was at a hackathon right and i know when when we first started talking um as well about kind of online and everything that yeah you mentioned that you know hackathons and teller go way back if you will right so i guess sort of um maybe you know if you had you know another chance to be at a hackathon right now if you were maybe a hacker at ethon line um what would you be building right now or you know either what piece of the stack or what would you be thinking about building um and and you know maybe if you could also speak to sort of you know uh the environment that hackathons provide and why they're exciting and and you know also why they were a part of you know your history well so like my immediate thought about uh what i would build is is actually something that we're working on as a team now so i can't like really talk about it but um uh but in general what i think a good motto is for for anybody that's getting into crypto and coming to hackathons and thinking about things to build is don't get sort of um it's tempting to sort of try to like hack on a project that's like the soup du jour especially with all the yield farming stuff going on now it's it's easy to get pulled into that um and i think ultimately that won't lead you down the correct path for like a real meaningful career uh or a real meaningful project and so our motto from the get-go no matter what we are building and what we will build in the future is build things that make sense build things that you can build right now with with current with current crypto technology um and you know scalability specifically and then build something that you you ultimately want to be a part of long term like because all these projects are a community you know blockchains it is a community and so make sure that whatever you're making isn't just something that's going to be like it's going to make you money but it's actually going to foster a community that you want to be ultimately a leader in and a part of and you'll be proud of and so to go a step further uh to be a little bit more practical what that might mean is you you can ask yourself well what really makes sense on a blockchain ultimately what is like why would you use a blockchain over just a regular database you know um and it's what we believe is it it's really about unstoppable applications and censorship resistance and so and it's not about making money a lot of money or anything like that or you know making digital versions of uh legacy finance but it's about making something that's slow and uh simple but like it can't be stopped by any government or any in one individual and like that's what's really cool about it so these are areas that can they can be really improved on in all of d5 and so you know you can take uh any one of these projects take a stable coin idea but like think about like how can i improve upon what maker's doing or whoever and not make it faster but make it slower and more secure and more censorship-proof and that would be a really good niche to carve yourself if i was a hacker because i you will stand out to people and there will be people that notice like we're a project that would we would gravitate to someone like you be like you get it and there's there's more people than just us that are like that that get that kind of thing and we ultimately they think that those are the people that are going to survive long term totally yeah i mean i think exactly right i mean i think you know building with on the platform with the ethos of the of the original the original ethos of the platform right i think that i mean that aligns just you know perfectly it's not about building sorry not just well you're not just building what you're building right it's like what are we building exactly it's like this whole community what is the ethereum community building like what are we making here like are we quickly going to become like what web 2.0 was is web3 going to just be a new web 2 with blockchain you know like i don't think that's what we want to build here and that we could quickly get there and get there real fast and there'd be enough money that people would be like what what are you talking about censorship resistance nah you know like you could get there real fast so um you also asked about you know just the events themselves um i i would so not just hackathons but any like any convention or any event encrypt and crypto like don't be afraid to make friends and keep in contact with people that you've met at these things because they will like every event we've gone to and every hackathon we've gone to there's some relationship that we started there that at some point made a big difference for us it later became somebody introduced us to a project or later like uh gave us an idea that was a you know a real inspiration for something we made um or they just became really good friends you know it uh it's kind of tough like you you know you want to focus on on on building but the relationship component is is is huge so don't you know that's like one of the biggest resources to leverage at a hackathon i think definitely yeah i mean i couldn't agree more i think you know one of the great things about the ethereum community is that we have so many of these opportunities to intermingle i think and you know able to like meet each other and i think kind of just generally across the board like from what i found like almost everyone is interested in being kind of a positive promoter of what other people are working on provided you know it's it's you know it's good and it follows the right ethos and um there are a lot of people in this uh community especially that are so down to help and so down to be part of the story oh yeah no i feel like people make it easy on you at these things um sure i'm not always the most i don't know depending on my mood i'm not always the most outgoing person but i've never had a problem at a at a heath event exactly awesome it looks like we do have a question from the crowd so it looks like uh jack has a quick question for you um jack if you're able to unmute your video you're already doing it um perfect i'll turn it over to you hey how's it going um hey mike uh yeah i'm kind of new to the to the space a little bit and i haven't gone deep into oracle's yet um so maybe the right question is like how does it work um yeah no we didn't even get into that sure yeah yeah and that would be great to know but yeah like what kind of data do you see yours like can teller take real world data and ever like port it to the blockchain in a decentralized way i'm trying to think of how that would work and i and i we do that that's exactly what we do so like if you know if the sun comes up today like how can you prove that the sun came up uh so um we could do that we don't that's not what teller does right now we do numerical data and we focus on pricing data right but the fundamentals of it would apply for something like that as well um it kind of goes back to uh how does how did bitcoin solve like how do you validate data uh in a network and uh you know the concept was you use a a competition and a set of incentives to uh incentivize honest and honest behavior and disincentivize dishonest behavior um and so we sort of took that idea and and what we did was um this will go into how teller works is that we use competition we use we built a proof of work protocol in a smart contract on ethereum and we have miners that uh they're not ethereum miners whatever they specifically run a teller miner and uh basically what happens is like a user would come to teller and request let's say some sort of off chain when you say real world data that and that what that means is that anything other than what's on ethereum to ethereum is is off chain data it could be in the real world the internet right so like a bitcoin price is off chain and you have to get that from some real world source whether it's a person or an api an exchange or something like that yeah and ethereum can't read there's you know if you know that's called the oracle problem like blockchains can't access off-chain data so anyway uh so someone is on ethereum they want the bitcoin price or they want to know did the sun come up or they want to know what the weather was on this date you could create a network of individuals that have to compete for the right to to say what that data is and so well then how do you incentivize honesty for them to be honest uh well you can give them a reward just like bitcoin you know issues bitcoins so we have a token uh our miners get rewarded in trb but also to in order to participate in this network they have to stake um a thousand trb which is right now roughly 20 000 worth of trp and that can be slashed if they're dishonest and so now you have you have an ability to dispute these data providers so you have an anonymous anonymous open network anybody can come and join you don't know who they are really and um and you have the proper crypto economic incentives in place you can you can bring almost any data on chain that way um yeah did i did i sufficiently answer the question yeah yeah that makes sense that makes sense so i guess the incentive is they lose twenty thousand dollars if they give the wrong price kind of thing so like you know you could read anybody you know in our network can see these these submissions um on chain like we actually have a dispute center uh if you go to disputes.tellerscan.com you can actually see the mining events as they're coming in live and they happen every we have five minute blocks which is just like our the time period for our updates and um you can see that these these uh submissions come in um i'm sort of backing into describing how all the details of teller but i'll go ahead and continue we actually for each request so like if someone wants the bitcoin us dollar price um we actually take five the first five submissions in the whole network the first five miners that solve the proof of work computation and submit their bitcoin price from whatever source they want could be an api like from binance or something or coinbase or whatever or they could manually put in what they think it is we take five and then we medianize we we take the median of all five and that gets posted on chain as the official value into a readable contract that people that projects can read from and get that data because now it's on chain and um oh shoot where was i going uh oh yeah and so um you can see you can you can see all those submissions happen and you can click dispute and basically you pay a dispute fee the important thing is you also have to improperly incentivize honest disputers right you could spam you could you could spam the network if it was disputing was free and you wanted to shut down teller you could just constantly dispute every value and take them all off chain if it was free you'd be like i think they're all bad but how do you want to you want to make it so people will only dispute if it's actually a wrong value like someone submitted one dollar for the bitcoin price it's clearly a malicious act um so it's actually quite expensive to um to submit a dispute fee but anyway you just submit a dispute fee and then it goes to a vote of our community and there's a there's a whole voting process and there's a ways to dispute the result of a dispute so we have a pretty robust dispute mechanism and that's the bulk of our security is that is um is that none of these values on chain are are 100 final um there's a concept of finality in blockchain it's called probabilistic finality it's like uh you have you ever like sent something on on like a crypto a centralized exchange you have to wait like six confirmations for your bitcoin transaction to go through like those confirmations are actual like each confirmation is a new bitcoin block happened right and so the idea is that the more of these blocks that have happened since your transaction the the more probabilistic it is that it's final meaning the network won't fork um you know and if i'm confusing you just let me know but oh that mean it's like a asymptote or it approaches you know finality kind of yeah yeah so for us like there's such a great incentive oh i should i should add this thing when someone disputes a bad value on teller if you successfully dispute it and if we all vote that that was a bad value you get that minor stake so the disputer gets rewarded that minor gets slashed and it goes to the disputer so like the you could call them validators almost that they can comb through all the data getting submitted from teller and make sure it's clean uh and if they find if if it's almost like you want to be the fastest person we don't have like a lot of bad values that come on chain they're pretty rare but when they do it's like payday for somebody it's obviously a bad one and so they don't last on chain very long so for us the longer a value has been put on chain by our network the more probabilistic it is that it's you could consider it a final price like it won't get disputed it'll stay on chain and so we recommend you know this is why being slow is safer you know you makers makers oracle has a one-hour delay their security module um which means that uh you know their prices are all delayed an hour that way it gives people uh their their community a chance to to to correct something if if something really bad happens with their oracle it's an hour delay so all the prices are are an hour old but that's really good practice um the longer you wait the more the more the more expensive it would be to break that price does that make sense yeah same thing with the same thing with bitcoin like the the longer you wait the the more the less incentive financially anybody would have to to do something malicious yeah okay so that's really cool that's uh yeah that's a cool system of like checks and balances yeah and that's what crypto is in a nutshell like sometimes all this stuff is hidden behind all this code but in the end it's really about the logic it's not really about like you know the computer science element although that's a huge component but there's this crypto economics thing that really is where all the where it where all the sweetness is i think yeah yeah that's really cool well thank you for uh explaining that in a nutshell to me yeah back to jacob now and thanks for the founding story too i found that really cool i'm glad you went or both of you went into so much detail on that yeah no i that it is a cool story and i hope it uh inspires you guys um but yeah cr usually off chain data uh on on in d5 right now is is pricing data you know uh right now that's that's what's most in demand because look look just if if blockchains are slow and secure like what are you going to want to transact and it's it's usually high value transactions that are going to make sense on a slow but secure blockchain um you know you're going to want to do some sort of betting contract or some sort of financial contract that's got a lot of value writing on it if you're going to waste your time on the blockchain and so that's why d5 that's why defy is the thing on ethereum right now is because these are all high value you know financial contracts right so it's important to uh to be slow but that's why uh that's why we're focusing on pricing data cool thank you so much appreciate it thanks for the question jack awesome thanks jack um i think we probably have time for one more question um i think vincennes do you have uh questions that way your hands up hey yep all right i'll turn over to you then hey mike hey thank you pretty good um so actually that was like a really perfect segue sort of what i was going to ask uh my interest is on you know focusing on what the future looks like what the pipeline looks like for incoming data types that aren't just pricing pairing um and also pairing it with uh so so i'm curious to know what you think is coming down the pipeline outside of that um is it amounts of you know relatively high value information um or is it you know more like boolean you know truth versus false and then i'm curious on also what you were saying at the end there which is because it's on a blockchain which means cost is high to handle the transaction what does the future of oracle's being fed on to layer two solutions look like where it could reduce that pricing and potentially bring on you know not necessarily high value but still really important data that could benefit from this cool good question um you know i'm not we've we've heard a lot of people talk about um insurance being one one type of data type that makes sense on the blockchain uh i've yet to see um really a good implementation of that but that makes sense and it's something that oracle's could definitely provide like weather data that that was something that at least earlier this year late last year uh amongst the oracles people were talking about insurance and weather data and things like that but i don't know any farmers that are using blockchain uh for their insurance yet but so it's just sort of like a concept and things things like that might be far away away i think d5 is here to stay for a long period of time uh the other thing that we've sort of thought about uh you know you can use oracle's to bridge chains so you could you know we've talked about um separate from atomic swaps well like using oracles to pass block headers back and forth and somehow validate uh data that way um that whole scenario is not my my expertise at all and we haven't really dived too far into it ourselves as a company but um those are two areas i think are could be uh could be interesting but um we don't one thing that we we tend to not look too far ahead you know a lot of times people ask us what's our two year two-year five-year 10-year plan and it's like in crypto you can't you got to keep on your your toes and focus on the here and now and we pay attention to what's going on of course and the things happen so fast that i mean if we think about what we were thinking about last year like i'm glad that we're not doing that now because everything has changed um so that's why it's important to stay nimble as a company you know stay small stay lean stay aware stay engaged because things happen rapidly and who knows how things will be different once things start to scale at ethereum and as far as layer two goes um you know we're actually um you know are you familiar with matic so we're actually um building out onto matic uh as a as our first sort of uh foray into layer two because they're basically like i mean they're just really easy to um to work with um and so we're excited about you know the experiment of that we're excited to see uh you know how that might help us in terms of speed and cost being able to have a um an oracle over there that has greater capabilities speed wise and scaling wise that they that it does on ethereum potentially you know these are things that ultimately though we haven't seen yet is we haven't seen a real demand on any of these either fast layer ones or layer two solutions we haven't seen enough apps on there demanding oracles otherwise we would be building over there and so um a lot of our solutions for layer two uh or a lot of our solutions period are our demand that kind of require people to be using them for it to make sense to build it and so we've been hesitant to to launch on on on these things but we're we're going to do one on matic very soon um and we're excited to see what that does that that doesn't exist at this time right you guys are building that right now yeah so it's really close we're on we're we were on their test net um you know we were just uh we were just talking about it this morning uh it's pretty imminent uh for that if you're are you looking to build something on matic that needs to be uh yeah we're you know tool agnostic it's more of what our need is um there's two different things going on here there's my hackathon project which is uh reviewing um security and building some grading system around different oracle feeds uh compare paired with different oracle technologies paired with different dap architectures and trying to help new doubt developers are focusing on more real-world build-outs get sort of caught up because we we see as by the way's weakness for real-world applications coming onto the blockchain and then my day job we're focused on building um settlement layers and marketplaces for electric microgrids so they don't rely on traditional banking services and so for us to be very beneficial to be able to plug in you know smart meter data energy consumption feed it in um it's not urgent we can do that a little time but we're trying to see if it's something we could put in the first version cool yeah um well it's not it's not the layer layer value of like a layer one gotcha obviously yeah this is counter factual sort of enforcement well i'll tell you what just if you want to uh we could connect offline and stay in touch and as you're thinking through these things like we love to just think through them with people especially if it's related to well even if it's not related fully to oracle's but we like to think about this stuff um and help people make the right decisions in the design phase of these things and so um yeah just reach out to me and then we can start a little chat and just keep in touch about it whether it's for your hack project or or something else sure awesome appreciate it thanks for your question thank you awesome uh thanks so much for that there's that kind of helpful conference meetup connection thing we just talked about yeah it's happening live that was a live one awesome uh cool well uh thanks again everybody uh for uh you know basically taking part thanks for your questions thanks for your participation um and and mike big thank you uh for for coming out and spending an hour with us had a great time chatting and uh yeah it was awesome to kind of detail the whole story and how it works and how we got to where we are and i hope it wasn't too all over the place it was like stream of consciousness uh there but i hope you guys followed and and like i told the the last gentleman like any of you guys if you guys are too shy or something like you can reach out to me uh or anybody on the team if you're a developer and you want to ask more technical questions questions you know our cto is we love talking to people so don't be afraid awesome and yeah just for everybody of course you can find them in the sponsor teller channel yeah of course they've got prizes for using teller so if you need data in your app that drb come get that trb um exactly so you know the they'll be around the whole event so don't don't feel shy at all just like what uh what mike's up there so awesome with that you know we will wrap this up uh it was great chatting thanks again for your time my pleasure to catch everybody on discord
