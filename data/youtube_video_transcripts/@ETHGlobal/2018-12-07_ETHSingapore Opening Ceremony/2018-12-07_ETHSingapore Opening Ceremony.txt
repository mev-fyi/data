hello everyone are you settled welcome to eat Singapore welcome to East Singapore hi guys who's excited to be here yeah not bad so before we get started first of all hi to everybody watching on the livestream he's Singapore dotco / alive we are also at capacity in this room there are seats and screens outside in the lobby and the pit a couple more announcements there is a aetherium Foundation grant survey down in the pit and FIRREA magicians is meeting on Monday for those who are still around cool so let's kick this off welcome to eath Singapore this is the last eath global event of the year and I think that it's going to be a very good one the grand finale so who are we I'm Anna I was presenting earlier I have a podcast called zero knowledge and it's about decentralized web stuff and zero knowledge things you should subscribe and I'm Evan Van Ness I'm part of consensus and I have a newsletter called we can etherium you should subscribe to we can apply alright so this as mentioned this is the finale of this year's eath hackathon series and it's been a pretty amazing Road it has [Applause] so we're very curious to hear who has been where I've been to a couple of global events and Evan I think you've been - I've been all of them so he knows best all right so quick question this was what started off the year it's Denver was anyone at the East End for event oh nice what about Ethan Oh Sara's all right yeah Eve India oh nice okay ether Lynne my hometown oh yeah it's nice numbers they're like it and the last one at East San Francisco it's good you guys have actually seen some of this stuff so this leads us to eat Singapore well new jokes huh we'll need some new jokes then I I just wanted to say I don't think I pointed this out last time I love these city skates whoever did them is it's nice and I really want to play soccer on the floating soccer field at Marina Bay so we should organize a game all right some steps yes so if global events up to this point in the year 500 plus projects have been submitted 3500 plus attendees from over 40 countries so that's amazing let's do some shopping so this event we have over 250 attendees 27% of you are students and there are 20 amazing sponsors so principals of an eighth global event the first is build what you want you know part of the fun of a hackathon and staying up all night is that you get to choose what you want to hack so choose something that you really want to build [Music] showing is better than telling like it's all about building so in the judging portion the the whole point is to give a demo no no PowerPoint slides just give a demo and talk about the problem you're solving and what you bill and then the third point is learn mentor and grow so these are about you know getting better as a developer learning to use tools available to you in that are constantly improving and our ecosystem fortunately and mentoring and growing as a developer yeah and make sure you take advantage of all these amazing people that are here so this is a hackathon not a conference the idea here is not just to sit back and watch there will be workshops and people sharing information but it's really good to engage and lastly this is for the ecosystem so all year we've had these fantastic members of the etherium ecosystem come together for this remember this is what you're building for so I think we actually get to start we'd like to invite our first or do you want to go ahead yes my new her kiya Thani is the deputy group CEO of ascend assessing bridge a leading provider of integrated urban development and business space solutions ASB is the venue provider for heat Singapore and ASB has presence across 11 countries around the world with assets under management exceeding 20 billion Singapore dollars welcome welcome [Applause] okay thanks guys I'm not only the oldest person here not only the boldest person here but probably also the dumbest person here but you still have to listen to me because we are your warm hosts I want to wish all of you a very good evening welcome to a science first italian hackathon at singapore i understand that many of you have flown into singapore for this event i would like to warmly welcome you to our hot islet hot in many aspects and I hope you have a great time here Kathak was telling me that this is the first time he's here and he's gonna leave immediately after the hackathon is over but we would like you to come over and over again because this is a really a great place that I want to tell you a little bit about Singapore so first of all my group has sent a singlet it's privileged to host at Singapore here at this product which we call the bridge in the Singapore Science Park today marks the start of an exciting weekend for all of you and we are thrilled to see so many industry leaders gathered here for this flagship event first I believe Singapore is the perfect place to have this event Singapore is a highly pro-business pro-technology international city in the heart of Southeast Asia further blockchain has been identified as an area of high priority by the Singapore government exploit blockchain and export blockchain is our mantra the Singapore Economic Development Board is actively promoting this sector and attracting blockchain companies to Singapore both startups and reknowned MNCs that IBM Enix Accenture halves Attucks have set up blockchain centers of excellence here the Monetary Authority of Singapore has partnered with technology provider r3 and financial institutions to develop interbank payments using distributed ledger technology I want to add that there is a huge FinTech conference and thought leadership seminar that takes place here every year and it has continued to increase exponentially in Singapore so I think for those of you you may want to find the time to attend the next fin tech conference that we have here the infocomm Media Development Authority has also introduced many initiatives including funding support to facilitate development and implementation blockchain solutions recently another of our agency's enterprise Singapore announced a new partner venture capital firm tri ventures to support its launch of a blockchain accelerator I could go on but you got to do your hackathons well I will not give you more examples but suffice to say that lots is happening in Singapore in the area of blockchain a report by Price Waterhouse highlighted that 82% of executives in Singapore have said that blockchain initiatives are underway in their organisations but only 15% have brought the initiatives life to the market so this is a very interesting market our company itself ASB although I declare understand very little about blockchain I have asked my team to look at smart contracts using blockchain second it is very fitting that today's event is being held at this location assent in Singapore Science Park which is the cradle of Singapore's rnd trust home to more than 300 multinational companies local companies and institutions Singapore Science Park together with the adjoining one north area is a thriving ecosystem of business innovators academia and researchers as the architect of Singapore Science Park and the biggest private industrial landlord in Singapore our company ASB is committed to not only provide quality physical workspaces but also create platforms and communities to collect collaborate and co-developed new solutions in areas such as blockchain last year we launched our flexible workspace solution the bridge to meet increasing demand for new and innovative space solutions and connect people through events and activities since then the bridge has attracted many tech entrepreneurs and corporates and hosted numerous blockchain events one year ago we welcomed our first blockchain member and one capital this was followed by long hash and power zaleka neo global capital and new pay just a few weeks ago you owe beef in lab and long hash also held their lab crawls what are those lab cross at the bridge were they crawling around should have come for that at the bridge in conjunction you can see I'm talking but I'm not understanding so please forgive me in conjunction with Singapore FinTech festival earlier in July the Institute of blockchain Singapore was officially launched here at the bridge and continues to be our community partner today the etherium Singapore meetup was also held at the bridge in March this year during which Vitalik gave a keynote address on a theorem we are happy to see we Tolec here again today with his esteemed colleagues and as a community at the bridge grows we hope to host more events like this as one of the many ways to drive the growth and vibrancy of the ecosystem good that you use the same word ecosystem this is aligned with ASB s vision to establish the bridge as an incubation ground for innovation we are excited to learn more about the solutions that will result from this exciting hackathon ASB and the bridge stand ready to further support the blockchain community working closely with brilliant minds like you and I've told your colleagues here we have locations all over Asia and now also in the US and we would love to host you wherever you go we believe in being partners with that I wish all of you the best of luck and great fun thank you so much [Applause] thank you sir and up next we have a fireside chat with Karthik tower from eath global and dr. vitalik butyrin from the university of basel test test so dr. vucelich thank you for joining us proposing we don't get the joke he just got his honorary degree last week and now he's a doctor we're super excited to welcome all of you here thank you so much for being in this room it's amazing to see a massive crowd of developers excited to be hacking on a weekend and especially here on a Friday night I don't want to I think we kind of already went over the numbers but there's people from about 30 countries that are represented here and they kind of flew in for for this weekend and we're super excited to to host all of you so I kind of wanted to focus a lot of this chat on just kind of having a conversation around anything from how the third project is evolved to where we are now which is at this hackathon and how we can make this a conversation around what is exciting to build so I'll kind of start off by just asking you are the chief scientist C chief scientist at the etherium project right now what does your day usually look like and sort of what are the things you focus on let's see so this morning I purchased participated in a couple of github discussions over on the etherium serenity spec which is what we're doing the spec that's describing currently the intended proof of stake protocol and then also parts of the sharding spec yesterday I worked on that blog post where I described in my own words what I thought what I think cbc casper is and like how it works i also wrote a posted describing a layer to scale scalability thing that makes crush our transactions go faster in these before and it's sometimes researching a lot of just keeping up with what other people are thinking and reading a lot of just talking to different community members and of helping different projects and pretend you know efforts like plasma and so forth out so it's like some of everything it's awesome so kind of from your experience for the way you work what is the life cycle of the work you do from the research side making to the application side and kinda at what point do you kind of consider that as a handoff versus things you're involved with to the full-on development it it does kind of handoff at different stages so there are times when I would come up with an idea and first of all sometimes there's either a buck in the idea where there's a better idea so I get it kind of stops and gets trapped there then after that the next step is if people like it then either someone and if likes it enough that they just take the idea and start start off and go on a path developing it themselves so with like for example Minimum Viable plasma and plasma cash and plasma prime like there's already teams of developers that want to do plasma so as soon as they see a better way to do plasma they just go ahead and do it sometime for layer one stuff I do needs to be and if more actively involve going later into the pipeline because it's not just like layer one is really important and it's not just a matter of kind of the basic ideas we also wants to make sure the spec is and if maximally clean and simple and make sure this back does everything that we want and generally there is like a lot of loose ends that it's important to try to tie up as well as possible and look for one point no we have this side of parallel track approach where a lot of teams have already started developing clients and they're kind of keeping up with the changes to the spec at this point though at some point fairly soon well the development on this back itself or kind of slowed down a lot and it'll mostly be development another kind of later stage part of the pipeline that's also important to remember is just people often have questions and it's great to answer people's questions no it's wonderful and it kind of set up the stage for all but ten things I had on my list to ask but before I get to those what I want to talk to you or ask you is DEFCON four just happened about a month ago is that they developer annual conference what were some of your takeaways from being at the event and kind of seeing about 3,000 people attend and talk about it be excited about it there yeah so one of the things that and we were definitely you kind of trying to do as a deliberate strategy and I'm very happy that at least I think it's been going very successful so far is to try to kind of make bridges between the etherium community and other community is you know both inside crypto and outside that we feel I share similar values you know so this cash being one yeah like a rosy cash like we came to their conference in Montreal a few months ago they came to our conference they presented at Def Con last year about a bunch of zero-knowledge stuff they presented about Def Con this year about even more zero-knowledge stuff Zuko gave a really nice talk about privacy it's then you know there's also all these all of the other crypto communities that show up and I saw the Bitcoin cash people and they expressed and of how how how much they kind of like the etherium community and how they appreciate its general friendliness outside the crypto space in glen while from a radical markets Stewart brands from the the long now foundation you know cory doctorow and then there is a kind of list that goes on and on and so I think we like it's definitely good to see all of that attention from the outside both because people outside the the crypto space and of caring about what we're doing is a useful form of validation like it makes sure that you know we are building something that at least these other people also consider to be actually useful it's and having a kind of two-way communication between them also ensures that you know they know and in what's going on on our side and we can tell them about what the technology is and give them you know some of the ideas so they can figure out what to do with it and we learn from them what kinds of thing problems their work they're working on what kind of challenges could actually be affected by the kind of resolved by the technology which is also a really nice because it helps us to kind of continue this year where the were the emphasis so I think that's like those kind of relationships are very valuable and it's something that I feel like we've been definitely doing a fairly well so far and we should strive to do even better going forward I absolutely agree and that's wonderfully put and it's the same reason events like these also end up becoming those test grounds where people can experiment and prototype things over the weekend and that's that's a a lot of experimentation and evolve into products or problems that people need solutions work yeah yeah you know one thing they've been starting to and if forced myself to care more about lately is to try to push look beyond kind of sticking things on a watch in for the sake of sticking things on a blockchain because I feel like that's what a lot of the earlier crypto projects were but at this point you know it's fairly clear that if we want crypto to get more adoption at this points that it has to get adoption buying and providing real value to people and so on and so forth and for that happen we have to and of under be more explicit and queer and your stands better know what is the specific value of that the technology provides do you think in this case the only possible path here is we know that we have these certain primitives that exists in this do sancho so this crypto well just even for aetherium and we have to figure out what the best solution could be or is it still necessarily us figuring out it could be the people that already are in the communities that care about whatever the specific problems are that figure it out but know if we educate them and then let them educate us then the opportunity that will actually figure it out so I'm going to increases got it I think we're having some my troubles with solved you know so earlier today you were on a panel about scalability and just sort of the attempts in layer 1 and layer 2 what I want to kind of talk at a high level is yes we know that things needs to be faster for us you kind of look into comparable applications that we are used to now and and also there's a lot of efforts being worked on but often times we miss to highlight what the trade-offs are or the complexities that get introduced as a result of working on these things what are some of your thoughts on kind of what these trade-offs are complexities end up being that we don't often talk about yeah I think first of all it's important to remember that the technology as of today is still fairly immature and there's a lot of little kinks that don't theoretically need to exist but as a matter of fact today do exist so things like you know no it's not perfectly syncing in some and sometimes falling off the network for a couple of minutes or you know like nodes not fully connecting very useful way things like transactions taking like three minutes to get included in the chain because of bad gas price estimation you know Oh huge portion of the network being on in fury' instead of like some more decentralized solution and you know there is this and if a longer and longer list and like especially as someone who works spends more time on the theoretical side like on the theoretical side there's no real reason why these hurdles need to exist and like theoretically if you just sort of throw more resources at the problem it seems like that it's a lot we can make a lot of those issues go away but the fact is we haven't yet thrown the resources at the problem or we've only started in the end in any key SD issues haven't yet gone away and that's something that's important to recognize absolutely do you think it's I mean it's not even abundant good or bad but how do you think about parallel implementations of the problems that we know we need to fix and then hopping back and forth or just kind of how does that change the developer experience when you have so many options that are all in working progress stage and then now developers have to choose or pick and think about how to evolve as the protocol is also evolving yeah it's definitely a challenge at this point I mean one of the issues with building applications that depend on bug especially more either layer twos or frameworks or kind of anything other than the base chain is that the those are kind of extra dependencies that you have to worry about those often have their own user experience issues and then any one of them could just end up becoming a not maintained project later so that's it definitely does kind of add to compounding the problem but on the other hand when someone builds something that's like genuinely reliable and useful and valuable then that's something that can really reduce complexity so I think in one thing that's kind of annoying in the short term is that a lot of application teams are starting to move from where purely or one to some way or two for scalability and on the one hand the scalability gains are real but on the other hands like if theory em is really nice because you just programming applications on it is relatively speaking quite simple you know you figure you write the piece of code dump the piece of code on chain and the piece of code does what it's supposed to do whereas if you're building a SD channel application at least at this point you have to personally worry about oh when the channels get opened when the channels get closed well how do we actually write the code to implement this weird logic how do we do meta channels how do we do Slovak swaps between them you know if we make a plasma thing then what does the exit game look like and like blah blah blah and like in the long term you know you're not going to get applications if in order to get a useful application you have to both be an expert at whatever your application actually is and be an expert at making you know we are crypto economically or to things and so there's definitely a goal of trying to create I know fairly generalizable layer to kind of plug-and-play frameworks that people could just like run and use some that adapts to their application fairly quickly and you know there's been a lot of good work on trying to make that happen for state channel projects I know you know there's been increasing and kind of faster work on the kind of plasma test networks so I'm sorry I guess like there's a site of taps that talk about usability from the the end consumer standpoint but there's a UX improvement on the developer side and just kind of tracking that to make it easy for developers to go and there is yeah and I think developer experience and user experience are both important like the two issues are not always fully separate because part of developer experience is a developer's experience in creating an acceptable user experience yeah so kind of coming back to this hackathon and just sort of themes in terms of things we can focus on near-term when we're talking about this chat before we kind of made a list of possible things we could possibly focus on and kind of bring some ideas about so I generally just took down a lot of notes and essentially what I want to do is kind of get your thoughts on anywhere from if you were to do something in this category what is something that makes sense and in what are some of your wishlist items so some practical things are basically applications of cryptic anomic s-- sure so one kind of category of thing I care about that I have kind of talked and posted about a couple of times but I think has it been discussed enough is the use of crypto economics for anti-spam and things like chat in social applications so like basically the like what was very simple kind of archetype of this that I came up with recently is what I call a proof of State conditional hash cash so the original version of hash cash right basically said that it's like an anti spam measure where in order to send an email that someone will see your computer has to do a bunch of work and then the proof of work gets attached with an email and if the proof of work say cost you five cents to make them that's kind of a cost of five cents of sending an email the way proof of steak additional hashcash works is that instead of burning the five or the five cents through proof of work you would along with your message publish a kind of pointer to a unchained deposit which could be vigorous it could be fifty cents and then only if the recipient consider is that message to be spammed they can press a button to basically burn the money and so that way for spammers it's like as expensive or even more expensive than the proof before cash cash but for regular users it's free right so the Jim and then you can expand this to things that are kind of more than two parties so you can think of for example like social media platforms where people can create an account with a deposit and then someone has the ability to but basically if your account gets bans and then the deposit ends up getting burned and things like that and the reason why I care about things like that yes I think as we've you know figured out of over the last decade or so problems around spam trolling you know like that whole category of things bla bla bla on internet applications are very real and it seems like a lot of the mainstream world is moving toward just requiring identity as a way of solving these problems which solves the problems but on the other hand has some very kind of dark consequences in other ways and crypto economics is like basically an alternative that kind of solves the or you the anti-spam problem and makes spam expensive but at the same time is first of all much more protective of privacy second of all any identity system is going to have a very hard time being usable by more by yeah everyone in the world and so it becomes much more accessible third you know it just becomes big more for him well that's more friendly to people who really care about protecting their privacy and it's ah it's also just another way of making accounts easier to get I mean also just relying on you know things like phone numbers for everything is just a huge security hole and there's a bunch of reasons so something in that general space I think would be interesting as he explored more I hope everybody's taking notes because these are excellent I kept on ideas no you kind of mention identity here alternate merged I wouldn't two categories just be just identity as a problem in in this space as well as sort of $0 person's EQ snarks and Starks that are coming about how do we kind of can be practically users of those technologies and primitives yeah so I mean I would also just kind of expand from identity to luck reputation more generally and because it's important to think of identity not just as like a thing that gets assigned by a central authority but more generally just the idea that people you interact with can be more inclined to trust you if you know that you have some history of interactions with other people that seem to have gone well right and that's something that's useful as a as a primitive in a bunch of ways so like one simple example of this is you can make things like like networks work more effectively with you just without kind of fairly complex you know multi-channel locking structures by basically saying like will use more trust a sense to BB sense the CC sense the DD sense that year but then for each link you you would only send smaller amounts at a time and you would go up to bigger amounts when you know you've you know that's the whoever the person is that you're interacting with has some higher reputation yeah and you can kind of automate these protocols you can automate them in ways that impose kind of mathematical balance on how much money you lose you can use zero knowledge proof Stu do these protocol to do a lot of these protocols in a way that preserves privacy better so like one of the problem like there's kind of two contradictory goals here right where one is that you wants to maintain some kind of reputation so that you can become more trusted as a result of long-running behavior and then be interrupted having the ability to trust makes kind of future interactions so more efficient but then on the other hand you don't want literally everyone to see that all of these activities can be traced to each other so you can do weird fancies your knowledge proof stuff to create reputation system where you can come up with some kind of score that says this person is trustworthy and no one has had bad things about them before and people have said good things about them without actually kind of linking people's behavior to each other sort of a slight quick question if somebody wants to work on a reputation project here what is or what are some resources they can look at that kind of help you understand how to bootstrap a network sure I would recommend I mean first of all a couple like different kinds of trust metrics so the I think advocaat OA trust metric is like one key word thing that you can look up there's another category of thing is like I know proof of unique identity so there if you there's something called I think pseudonym party that's trying to do that a third thing is also just your understanding zero which subgroups and ZK starts themselves because that's what you need for privacy preservation and for that I mean there is like a bunch of theoretical materials on one sneakiest narcs are and I wrote some of them but then there's also the actual libraries you know lips dark and then Socrates and like the different tool gets you can also look at the source code of existing applications that use icky snark so for example you can look at some of Barry White had stuff around you know roll-ups yeah other applications like generally if you want to build something like starting from something that already exists in any kind of editing lines of code is definitely a good way to do it a lot of the time that's awesome so we kind of covered reputation identity and snarks in there one other interesting category I think is just the kind of the emergence of survivalists applications and mixing that with blockchains how do you kind of see that how do you describe that and what are some of the applications you see yeah so like the most recent one I think in this category is Yunus whap rate so basically decentralized exchanges that historically had like terrible user experience because if you want to convert from A to B you have to convert your east to west and then do some other thing then put up an order and then the order book depends on verrano logs and so the order book takes two minutes to load and then you click on some other order and then oh by the way you forgot to load a bunch of logs and you collect on order that's a day and like 20% of price movement out of date forgot to unwrap these yeah yeah right then you get you take the other you got your other token then your other token you you have to watch you know move it out of the exchange and then you withdraw it again and like the whole thing is over complicated and also of these decentralized exchanges dependend append on like centralized servers to manage the order book which is annoying because well for various reasons those centralized service can disappear those centralized servers could get attacked and a couple of things can happen and the unit swap is this like really nice an interesting design which basically is entirely on chain does not have a kind of order book instead you basically are kind of buying and selling against the liquidity pool and it depends on just like basically arbitrage to keep prices in a in line with the actual market price and you the user experience is basically you take coin a you send it in and you're just immediately literally within the same transaction get coin be out and that's it and so like it's literally more usable than even the centralized exchanges and it is decentralized and it does not depend on servers whatsoever so basically I think we can well expect to see a kind of more applications that's start following this kind of pattern because they're like just the ability to kind of create an application and just fire and forget it and run it you know with kind of zero infrastructure I think at least Tamiya was always a big part of the original web 3 vision and it's good to see it actually and it becoming more and more possible from a protocol standpoint to make a lot of those kind of standalone service applications happen what should we prioritize I think scalability is important but also in the shorter term it's important to remember that there are decentralized protocols other than ethereum blockchain itself that are necessary for this so probably the talk to our decentralized message-passing and decentralized appear to be data storage so basically you know what whisper and swarm were kind of filling in the original vision and more recently there's been other protocols and then there are some people building on ipfs and so on and so forth so trying to kind of build up those layers and make sure those layers are more robust so that for example it's not just the smart contract code they can just live in the decentralized cloud it's also the user interface for the application that you can just push into the decentralized cloud and also just fire-and-forget and be fairly confident that it'll be still floating around somewhere the users can access five years from now no that's awesome so this is it's a very interesting thing which is we kind of talked about some of the applications from a short-term which is kind of things we can prototype this weekend to upcoming upcoming months and this is kind of like a wish list for you and the theorem foundation is softballs this grants program where people can apply to get a grant for the project that they're working on and there's a lot of things that the foundation and just the ecosystem has a list for things that they need anywhere from documentation to implementations in other languages for clients for lis PGP or stay to layer 2 and stage shell implementations to a plasma implementations usually the wishlist comes from a handful of people on the foundation side for the long term what is your personal wish list if like crazy or really ambitious things that you would like to see I've done on either a theorem or just blockchains in general so I guess like closer to the base layer I mean there's obviously the base layer itself and then there's whisper and swarm and kind of whisper and swarm like things being and if develops up to their full potential like AI wants to be able to use the decentralized cloud to back up my hard drive and that wants to be able to just like fire it and know that if I just have you know the address and my password in five years I'll be able to download it again I say also like for this year the infrastructure needed for all of these your knowledge proof based applications to be just very easy to build and deploy and that includes you know snark Starks programming languages and all these awkward T is and like all all of these related things on the kind of moving a bit up the stack a kind of richer and more diverse ecosystem of Oracle's for provide for providing data and like both centralized Oracle's and kind of audre style a decentralized Oracle's and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing how that augur market on Groupon the election in November ends up resolving I think that'll be a really interesting kind of test of a decentralized Oracle's ability to be saying going even further up I mean just ooh another one I care about is also a wallet security so again I talked about this basically every time but like coming up with like smart contracts or secret cheering or whatever some mechanisms so that users can be sure that if their computer or phone or password or whatever gets lost or stolen they don't lose all their money and along with their identity and like their estate in every application they care about you so that's something where it's like we know what a multi-city quality is and we know what secret cheering is so from a cryptography point of view it's not not the hardest problem but from a kind of user experience design problem and coming up with like what specific instantiation of these components as maximally grandma friendly I think is definitely an important challenge for people to think about it and I've tried to come up with some more solutions for I hope you're still taking notes so the next kind of a few minutes I want to spend doing a segment that we did before even a vsf and which you kind of stole from Tom Cohen and the section is called a segments call under radar overrated I'm gonna name name one topic and you have to say is underrated or overrated and then a one-line comments on why so we'll start off with a ZK snarks um I would say still hmm still slightly underrated like I don't it's amazing to me any general purpose there were no which proofs are like literally on par with blockchains in terms of kind of the power of that and the transformative this for the technology it's like the ability to just have privacy and correctness of execution at the same time it's just something that cannot be understated fair what about formal verification I would say at this point around probably about correctly rated in terms of like people talking it's not binary metallic okay yeah sorry the place the one formal verification related thing that's still underrated it's just making it easier for developers writing contracts to firmly verify them like I wants to be able saying you know add claims on top of a solidity and viper or viper contract to just have them be checked automatically and so far formal verification just seems to be this racket where like the small number of people can earn two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in the course of eight weeks and like that's terrible and she change that was a good one house points i'm at this point hmm i would say the the feedback for I kind of backed outside variety of stable coins still slightly underrated and the maker like maker Dow style category of mm-hmm probably him oh no it's I I want to do the cop out and say correctly rated at this point because I feel like it is like it's not it's not a really good job of like surviving a 94 person I knew 3% whatever price crash in the underlying collateral and movie him but you know on the other hands like people and the markets seem to recognize seem to recognize that as such for kind of issue or back stable coins the you know the reason why I find them interesting is that I think there are a lot of like even mainstream applications for programmable money that people we can find very interesting and valuable and like their that isn't really something that exists for just a thing where you can build your own Kickstarter like thing so even things like you know like building crypto event Mo's and so forth like there's another important application for this is or the reason why I care about feedback stable coins is that they can kind of disintermediate part of the centralized exchange cycle so basically like if you look at historical centralized exchange hacks and thefts you know bid phonetics Mon Cox blah blah blah blah blah the greatest majority of the problem is what's not on the feet outside it was on the crypto side and so so the inability of it yeah like the vision that I want to see the community try kind of moving closer to is that centralized exchanges specialize and basically being with the odd gateway and then converting feedbacks tokens to things like even something that can be done in a either decentralized or at least kind of plasma style noncustodial way so it's rated and finally Singapore is only one correct answer here yeah I know yeah it's obviously underrated but stick of course really cool yes yes well hot yes you know the temperature is like really nice and stable you know not many places in the world have a 100 year minimum temperature of nineteen point six and a hundred year maximum temperature of 36 yeah that's that's awesome so what I want to do is and the this conversation with a question and then we'll open up the audience questions so kind of my final question to you is just generally why should people care about the centralization and what does that matter for you yeah I definitely think started kind of being more explicit recently about viewing decentralization less as an end in itself but more as a kind of means to achieving a particular goals so like for example the reason why I like you know things like decentralize exchanges is because number one I mean the whole thing about exchange is getting hacked and like losing huge amounts of money is something that's like sad and it would be nice to minimize and number two like I actually do feel like centralized exchanges have this unhealthy level of influence over the industry because like individual listings can basically increase or decrease the price of you know some coin by a factor of two and that's like the more yeah or more and that's just like power that's so obviously ripe for being abused and probably is totally being abused behind our backs and won't ever know and like basically if you know the this is like a great opportunity for the crypto space to kind of use its own technology and values to solve its own problems if we look at things like these like service applications for example I think it's the value that they provide is that if you build an application on top of many components then each component you add is a dependency and each dependency you add is a thing that could break and it's like something where if it's managed by someone it's someone else that could break to you and so if we want to actually be able to build things where people build components and these components will rely on each other and create this ecosystem cooperatively then building more and more base components that operate in the structure where once they're built they're like basically literally as close as possible you're just guaranteed to last forever you know regardless of what happens to the team I think is like really nice and being kind of more broad in philosophical I think you know decentralized and of watch-chain applications or in some ways a kind of spiritual successor to the concept of open source because like the nice thing about open source software rate is that it's once again it's that you can you build and here's and use applications where they don't depend on a single party that could disappear where you know what's actually going on where you know I have stronger assurance that it's not spying on you it starts burning you over in some way and 20 years ago it's actually a kind of much smaller fight because even stuff like Microsoft Word like the worst thing that could do is they can like lock you in with proprietary file formats then like possibly stick a stick watermarks into your documents or whatever like but now you know we're not talking about proprietary software on your computer versus Alfred source software on your computer we're talking about proprietary software where even your data is being stored in servers inside of Google and you know we have no idea what they're doing many of your stuff in so trying to come up with the kind of credible technological alternative to that paradigm I think is something that a lot of people want and it's something that could be potentially very socially valuable so and so that was my last question but and I will ask another question as a follow-up to what you said is do you think we often kind of complete the centralization with transparency transparency is like one of those complicated values right because like there's clearly things that we wants to be transparent and there's clearly things that were building stuff to try to make more private and I think you know the place where transparency has a role is basically so that like people know what kind of a deal they're getting right and so you know if you wants to interact with some application you know or you wants to just know that but you want to know what terms you're getting you know you don't want to kind of sign a blank check to people you don't know you know that's something that I think in wall chains are definitely good at providing they're good at providing kind of transparency and kind of guarantees of what the process is that you're going to be participating in and that's something that's valuable I mean you can also talk about kind of transparency of organizations and the transparency of organizations can be valuable I mean basically just as a way of convincing people that there is nothing nefarious going on which is something that definitely is valuable but on the other hands you know there are a lot of good reasons to have privacy too and like we can talk about personal privacy and my usual kind of one sentence utilitarian argument for my personal privacy is like really valuable is that basically it should not what people should be free to do things like to optimize for their own happiness it should not be that every single thing that you do should carry some component of like doing either doing it or deciding not to do it for social approval because if if things go kind of to it go far in that direction then you just get an equilibrium where people do things that they really don't want to do too and if me okay what do what they think makes each other happy but actually the whole thing just makes everyone was happy you know but then even aside from those kind of more social and of privacy for the individual things like privacy is just a fundamentally necessary component of making many classes of mechanisms work so even if you look at voting for example like if voting is transparent then that makes it insanely easy to pay people to vote in for in one particular direction it makes it insanely easy to penalize people who vote for something you don't like it's so and then if that happens then the kind of you know the me the kind of mathematical description of the game changes because instead of it being a game where people make decisions independently it becomes a cooperative game and cooperative games are notoriously harder to make kind of actually be stable and so when we are in the designing mechanisms whether for governance or for you know whatever whatever else like basically having the option of kind of more privacy it helps me reduce those kinds of issues so I guess privacy and transparency I mean as well as decentralization I think are something that you know you can more mileage out of them if you start and of decomposing them more into well why do we actually want this thing that was awesome well felt like thank you so much for being here and now we'll open up the room for questions so you have a question you can just come on up or shout I'll try repeat the the question itself will do a handful of them oh we actually have an extra mic so just raise your hands and we'll have somebody come to you hi vitalik so when year ago you proposed us idea of dico so what was a community is relatively abundant by this is consent I mean so just to kind of describe what I Dai cos it's this was my attempt at kind of mitigating the problem in an IC o---- where the person the founders of the IC o---- have no incentive to eat like no not enough of an incentive to work hard or even to just not disappear with the money and so the way that this works is that when you do an IC o---- instead of the money immediately going the developers the money goes to a smart contract and in the smart contract the participants in the IC o---- can vote on basically how big the tap is so ik how big the amount of money per per day per block per month whatever yes that goes to the founding team and they can either vote to increase it or they can also votes to just shut off the whole thing and immediately refund the money proportionately and the nice thing about this mechanism is that for ETA IC o---- to kind of break you actually need both the voting mechanism and the founders to be dishonest right because if the founders are dishonest then the dico mechanism can just or the voting mechanism can just say oh it looks like they're dishonest and so we're just going to refund ourselves the funds and will participate in some different da IC o---- but on the other hand if the voting mechanism gets corrupted then if the founding team is itself happens to be honest then well the only thing the voting mechanism can do is it can either like not increase the tap in which case money will still keep on flowing to the team cause everyone to refund refund the money but then if refunding the money was the bad thing to do then everyone who still wants to participate would still just be able to join a new ICO created by the founding team so I thought a story I think one of the main challenges is just people are afraid of sticking fifty million dollars into an audited smart contract and so far no one has had enough private incentive to just develop the contract and have it audited and so if people at this hackathon want to take the first step and just develop a simple da ICO application I think that's a totally legitimate thing to do as well more questions how do you feel like the da ICO squares with security laws because from my understanding like security laws are kind of like don't make promises to develop an application and like steadily get money from it they just want you to develop it and like not advertise it as an investment I think my instinct is that whether or from me kind of very narrowly goes the endpoints whether or not something is a da ICO should not increase the chance that it's like that that it's a security but I'm like basically because like the tests that we've seen so far used in practice about whether or not something's the security have more to do with like basically whether or not the actual application looks like an investment and also the stomach's another contributing factor is like when you get money from the public are you getting the money based on promised those words you or you already have something that's basically usable already built so if for example you have something that's already built and you're just me like collecting money into a pool that maintains it then that seems like it's an allure risk then for creating a totally new project but this seems kind of period jurisdiction specific and they like talk to lawyers bla bla bla bla well we'll do two more questions so if you have any more questions please and will come to you with a mic one at the back hi who would you say is more handsome virgil griffith or vlad Zamfir can I answer Carl what about underrated overrated I feel I just realized I haven't said overrated even once in these sections before so like I don't know keep throwing me stuff and I'll say overrated the first time I think of something that's overrated I don't know I've actually been like warming up on at least some parts of CBC lately though I do think they should the sharding stuff is overrated Jasper the name look really overrated and perfect you've met the official Koval of larding is underrated perfect well I think we'll end it here it's all like thank you so much again and now we'll get on with the rest of the opening ceremonies thanks everybody [Applause] alright so next up we have a couple words from some of our sponsors start to start it off it's B 0 X or B Z X and if you guys want to come up these are gonna be very short presentations from a couple of the sponsors and you guys can find out a little bit more about what they're doing there might also be some prize announcements here so listen hey guys we're b0x we're a decentralized margin lending protocol on the etherium blockchain we are integrated with Xerox relays and khyber network so if you're familiar with the 0x protocol Zarek's lets you exchange assets on the blockchain a decentralized fashion lets you bet that something will go up we let you bet that something will go down and we let you leverage assets so we're live on maintenance relay and we're on the road maps of these other relays right here star bit shark relay insects some of our values are radical decentralization so one of the things we really wanted to do was create an application that would outlast us so if we went away or something like that happen if we went away or something like that happened then the application would still be there and it doesn't require us doesn't require us at all so the way it works is we have two layers we have a protocol layer where there's an escrow contract it handles disbursement of interest it takes in people's and a second layer which is the liquidation layer the Oracle layer so just it's very simple on the first layer it just takes in the funds holds it you can submit Xerox orders to it in order to manage your asset exposure you can use skiver network to manage your asset exposure we have a liquidation layer it's an open protocol anybody can build their own liquidation layer on top of it and but we built our own which basically works by having khyber network as a non chain price feed and on chain source of liquidity margin callers are incentivized by trick the borrower's staking a small bit of collateral big rewarded for that we take a small amount of the interest on the loans as a fee and we put that in a guarantee fund that's handled programmatically it disperses and the case that anything goes under margin maintenance and doesn't liquidate in time for the lender to be made whole so we have a token works the same as the 0x token it's a governance token it's a fee token so on to the exciting things for hackers building on our protocol we have a wish list that we made that we published on medium that we hope everyone checks out there's a number of different things you can do in terms of building a relay can create your own generic relaying one that's integrated with Xerox with the 0x protocol or one that's standalone that works just purely with khyber manage your positions with khyber have margin calls handled by khyber you can create a dark pool relay if you want to have a matching order book that's opaque and gives just-in-time quotes you do something like that and you'll have a dark pool really where you know people can go and they can put in large shorts on the order book and not have everyone know exactly what they're doing you could create a relay that works like shape-shift good put one on ipfs you could create a mobile relay you know like or widget so you could it could be embedded and I am token or any of the other mobile clients that would want to offer shorting could also probably use like a protocol like Aztec to give privacy for Shorter's so if somebody does a large short and they don't want everybody to know what they just did that might be an interesting use case you could integrate us with other liquidity providers like totally fetch air swap you know totally in fetch they both aggregate a lot of liquidity suppliers already you could create a Hydra like protocol for bzx that basically would be like the Hydra protocol for Xerox like a federated liquidity pool with incentive structures for liquidity sharing built-in you could create a paradigm market wrapper contract for Music's which would be like a decent paradigm if you're familiar is like a decentralized real a protocol for decentralizing order books an automated trading interface for like market makers to very easily put in a lot of positions of the napi da checks integration so gnosis just released that there's slow trade that could be an interesting integration and chain link we partnered with them we think that could be another interesting way of powering a liquidation solution so yeah that's it that's what we're about we have a bounty for e for the best project that's a lot less than it was when we first set that bounty but had a feel [Applause] see I don't know how to use the up next copper network hello everyone I'll keep this short and sweet so we can get into hacking I'm gonna introduce briefly cover network so what is khyber network khyber network is a knowledge and liquidity protocol that powers decentralized token swaps basically you can embed this token swap functionality in any application or smart contract and it allows your users to swap across different interfaces and developers can build innovative applications allowing to build the world where any token can be used anywhere and what exactly can you build by integrating this token soft functionality into your application so some examples it's like like a normal swapping you can integrate this into your application and you allow your users to swap between different tokens or either without having your users to leave your application you can build a payments use case or application where you allow your users to pay with any two again but your platform still receives the token of your choice and Qyburn health facility is so can swap behind the scenes and of course you can have your financial application such as a user exit was a here in his presentation earlier a while ago you can build applications that does on chain liquidation or on chain fund rebalancing by leveraging this talking swap functionality so we do have bounties a total worth of fourteen thousand six four dollars and you can check them out at cardboard up at work / hack and if you need any help you can visit our developer telegram group which is a hybrid developer and of course you can visit us at the booth down below there if you need any help so yeah that's all and one more thing if you're thirsty kabra provides liquidity for you all right next up is maker where are the maker folks I'll show you how to use this right here I've run my name is Sean I'm a senior developer at maker we make a stable coin called die as well as a system of permissionless credit so what that means is that you can use our system and lock up collateral batalik talked a bit about it but you can lock up ether as collateral and then loan yourself die which is a stable coin and we've been live on main net for about a year and it's say that right around one u.s. dollar for this entire time even in this market so it's a really useful to use if your application has any sort of fees deposits or payments you can use our or c20 token in it and not have to worry about any sort of volatility and so we have an API prize really we have both a platform and a a product and that died and the CDP's one thing we're targeting right now is lowering the barrier to entry for people to use this so right now it's quite difficult for example we have these happy hours where people buy drinks at a bar with died but they're actually still very difficult to use so any sort of leveraging any sort of these new paradigms like meta transactions recurring payments anything was a Zeke Zeke a Starks that'd be really cool to see we also hear people from 30 plus countries if you have any sort of knowledge of banking api's we're trying to improve our Fiat on and off ramps so if you have any knowledge of what you can use to move die in and out of fiat currency that'd be a really cool thing to see for example in Singapore we have these I see a lot of top-up cards and that sort of thing around here just giving you ideas and so we're gonna split 3,000 died in between the top teams and I recommend going to our community chat room posted up here Deb channel to ask questions we're also at a table or a booth downstairs and we have a really cool NPM library so JavaScript library called died is which should really increase the speed at which you can start your hack I'll be giving a talk on that much more in-depth technical talk tonight I'll be the last talk of the night so after a couple of hours of brainstorming and what you want to build come out and we can chat about what you want to build and help you out and last thing in addition to the prize we're starting a new community fund it's called the core community initiative and survey so we want to continue to fund projects that we see a successful and adding to the community so if you make a project or a company idea and really want to continue to fund that over time so we hope you work a die and you really can really combine us with almost any other project here so we hope you have a great time thank you alright next up is new cipher how you're all the way back there hi everyone my name is Michael I'm the CTO of new cipher and what new cipher is it's basically air layer like a privacy encryption layer for decentralized applications so when you build a decentralized application every time you want to deal with private data you want to keep your data always encrypted because since the application is decentralized you don't know who can who your data is residing with so it could be some stranger and you not always you want everyone to see your data so anyway if you keep your data encrypted it's actually pretty tricky to share this data with other people so if your application requires keeping data encrypted and simoleons they're sharing this data with other participants in the network that's when you use new cipher so new cipher allows you to share data while it's encrypted without decryption during this process of sharing so you can allow someone else who has different encryption keys to read your data which originally was encrypted for you without huge decryption encryption again so anyway oops anyway so we have some needs which which we need basically we want right now our implementation of new cipher is in Python and we definitely want other languages to interact with it so and before we actually implement clients in all possible languages we want other languages to still interact interact with new cypher network with the even before these clients written and that's actually good enough for a hackathon task so if you if you want you can create a client for a new cipher network in in go in JavaScript in anything where you actually interact with the Python client so just you know a wrapper like that which is convenient to use and whatever way you you might think is good for that arm and since we talked about JavaScript maybe her interacting with new cypher network in the browser is good so you could imagine some extension like madam asked where you the extension interacts with the network and again it will be the Python code which interacts with it at this point so if you can pull this off or feel free to to do that but if you can imagine any creative use of new cipher for anything you are building that's actually that's the best thing to focus on and any of this stuff is can get you to the API prize which is $2,500 it didn't change much during this year because of well you $10 oh yes dollars so probably should switch to die but it anyway so this is like their information which like where you can get information about new cipher new cipher dot-com website and new cipher github and one thing which I didn't mention on this slide is the hackathon repository on new cipher github where we have all the information and yeah I feel free to come to new cipher workshop at 11 p.m. today here where I will explain how to set up Thanks next up is consensus there you go hello Michael from consensus we are very excited to be here so consensus okay so consensus is here to help the ethereum community and promote blockchain adoption how we do that we have developed some tools that are here for you for developers for end-users you probably have heard about meta masks truffle you port an ethe you can I do all of this to lock up and running and for you to use so we hope that these tools will allow you to transform you ideas into reality so this is all for consensus we have a you have a lot to do over the weekend good luck and thank you [Applause] cool thank you guys for presenting the projects we there are some additional prizes that we are going to list for you and then you want to start this off we have thirty five thousand dollars in prizes for four hacks from our sponsors so Eragon will award two thousand dollars for the best integration and governance plan for an hour gone down five hundred to the runner-up a thousand I and giveth swag to the team with the project with the most social impact b0x for eath to the team with the best use of bzx b0x bamboo relay and seller will award $1,000 for the best use of the seller SDK there's more though was I oh just best used to pzx it doesn't have to be bamboo okay cool so Khyber is also offering a prize Khyber will award 3000 cynic or yeah Singaporean dollars worth of can see tokens to the team with the most innovative use case for Kuiper's protocol maker dowel will award 3000 and die to the team with the best use of the maker API news cipher will it work we already know this new server will award 2500 to the team with the most effective use of the new cipher platform and the Raiden Network will award 2000 in radan tokens to the team with the most innovative use case built using the Raiden API and 1000 in rdn tokens the team with the best UX UI using the Raiden API I think we've three more separate all three thousand dollars total to the top three teams about 1500 $1500 it's the best use of set Quan stamp will award a thousand dollars to four teams for four different projects see their dev post status will award for the best use of statics extensions $1,000 one team and $500 to the runner-up so these are the prizes that you guys should look out for they are listed on the prizes website now there if you forget them no keep saying a word echo slash prizes exactly so here's some of our sponsors sponsors yes so it's it's always important to remember that these events don't happen without sponsors so you know take advantage of being able to talk to people about their dev tools and and and be able to give them feedback on that and be thankful for their their use here let's let's give all our sponsors a hand [Applause] so b0x new cipher maker fiber network consensus status set let me say go Raiden a combo Labs Quan stamp in fira and seller thank you guys and we also have silica I am token alpha wallet open token Matic lap Matic Network Aragon the bridge blockchain at NTU neutral theorem Singapore SG innovate kinetic crypto briefing coin market cap W XY group and long hash so thank you again to these sponsors I think this is I think we got him [Applause] Singapore nothing good looks pretty cool I kind of want to go up there alright so get set for two days of workshops Tech Talks free food which is good because Singapore is a bit expensive so free food and an after-party cool so rules and criteria for the hackathon a maximum of four team members everybody must physically be at this event no online remote working yeah that's not your friends can help you they have to be here as I said before like we don't want PowerPoint presentations this is not a venture capital pitch this is a hackathon demo and all code must be written at the hackathon here and posted to dipose finalists will be chosen based on technicality originality practicality design allottee yeah and the wow factor a couple of you laughs thank you thank you alright so hacking ends at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday every member must have signed up on dev post I believe this takes a little while so it's really important you do that early don't wait to the last minute to do that you will have you having five minutes to demo and two minutes for questions from the judges on Sunday yeah and for more check out East Singapore dev post.com and team formation if you don't have a team you should stick around here at least when we start cool and if you do have a team and I guess you can get started after this it is 9:30 yeah I suppose you can so then I think let's give ourselves a round of applause we're about to start the hackathon [Applause]
