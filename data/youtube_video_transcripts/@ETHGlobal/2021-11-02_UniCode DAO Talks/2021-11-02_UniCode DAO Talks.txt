good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik i want to welcome all of you to the unicode dow talks so all of you are watching this thing on 8th global.tv this is a live platform we're using for the next few hours so if you have any questions for our speakers if you're any comments you can pick them up in chat and i encourage good morning good afternoon and good evening to login and uh we'll be able to relay those questions directly to our speakers all right so this event is brought to you by youth global um and for those of you who don't know the closed organization with a very simple mission our goal is to bring out thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem so we cover everything uh in the web3 ecosystem by doing summits and hackathons and unicode is one of our events covering both the best of both worlds so unicode is a hackathon that's going on for two weeks where we have over 320 hackers from 40 different countries in spanning 17 different time zones working on the latest in the base on the unesco protocol and on top of that we have over 20 ecosystem mentors six technical mentors and seven partners we're helping all of our hackers get to the best of what the projects they want to build so today is dow talks we're going to cover a lot of stuff around what's happening with daos and i'm going to quickly give an overview of what the next few hours look like and then we'll go right into our very first talk so we're going to talk about what worker cooperatives look like in dao's how should we think about co-ops and agents tokens uh just a legal framework on how we come up with a better legal understanding of how we can structure dows we're going to have another discussion on these legal draw structures we're going to talk about collaboration at the governance level and also go into some philosophy around looks like we're experiencing some technical difficulties but connor if you cannot introduce yourself uh would love for you to kick off with what the rest of today looks like and i will jump right into our very first talk amazing thanks um so hi all thanks for joining i'm conor spelsey and i'm here today representing the dow research collective uh we organized today's speakers with the help of course of the amazing folks at youth global and uniswap grants i'm a former lawyer i'm the co-founder of the blockchain association and i'm also the founder of the dow research collective so daos are of course cutting edge organizational structures don't have to tell any of you that i'm sure but there's really very limited precedent for how doubt stakeholders operate their dows dow stakeholders are starting to think about things like i'm sure many of you are starting to think about around legal governance treasury management etc but much of that information is still really being siloed inside particular daos now we've brought together today's group of speakers to help push more of that information out to the community particularly around dao structuring and governance today our goal the dow research collective generally is accelerate dow functionality by open sourcing and procuring research foundational to effective dao operation we think the research being presented here today is exactly that and so we're proud to be providing grants to many of the speakers for the research that they've prepared today we'll continue to host more events like today's support research and encourage more cooperation between dows if you're interested in getting involved getting involved you can reach out to me on twitter at the underscore spallacy or check us out at uh xyz and i'm sure the same goes for kartik as it relates to youth global they put on a ton of amazing events and so i highly recommend you check out their website to make sure that you're up to date with what they're doing before we started you want to thank eat global for putting this on and for all their amazing work in the space and also you know swap grants for their support and their amazing work now as always just a little bit of housekeeping for today none of the information provided by our speakers is legal or investment advice in any way you need to consult professionals or lawyers before taking any action and with that i believe we have bill warren on the line and i'm very honored to introduce him as our first speaker bill is the executive steward of product and technology at opolis i saw him speak at liz conn just last week and he did an amazing job and and so i'm sure he'll do the same today so bill i think that we can now bring you up there you are sir thank you awesome yep so also just want to reiterate what connor said nothing i'm saying is legal advice i'm actually a former lawyer so that means don't listen to me and it gives me the permission at least in my mind to be a little bit spicier with some of my legal takes than maybe some of the folks that are still practicing out there in the world so i work for opolis which is an employment commons we are what i'd like to think of as an employment dow um where we offer payroll benefits and shared services to freelancers especially in the crypto endowment space and we do this by being legally a cooperative in the state of colorado so i i truly believe that it's helpful to start at the beginning and kind of think about what our dows and how dows intersect with the future of work you know we believe the future of work is dow more people than ever kind of trading that 40 years at ibm with a golden pin at the end for freelance work and the next iteration of that kind of freelancer work is working for dowels or nft projects that are really kind of like quasi dows and getting that financial and employment freedom which is fantastic but it doesn't mean that um you can kind of transcend the need to pay taxes or you know have benefits for yourself since at least in the u.s those are very important to being kind of functioning members of society and also protecting yourself and your family from risk you know at opolis you know we we started because we saw this trend of workers moving to independence this has this is something where obviously this chart goes back to 2019 but really you know starting in the 70s and 80s you saw more and more mobility from workers where they were switching companies and now we've seen workers rather than switching companies kind of declaring themselves freelancers and going for a lifestyle that allows them to truly control their working life day to day pick who they work for when they work where they work all of that is great and um all of that is kind of being seen in the dow space as well on the opposite side a lot of our members and the cooperative are those who work for dows and we've seen a huge jump in membership in the last year as as taos have taken off and more and more people are working full-time for daos to give a quick kind of introduction on how dows work at least in my mind you know obviously most of you all know this but i like to think of dows as just kind of simple collectives where people come together around a shared interest or project they put together a treasury of tokens maybe those tokens are reputational maybe those tokens represent capital or some other form of assets and then they use decentralized governance mechanisms to distribute that treasury and make decisions on how they allocate those assets to achieve those goals you know we see this in practice in dallas that range in mission from something like madaga delta which is an amazing organization of women in the space that are supporting other women with grants to more investment type dials like the lao or meta cartel ventures where those are typically accredited investors making actual investments in other web3 projects to something like dow house where i also contribute and that's a kind of dow that is building a project product for others to use it just also happens to be the dow that is building a dow platform i i do think it's nice to kind of take a little bit of a um historical maybe side quest here and mention that dows are not the geek economy i i think the gig economy came about with a lot of promise but quickly turned out to be exploitative and the big problem which is a problem that dao solved is that within the gig economy power was still concentrated in these traditional corporations where you know the corporation was governed by the you know idea of shareholder primacy where everything the corporation does needs to be increasing the value of the shareholders and their shares in the corporation that means that a lot of the focus of these companies was to increase the wealth of their venture capitalists the early employees who owned shares and kind of anybody else that invested in the company often at the expense of those who were users of the platform either you know gig workers or those utilizing gig workers and also probably later employees dows truly give a way for all stakeholders to participate in value creation in a way that we really haven't seen obviously a lot of that value creation is in a legal gray area still if you start to think about the securities laws but i i do and see this and i am hopeful that this is kind of a trend towards a more stakeholder economy rather than kind of late stage capitalism that has become pretty exploitative so i think you know what what we do at opolis is help people figure out how to work for dows and this is where i feel like i can be a little bit more spicy yolo than some of the practicing attorneys because i think a lot of dows are meant to exist ephemerally you know if you're if you're running a investment dow you know of course kind of like foreman llc you know keep it to in credit investors keep the number reasonable under 100 for investment act purposes you know if you're doing what we do at opolis where you need a legal entity form a cooperative right that that does kind of give a lot more of the stakeholder economics um or give those gives the potential for a lot more of the stakeholder economics that dao's represents and endows should be striving for because we can return profits in the form of patronage to members across kind of membership classes but then again a lot of dows until there's like a really good kind of dow form which i don't believe exists yet are going to exist ephemerally because they exist across borders and and that's okay um because you know one thing that we do is help people who work for ephemeral dows protect themselves from a liability ish you know perspective and access traditional benefits and payroll services so our prototypical member is patty who works for dalles she loves working for dalles but her problem is she gets paid and die she has zero purchasing power in terms of getting benefits and she doesn't have a w-2 which makes it kind of hard to get like home loans or car loans and participate in the normie economy still the solution we recommend at opolis and again talk to your lawyer make sure this is right for you is that people should be wrapping themselves in llc's or s corpse in order to provide themselves individual liability protection and that way the dow pays the llc for the s corp and then the s corporal llc pays the individual contributor you know this allows dows to remain more internet native and ephemeral if they want to um it protects the individual contributors with entities which i think is important in the long run and and i think dows should be responsible and think about how to protect those who contribute to the taos and it also confers tax advantages to the contributors you know where we at opolis take it a step further is rather than having these s-corps and llc's exist in a vacuum we kind of bundle them under the employment commons lca which is again a colorado cooperative and this structure allows us to be people's co-employer so while patty might have patty corp that gets paid by the dow she can also have opolis or the employment comments lca as her co-employer that way petty corp can use the employment commons for running payroll and tax compliance it can also she can also access benefits through the employment commons so rather than going out to the kind of individual markets or trying to find a broker for herself and her maybe one business partner she or they can access benefits through the employment commons where we negotiate for everybody in the commons so it's a lot more akin to the rates that you would get working at a large startup or organization you also get a w-2 this way so in a lot of ways the legal structure around the employment commons allows us to give people who work for dows the experience of working for a larger traditional corporation while actually still getting paid and died from some ephemeral internet organization so you know this this creates a one-stop shop for paddy but i think the other nice thing about co-ops that you know mentioned a little bit in the background is that patty's not only a user or customer of opolis and the employment commons but patty's a member and owner of the employment commons and that means that she can share in patronage and and the benefits of the commons that way if we run a profit kind of like rei patti can get some of the fees that she's paid into the commons back she could at some point realize you know patronage and that kind of looks like a little bit of profits and because we're you know web 3 forward we're tracking patronage and tracking governance rights within the commons and within our dow using the work token so we are you know not going plain vanilla on our cooperative structure we are pushing the boundaries there a little bit by saying you know why don't we tokenize you know governance tokenize patronage and reward people like patty for their consumption of the common services whether that be payroll or reward her for helping recruit new members to the commons or providing other value to the comments maybe paddy is a great developer and she helps in the future develop technology that the commons uses she would receive work tokens for that as well this means those who contribute more have more governance have a greater share of patronage and we've created this kind of dynamic stakeholder economy that i believe really transcends and fixes a lot of the problems of the prior gig economy and the challenges that freelancers faced so in summary i'm going to say with a few caveats you know our opinion is let dows be daos right if you need a legal structure i would say one talk to a lawyer but think kind of carefully about what legal structure you want to take if it's the investment club sure go with an llc in wyoming or delaware if it is more of a project-based kind of dow that you have and you really want to distribute value across stakeholders i would strongly recommend a colorado cooperative just because you can do a lot more and there's a lot more flexibility there in terms of distributing value to those stakeholders in any case this i do want to kind of reiterate and strongly push is that please protect individual contributors as you're creating the dao right people are working hard for your doubt contributing make sure they've wrapped themselves in some sort of limited liability entity so that if the sec or whoever is looking at the dow and they're looking through to the membership that those members are protected in some way and you know if you are a dow and you've got a bunch of great contributors that need benefits and you know payroll services and tax compliance please send them to opolis sorry that's my little show at the end so uh that's all i have for today and uh looking forward to hearing from the rest of the speakers amazing thank you bill much appreciated um and i think bill will you also be joining us for the panel later on i will yeah amazing okay so we'll you'll get more bill content in just about an hour um and now we're going to move on to yev which nick and jaclyn right about so yeah and jacqueline are both lawyers of jay weiner and we've been working with kevin jacqueline um on a paper recently that they are drafting on structuring dows as cooperatives so at least portions of dave's cooperative so i am very excited to dive a little bit further with them on that today so we have jacqueline here and i imagine we'll see if you have uh yep is currently missing at the moment but maybe i'll i'll leave it to jacqueline to get started thanks hi there um so yeah thank you for having us uh oh there you go yeah this is joining us so let her get us started and i'll talk to you in a second sorry i'm just sharing my screen so bear with me for a second please my name is yav muchnick and i'm joined by my colleague jackie radebow we're here to talk about style co-ops and patronage tokens and grateful to bill for setting the stage um to some of the work that we're doing here in colorado so we are with a law firm called jason weiner pc based out of boulder colorado um i also have my firm which is called launch legal and i'm of counsel to to jason's firm um i'll let jackie provide some background on her work as well yeah so um i've been working with the firm since january 2021 with background and cooperative corporate taxation between brazil and nonprofit working in europe and started working with yeah earlier this summer on the overlap of my work in blockchain and we found it to be dao's work so i'm excited to be here and i'm excited to talk and so my background is more traditional corporate insecurities um i took a deep dive into the crypto and blockchain space back in 2016 um with the influx of icos have been around to watch it mature and participate in molding it um i'd like to think that i've had some hand in molding the maturity of the space as well from a legal perspective i'm really excited to amalgamate um some of the work that we're doing with kind of the traditional layering of corporate structuring information and the web3 technical framework on top of that just a little bit more background about our firm jason weiner pc is preeminently known in the country for its work in the the co-op space we're a business boutique business law so we concentrate on shared ownership creative financing securities employee ownership co-ops co-op development and business consultancy across different sectors and industries and we've got a team of core six core attorneys and four contractors and 40 years of combined cooperative experience um so we are actually practicing lawyers unlike uh connor and bill who uh made the kind of caveat disclaimer that they are not but we are and so none of the information that we are disseminating here is intended to be legal advice it's just for educational purposes um but we are certainly deep into it and and hopefully you'll enjoy the discourse and kind of share your ideas as well via twitter via email so please feel free to engage or buy questions through the seminar um so why why are we here today and and what is our presentation about um we um based on our core work in the cooperative space um and the web3 space we are seeing that there is very much a revolt against the traditional corporate forum of corporations um and the way that they've been structured the way that they've been evolved or the way that they're evolving um they traditionally they're top down in terms of governance they are all about shareholder maximization um and really an asymmetry in um in power and and and that just doesn't align with sort of the the kind of groups that we're working with especially in in the dao space um so dao's from our perspective are a revolt on the traditional corporate forum they are they typically or they have been taking the form of unincorporated um associations and being treated like general partnerships so um there are a number of legal issues that arise from that designation including liability and fiduciary duties and things of that nature the lca is a modern take on the traditional co-op and so kind of in in how lcas have been adapted and their flexibility their principle-based approach to meeting the needs of organizers and groups really you've seen kind of the marriage between daos and lca so our theory and our kind of thesis that we're here to share with you today is that we while still that while there's still sort of no ideal legal form or structure for the dao we do think that the colorado lca statutes provide um some of the kind as to what's out there some of the best suited um kind of regulatory environment and framework for for what we're hoping to accomplish right so before we get on to the overlap um i think it's important to to define what we're talking about right so cooperatives uh they can be um they can be statutory business entities and i'll touch on that they can be a set of practices and values and really a way of organizing and doing business that comes with a set of practices like shared decision making it can be a set of basic principles so uh it could be and when we talk about cooperative we expect to hear and we hear about rush day of principles the seven basic principles or the mondragon principles which is a little more expended and based on its labor-centered set of principles and as the statutory business entities and taking the example of colorado where our firm is based you're going to find article 55 cooperative so they that's a statute that is historically used by conventional cooperative industries such as housing cooperatives and electric utility cooperatives and this article is less and less uh article 56 essentially are cooperative corporations so majority of the state the states throughout the country have adopted a similar statutory framework and the majority of the known tech cooperatives in colorado still use this article to form their cooperatives so the members then are given the opportunity to create their entity that fits their needs their bylaws can supersede most of the statutory governing characteristics so and and then it's still allowing for investors to participate in the growth of the entity but without voting power and article 58 that's the more recent addition to the suite of cooperative uh statutes in colorado and it's slightly different cooperative form and it's known as the limited cooperative association that bill touched on and that's the one we've been working with in the context of dao cooperatives as well that allows as a form it allows for unknown patient investors to participate and have non-controlling rights to vote that the cooperative may or may not adopt if the members choose to do so um it has been objective criticism within the more traditional cooperative sectors because of the acceptance of investors and some level of not control but voting rights to investors sometimes so that's sometimes a hurdle in the more traditional sectors but a benefit for some folks and then we have you are welcome to move along to the next and again that benefit of and flexibility when folks are using looking for flexibility in their entity type uh looking for outside of capital um they're innovating they want a flexible entity type that really the simplest way and maybe more traditional way of explaining for those that are used to cooperative to corporations and two llc's is that the lca it's a merger of those it gives you the flexibility typically find an lca in an llc model um and it's internally governed by a set of uh bylaws but also allows some of the cooperative principles that we're also going to touch on again to be baked in that entity type so startups are looking for lca model because they are seeking outside capital and flexibility doubts again because of flexibility but also because of the overlap of principles of decentralization democratic participation of members the mutual democratic participation in the revenue and profits that are generated um by the members and the distribution that you touched on that lcas can benefit from and therefore dials a document model next please um so we can typify cooperatives by membership and by sector and then i have a little bit of those there so by membership classes uh and for example in a purchasing or shared cooperative services where members are all business or organizations who use the cooperative to more efficiently uh manage their operations or their join or acquire access to bulk services and we could say that employment commons reflects that model where the cooperative functions as a group purchasing vehicle for benefits to their members to be provided by the members so i do want to highlight in that sense that that's one of the reasons why the employment commons have their members as entity types that's a very important characteristic of a purchasing cooperative those are business organizations who use the cooperative in that sense and then you can have types of cooperatives by sector you can have a traditional one is the agricultural sector but the tech sector can um it's growing through cooperative platforms cooperatives that we're seeing so folks using just web 2 and now web 3 to implement their processes or relationship within membership and and that could combine the classes of membership within their sectors so imagine a tech cooperative a dow co-op a dell lca that has workers and consumers uh that both benefit differently from the cooperative the workers by being able to own their portion or their membership and be a member owner as workers by providing the activity that we know that we know as patreon objectivity to the collaborative the dow lca but also the consumers so imagine a dow that sells nfts and we're going to touch on an example later on um that can be also members the purchasing the folks that are purchasing that from the cooperative as well um there you go we're back to a screen and then you have a moving on to the cooperative principles that will be the next one the black screen there you go so quickly on that one i just wanted to give you a visual of the basic uh rushdale cooperative principles that were adopted in 1800s in russia england and have formed the basis for principles that are adopted on which cooperatives around the world still operate today so when we talk about cooperative principles overlapping without principles those are the principles we have in mind and have seen some of those reflected within the dow practices and work uh you have to want to move along please and then we can summarize uh legal characteristics of cooperatives in this way um one member one vote typically the lca law also does allow member uh voting to be increased based on patronage activity and i'll explain what that means um but essentially allowing more the more you interact with the cooperative the more voting power you may have so a little variation to one member won't vote um business carried on for the mutual benefit of the members that's an important characteristic so the existence of the cooperative is to benefit the members in the cooperative with them workers or consumers or purchasers the profits are distributed to the members based on their patronage activity and not equity so people receive the members receive return back from the cooperative based on how much interactions they have with the cooperative and not how much money they put into the cooperative um so on and that's the the defining characteristic of that patronage activity so um patronage just simply i guess put if i can ever put something simply is just activity done by the members in relation to the co-op that results in generation of profits to the co-op so if the cooperative is a consumer co-op the cooperative's business is to sell something and the consumer's activity is to buy that something that is a patronage activity um so uh those businesses or the cooperative typically operate at cost it doesn't mean that they don't generate profits but it doesn't generate profits or surpluses to the entity itself the goal in generating profits is one for the profits to be generated by the activity of the members and two that that profit and surpluses that are generated from that activity be at some point distributed and for the benefit of the members so you're gonna hear patronage distributions paycheck dividend those are all names for that distribution of surpluses um limited transfer of ownership is important we've talked quite a bit about in the context of dell with some of our clients a member in a cooperative corporation cannot sell their membership interest in the cooperative if they decide no longer to be a member if the determination their membership is terminated or purchased back by the entity itself you cannot just put that on secondary market or or transfer that to another person that is not otherwise eligible for membership um and then i guess i'll just touch on limited liability for members so members in engaging in the activities of the cooperative and or through the cooperative get um have protection and their assets and that's something that our clients have sought um heavily and i think will touch it on is important to protect the members assets and the members from liabilities in the activity of the the business that that entity the business purpose and um having adopting an lca like other corporate models also protects them from that um and then uh just i won't forget to mention securities exemption that exists um you have might touch more on that but just essentially if you remember you're not investing in the cop you're purchasing your membership into the co-op and any distributions that come to that from that because coming from your engagement with the cooperative and not through the efforts of others it's um also that stock is exempt from securities registration then next thank you i apologize for all the uh the back and forth screens come popping in and out but um so we've attempted to um do somewhat of a scrape of the um public information available on different kinds of dowels this is just a small snapshot of two that we chose from our list and in sitting down and trying to design um co-op daos whether with with new dows or with existing daos these are some of the things that we're we're looking at whether kind of what the what community what what industry the community is based on the type of membership whether they've issued a native token how tokens are earned or collected whether there's any kind of value and whether that token has kind of bifurcated rights whether governance or economic rights the mechanism in which the dao is is operated um whether there's any kind of specific focus um and generally kind of the number of of disclosed token holders or members um so it's important to to look at some of these aspects in designing the co-op doubt just because of some of the the categories that jackie touched upon earlier and trying to figure out where the cooperative membership really rests in and and then kind of structuring governance based on that so whether it's a um producer cooperative whether it's a service based co-op project-based or multi-stakeholder among all the other ones that are listed we're also big fans of metagama delta they are a female-focused dow that allow members to come together and vote on on female-led projects um they are on discord and are on the second version of the molok dao um so just kind of in in looking at existing daos and how they've naturally or organically come to be um we again look at membership the type of activity um the type of members that are eligible whether they have to have some kind of an active role or a passive role whether they have to be a token holder to to vote or participate in treasury activity um also how the dow makes money that's that's pretty relevant in our analysis and that it's not just kind of setting up a co-op and and that could by by purchasing membership or by purchasing tokens that's generally not enough to create the patron objectivity that um that we've been discussing so it's really the organization between the organization the members and the revenue generation which drive patron objectivity which jackie will talk about a little bit more yeah so we wanted to highlight the patreon objectivity because i think that's one of the defining factors of or defining characteristics of a cooperative right so you have just generally in a stockholder economy you have folks that put money into that business and expect that workers and the management and the entity will produce revenue that will be distributed on this stakeholder just generally stakeholder model that is a cooperative the goal is really to have that interaction the participation of the member and by that participation generate revenue so patronage is the concept that allows or that defines the members participation so it is an action of purchasing or selling purchasing from or selling to or otherwise engaging in the activity of the use of the goods or services provided by the cooperative for the members or for the benefit of the members so uh rei is an example that's often uh brought that's a consumer cooperative and it's been brought up several times um it's it's a big entity with a lot of members and participants as a consumer cooperative it has a purpose a business purpose of selling goods and the patronage activity of the members is purchasing those goods right so once you when you buy the long enough or a certain amount of goods and services you're gonna receive a return so when when you're engaging in that activity the patronage activity that's generating revenue for the business the distribution you receive will be a patronage-based income or a patronage based distribution you your activity your patronage activity allow the entity or the business that entity to generate some profits after expenses that surplus which is left over doesn't go to stockholders pockets or to investors pockets but typically get distributed for the benefit of those that actually generated that revenue that profit that resulted at the end um and then we have been encouraging uh our dollar clients to adopt uh that have adopted the lca model to be really uh intentional about defining that patronage activity because that comes with attacks a specific tax treatment it comes with securities expectations that it is not a security because formed in this way or gender or profits generated in a certain way it generates profits it gets distributed um all those expectations that come with it needs to be um to conform with us with the definition so we've been uh with advice clients to be uh clients to be very specific on those because being on the web 3 on 14 and all that brings money as the lines a little bit from selling goods or selling services as you typically expect cooperatives to do and then adopting uh what we're calling patronage tokens um digital tokens tied to that activity that gets used to trace the patreon objectivity so the same way that we can use co-apps to trace attendance uh on events maybe using that as a unit of accounting to trace the patron objectivity and then therefore use that token itself to trace the returns as well or use that as an account measurement of accounting to return the distribution um to the members later on so patronage tokens a token also that represents a membership that is separate from the page on each token so um if later on there are any questions or the irs or some other agencies are struggling to find out how to use that well we can explain that they have different uses different purposes and they make sense within that context but also fit the legal needs or the legal frameworks that are already placed by cooperatives i didn't want to mention that and that also becomes a way of facilitating vote based on patronage maybe you're tying your votes to your token itself but your vote could be increased by by the amount of paycheck that you do and again that can be done through the way you trace by tracing your patreon objectivity and again using that measurement uh so i wanted to touch briefly on a course i'm very excited about adele club i am excited about just because we just recently formed uh the song adele co-op lca it was organized under article 58 so it is a limited cooperative association and their business purposes essentially to eliminate the middleman just run the music industry and really have songs being heard as much as possible and then distribute the profits and the priorities that are generated from that back to the members whose patreon objectivity is really promote the listening of songs so they will be purchasing song that they nfts they will uh be promoting the songs that come with the nfts and as the cooperative the dow generates revenue varieties through that activity they will be receiving returns from that it will be governed by a board of stewards that's appointed information and then what elected later on by the membership as a membership growth and their goal is really to implementation of chain activity and not really to centralize decision making so there are parameters that we put in place to make sure that once it reaches a certain number of members it goes it reduces any power that the entity that board they can can take or any controlling actions that they they might take to essentially overtake or overrun the entity um it's this entity will have two formal class of members and an informal part membership participation uh through discord voting or not really voting but participation there and to formal class supporting members um again returns will be made to to those voting members based on their patronage activity and this client went along with the recommendation and have adopted a specific membership token and they will have the patronage token to trace the activity of the members and then um they will be purchasing from the cooperative cooperatively um and we just kind of wanted to summarize again on bill did a great job um kind of talking about the philosophical aims and um general overview of the employmentopolis and the employment commons but kind of getting down to more of the granular legal aspects of how uh we helped structure the commons and really they really pioneered the lca dow co-op structure or model in in colorado um we organized them under article 58 as a public benefit limited cooperative association so you can also kind of designate a specific public benefit in in addition to the cooperative principles that we talked about earlier we categorize them as a purchasing or shared services cooperative and so far as they're able to share the services of benefits and payroll and these decentralized employment organization um other services that that the commons provides and the commons is an employment ecosystem which is designed to empower the self-sovereign worker which i think is it's a pretty pretty bold thing to do it really shifts um kind of power alignment shifts power allocation to the worker and allows them to engage um in this modern world in a very different way whether it's with dao's or other um other kind of traditional organizations but um being empowered to have benefits and being compliant i think allows you to sort of um have a lot more bargaining power in than you did previously as kind of a single worker so um through the commons employees receive w-2s um the structure is based on co-employment and and members can gain access whether your employee member or a coalition member you have rights to certain benefits that the commons offers the employee members gain access to health care and benefits and payroll um the bylaw that the commons is governed by the board of stewards as well um and voting is based on quadratic voting um and we use a gnosis multi-sig um but the bylaws does provide that there is a transition for decentralization on reaching a membership threshold of a thousand members um and the bylaws can be adapted when when such an event takes place um and kind of more dictated or realigned by the members um so the commons does have a native work token which is a unit of account that's used to determine patronage profits um and as they are declared by the commons they are unlocked by um payroll mining and based on a formula called acpb um and so again kind of the the the general kind of woven piece here for all co-ops is that the members that are using and earning the work tokens are actually using services provided by the commons they're um they're providing referrals they're staking it's not sort of just a passive membership but it's it's rewarding people for um for taking part and i think that's really what we've come to conclude as um something that's very much shared with with daos and kind of creating these larger networks and and having um different kinds of member participation and and reward systems built in that way um so that's us and we are really i mean it's a really exciting time to be lawyering at the moment um and feel free to reach us at our email addresses or at our twitter handles um it's been a pleasure presenting and uh we will be releasing a paper as well on the topics that we presented today so that's to come right yeah thanks jack can you really appreciate it and jackie able be available during our panel in about half an hour so you'll see them there too we'll see you again um so for the next speakers we're excited to be joined by dave and care and miles jennings both of whom are very experienced and very talented lawyers david is the founder of cowrey llc and miles is the general counsel for a16z crypto many of you may have read the amazing paper that david and miles put out i think was just last week um i think the biggest legal paper drop i've ever seen in crypto world if you haven't read it highly recommend you check it out um you can find it via their twitter or we'll post a link to it at collective.xyz so there are david and miles hey guys we'll leave it to you all right thanks a lot alright thanks connor uh thank you heath global unit swap grants program dow research collective i hope everyone out there is having a great hackathon we appreciate you letting us drop in to talk to you we're going to be talking about system of a dam a legal framework for dows so not too dense i hope uh my name is david kerr i'm a tax attorney i worked in for ernst young for a while there the gaming and telecom sectors and then when i left ey i started a consulting practice to help with crypto issues uh well first i took a little break but then i started a consulting practice to help with crypto issues and uh miles approached me about the risks basic treasuries and some of the issues going on with dows and so we ultimately prepared the memo that connor was talking about um you know we didn't get here alone there's a lot of people in the space doing really good work i think every time you know we start talking about tax i got to reference david shakur's 2016 article it was awesome obviously our memo has contributions from folks who helped us just a ton and uh without further ado i'm going to introduce you to my co-pitcher miles he's very boring but he's very smart so find the fortitude to stay awake he's gonna have some good stuff for you i don't i don't think i i buy into that description but um yeah my name's uh miles jennings um i was a partner at latham watkins uh until about three months ago i've been there for 11 years in the emerging companies group where i kind of specialized representing uh vcs and you know the companies that they invested in um i got started in the blockchain space in in 2017 working with consensus you know basically trying to help them cool the market from going down the ico craze uh and the sap craze uh and so wrote a bunch about you know those instruments and those uh offerings back then um and then from there kind of you know got paradigms the client i basically formed them and then and then have done all or did all of their deals for about two or three years uh and and then also brought in other you know big vcs like uh para parify pantera dragonfly code two ribbit uh an a16z and then i also worked with uh you know a bunch of companies in the space including unit swap ave uh idle finance element finance you know a bunch of bunch of d5 uh protocols and then uh you know starting to move into nfts before i made the jump to a16z about three months ago um you know so this this problem of kind of you know what to do about dows really came up in the role of of working with companies who were very frustrated by you know what the post token issuance world looked like um and so that was kind of the reason i enrolled uh dave to help me out um so here's a quick disclaimer uh obviously this is is not legal advice um and you know we'd recommend uh speaking to an attorney especially about the paper that we wrote if you do want to go down this path um okay so just starting out like very basically from our perspective right the there is no um one size fits all uh you know structure to use for dabs right dows are there are come in all forms of different shapes and sizes when when dave and i first got started on this pro problem we were really focused on on dows that were formed in connection with uh d5 protocols that had decentralized right so we were looking mostly at smart contract protocols um where you know your number of holders was you know into the thousands tens of thousands um you know anonymous people on on you know the blockchain and ultimately that was was kind of what the the key focus is obviously you know there are blockchain networks that use coinbase voting um and so i think you know there are some opportunities for you know this structure to be used with with those dows um you know there are also social clubs artist collectives um that has has become you know that's really an emerging area of what you know use cases for dows are um i you know i think those are the co-op structure obviously is very interesting um and i think that you know it really is going to depend on the facts and circumstances around kind of how transferable you want your tokens to be whether you're for profit or not right that will ultimately you know be the deciding factors in terms of what structure you go for and then they're also you know just investment clubs and we're starting to see more and more of these where you know a group of people are are basically um coalescing around an investment structure and and you know wanting to basically act uh collectively in making investments um so you know in in that context the the legal issues that we were primarily focused on in in dealing with these you know dow problems right are uh securities laws right everyone knows uh the howie test in this space um there's also landrath um which really looks at whether or not the instrument is our shares and in you know what what that's really looking at basically there's a it's a five factor test um but you know a lot of tokens would uh technically constitute uh shares or stock under this test um if they were entitled to a distribution of profits um and so that is is one of the other uh kind of areas where we've been you know focused on with respect to this structure um legal existence uh is is a concern right if you don't have any uh legal entity that you've formed then you know what is common law going to you know stick you into uh if if it's a for-profit business that often looks like a general partnership um if it's not a for-profit business then it likely would be an unincorporated association which is one of the nice things about the structure here and that it's almost the default uh if if you are structured properly um from a tax perspective uh you know this is one of the leading factors in kind of what was driving this issue right is a lot of d5 protocols had started jazz had created treasuries with dows uh and you know those treasuries were worth uh hundreds of thousands of dollars for you know millions of dollars or billions of dollars and as a result of that uh you know there was obviously a strong desire to potentially uh you know diversify the treasury's assets um and you know the question then became well how do you pay taxes on that if there's no legal entity associated with it um you know then there's liability i think this is a you know should be a significant concern for any founder or you know investor uh or dow member in the space um you know typically general partnership liability looks at its its you know can go to any single general partner so it doesn't have to be shared equally and as a result of that you know any general partner that's identified um could potentially be liable for any harm now that probably wasn't you know a very big concern when dowse you know especially for these g5 protocols were you know just getting set up and there weren't any real world activities you know you maybe had some um proposals going on around like what collateralization ratios or what pools to open up but you know very very unlikely set of harm there um now that the dows are growing you know they're taking on real world operations um the the need to bridge the you know the virtual world and the digital or in the real world um is is becoming more and more important and and from a liability perspective you know your assets and and you live in the real world and therefore not having kind of protection there for what you're doing in the virtual world uh is is just taking on along a lot of risk um you know contracting another area where you know given you know the operations of dows are expanding um you know you're seeing more of a need to actually have legal agreements in place with respect to service providers so just for instance right there are you know any number of proposals that have been up with respect to d5 protocols where they've been uh you know they've hired basically someone to provide a service to the doubt but if you don't have a legal agreement there then you don't really have any right to kind of demand that the person perform or that they actually meet their obligations and as a result of that you know we have seen a lot of dows struggle with actually the quality of the um you know work being done uh by service providers uh dave do you want to speak more about the tax point yeah um i'm just taking just a little bit of a step back because you know i know that our audience is we're dealing with a really international community and you've just heard three presentations that have hit on u.s issues so i'm gonna get into it a little bit in this section on why the u.s is kind of such an important part of the discussion and then so hopefully that can kind of probably answer a question that i'm sure is blowing up the chat rooms right now so one of the difficulties in discussing tax issues is that the rules are extremely complicated and can hinge on the slightest of details uh when sophistic when sufficient precedent exists answers can be clean but even then they usually are caveated so much like when you've talked to a tax professional that it's hard to understand a lot of maybes a lot of ifs a lot of you know oh don't quote me on that and so what we're trying to do you know i'm gonna take a step back because decentralized governance is found on consensus building and collaborative decision making so i'm going to try my level best to drop the hedging the disclaimers that out of confusion and just try to take as clean a line as possible through this uh which means i need you all to know that someone i'm going to say it's going to be simplified to the point of being oversimplified even you know potentially wrong uh but these are general ideas and conclusions and subject to much change depending on facts and circumstances so you can't take these kind of high level decisions and apply them to a company uh but on the other hand you know dows are made up of collectors of people who make decisions together uh and so education's hugely important and we're not going to start with that education by starting with the most technical answer and really nuanced issues we kind of need to get into a little bit more of a general understanding of why some of these issues matter um so as to why u.s policy is so relevant on the taos like one thing i hear a lot especially since joining twitter last week is that dows are global their activity exists solely in an intangible form uh and my favorite you can't tax the internet man uh which is true uh and those arguments do have merit you know some more than others uh but you know one of the historical one of the historically essential elements of taxation is nexus which is tax productivity linked to a physical location it's certainly difficult to attribute nexus to smart contracts and protocols even online memberships and organizations but when you introduce value especially in the form of revenue that changes a little bit uh if tim berners-lee and his colleagues at the cern institute had built a fee switch into html i assure you the history of the internet would be very different uh and not at the very least from a tax perspective um you know international tax is hugely complicated and the intersections of governments is a complex web of treaties practice application of their own laws which vary greatly by jurisdiction and how they intersect again so taxation of online activities often criticized as arbitrary and the answer to that is uh that yeah you're right application of tax is pretty arbitrary the decision to tax or not to tax how to tax when to tax all stem from the government uh and so it's determination of you know what the government believes is is going to be their tax policy and to that point governments are hugely impactful uh on the internet in general it is easy to think of the internet uh as an ephemeral wonderland housing a digital world uh but you know that is possible through fiber optic cables that run underground across oceans around mountains you know the wi-fi we're using right now is ham radio connected to physical assets that exist in the real world uh and the reality of that is the existence of interactivity must be assessed for possible tax implications when incomes involved uh especially when that income ultimately comes under the control of a tax with a person or entity now this part of the us focus right here is that the us is a tax policy worldwide taxation wherever citizens are involved you know we had a recent trend to territorial for purposes of you know corporate uh you know but more or less when a u.s citizen creates a u.s company and that company develops a computer code smart contract or what have you uh the arbitrary nature of the us tax code makes income derived from that potentially taxable in the u.s uh and if you're thinking man i'm sure glad i'm not a u.s developer and not located in the u.s and did not form a u.s corp then yeah it's a different situation it gives you different options you know our plan is set around a domestic energy structure for the us but it certainly wouldn't be my first choice if i didn't have a lot of the factors in our decision for why the us was right for for who we typed to speak to as an audience so from here on when i do talk uh about tax i mean u.s i'll clarify foreign treatment after that um additionally the liability protections that come from an entity you know while i was talking about liability protection when you form a usa then all the maybes go away and you definitely have us tax responsibility so to kind of think hit on the next slide as it must the governance tokens treasury activities maybe oh you know it was the last one still i saw them on the list all right so the ones that are on the list here governance tokens you know i'm not going to explain the mechanical governance tokens to y'all you know what it is um but you know the mineral guidance provided in the us does make governance tokens taxable as income when received and subject to capital gains when sold now that income sits in the hands of you know the holders the government's tokens and they have that responsibility but a whole other section of it sits within the treasury and so there's a whole treasury activity question that really comes down to who controls those tokens in the treasury how should they be taxed who should be responsible for filing that tax paying that tax and where should be paid um so you know i'm not going to explain treasuries either again you know it um except save like miles did some are worth a lot of money uh and an application of us guidance on tax taxation of virtual currency could result in any number of situations where taxable events occur including hard forks treasury swaps staking founding of granting lobbying programs uh who's responsible that tax is not necessarily clear the principles that define realization of income through dominion and control don't necessarily result in an obvious answer but the choices are developers the members the entity or the entity attributed back to the members and there's no one else uh and if there's no one that opens door to its own set of problems regarding how a system was designed where that's possible and so you know long story short interaction with certain protocols uh you know can generate income which needs to be recognized from a variety of sources um and i'm going to skip the deep dive into tax reporting this could go on forever uh and my soapbox to go with it being an invasive privacy you know uh and just say the rules on how income the transfer of money must be reported to the irs uh and this is true regardless of whether or not there's an entity uh uh it exists across the board uh based on activities conducted in the us or uh you know other other factors and so in other words u.s operations require everyone to have some form of reporting requirements and so big picture there are any number of ways that down as treasury can realize taxable income in the u.s uh and it's not creating a u.s entity that creates the obligation for that tax but rather the creation of the entity that is the solution which creates a mechanism to pay the existing tax uh and this was the problem miles and i really set out to solve and hopefully the rest of this presentation kind of takes you through so back to you miles yep thanks so just taking uh looking at kind of what goes on in in the world currently with with the vast majority of you know d5 protocols and houses is you know really you have one of kind of two like general structures right there's the entity list structure and then there's you know use of a foreign foundation so um you know the reason that those are the kind of the two routes is that there's no there's no simple answer on on the entity structure um or at least you know there hasn't been right and so you can't use a c corp right otherwise your your dow members are stockholders obviously there are securities laws issues that come up as a result of that llcs don't really work membership interests are also um you know are also securities and so you know you would only be able to use accredited investors in that situation the wyoming dow bill is is great but really it is meant for a scenario where your dow members are all going to be accredited investors none of them are going to be anonymous um and and really you know that that kind of takes it out of a lot of dows right anonymity is basically a killer um for use of that type of legal structure partnerships again are are not great um you know for for various reasons including uh the limitation of liability point that we discussed earlier and then obviously we've heard you know co-ops might be a viable solution um for for many dows um so looking at the entity list and foreign foundation structure right really what what those look like is and i'm just referring to the case of where you have a you know let's say us del or c c-corp who has started a company and now in the process of decentralizing they're going to issue tokens uh and you know basically turn over control of the smart contracts to um you know the governance protocol or you know even just like a social down that starts out by issuing tokens to uh individuals that want to be part of it and then they hold events right so all of those really are are just relying on the fact that you know they don't really know what entity structure to use and so they've deposited governance tokens into a smart contract um which is the treasury and then those tokens are are you know controlled by the governance mechanism that's put in place uh you know i think the the risk there is obviously what we were just talking about with respect to the general partnership structure um and you know limitations on liability uh potential tax issues all sorts of stuff um the foreign foundation uh solve some of those problems right and the foreign foundation is really you know what companies will do is they'll create a foundation in a foreign jurisdiction usually a tax favorable one uh and they'll have the treasury you know basically allocated to that foundation um and you know usually the dow can give instructions to the foundation um you know some of the issues there right is that you don't have you're not you haven't wrapped the dow in in a liability shield right the the the dow basically controls um the foundation but to the extent that they engage in anything else right they could be found to be liable uh you know the tax problem is probably the one that is is best solved here um because it does create an entity that that can pay taxes um however you know there is significant risk in terms of offshoring uh you know u.s assets um to foreign jurisdictions um and you know basically the process that you have to go through um for that you know the u.s typically doesn't like people to to move out assets outside its jurisdiction so um you know they do have some some checks there um so as a result of all of that that really leads you know to the unincorporated non-profit association yeah and so we did a pretty thorough scrub of what options were available miles kind of talked you through some of the ones i mean there's other ones on the list that work depending on situation uh one thing to keep in mind that you know miles already hit on is that so many different types of dows you're going to get different facts and circumstances but one that really opened up the door uh was the unincorporated nonprofit association and so you know a real high level we've got the the una uh is kind of a registered uh unincorporated association uh that that carries various statutory protections through different states there's a uh a uniform act the uh uh where where uh uh you know the the uh the under rules have been kind of defined and and the statutory the states have their own right to kind of make adjustments to them uh but but overall it looks like a relatively uh strong or better than strong fit in most regards based off of just kind of the type of nature of what dows operate as an association they're a little less formal than incorporated structures um the membership makes a lot more sense and i'll get into that detail uh in a little bit but you know one thing to keep in mind is that legal entity and tax entity are interwoven uh but separate concepts you know would reach miles we'll talk about the entity forms to give rise to limited liability the ability to contract people to have a bank accountability to pay taxes uh but when the us legal entity is uh forms you know it creates a tax entity that's kind of separate but different with how it interacts together uh some entities are defined as corporate uh the entity stacked directly or passed through like with partnerships where profits are passed the members and you know taxed directly to them uh in the past 75 years significant blurring uh between incorporated entities and unincorporated entities has occurred you know as the protections of incorporation stemming from legal existence as a distinct entity have been given to unincorporated forms uh the history of the corporation uh you know it's been a change uh and the history of the corporation is really interesting and you can trace it from rome to england to the u.s but the reality is the modern form is just an entirely different meaning than the historical because state jurisdictions have passed laws giving similar and at times identical treatment to entity forms that historically would have been completely separate and how they were treated so you know llc llp llp unincorporated non-profit associations s corpse uh and so in the 1990s the irs said you know what we're done dealing with this uh they gave up on forcing the historical treatment for tax purposes and they introduced the ability for many entities to select between corporate and pass through taxation for you know based off of their preference you know you file a form 8832 and you know it's a it's a de facto election uh pro forma and it can and and that's the solution that the irs had rather than trying to chase uh the historical definition through you know what we suggest in the paper is that the the uno select the sequoia so in the case of an unit doing so it provides a lot of benefits even though it reduces the concept of double taxation uh unas taxable corp will be able to pay taxes on behalf of its members that would solve many of the practical limitations related to partnership taxation you know withholding requirements uh k-1 reporting identifying partnership share for the treasury which they do not have access to or really actually has dominion control over the difficulties in dallas meetings flow through taxation reporting but really i think the difficulty stems you know with dow's report you hear a lot that dallas can't meet partnership filing requirements uh it has more to do with the failure and then being a partnership uh and acting as a partnership than any failure on their part to actually meet an existing obligation uh the unit provides a kind of a more philosophically appropriate place for them and wouldn't carry the same reporting requirements they can't meet based off of that organization um corporate taxations also characterize uh a lot of times unfair to foreign members who might end up paying more tax under the structure it's a little more complicated than that the uh the activity being taxed at the corporate level wouldn't have a clean path back to the foreign holders under a flow-through structure uh at least it relates to the treasury which is by far the most significant tax liabilities for dows at this time hypothetically member distributions of profit could result in unequal treatment for foreign members but as miles was saying to the securities piece uh direct member profit distribution something to be avoided uh so you know taxation c corp doesn't choose double taxation which means that they will pay tax and district distribution to the members will also be taxed but it does clean up a lot of the tax filing requirements the tax reporting requirements uh and and it kind of has an ease of administration use too because you've got one one entity paying tax instead of passing all the information necessary for everyone who has you know anything to do with it i have an information passed to them decided what was theirs based off of you know apportionment calculation that they didn't have a say in which is exactly um you know ideal uh decentralization principle so right so just quickly through the the advantages of what the unit affords right so it's it's very simple formation requirements right you could look back and and for you know companies that have already kind of launched their downright you you could look back and say that that you know when that governance um structure was first uh launched that that that was really the formation of the unit as dave was saying there are lots of states that would require you to register uh uruna in order to to get liability protection um so you know there's no kind of in those states there's no going back and kind of fixing that but again you you would be able to kind of get it going forward if you were able to register and we're really qualified um then you know there's also flexible government right there's no need for a board there's no need for like a centralized hierarchy of of kind of control which is obviously beneficial because it it you know combats against the the centralization analysis that would technically uh lead to interest in the dow being deemed to be securities under the howie test um they're scalable there's no membership limits you can you know any number of people can be members um they're also transferable and and you know although the the uu naa uh indicates that that they you know doesn't they or they shouldn't be transferable it does give power to the units to determine whether or not they should be transferable so if you were to adopt you know a articles of association that essentially allowed for transferability um then that should be the controlling factor uh and then you know it provides limited viability right so dave dave talked about the tax piece the limited liability is the other kind of big piece in our mind um where you know it will give dows and down members a lot more freedom to operate and actually engage in you know potentially real world activities uh that you know would otherwise you know lead to potential liability and so i think you know from that perspective uh we do think that that these kind of features right really probably are most in line with what i think people's expectations of art are of dao's right that you know there's no centralized hierarchy that that you do get limitation liability that there is you know reasonable tax taxes being paid all of that stuff kind of fits in within like how dows currently work um and so as a result of it it should be you know a fairly painless uh kind of uh you know in any structure to layer into these dows that that you know won't really uh change their operation dave yeah um and so this is really kind of one of the tricky parts in trying to explain this to people um is that immediately kicks back to like how on earth can a governance token a dow where everyone's trying to make money be non-profit status and you know it's really a matter of terminology more than anything uh you know we have the slides here but i'll just kind of talk you through it uh people usually associate non-profit with charity uh that's not necessarily the case you know non-pro many dows are not established for a profit purpose and although the mechanization of government governance varies by protocol in general the primary functionality of a governance protocol is not to make profit but to create and vote on government proposals that control the smart contracts of an underlying protocol and direct actions the dow treasury to foster the development growth of decentralized ecosystems uh so government stoves are digital assets that represent voting power within a dab and integral to decentralization because they distribute powers and rights uh to users and so the governance does themselves obviously uh have huge uh valuations on the market right now and but that's not actually determinative of a for-profit status right uh the example that we've utilized a lot to just kind of convey this is homeless associations you know you live in a homer association you have all these rules your covenants and you're protecting your property uh and just because the health value goes up in the community that you live in and obviously profit from that going up doesn't mean that your homeowner's association's a for-profit entity uh the values of donors tokens are not an indication the dow itself is for profits uh the outside market may or not be because of their actions uh and it really wouldn't matter if it weren't because the underlying activity within it is what we're now which we're analyzing to see if it's appropriate or not um and a big part of that is because the people who hold the governance tokens whether it's the treasury paying a ton of tax on it or the members are paying a ton of tax on it that's already been removed is tax what's left what's left is what's not the governance tokens that's really what we're talking about uh that sits within the doubt the protocol itself the smart contracts and so it's kind of a bit of distinction it's important so really the question is whether this definition of nonprofit that we're utilizing is able to qualify as a non-profit under the law and that depends on state you know there are ten jurisdictions that have adopted the uniform unincorporated nonprofit association act where the activities of most dows would meet these requirements without any uh you know charitable purpose whatsoever and in the states that do have a general purpose there's pretty good statutory authority for them supporting other states having the ability to decide for themselves uh what should be and should not be uh you know non-profit for the purpose of uh you know uh of innuna yeah so and i like california is just a good example there right where you know california actually does allow their unis to engage in for-profit activity um so long as you know anything that is lawfully allowed to engage in so you know as a result there are states that certainly provide a more flexible framework um for you know unos to operate and as a result of that you know there are there's kind of significant opportunity um to you know apply these structures to dows and to wrap them um i think that takes us to our last lab we're a bit over time here so we'll just be quick but you know dave and i are going to work on on um preparing a you know kind of practical applications and stuff like that to give more information to the community i mean we're working with a couple companies on that on that front um and you know i mean again no one-size-fits-all approach you know this this structure can also be uh kind of combined with other structures such as trusts the foreign foundation um there's just a whole bunch of different ways where you can actually incorporate this uh and there's you know a bunch of activities that that you could engage in to you know kind of deal with um uh you know trying to to basically be a responsible actor in the corporate world um right so in terms of capitalizing the business uh doing things like that that we'll uh you know be following up on this paper with with more information on anything else dude no i'm good thanks for having us guys i guess we're about to do a panel so we're not going we're not going anywhere we're adding keepers yeah thanks guys much appreciated and you're totally right we are about to add more speakers so yev and bill and jacqueline if you want to just turn your videos on you'll now become part of the broader panel um so we're gonna start on a panel uh really so we can jam and dive a little bit deeper on what miles what really everyone who's spoken so far has gone into as it relates to unique structuring in the space bill of course is taking this from a little bit of a different angle with opolis but at the same time i'm sure you have a lot of information about what you're seeing from the dows that you guys are working with and i'd be really interested particularly as it relates to the liability pieces and how workers but then also the dows themselves are seeing that and jackie whenever you want you can also just turn on turn on your video and you can join us too so um i know that there might end up being a little bit of overlap between what you guys discuss in your presentation and some of these questions but i'll get started and we'll see uh where the conversation takes us i'll i'll just suggest some people respond to particular questions but anyone should definitely feel free to jump in particularly if they feel strongly about anything that's coming up here so first question i'm gonna put this one to david first but then anyone else feel free to jump in um when you work with dow founders and operators what do you think are their biggest legal risks and how does that differ from what they think are their their biggest legal risks um and this is something i throw this in there it's almost out of personal interest in a way because we see so many misconceptions on twitter about like what are risks from a legal front what people can do um there's just a ton of uh of unknowns um among crypto folk who really don't have access to lawyers or a lot of very good information at the moment so really interested to see what you guys are seeing from them but then also what you perceive to be the biggest problem so we'll start with david and we'll move on from there yeah and just to kind of leave room for everyone else just um i'm gonna i'll just keep mine confined to the tax space um you know not filing a return is uh and whether or not a return should be filed uh is obviously huge for for clients who think uh there's a possibility that they may be on the wrong side of some decision making or the kind of future events or you know there's a lot of concern over that and you know what that'd be mine too if that's the situation but there's two other ones that are a little kind of less tax reporting did not get a whole lot of attention until the infrastructure build my perception of it has been kind of heating up before that but you know there's a lot of tricky rules uh and they're tricky if you're trying to follow them and there's still a lot of penalty if you're just willfully not following them the penalties are punitive because the the government does not want people not not filing and that's those forms exist whether you know you're foreign uh situated or or domestic situated uh and so i think especially with the infrastructure bill as proposed could be could be really serious uh and then kind of a surprising one is the risk of perception you know on the political stage these issues are often trivialized tax evasion money laundering uh but the reality is the technology is new and it provides a lot of benefit over existing process and so the difficulties reporting are a result of of that not an intent to aid in harmful behavior you know and so education on why difficulties exist is key because the change of the law um or the benefits of changing law is going to be the difference maker so if the if the government reacts and there's a harsh reaction to this idea of like money laundering you know tax evasion which you know is well deserved in a lot of industries you look at panama papers and you know uh and you start kind of getting into tax division it's not that people in the u.s don't commit tax evasion it's just that necessary this isn't necessarily the best vehicle for getting that distinction communicated explaining why that's true is going to be hugely influential in keeping this next round for me we're all worried about the new laws that are terrible uh we want the new laws to be better additive uh and helpful so that'd be my team yeah but what are your thoughts on it yeah i mean a lot of my kind of flags back up against taxes as well but i'm by no means a tax professional but just kind of surrounding you know paying workers with tokens and imputing value to those tokens how you're declaring those um bringing on employees into dows you know whether they need to [Music] whether you're treating them as independent contractors or you're classifying them as employees and all of the issues that's around that licensing is a big one as well and you know who holds uh the iep who holds the rights um and yeah i mean liability obviously which is something that we've been talking about across all three presentations it's just not having um any kind of legal rapper and sort of the consequences that entail as to all of the members participating um and it can be pretty scary i think it's it's probably we're saying these things and kind of default treatment as general partners but i mean if somebody sues um one person and then they can go and claim against the others for some large amounts of money i mean you can be you know you can be wiped out financially um pretty significantly so that's that's a huge concern so just trying to shield yourself from liability shield the organization from reliability i think that would probably be number one yeah i mean i think quick fall cigarette mouse i was just gonna say so i think one of the the situation that we find ourselves in right is like people look at you know bitcoin and ethereum and you know they obviously don't have a legal entity that kind of wraps the decision-making framework or you know you have like and bitcoin is mined and no one is paying tax on like the issuance of that bitcoin um through those mining operations obviously the the miners themselves pay tax on the bitcoin they receive but like the the kind of the way that those structures work same thing with ethereum right is is you basically had these you know unwrapped kind of decision making frameworks the problem with where we've shifted from that area to you know governance token based dows right is that all of the sudden you now really do have people that are responsible for deciding the direction of where these allocation of assets go right and as a result of that and they're undertaking activities on behalf of you know other members so as a result of all of that all of these legal issues have popped up where it's like these are not directly comparable to you know ethereum and bitcoin and that right these are these are more complex systems and you know there there's more of a bridging of virtual reality in in actual reality and as a result of that like legal frameworks need to be put in place to protect people in the real world and you think like part of that implication is that now that dows have really exploded over the last i don't know eight months maybe um people in the crypto space are just not ready or they're not prepared in any way or have very little touch points for these unique problems like for instance the general partnership thing that you have mentioned that probably wasn't on the radar of many people in crypto who don't have uh you know some level of legal background at this point so it seems like it's almost a new issue for for the community i mean i to jump in here i i think the issues that the crypto community are facing are in many ways the same ones that a lot of startup founders face um you know why when i was a lawyer back in the day crypto wasn't as big i mostly advised startup founders on technology agreements and general corporate stuff and often they had no context for what was a general partnership or you know the question of whether and when to incorporate came up all the time so i i don't think these are new issues i think the challenges are in trying to maintain the web 3 ethos how you address those issues because a traditional c corp with kind of like your three founders owning everything and then taking outside investment really isn't what a lot of people in web 3 are after and so it's trying to kind of fit a new paradigm in terms of how you organize a project and how you how you build together into this legal system that was formed with the idea that kind of the contributors to projects and and companies would be well defined that they might be in you know a single jurisdiction even rather than spread out across the world with some of them being anonymous you know and that's where i think we're bumping up against kind of some of the trouble and and encountering these more unique questions in the legal space i i think some of the growing pains are are really the growing pains you see in in any kind of startup environment it's just the answers are so much more complex with dows and doubt workers and it's also so i mean the dows themselves are evolving so rapidly that like that you know some of these issues for instance if you were just creating a down for a d5 protocol that had the treasury automatically set up for you know yield farming and there was no actual voting right then i don't know that you would need uh to go down the route of of dealing with all of these problems right but it's it's as you add on complexity and what the dow is doing uh the legal issues get more complex and and that's why kind of we find ourselves where we do now yeah yeah i mean that's where kind of my spicier take is there are situations where it's appropriate to kind of choose the yolo entity form yeah um but there are a lot of situations where probably an unincorporated nonprofit or a cooperative or even an llc makes sense it's it's all about context and what you're trying to accomplish right i think you know what as a former lawyer or a recovering one you know i'm sensitive to over lawyering and i think too many people who are trying to like create these little project-based dows or you know like social clubs are thinking about entity structures and all of that and it's like well when you and your friends get together and pool like 100 bucks to you know buy tickets to some sports event do you form a legal entity for that do you kind of create a bunch of legal contracts to make sure that everything's enforceable or do you just kind of like do it and use social context to enforce kind of the promises that people are making and i think that's probably appropriate for a lot of dows versus if you are kind of creating a d5 protocol where you're about to accumulate a ton of wealth in a shared treasury it's worth kind of like talking to lawyers and thinking pretty deeply about how to structure yourself yeah but i guess and to your point on um kind of like the the lego structure now that's part of i think advising or that touch point with the attorney should also be always like let's not drive with the type of legal entity right sometimes we're gonna have folks coming to us and say hey i want a cooperative where i want uh to form an llc without having defined what they're doing how their members interact among themselves what's their kind of almost like their business plan or how they relate to each other and then they want to fit uh how they have been doing some of that interactions into a square that is what the law says um up front without having decided on a bunch of other things that are either logistics or just relates to the success of their venture or the feasibility of that which is really more important like we can find out legal ways and if not we can work around but after kind of having defined on that and that's super important i think to to remember like there isn't one perfect legal entity right now i don't think um there are some that are better than others for a specific aspect so kind of like not driving with that is also i think very valuable i think also it's not loose it's worth not losing perspective that we have some of the most powerful centralized entities in the existence of the world uh creating the structure that we have to operate within and so it's not particularly surprising that a decentralized structure is going to have problems onboarding into what is the extremely centralized system and so i think the reality of the situation is you know i think we're gonna have to take some of these pain points on if we want them to change we're gonna have to kind of dig in on some of these issues otherwise we're just gonna accept a reintroduction of a centralized uh principle somewhere down the line yeah yeah yeah i do think i mean to your point david there there is room for a certain level of almost like civil disobedience in choosing no legal structure for certain dows that are truly decentralized again this is where i'm not a lawyer so i don't have to give clients legal advice but you know if we really want to push regulators forward and and kind of push them to recognize that at a certain point transparency is accomplished through this technology and at a certain point decentralization means you're not so much relying on the efforts of some small cohort of people with specialized information or specialized skills but part of a community you know maybe we don't try and force the square peg into the round hole maybe we kind of say throw our hands up to the regulators and say like look we're not going to participate in the system right now until you give us a form that fits our ethos um i think there's a lot of risk to that but i certainly certainly doesn't work on the tax side right i don't think has it not worked yet though but also not legalization yeah yeah and that's also where with opolis we kind of encourage the contributors to llc and escort themselves and pay taxes on their income because right as an individual you do not want to ignore well so do you have them do that do you have them do that for every now they're in then so do they follow a different llc for each no they can funnel all the different dow incomes and through the same llc so it's kind of like a traditional freelancer model where right you bundle all of your income you run it through your company that's like bill inc and then you take out the appropriate amount of taxes on that income and pay it to the government yeah and then they become an employee member of the commons by virtue of that policy so they've got a mass worker power across everywhere else except that they're co-employed by the commons yeah yeah yeah i think a lot of them a lot of people i mean i feel like this is something that we always get into when we talk about legal structuring for daos and crypto or maybe just layering generally for dowsing crypto is to what extent we need to focus on existing structures and to what extent we need to to work to advocate but it's very frustrating of course for founders who just come to talk to you and you tell them oh this needs to change but we have no timeline for it changing and in in the in between period you need to work in this very gray area and here are some structures you know for instance the ones you guys are recommending that could work but they also need you know we're at early stages in many ways of exploring them so maybe before we jump into the advocacy stuff like if we could dive into maybe if miles davis you want to go first and then yeah and jackie the biggest sort of challenges and whether you know whether a founder today could connect with a lawyer and start working on the structures that you're proposing yeah i mean i think that the the you know the biggest hurdle that that we see obviously we listed in the disadvantages right was was around kind of the non-profit like angle and and basically um you know you want to ensure that that you know your structure is going to basically be able to meet um what that means in the state that you're registering but i think you know one of the the key pieces i think that that still needs to be done on ours is to really look at uh you know a 50-state survey of of which states have you know the best uh una statutes and then taking that and actually working with lawyers in that jurisdiction um to ensure that that you know the way that you mean non-profit um is is in line with with what they mean is nonprofit um and then you know the the other kind of piece there right is is you know there's there's a whole bunch of of um federal laws that that could potentially create issues one of the one of the problems um you know with dao's having treasuries right is under the investment company act if over 40 of your assets are you know potentially securities um then you could be deemed to be an investment company which requires registration under the 40 act which is obviously a big pain in the ass and not something that any doubt would really be able to do um other than like small investment downs and so you know as a result of that right the gray area around you know whether or not a token is a security also screws you with respect to investment company act stuff and and so like and then there's you know money transmitter there's just a whole host of kind of federal issues that you know are already applicable to dows um but you know once you you put a regulatory start or a an entity in place um you know you also have to jump those hurdles so there are um you know there are things to kind of work out and and you know we at andreessen just proposed uh you know to to send her to me some legislation that you know would have created a federal entity that was you know could be labeled a dow um to provide for you know tax payment um and then also carbs out from the you know the bsa and the ica uh dows that are um you know that are operating on blockchains and so you know i i think that that there's still a ways to go in terms of nailing it down so that you are eliminating all risk but i think that any way you slice it putting a legal entity in place um you know if you have the resources to do so is a step in the right direction just because of the liability and the tax potential uh on to a much briefer one the miles i think you know the only thing to tack on is you know form over substance right uh the laws exist i think there's a chance for us to uh or substance of reform in the positive uh statement of it i think there's enough room in the law for us to find substance for our art for you know what we described in the article uh what we would like to see is a little bit clarification of what kind of non-profit would and would not be activity would would not be counted uh for purposes of the in in our case the uno but really all these laws because if there's clarification that left ambiguity is just fast uh so if the state governments could you know update their definitions that were constructed well before they conceived of any of these ideas and say okay well this one fits in this pocket this one fits in that bucket then a lot of this ambiguity where we just kind of hash over we don't really know if it's going to be in this one or that one could be solved it's just clarification of the rules not necessarily even a change just clarification of terminology so we know know what the answer is i would say that the um kind of been following our thesis and and the conclusion that we're trying to report and and going with the um the the limited cooperative act for for housing the dow i mean the ulca has been around um since 2007 i think jackie would kind of check me on that but um and and it's you know it does um come up against some of the same issues in terms of reciprocity and recognition across state lines and state boundaries but i do um jackie do you know the number of states that have adopted the ulca there's seven jurisdictions or eight jurisdictions with seven states so all districts of colombia included um the eighth since 2008 adoption so if you're right on seven and then the last one being adopted i think 2019. in washington yeah so i mean there's there's a little bit more history there um and just kind of um i think what we're seeing most is people coming to us and thinking that they have a automatic securities exemption and um and while that is true on some level you know that that's certainly not what kind of our philosophy is in using and using the co-op structure to house dao so um there are state securities laws that exempt um membership interests and patronage um as securities and then also on the federal side um the foreman test which basically states is similar in many ways to the howie test but um essentially states that there's there has to be a limitation on transferability um it's based on kind of membership patronage and activity um you have to have that kind of principle of democratic participation and voting that's um that's tied to that exemption and um i think yeah jackie did i have missed any yeah what one one one member one woe and then there's six things on transfer so yeah i mean there are definitely um that there is definitely this unique um kind of halo effect around the co-op from that perspective especially given all of the instability um on the security side with crypto and and we've been bombarded with that question but really you know we're still sort of very much um wedded to the cooperative principles and having um kind of that philosophical aim achieved with setting up a doubt in a co-op structure so you have to have some kind of detail and you've got to have participation you've got to have that network effect built into your your bylaws and your um your your structure in order for that to be a good fit so jackie i don't know if you wanted to add something i actually it makes me think more you know on the other like the other side of the coin is that the dowels we have these issues sometimes with folks that want to start a cooperative that their two founders and they want to start a cooperative and they have that founder mentality uh that is that's mine i own it um and then so typically there's a mindset shift that happens when you have three of those because it's more collaborative there's some research around that so when you're thinking about dowse it is typically already a bigger group of people they have been collaborating so the mindset shift has taken place already uh makes them more right too so they're all those issues that we have and challenges that we have to address but also as far as they are in a mental space and a practice space that is already kind of right for that collaboration then and just kind of calls for more collaborative types and i think that's one of the reasons why we're both talking cooperatives and nonprofit uh that are typically membership-based entities as well that kind of make sense because those are type of legal entities that have required to some extent taking a step back from that founder mentality to like kind of collaborative approach as well so that's for me the other side of the the coin with a challenge that gets eliminated and maybe starting starting with bill in this next one and dealing with that a little bit so thinking about the non-profit structure the cooperative structure it does seem relatively consistent in some ways with what we've seen from from uh or what we're currently seeing from downs and we'd love to know whether you're finding that your clients are are more receptive to these two different sorts of structures or there's folks you're talking to generally because of the history or if they don't care and like a second part of that question is are there communities receptive to it because i know that there will be to some extent you know particularly if larger dows are going to choose one of these structures to the extent that you can at a later stage there will need to be some community agreement that that's some consensus there and i imagine it'll have to be a vote as well so um can you maybe we can start with bill on this one um and you you know you don't work directly on this piece necessarily but certainly i'm sure that that working with dao's and bringing the co-op structure to bear you've had experience but then i would love to hear from everyone else yeah so before i joined opolis i i was building dow platforms targeted towards non-profits and social goods because early in my career i'd worked on kind of the the dirtiest form of nonprofit which is the 527 or 501 c 4 non-profit which are social advocacy groups or political organizations and in a lot of ways those seemed right for dalification it turns out though when you go to existing non-profits and say hey do you want to decentralize and and start giving more decision-making authority to your membership they're like no but i i do think within the web 3 community we've seen this kind of ethos of collaboration and cooperation and decentralization so have done a lot of work with kind of crypto for good communities that are very interested in exploring non-profit forms um you know not necessarily 501c3 which confers obviously the advantage of being tax exempt plus having contributions be tax deductible but you know 501 c 4s and 527 organizations that are looking to influence politics but operate as a dow in order to be flatter and more decentralized you know i think crypto people are interested and willing to accept that there's just still this level of you know intimidation and kind of i guess some um recoil against kind of participating in the system that seems so broken especially once you talk talk about like well this entity form was really utilized first effectively by dark money groups but it actually could be utilized for a dow for good in a much more transparent way um so i i do hope that we'll see more and more of that on the acropolis side because we're focused more on value accrual and then redistribution of that value to our membership the cooperative made more sense than a non-profit kind of structure because like i forget whether it was jackie or yes use the rei example right people who are a member of our cooperative pay a fee in order to support the services that we provide which is payroll processing and finding benefits and administering all of that and the hope is that as we grow and scale and those fees kind of outstrip the operational expenses that we can start returning those to members in order to offset the fees that members are are paying to us and you know maybe even someday that patronage will exceed the fees that members are paying in though i think that's a long way off and that creates kind of an opportunity for all of these stakeholders to really benefit from membership and the cooperative and for us to distribute value across these different classes of contributors that do range from people that just process payroll to people who are referr members into the cooperative and help us grow to technology providers and you know what interests me there and what i think a lot of dows should think about when considering the cooperative model is it is good for kind of stakeholder economies and kind of this post-capitalist sort of um value accrual and distribution across stakeholders rather than focusing on shareholder primacy so you know you i i'm trying to be very careful in the way i talk about it because as you have knows um you know the securities laws are a concern with the cooperative structure right our members aren't just limited to colorado so while the colorado securities exemptions are amazing and colorado is hopefully blazing a path for other regulators to copy right we're subject to um federal oversight because our tokens and our membership crosses uh state lines but you know i i do think while we're stretching some areas of traditional co-op law with tokenizing patronage you know we're also sticking pretty close to it in that everybody who receives patronage tokens is providing value and as we grow and can put more and more stuff on chain i think we're also trying to you know accomplish the core goal of securities laws regimes in the in this country which is really disclosure and information sharing right the sec isn't really or isn't really supposed to do kind of like merit-based securities calls right unlike some states where they can kind of say like we don't like you you can't issue a security the fcc is very focused on disclosure you don't have to be a good company but you do have to be a good discloser and i think that's kind of the hope for blockchain and dowels in my mind is to say like on a philosophical level by putting this stuff on chain we are creating a level playing field in terms of what people can see is going on and there isn't this information asymmetry that created the need for a disclosure regime because everybody can see what's going on everybody can participate so you know while we're playing a little bit safer with the cooperative structure i do hope that the cooperative structure can serve more as a guide for regulators as they're considering kind of a new way to regulate tokens and daos i'll just add that we do also have the colorado digital token act which bill mentioned kind of from the state securities perspective um is i don't know how powerful it is but it but it is there and it does provide some guidance on differentiating between utility and security tokens so i also think we're going to get you know i think we're probably going to have more luck at the state level trying to get uh adjustments to laws to enable daos to operate and securities laws changes right then at the federal level where it's it's you know looks like it's going to be very difficult to to change anything with respect to that analysis maybe let's let's let's kind of jump on that thread a little bit um as it relates to the advocacy piece and what it is that state and federal regulators and policy makers need to do or what we should help try to encourage them to do to to you know provide clarity for founders allow for this industry to thrive united states maybe to capture some of the tax dollars that are so available to them um if they so choose to allow it um and so one thing that we did it at the dow research collective we hosted an event in june and we used that event to get a sense of the biggest problems faced by dao's and um and then also schedule number different interviews with a lot of stakeholders in space to figure out what their biggest issues were and their biggest issues always ended up being things that you know we just couldn't help them with or probably no one could really help them with that it required change their change in policy or change of regulation before they get the clarity that they'd want to see so we appreciated that this is actually one of the biggest issues that dao's as a group should be focusing on is advocacy because it's what they need um in many ways depending on the type of dow of course but to get that clarity that everyone seems to want as it relates to like hiring workers limiting liability uh a securities piece and any number of different thing that we discuss today so maybe starting with you miles because i know that accident has done a lot of work on this front like what do you um you know what do you see as the most important piece to advocate for what do you see as a strategy or direction for forward for crypto as it relates to the advocacy piece and who needs to be involved in yeah i mean you know i think that that it was it was nice to see during the infrastructure build process how kind of it seems like the end you know the industry really woke up and and really started kind of taking the the lobbying part of this seriously and i think that that's really important because i think as web 3 you know as that becomes you know into view and more clearly for people um you know there are going to be more uh intermediaries out there businesses that are going to be pushing back on kind of what decentralization and all of that allows and so i think that there is really going to be you know a strong kind of fight on that basis i think at the moment my i guess you know two issues that i'm most focused on right are really around uh you know just dowse and how they can operate and be legal and exist uh and then you know what tax implication and reporting obligations are you know i think that there's there's very much a desire um you know at the federal government level and we saw this in the infrastructure bill to apply laws uh to you know blockchain protocols and networks um as though you know that like basically recreating intermediaries within those systems when there aren't um which obviously destroys the value of the technology and so i think that that you know kind of trying to and then on the dow side right i think that there's a lot of uncertainty people you know you talk to people in government about dowse and they don't understand and they're like scared of it and so i think that that one of the things that would be helpful right is is basically you know using the existing frameworks like co-ops and unincorporated non-profit associations to basically show that dows can be responsible actors and exist with as you know as other entities of that type do these are just blockchain versions of them the blockchain you know technology allows them to do certain things and get consensus that you know would be more difficult without um and and i think basically operating within that space you know paying taxes like and educating uh and just kind of walking through people through kind of the issues and how this stuff works is really going to be you know key i think that the securities analysis you know is is the one people probably talk about the most um but i think that it's it's you know i don't think that the howie test is actually that all that bad right i think that it's enabled a lot of companies to go out and issue tokens now you know the sec is currently trying to walk back a lot of the decentralization like framework that was put in place over the last three years i think that's pretty devastating but but it's so long as that the tide there can be stemmed i think that the howie analysis was actually a fairly reasonable framework um for people to to kind of understand how tokens can be issued you know and and and you know it leads to these decentralized systems that are potentially going to be you know revolutionary yeah uh i think i think also um you know as far as it's changes in the law we need to start having a little bit more honest discussions you know you can go onto crypto twitter you can go to discord you can find people talking to each other about it but they need to start educating the rest of the community if the idea is going to be community engagement people need to understand how this works and that's true across all the professions like one of the things that drove me crazy about hearing the infrastructure bill uh working its way through was the 6050i uh the reporting requirement around the the form 8300 just kept getting presented as a tax bill right if you watch any news media you can read any story it was a taxable the irs collects it so it must be taxed you know that's the patriot act man that's that's that's information reporting it's terrorism you know and the idea the irs is the one collecting it well of course they are they're the ones who collect forms the first thing they do is send it off to a bunch of different governments and so if we want to sneak into an infrastructure bill we probably should have a conversation about what the right level of privacy is and what the right level you know and having these conversations and you can't even have that conversation people understand that we're not talking about tax evasion but we're actually talking about money laundering in the context of terrorism uh it's a whole other conversation and you can't even have that educated debate because we're all the way back at you know people aren't paying their taxes and it's like well that's partially true people aren't it's not because of blockchain it's not just crypto but at the same time we're not even talking about tax donation and so getting on message and getting communication out in the communities we got to stop talking just to each other uh in in the tax community in the crypto community in the legal community and i think we got to start kind of living what we preach on community engagement and collaborative decision making yeah i would just add quickly you know i think we also need to start participating more on the electoral side because the truth of the matter is regulators are a little bit more like the cops and their job and incentives is to go after people and and win cases versus politicians truly do work for the people and their jobs at risk every two or four years and so if crypto folks can really educate their neighbors and others and and coalesce around these issues and and refocus them on the right things you know we could have huge impacts and start electing better and more pro-crypto people to congress and those are the ones that can write the laws that the regulators then have to enforce so i i do hope we see more of that both at the state level and especially at the federal level all right and i guess i want to add a country your question on who should participate you know we our gripes are also uh tax related irs related that comes with some specific tax treatment on cooperative that is like um the payment you're kind of required to pay a percentage of it in cash when you're making distribution so how do you do that if you're only using crypto or depending on the type of tokens that you're using so there are some technical aspects there but then folks that are doing it that the dow folks the members the participants should be the ones um driving also those those changes the conversation i uh as attorneys as cpa tax professionals and we can support and we can help identify aspects of the law that are blocks but it's really about understanding what's being done on the ground what's being how how those groups operate they know what what they're facing as as far as issue goes and how how hard it is to uh get funding you can you know form a cooperative a dao as a cooperative and and then maybe everybody has access to sba loans to get that started well cooperative might need um individual guarantees for that how do you do it with a cooperative and how do you do that with web3 group it's you know virtually impossible to have that so it's really um the the operation kind of be driven by those that are on the ground the community that they be engaged i think those are the ones that are suffering the most i think having to jump through hoops and they they we just need to enable their activity to happen to help and support and i think conor you're doing those research and survey i think that's a really important aspect that's identifying um those with not me who are trying to you know just kind of draft what i'm described and what i understand from the law but but you know bill who is actually doing the the dirty job and making things happen on the ground on that front too i would really plug the work there are a number of different groups and that are starting to do some really good work here i think blockchain association is one but also fight for the future the electronic frontier foundation is becoming much more involved and has been for a long time i should be fair to them on that front um and we're seeing more and more uh established organizations like eff which have been around for many many years that are starting to look at crypto appreciating the privacy piece appreciating in many ways you know crypto has been for a variety of reasons quite you know popular with republicans uh senators and members of congress and we haven't seen that popularity build amongst democrats but there's so much promise there's so many things that democrats and progressive and lesbian left-wing organizations love and would love about crypto to your point like they were just a little bit better educated so hopefully we can see more and more of that happen and i would love um you know folks on this caller folks watching i mean to check out those organizations i listed and i'm happy to include links to those later but all all great organizations doing really strong work and coin center too i think i forgot that but of course yeah well also throughout so um is another thing on the electoral side yeah because i i do believe like if elizabeth warren understood what dolls were she'd be a big fan but instead she just understands what bitcoin maxies are and that's why she hates crypto but yeah i'm also biased because i'm uh kind of come from the democratic party background so i do have hope right yeah let me say well thanks thanks so much everyone i think we're right thank you connor connor thanks for spending this together thanks for this together man yeah for sure for sure well thanks for joining really appreciate your time and uh and all of the very engaged conversation on this i mean it's it's it's i think really important to get lawyers in front of crypto folks sometimes they don't want to stick around and hear from us but um the more information we can get out there uh and open source for the better so thanks again everyone and uh we will now i will see you later thanks we'll now transition out to um to the governance portion of this session so we have two more presentations one will be by tony douglas and the other would be by kelsey nabin and michael zarga so we'll start with tony and tony's a second year uh student at stanford in their mba program and he's also the head of governance for stanford's blockchain club before stanford tony's professional academic focus was organizational design and future of work technology um and i know tony's been doing a ton on the dow governance front so i will leave it to you tony yeah thanks connor and uh thanks everyone for having me it's been an incredibly interesting discussion um let me share my screen one second all right i believe we're good to go so so really um you know what i'm going to go through today is just a discussion on governance collaboration and in particular how we're running you know our governance program at stanford blockchain club and sort of some open ideas on how folks can collaborate with us before i jump into that uh you know connor touched on this a bit but just to give a brief sweep of my background i started my career at goldman sachs as an internal design consultant effectively i was doing process engineering work decision automation work target operating model type stuff and in parallel i was getting a master's in organizational psychology in particular i was looking at applications of machine learning to organizational development i ultimately built an org design team at goldman and then left and joined an hr tech startup called humu and now in school again i'm in nba in the mba program i've had internships at uh share ventures which is the logo on the left the big s um which is a venture studio and then the churning group which is increasingly getting involved in crypto so you know here i'll all i'm just providing an overview of the presentation but but what i'd say is like if nothing else the takeaway from this is one we want to be transparent in how we're thinking about governance and who we've collaborated with and the partners we've had to date and then beyond that we just want to invite as many people as are interested to collaborate with us in various ways that i'll touch on you know later on in the presentation yeah so first um this is just an overview of andreessen horowitz delegate program and for those that are not familiar i strongly encourage to google this title at the top the open sourcing our token delegate program and effectively you know a16z has just delegated out governance rights to various stakeholders and they talk about why they've done this how they've thought about doing it and criteria they've had for delegates you can see in this uh sort of pie chart to the right the breakdown of who they've delegated to so you'll see these this big purple section is various university organizations of which we are one um you'll see on the left how many votes uh we're responsible for um and the reason i highlighted here the criteria for delegates is we take this incredibly seriously um and we think it's quite a responsibility to be able to participate and really shape protocols that are managing you know billion billions in assets is a pretty serious thing and for that reason we want to remain committed and engaged in the process um we are independent of of andreessen though they've been incredible partners anytime we've had questions uh or need advice or educational resources the like and they just they frequently join a lot of events that we put on at stanford as well um part of their criteria for delegates is a diversity of perspectives which i think is an incredible idea and very necessary as people think about how to collaborate on governance um and then obviously trying to tap into subject matter experts that are within the club and so it's probably worth touching on our club is comprised of people honestly across the school so whether it be management science and engineering or undergraduates in cs where we have a graduate program called symbolic systems we have folks from the law school and obviously you know like myself people from the mba program as well um and really we look at this you know these governance tokens as an educational tool i mean it's it's opportunity for our students to engage with these protocols in a very uh meaningful way um not only reacting to proposals but putting forth our own proposals as well um and again we're we're looking at expanding this program though we haven't made that public yet so i wouldn't speak about the partners today but you know we're looking at getting involved in other protocols as well yeah so here i just wanted to provide an overview and again uh we want to be transparent in how we are running our governance process right so and there's a lot of room for improvement and i would very much consider this you know v1 or v1.1 or so but at first you know we just monitor proposals across those protocols very frequently um and right now we're taking a stance that we are primarily reacting to activities that have to do that relate to the protocol so smart contract modification decisions related to protocol fees rather than activities related to the treasury um you know for example like grants and the like and the reason being is we just want to as much as possible remain beyond reproach and and not subject to um you know in any biases or people that we we particularly like or um anything like that um the beyond just monitoring the proposals what we'll do is then post it in our discord which is actually open to the public and i encourage everyone to join um and then we'll just have an open debate around the the proposal and you know people will dive into the code on github um read the other resources um and and really just provide their their unfiltered views from there the governance team which um in addition to me is 10 other folks will synthesize all that information basically weigh the pros and cons of everything that was presented and then make a decision on on whether to upvote or down vote and then attempt to reach a quorum like we haven't really had many instances where we haven't post that analysis stage generally we agree um and then to the extent that we don't we're we're typically able to resolve that and we lean heavily on folks that are are more experts in the particular decision that's being made from there we then pass it on for a final review to the leadership team that just ensures there's no conflicts or other areas of concern within that particular vote one area that we are hoping to work on and i think speaks to the collaboration theme here is posting our analysis publicly more often so you'll see on the right us just posting to our twitter and please do follow at uh stanford crypto um why we voted for a particular proposal and you know this didn't have any super in-depth analysis appended to it but we're increasingly starting to put those together and and trying to get better at documentation and engaging with the sort of like external community to get a reaction to to our analysis yeah so our our goals within the governance team are on the right so you know i already touched on the participation and commitment and the the sense of responsibility that we realize we have um beyond that though is just education and thought leadership so not only educating ourselves and having this shared learning journey which i think is incredibly important um and you know i think it speaks to why why this set of talks today was so important right we're all kind of collectively learning together but beyond that i'm starting to develop some thought leadership so we have an incredible set of schools that are working on various things that that apply to dao so you know there's a center for work technology and organization for example and a set of research researchers and professors that are really pioneering various freelance worker models um and other future uh work technology so we think that you know we have a unique opportunity to leverage these different schools at stanford and and really apply it to governance and and hopefully advance this space and engage with folks again in a discussion on how to do that but beyond that and a big reason that we were excited to come today was this idea of transparency and growth mindset i think to date if i'm being completely honest we've we've done things maybe in in the dark i mean not intentionally but we just haven't posted as much externally as we hope to and and we want to do that you know not only to um so people understand what we're doing what we're working on what our thoughts around various proposals are but so that we can get feedback right like ultimately we don't have it figured out and we want to refine our governance program as much as possible on the left you'll see various ways that we're actively working to do this so again i already touched on the more active participation on twitter um if you were to go to our website it's it's pretty bare bones and we're working to enhance that um one of the key things that we're thinking about doing is just basically open sourcing all the analysis that we do and posting that centrally on our website um and then beyond that we just have an increased focus on events with external speakers so if you go to youtube and type in stanford blockchain club for example we've been doing an accelerator in the last six weeks it's really just been an educational series with an incredible group of speakers um and now those are all you know posted on our youtube channel so i encourage folks to to look at that and in two weeks we'll be doing a set of dial panels ourselves um we'll post that both on our twitter um as well as our mailing list that you can join if you go to our website uh and then yeah beyond that i already touched on documentation that we want to get better at and then just uh really encouraging folks to reach out to us and partner in various ways so one of the last things i wanted to touch on was was just you know i think various collaboration efforts that i think are worth learning from we're learning from right now and i think you know the work that conor's doing through the dow research collective and they put on a dow summit much like today um i think is absolutely incredible because again we're all learning together i've been able to reach out to connor and tell him what various folks are thinking at the university and we have a great exchange of ideas through discussions like that which you know i've really enjoyed in and folks within the governance team are are um excited to get involved in various efforts like that as well um you know open sourcing everyone's research i think this was one of the most useful set of of like open source research if you were to google this that i ran into um as i was trying to to get smarter around daos and then lastly uh for those that are not familiar the blockchain education network uh has a meta delegate program that's encouraging and educating folks on how to take part as delegates in in uniswap and so efforts like this obviously that bring more people into the space not only bring them in but educate them in how to get involved based on their expertise or sort of past academic experiences i think are incredibly important and we're always excited to connect with folks that are engaging in these types of activities um in terms of collaborating with our club around governance um i i touched on some of these earlier but people reach out to us in in uh delegate or talk about delegating their governance rights and other protocols and and we're always open to those discussions um we're open to running nodes uh i already touched on exchanging ideas and co-authoring papers and here i would just highlight again even within the governance team we have folks that have a public policy background and have thought about the history of governance um and how that might apply to what daos are hoping to achieve and i think that's an incredible sort of area to explore beyond that again i touched on you know the center for work technology and organization and i am actively talking to the organizational behavior professors there to talk about beyond some of these legal structure um discussions that we've touched on today how can we think about organizational effectiveness with endows and really help to ensure people are coordinating as intended around these common goals right um and then lastly just partner on educational events um so that that was pretty much all that i had i again would encourage to reach out to our twitter and and follow us we're going to be posting um more and more throughout the year this is the link to our website and lastly i'll just say thank you i really do want to connect so for those that are curious about anything that's going on that i touched on today or my independent research is more around again organizational psychology in lessons from frameworks and processes there that can be applied to daos please reach out to me either email twitter or linkedin amazing thank you tony much appreciate it um and yeah i think it gives everyone a good sense of almost like the i think tony spoke to it like everyone's still very much learning in this space as it relates to taos and how much news how much news is going on at all times and so there are many folks who are working on it but so much more helpful if you can collaborate and uh and share a little bit of knowledge so moving on to our next session we have kelsey nabin she's a researcher in decentralized technology communities as an ethnographic researcher she's interested in the human outcomes of digital infrastructure blockchain community culture and algorithmic governance we also have joining her michael zarghum who's the founder and ceo of block science dr zargham holds a phd in systems engineering from the university of pennsylvania where he studied optimization and control of decentralized networks very relevantly so they're presenting on the foundations of decentralized governance and they're writing a paper on that same subject which they're going to be releasing soon um and after michael and kelsey it'll be the end of the session so it's been great you know jamming with everyone today we hope it's been useful feel free to reach out to us through the dowcollective.xyz or find me on twitter do the same really encourage you to reach out to speakers as well if whatever they said was of interest to you and thanks so much for for uni-swap grants program and heath global for all of your support and all of your help in in us doing this and so um we're going to move on to kelsey and michael they're in two very different locations kelsey's in sydney and michael i believe in the united states so they had to pre-record this so they could get on at the same time and coordinate with the event so we're gonna take a second to to bring up the video now i think andrew's got it going but i'll leave you to take a look hey unicode really glad to be with you today i'm kelsey nabin a researcher at rmit university and i'm joined by michael sagan founder and ceo of block science and we're here to talk about the foundations of decentralized governance so the aim of this presentation is to draw on control theory to explore governance dynamics in decentralized complex adaptive systems so first of all it's worth starting off by questioning what is governance what are we talking about when we say governance and how is it delineated from politics or political processes or a lot of other sort of related but distinct themes and so you know in order to define this word drawing on the definition from french philosopher michel foucault who describes governance as the art of governing or governmentality in a democratic society as the techniques and procedures for directing human behavior so this is a helpful way of thinking about governance in decentralized systems as well as the process of structuring the possible field of action for others michael do you want to comment on that sure yeah i think it's important to examine what this looks like in both a sort of top-down and a participatory system so a lot of the times when we think about governance we think about the specific decision like being enacted or the process through which that decision is enacted and in a top-down system it might be as simple as you know someone with the authority to set the field of action for others simply does it and and revises it sort of on a whim in fact i'm sure we've all apprecia experienced that in some sorts of digital largely web 2 systems where what we're allowed to do what we can see is the province of the platform provider as we move into understanding more decentralized systems or in particular systems with feedback loops between the participants within those systems or the users within those systems and the field of action available to them that's where we start to examine the complexity of adhering to the field of action as it is versus changing it in the future and so we can start to examine the processes beyond just the point of decision and expand them to understanding the relationships between the you know sort of role as participant and the role as governor especially if these things overlap which is actually pretty common in a decentralized system so that's actually a really nice delineation of what is a dow and actually understanding the difference between an organization and a set of tools because if governance is structuring the field of action we're not talking about a dao as a multi-sig a snapshot and you know liquid token delegation we're saying fundamentally the most basic tao is a set of participants and an objective and so the first step is to make that those kind of often implicit assumptions explicit and start to think about how they then apply to governance within that system so i think in order to dig into this we should examine another concept that we've been exploring in our research and that concept is the governance surface so if you are doing governance to set the field of action then there's a sort of field of action for setting the field of action now that sounds sort of silly but we just decompose it a little bit as an actor within a system you have some things you can do and some things that you can see and generally a way of engaging with that system but in a governance role whether it's a decentralized or centralized governance role there's generally a set of actions that you can take to change that field of action now if uh networks such as crypto networks or software systems that enable people to do stuff generally this means software is the field of action you're pushing changes to code or you're pushing changes to parameters that are in code or possibly you're expanding funds to maintain or develop future features there's a range of activities but if there is a set of actions that you can take as part of the platform there's also a set of actions that you can take to evolve the platform and so we tend to delineate the governance surface as the set of things that the governance activity can do and even that might need to be further broken down because you might use different processes or have different stakeholders who have rights over say the governance of a pool of funds versus say the governance of a particular parameter within a piece of software versus the governance of the software writ large where you could imagine making arbitrary changes to code and so any time that you need to say this group of stakeholders through this process has control over these parameters or these activities which further structure the field of action for everyone else then we can call that a governance surface so there isn't necessarily a specific one governance surface for an organization but any time we want to look at a governance activity we can examine what's the set of rules for changing what particular aspects of that system kelsey did you have anything yeah i really like that and and obviously then differs between different organizations as well or different dowels or whatever the system you're looking at is so there's not just one governance surface but then that will also differ across different organizations and i think what you mentioned at the start there in terms of kind of creating a mental model or a conceptual model of what that governance surface is according to the relevant decision that also requires the designer or the governors to be self-aware and factor themselves and their sort of position and relationship in relation to what they are governing into that picture as well which is really interesting yeah we have to ask sort of when we move towards participatory or decentralized governance what does it mean to become informed in order to participate in that process because i think we often take governance as a big bucket and the truth is that an informed participant in governance depends a lot on what they're governing and so in the case of breaking things down or in the case of decentralized governance it's necessary to break things down so that we can better understand which participants have control over which governance surfaces and how we can move towards a informed participatory governance as opposed to just governance i checked the box cool we let people participate so it's totally going to work i think we see a lot of that yeah i mean as an ethnographer and a social scientist in this space this is something that multiple dows are grappling with in terms of how do you have a participatory system where everyone has a say in decision making but then how do you have a meritocracy as well so how do you have people that are informed on a specific matter whether it is technical or fiscal or something else actually having authority to make decisions on the relevant matters and so there's kind of still that tension i think as uh communities experiment with figuring out governance and then decentralized governance in terms of is it everyone makes decisions on everything or is it the most qualified make decisions on some things but then how is that actually uh going to prevent against kind of collusion or attack or or you know who decides who's qualified right exactly the age-old problem about how you decentralize the system who decides who decides so i think it's probably time to get into one of the more formal concepts this is borrowed from control theory which is the area of my phd work um for those who aren't familiar i'm a control theorist specializing in and actually decentralized systems that's what my my phd work was on and here we're going to bring in a pretty basic con concept from like you know intro undergraduate classes on control theory and and that concept is um called controllability and observability really it's two concepts but they are kind of pairs they're a pair that come together and so i'm going to give a quick overview of the two concepts and then we're going to explore how it is relevant to organizations so in the in control theory we have a system that's being built or generally something that already exists called the plant and the plant is a system that you want to steer however it's there already and you need to add actuators and sensors actuators are the means of changing the system and sensors are the means of observing the system now most systems are not completely actuated and completely visible some aspects are going to be measurable meaning you can see what's going on some aspects are going to be unmeasurable but you might be able to make inferences about them from what you can measure similarly you want to control some of the states of the system but you can't necessarily just set the thing to the point you want you actually have to steer you need to accelerate your car you need to turn the steering wheel and those controls allow you to collectively navigate the car to where you want it to go um without necessarily just mutating its state to the car is in front of my house or the cars in front of my or in the parking lot at the university et cetera so we break down these concepts of of observability and controllability in order to determine whether it is possible to navigate a system from where it is to where we want it to be in a sort of abstract space not necessarily just physical space and we do this by adding things that allow us to mutate the state of the system and to measure the current state of the system in an organization the sensors are going to look like places where you can collect data where you can measure progress against kpis not necessarily the kpis which are set higher level goals but the the measurements that you take in order to determine whether you're meeting your kpis and so what ends up happening then is that you look at your system and you provision some measurement apparatus and some mutation or change apparatus and then you feed that output back into a controller and a controller is just a decision-making system it perceives what it can observe and it uses that to actuate through the tools that it has so in the context of decentralized governance what we're really just saying is that the organization writ large needs to be able to have be able to set some goals it needs to be able to measure its progress in those goals and then it needs to make decisions about how to use the levers the actuators under its control to make changes in the system which they can then observe through the sensors part of what makes this difficult is that there's often big time lags right so activities that you might take in the short term to drive your goals in the long term might be counterintuitive or opposite what you might expect this is because the system itself has dynamics maybe some that you don't even know and so you have to respond to perturbations or uncertain elements in a in a proactive way not just in a reactive way in order to drive towards your goals and i'm going to sort of leave this at that for the moment if you're interested more in these concepts i would recommend this youtube video that we've linked just talking about the basics of observability and controllability and how you provision actuators and sensors for physical systems in order to learn to drive them towards desired outputs and i'm going to note that we are not really doing the sort of undergraduate version of this in our um you know decentralized organizations and our decentralized governance problems we're really doing the multi-agent version of this whole teams of individuals each observing things independently and sharing some access to a collection of actuators and we need to get the system to steer as a swarm rather than steer as a centralized sort of command and control architecture if we want to be able to think about this as um sort of decentralized governance not just as centralized governance kelsey i know i've been talking for a long time here do you want to sort of layer in some interpretation of how this fits into our um like social systems you know dow governance design problems yeah absolutely and that's it's really helpful the way that i think about those concepts coming not from the controlled theory background is controllability is what levers of control are there in this system and then when we map that to daos it's who gets to manage those levers and then observability so how can the behavior of the system be observed and measured and again like who who gets to observe and who decides what's happening in the system and then who then you know in that loop who comes back to the levers controllability and controls and then who observes and and so on and so i mean practically these concepts lead to really concrete questions that are hyper relevant to design endows so what in the system is controllable so what can be influenced and what is observable how do we know what kind of critical changes um occur in the system and and the outputs of those uh between different states and then if it is controllable and observable how much so from there what are the effective places to add sensors so you mentioned uh we need to kind of measure the states and the and the outputs to generate those feedback loops but where and how do we do that and then the actuators as well so what are the suitable places and how much how much effort or force needs to go into those and so i think one of the most helpful analogies for these concepts is one that you actually shared with me sargon around a car and so that might take us to our next slide in terms of the size of the governance surface yeah i will make one comment before we go all the way into sizing the governance surface and that's that measurement is tricky and i think it's something that we'll be addressing in some of our other writings but especially with social science like science and the lack of explicit measurables in terms of the things that are our real goals we're always going to run into challenges determining what our sensors are the sensors themselves are actually proxies for the underlying phenomena and so you know as a flag for people who are taking this as advice to go plan out their ways of you know guiding their organizations i want to put a reminder that your measurements are always reductions they're always samplings from the phenomena that you're trying to drive and so you should always be careful about what you measure how you measure it and how you use those measurements because you might argue that a really important part of your governance surface is actually deciding what your goals are and deciding how to measure those goals because minor changes in what your measurement apparatus is can actually greatly impact the um the output decisions about what to do and that means it's part of governance great so we get to governance surface and i think the common or like a common kind of uh thought pattern in decentralized systems is that smaller is better so keep governance really simple so it's controllable or through the process of trying to i guess decentralize or simplify it's automate as much as possible so it's uh free from kind of the vulnerabilities that human intervention might introduce but coming back to that car analogy the way that i understand it is there's a certain uh amount of control that you would like in a car and observability so control is you know it must have a steering wheel a gas pedal a brake and a gearbox you actually don't want less governance than that and then in terms of observability you definitely want a windshield you definitely want side mirrors you definitely want you know a dashboard with your your speedometer and all those things and so i think that analogy is helpful when thinking about governance because it's not about making it small or automating it or making it big but perhaps you can talk more to the concept of this idea of right sizing yeah i think the thing to understand is that the amount of actuators that you need depend on what you want to be able to accomplish so we can think about the car analogy and we could imagine what would happen if we cut the brakes so to speak right you would lose a degree of um control over the vehicle that would be really unhelpful in fact you'd become much more difficult to accomplish goals of getting the car to where you want it to be if you could only use the gas but you probably still could so like technically speaking i think you'd retain uh sort of controllability of the navigation of the you know 2d plane of the the traffic um uh transportation system but it would become much more difficult it would be less safe probably if you also took away the gas you would lose your ability to actually modulate your velocity and thus you wouldn't really be able to control position even if you could say change the steering wheel you might be at a fixed velocity but you'd be in the worst case just sort of going around in circles sort of annoying silly maybe but the point here is that removing leaving the gas in the brake but removing the steering wheel would also reduce your capacity to navigate somewhere now all along we're assuming you can see out the window see where you're going maybe that you have a speedometer so that you can keep track of what speed you're moving at and imagine what it would be like to try to navigate that same car without the visibility of being able to see out the window or be able to see your current speed it's the combination of those observables and those actuators that basically render a car as a useful piece of technology that you as the driver can sort of navigate the the gestalt of you plus the machine to where you want it to be now one of the interesting uh elements of this uh discussion the car analogy is it does um beg questions about quote-unquote autonomous vehicles and what's really interesting about it is that the car is only really about as autonomous with say the technology that allows it to drive as it is with you in it from a first principles perspective because it needs you to give it a target destination so i guess a person plus the car is autonomous in the sense that the person gives the car instructions and the car delivers on those instructions um that's technically true even if you're not in the vehicle driving it because you're setting the destination or a human is setting the destination for the autonomous car that's a little bit silly but i want to point out the fact that these technologies and their relationships with humans excuse me require us to um think about where the goals are coming from and so maybe without going too far down that rabbit hole i'd like to point out that when we're sizing the governance surface we are really working backwards from those goals if i had a really an autonomous car then my governance surface has been reduced to basically giving the car instructions about where to take me if i'm the driver of the car then my governance surface is the pedal and the brakes and the steering wheel etc and in both cases we are working with the same vehicle we've just you know changed the um amount of um control being exercised directly by the humans um or the in this case the humans that are overseeing that system and what i want to point out is that the lower level um mechanisms associated with the brake and the gas and the steering and the gearbox are actually still there even when we automate it up we are just automating the use of those now lower level mechanisms so we're just stacking things up and when we automate that can work as a great way to reduce the governance surface but it never wholly eliminates the sort of human at the top of the stack because no matter how much you move up you're going to need someone to do some goal setting you could even have a whole fleet of autonomous cars that are taking their guidance in terms of the goal on up another level and you could have you know a continued stacking that ultimately gives up to some profit objective over some measurement over some other again higher and higher order goal but when we think about governance we can think of it as saying we keep pushing the goal setting the field of action structuring up to a higher and higher level composite but we've never really lost the degrees of observability and controllability in the lower level systems we've just made the governing apparatus a higher level software system and i like to emphasize this with regards to taos and in particular decentralized governance because we're trying to ensure that the top level of the stack of governing apparatus actually points back around at the constituents of that system and it could end up being a pretty complex network of you know expertises and empowering of different humans to monitor maintain or govern different pieces of such an assemblage but if we want to think in a participatory way or in a decentralized governance way it does make sense to ensure that there's always a loop background to the automated the higher level decision-making apparatus where its measurements and its goals can be changed by the humans who are subjected to the decisions that that automation um is making um kelsey do you want to add anything before we move on to um the next slide it's a well articulated point i think that takes us to the next slide in many ways this i mean this it's a whole a whole other presentation but this idea of autonomy in in what we know and love is decentralized autonomous systems it's kind of been a bit of an obsession for me this this year and i have a a post on my sub stack blog in terms of in terms of this asking um you know who or what is being made autonomous in autonomous systems so i think that point about automation but still the role of people in systems is um is really important and so it kind of brings us to this question of like what is actually the objective of governance and i don't from what i've again what i sort of have researched i don't see this super well articulated within decentralized technology communities uh thus far i guess and so we talk about them as evolutionary but it's a really important question in terms of like what are we evolving uh towards or what's the uh the aspiration here and so i really like the definition of autonomy that comes out of the field of cybernetics informed by control theory which is what we've been talking about which is this idea of wholeness and so uh zagrum you've actually been bringing up for a while that um daos could think of themselves as autopoetic systems and what this means is just a fancy word for saying a living organism or something that is able to uh make decisions adapt evolve and even sort of self-perpetuate or or kind of uh like replicate itself without relying on external resources per se so that's kind of perhaps an interesting uh thought provoka but there's some really great quite old school kind of literature on that and i highly recommend someone called varela from the 1970s who talks about um autopoetic systems and how something that is autopoetic is whole in and of itself and thus that wholeness meaning that it doesn't depend on any external factors is actually autonomy and that's quite a nice way of thinking about what autonomy could mean in decentralized autonomous organizations one of my favorite um ways of articulating autoplasis is as um constantly in the process of creating itself because it's not static i think this is probably the biggest leap from uh autonomy to autopoetic that's relevant for dows is that when we think autonomous especially in a very technical sense like a closed-loop control system that observes decides acts observes decides acts and this is perpetuated it has a it is it's dynamic in one level meaning it's got feedback generally this is feedback control right the basis of the control theory literature is the idea that you can go through this process of observing observing state through sensors and using it to make decisions in pursuit of an objective to execute on those decisions and observe even if things don't go as intended you're continuously able to adapt to the changes within the scope of that model however they tend to be static up one level in the sense that there's not really a meaningful way to change its goal unless you stack it with another such system and we get back to what i said on the previous slide about sort of the human at the top of the stack somewhere setting some goals in an autopoyetic system the source of the goal setting is also internal and so we've moved beyond just saying that the system is closed in the sort of informational technical sense around pursuing an objective but it's closed on itself in a higher order way meaning it's able to discover and sort of you know rewire or continuously create itself and that sounds like kind of wishy-washy stuff but i think um if we examine a particular dow that i feel exhibits this property it becomes a little bit more concrete so i've been a contributor to the dow called one hive it's a sort of self-organizing system built on the aragon stack and in particular the one hive dow instance that's running or the community that's got their infrastructure running on the xdi network has evolved it multiple times they have many swarms that are independently operating living some of them get big and even fork off into multiple organizations or even other organizations they get funding through a shared voting scheme but what's so interesting about it is they've actually made upgrades to their code they've spun out other um sub organizations that became their own organizations and they exhibit a lot more of the properties that i associate with um sort of living organisms albeit they are code plus humans humans doing things that interest them what interests them has changed over time their software infrastructure has evolved with the deployment of new smart contracts and basically if you trace the lineage of the project you'll see ebbs and flows in people ebbs and flows and code bases variations in a plurality of objectives pursued by the different swarms and as i noted spin-offs of projects that grew out of it so that kind of situation lends us to believe that it is possible to look at the gestalt of the humans and the infrastructure that they're using as a whole entity in its own right and that that entity is able to adapt its goals but unlike some of the more centralized sort of stackings like in the autonomous car or even the fleet of autonomous cars example it doesn't loop back around on like a single point of decision making it actually loops around through a collective decision-making process and the participants within that system have sort of emerged this plurality of objectives that are largely complementary but they are fuzzier and less um bottlenecked on a single point of of decision making than some of the more technical examples and even some of the more technical articulations of the control of doubts yeah a couple more points that come up in relation to onehive is a kind of sort of case study example and i'm really grateful to members of that community for engaging in research interviews but the decentralization of that system comes from the fact that no one is setting the kind of high level strategic um direction although there are shared sort of vision and goals which give the participants in the system the capacity to set their own objectives i guess or subsets of objectives and so a couple things happen there uh within the design of the system and and one is that value is intrinsic to the ecosystem so the way that currency is automatically minted through their smart contract and then deployed through proposals to reward labor in that system means that it even even value in that ecosystem is not pegged to any external kind of real world currency although honey token found its way to currencies and kind of can be mapped to you know a dollar a us dollar value or whatever the other is in the way that the system sort of self recreates or perpetuates it's not just when mechanisms are built by swarms within the system such as you know adding on different modules but actually the high level architecture of how that ecosystem runs was recently sort of adopted i guess i was gonna say fought but it was adopted by bright id so actually it's it's creating uh an evolution of itself or it's self reproducing but in a different instantiation which is really interesting when it comes back again to that idea of autonomy and wholeness and i think just zooming out and linking to something i said in in the first slide is what we wanted to kind of start to explore was how governance differs from other or is distinct from other concepts we see in decentralized autonomous organizations and decentralized systems and so the way that we've spoken about this and some of the concepts we've tried to draw out are very different from politics for example or political processes but when we come back to you know a whole system that is you know self governing independent of excel factors and this you know governance surface and controllability and observability are some of the techniques used to do that it's very different from things that run on top of the governance surface and also things that run underneath it such as the fundamental kind of architecture that you've spoken about a couple of times and then how people sort of sit at the top of those of those layers i want to make a comment about the relationship between governance and politics especially within the scope of this concept the governance surface so if the governance surface is the set of actions that governance can take it's meant to encode a feasible set so from a in a formal decision problem an optimization problem of sorts there is a feasibility and then there's like the objective or the goal what would make something optimal is the thing that is the highest value in the objective function suppose you're maximizing and it has to be a point in the decision surface or the set of decision variables that are feasible and what's interesting about the governance surface is that it actually encodes the feasible actions or the things that can be done not the measurement of whether that's the right thing to do and in an environment that's decentralized there isn't necessarily a unique objective the objective is a composite of all of the stakeholders who have governance authority or rights in choosing a point from the set of feasible governance actions and so as we leverage that sort of you know decision-making formalism that comes from the theory of optimization um and which is implicit in much of control theory we're realizing that by decomposing the concept of a feasible action or the set of actions that can be taken from the specific action that is taken or is even proposed to be taken we've opened up room for an evaluation of a political process in terms of how candidate actions from the feasible set are surfaced and evaluated and discussed and then ultimately sort of ratified and put into action and then even the consequences of observed and feedback on future decisions but because we've decomposed the governance surface as a set of possible actions from any specific action taken we've actually left room to discover the or even realize the preferences of the community through their actions in the governance process or in a political process that gives rise to the choice of an action through a governance process and so it's definitely a lot of meat that could be further untangled in these concepts but as kelsey mentioned earlier we're not actually doing this for the first time there is a many decade old theory called cybernetics which itself examines the application of control theory to decision making in organizations and large institutions with the caveat that early cybernetics was very top down very commanding control and part of the application of cybernetics to decentralized governance is moving away from that command and control view and leveraging concepts from decentralized control theory to understand how to accomplish a informed participatory governance through feedback loops within these living systems so perhaps that takes us to our next slide uh to say that uh we do have a research piece uh coming on this which explains these details uh or these concepts in in more detail and also goes into the case study and as a kind of applied example so we'd love to share that with you uh when it's ready and thank you so much to unicode for having us and the organizers as well for the invitation really appreciate it thank you very much and a shout out to our our teams um i work with a great team of researchers at block science and kelsey with a great team at rmit anything else you want to add hope to engage with people i guess feel free to reach out to discuss further awesome thank you [Music]
