[Music] [Applause] [Music] our next segment so we are running five minutes ahead of schedule um but what we have up next is a ecosystem showcase of some amazing projects that have been funded and supported by the ave grand style so what we'll do is we'll kind of call up all these six speakers they're going to talk about who they are what they do and how you may be able to get involved so without further ado let's bring on our very first talk and that is homar from gelato and hilmar is going to talk about everything that's happening with gelato so i'll ask you to turn your camera on and uh we can get started hey carter how's it going good welcome let's do you see me all right uh yeah i think there might be an audio issue if you're not able to hear me but i can hear you just fine so it would be great to learn about gelato and you can just take it from here yeah sure so um yeah i work at a project called gelato um gelato is a protocol that automates my contract executions on ethereum and on other networks and yeah basically we help developer teams to automate certain aspects of their depths kind of like taking away the burden of all the devops related technicalities that uh come with running sophisticated financial products um on public blockchains and yeah we we received an um have a grand style grant some time ago to help build out a cool product which is available on a website called kono finance and that's basically um automate like paying back debt positions um and preventing liquidations by kind of periodically always selling some of your collateral off um for the debt that you borrowed and then paying back your debt periodically to avoid getting liquidated and having to pay liquidation penalties and yeah that's basically what we what we built for the other brands though and i appreciate the support of uh over there a lot amazing um yeah i'll kind of do some q a here as well so um let's kind of go deeper into what gelato is uh you've obviously been part of the global site for as a number it's been for the past few years and you've kind of learned so much about what's happening in this ecosystem and i think i remember just chatting with you a while ago and uh you kind of also got into the vega system a bit early so just walk us through how gelato is set up what was the need for you to build this thing and sort of just everything's happened the past year and a half yeah so yeah things develop fairly quickly um i think like two to three years ago i was still going to hackathons um at the eth global hacking on some some funny interest rate swap use cases we're using eatland uh back then or or now other um and so yeah i was always gonna like fascinated and try to kind of like build more sophisticated financial applications uh also like options on on defy and every time you every time applications require something to happen on a conditional basis at some point in the future you kind of require this second layer of servers or keepers or bots basically running that actually monitor all the states and then execute certain functions at um at future times basically and um yeah we kind of like stumbled across this issue a lot of times during um just hacking on stuff and yeah at some point um we were working on a project together with gnosis and built in and and and yeah we came across this problem again and then we kind of like decide okay that's for us like for us developers let's just build like a tool that really just like outsources that problem um and try to kind of like fix that for for every for all of our future projects that we wanted to build and um yeah we kind of got stuck on this i'm solving this issue because it is not that straightforward actually um as it may seem and um and so yeah could you dig a little bit deeper into that like what are some of the complications how do you think about some of these guarantees and also maybe some examples of what you can do or cannot do with gelato right now yeah so um they are like the the very basic problem that you need to solve in such a system is basically um making sure that transactions get mined in a certain period of time at certain future times right it may be sound quite quite easy but it's actually like if you think about the blockchain you only have a certain uh block limit right you have a certain capacity and there are a lot of transactions that want to get in during the same times maybe if they're like high congestion times and you need to make sure to actually fulfill the duties of your protocol to get your transaction mind in a certain time frame and um this is fairly easy if you do like one transactions but if you do like a thousand transactions in a very short period of time you need to resubmit transactions you need to cancel certain transactions then this becomes very very complicated um and doing this on one network um on the ethereum it might still be okay but if you then have your application deployed on phantom on polygon on our optimism you suddenly have to run nodes on all these networks you have to deal with like rpc issues um running phones on most of these networks is nearly impossible for like the average development team without like a full-time devops team around it so um yeah they're like very infrastructure related problems that you have to solve first of all and then there's the whole whole um whole issue about um okay then you are kind of like the only one running this spot right and if your company can like sensors or ex-maliciously or just kind of like goes down for whatever reason right um then your whole application this decentralized application you build is now not uh functioning as intended right so similar to how the graph um picked their like reading data from the chain problem we pick the writing data to the chain on the conditional basis problem basically and um yeah we want to provide developers with just this infrastructure piece and that is decentralized that is censorship resistant that kind of runs also when gelato our core team at some point in the future is not there anymore right that they kind of can rely on and and this is uh it takes a bit of time we're not there yet uh but yeah it wasn't one step at a time this is great and then uh i was gonna say i think in closing i guess uh one obvious thing is that most of people that are watching this thing and and participating in need online are developers so as i think about their hackathon projects can you give them uh some sort of uh thoughts or suggestions on how they might be able to use gelato and then what are some of the things that they can do problematic so so yeah so um every time you your application needs to execute certain functions at future times be it like every 10 minutes or be it when unison prices uh rise above a certain threshold right um you would otherwise like you would normally be required to kind of like spin up your own server and kind of like try to get these transactions mind for poc that might work but like in production that rarely really does so um um rather than just do that i would just uh encourage you to go to app.gelado.network there you can literally just um input the contract address of the contract you want to automate then all like the functions appear and then you can just like select the function that you want to automate and you can write a resolver contract that defines upon which condition you actually want that contract to be executed you can for example say hey every hour or you can say um when the balance of this user is greater than x right um and then you you just deposit some ease to pay for the transactions and then or like somatic on polygon for example and then that's it and and you don't need to worry about running any intra it should work right away um and if it doesn't uh let us know come to our developer chats and discord and we can help you out amazing well hopefully everybody got excited about that because there's a lot of automation and scheduling you can do and there's so many interesting applications with that in d5 so uh thank you much mr and uh for those who are interested it looks like bill's already posted uh a comment on how you can learn more and how you can find out the documentation for gelato so thanks again and we'll on to our next uh demo and showcase and with that i'd like to welcome eric who's gonna talk about omni analytics so eric whenever you're ready cool better get started awesome uh hi everyone hopefully you can hear me okay um i'm gonna go ahead and share my screen as i have a couple slides and so i'll talk about our project uh so basically for the ave grand style um what we did is we were building what we call like an intuitive and extensible analytics framework for the ave ecosystem that was part of or the work we did and so i just wanted to start by kind of talking more generally about omni analytics group uh i'm the chief data scientist at omni analytics group um and basically we're a boutique data science firm and we specialize in machine learning data analysis ai and recently cryptocurrency we've actually been active in the crypto ecosystem uh now really for a number of years but especially in this last year um we built tools for the ethereum foundation numero uniswap gitcoin pool together and many more um and we we have a little following on twitter and you know five thousand plus people they like to kind of hear about data science crypto related topics and and basically the goal fun underpinning what we do it's always been about the power of data analytics and data decision data driven decision making um and so that includes things like insights from statistical modeling eda exploratory data analysis dashboarding app development and our whole goal with what we did for the ave grand style is we wanted to bring some of this to ave and the broader community and so this was basically our focus and it's still ongoing but we basically broke it down into a three-tiered kind of uh process it began with a mainnet dune dashboard uh we later were sort of contracted into doing a polygon dashboard on dune and we followed a really similar structure i'll show you both of them in just a moment um but then we wanted to take it a step further so basically we love dune we love the platform for those of you you know who are familiar with it it's just such a great way to collect data from the blockchain display it and and look at trends and growth trends over time um so we love dune but we were thinking what can we do to take this analysis to the next level and by our day jobs what we usually work in is in r and for those of you who are familiar with the r language it's effectively a statistical uh programming language it has all kinds of toolkits packages libraries that can be used to do some pretty cool analyses and we thought um integrating with the covalent api where we can pull off a data produce a customized dashboard and really take this to the next level as far as the flexibility would be what we can do to broaden the appeal of the work we've done so let's take a look i'm going to first show you the two dune dashboards then i'm going to show you the r dashboard and just give you an idea of what we have here so let me take a look at this so this actually let me go first to the mainnet dashboard then i'll show polygon so uh this is our first dune dashboard and we structured it in in such a way that we wanted to present what was the uh essentially the most important information up front and really this is like you know illustrating the growth of ave as a platform up front and we sort of broke it down into these categories so basically usage metrics where you can see like daily active users new users of the platform number of transactions on the platform and then we basically have a whole section where you can see volume metrics so this is things like deposit volume flash loan volume borrow volume liquidation volume and we sort of have this consistent structure where you can see there's always a counter and that counter is like one day seven day 30 day and then the total volume along with it we have time series so basically you get an aggregate metric of each and then you get a time series metric where effectively that gives you a view of how the growth has taken place as a function of time one of the challenges and things that we just had to overcome is of a there's basically v1 and v2 uh versions of the contracts and we aggregated this so you can see it dates back to june for the v1 and then i think since december for the v2 and these queries unless we're indicated are all at the aggregate level you can see this dashboard has quite a lot of statistics but we tried to keep like keep it consistent clean and the relevant stats like really prominent so that's our mainnet dashboard um the second one and i won't take too much time on this because you'll notice it's quite similar and that was uh by design we basically rebuilt the dashboard and for polygon and so you'll notice most of the same metrics some of them are still pending uh some data's recently been added to those tables that have enabled more and we're still working on some more but a similar structure basically all the metrics targeting the polygon chain so same idea there okay and then finally i want to show you our start on the r dashboard so basically what this is here is uh h r shiny so those of you who are familiar with it basically shiny itself is a way of turning an r analysis into an interactive web application and we basically built a similar concept to the dune dashboard but what we've added so far is basically some interactivity for the user so instead of just a big tall scrolling list of the volume metrics you can select which one you're interested in viewing and then immediately get those results you can also then filter to a specific date range so for instance maybe you're interested in since the beginning of the year to in this case september 16 to see the aggregate metrics across that time span then you can get that and we have plenty more functionality like usage metrics and these all uh are dynamic plots we try to include some ave branding it's very much a work in progress but we have a lot of great ideas for what we can do to keep making this uh more extensible and more sustainable one other quick comment just for those of you who are interested this right here is our github and we're posting the code that basically is used to underpin the dashboard and the shiny dashboard itself on our github on the analytics group of a growth dashboard anyone's welcome to check it out follow the instructions to install it and run it locally and if you have any great ideas for what we can visualize in the dashboard we're more than happy to hear those ideas okay let me go back to the slides here and then i'll finish it up okay so in conclusion really what it comes down to we're firm believers that when data underpins like the decision making process organizations run more efficiently and so we really wanted to build upon the analytics done in the dune dashboards but with the r code we're exposing the analysis to a wider swath of users we're interfacing with the covalent api and exposing that growth data in a way that really the whole community and other developers can access and explore themselves and since this data is so rich the potential is so vast we believe there's a lot more that can be done beyond just what we've done but we're really really excited to keep working and about the potential of this and that's all i had thank you so much if there's any questions i'm happy to take them that was amazing eric thanks for covering this i think uh there's a couple questions so i think we'll be good to know is uh it'd be great to uh get your take on sort of the conversion between now focusing on doing this thing for define crypto and sort of what you were doing before uh what was that like what were some of the learnings or rather insights or the things you were talking about uh let's start with that and we can dig in a little bit more yeah that's a really good question so effectively like when we start when omni analytics group was started uh we really were focusing on general statistical consulting and we were looking at like what are especially like more underserved areas as far as like you know industries that don't typically think about statistical you know statistical insights as being something that they need to really worry about and so what ended up happening is as statistics and data science got a little bit more prevalent and and people started figuring out that this is an industry that needs to be taken seriously they need to make data-driven decisions what what happened is we sort of found the cryptocurrency community and things were starting to take off but we were seeing some similar patterns which is that you know there's a lot of data out there but sometimes half the battle is just structuring it in a nice way so that you can start to find those insights and that transition sort of was that you know this is another major community cryptocurrency and you know blockchain was exploding in 2017 but that does we didn't have all the analytical tools that we do now and we wanted to really kind of push in that direction when you say you didn't have the tools is that just a comment on not having access to the chain data or do you mean something specific that that it's it's yeah mostly that i think just at the time you know that that data was available but now we have it basically in a way like doom lets us just trivially access it and that just opens up so much potential that the covalent api is another good example where effectively we've gone from yeah that data's all there but now we have one unified api that we can just you know write some wrapper r code and pull all that and do some pretty cool analysis with it no it's amazing and then um and you kind of touched on this thing a little bit but maybe be awesome if you can dive a little bit more into what are some of these insights that you kind of hope to draw from uh kind of the ave reports or the dashboards a lot of this is i guess uh the way i understood it a lot of this was just being able to present the same information slightly differently but how do you think about being actionable from yeah great question so i actually had a discussion about this yesterday with the team because we're what we were thinking like we spent a lot of time building up the data infrastructure for this effectively to show the growth of ave as a platform and i think we were really successful in doing that but to take it to the next step kind of you know what we're thinking here is there's all kinds of metrics that we're basically showing historical data on that we're visualizing the historical data but what we're not doing at this stage is actually making forecasts fitting statistical models so for instance you know these we're seeing a sustained growth in the number of transactions on the platform but what could those forecasts look like if we were to project them you know end months out into the future and you know there's plenty of machine learning algorithms that we can do to have a pretty accurate time series forecast and then it would be really interesting to do stuff like having these forecasts produced and then essentially compared against for accuracy as a function of time so we can continue seeing and refining the estimates over time i think that would be one direction that would be uh really worth exploring no for sure that makes a lot of sense um is this something that requires like it's more input from uh kind of the community or the governance sort of calls or like how do you think about prioritizing which ones to focus on i i think i think having some more input would be good because like you said it's a question of prioritization we the the sky is sort of the limit for what we can do but maybe there's an immediate need we want to say like if you know this these projections are just one example but if someone was say you know interested to say what is the you know the projected borrow volume over the next 10 months and we started with something like that we kind of could prototype it out assess how the model is doing and then expand it as you know the community sees fit oh that makes a lot of sense yeah exactly because it'll be a case by case i guess or need base um and lastly before we move on to our next stop um how can people get involved in what you're doing and where can they find out more sure so lots of ways to do that but um if you want to get in contact with us directly uh our twitter profile's probably the best way to do it twitter.com omnianalytics and if you dm us uh and just you know say you want to get involved with working on this whatever aspect it is we would love to collaborate and we like i said everything that we've done for the r dashboard is on github and then everything for the tune dashboards is obviously on dune public facing and we love anyone if they'd like to collaborate with us just contact us on twitter uh my email also eric omnianalytics.i o if anyone wants to contact me directly that works just fine as well amazing well thank you so much eric and hopefully more data scientists and your engineers that come in and help out with those models thank you very much and with that we are ready to move on to our next demo and want to welcome dennison who's going to talk about tally great to see you again dennison hello hello howdy howdy uh good to see you too good to see everyone here um that was really great presentation i was just writing out eric's email address because it's like oh that's pretty cool uh yeah so what i wanted to talk about today was the project that we worked on for ave grants um ours was a pretty interesting project it's called tally safeguard and it was originally built from a uniswap grant so the the idea of tally safeguard was to address some concerns around the flexibility and permissions layer of taos and our grant with ave was specifically around funding the uh audit with open zeppelin uh of these contracts so i think the best way to sort of describe um the the tally safeguard what the problem is is that uh you have a couple different camps when it comes to like governance and the ability of like governance to act quickly in an event of emergency it's a little bit timely if some people are following the the bug in um uh compound uh introduced by a community proposal or introduced by a proposal there's this need to have a permissions layer around acting quickly so uh what tallysafeguard does is actually wraps the timelock which is the sort of authority in your governance with a permission system where you can give different addresses permissions around creating uh proposals uh executing proposals and canceling proposals the idea here is is that you can go from a governance structure where you have the token holders who directly control a time lock to a situation where the token holders directly control the time lock but they can add other folks as controllers on the timelock with different permissions so for example they could say hey um we want to add this multisig to have the authority to create proposals on this time walk that then sit in the time lock for some duration of time during which governance could come in and cancel them right so the idea here is if you have a trusted group of individuals that have the ability to like create proposals at will there should be some sort of administrative function where governance can come in and say no this proposal should not go through similarly governance can give someone else the ability to cancel proposal um so what you end up having is this this ability to like compose authority in your governance and the way that would look is a little bit how i just describe it you may have one multi-sig that has the ability to create proposals uh another multi-sig or an individual that has the ability to cancel proposals so you could use that for example in a setup where um you know governance is open and it can create a proposal but you could have a sort of a overseeing group of security experts who have the ability to cancel a proposal uh or you could do it the other way around right the security experts can propose a proposal governance can cancel it you can also use it without a governance itself where you could just simply have different combinations of multi-sigs or different combinations of individual ad addresses that have different permissions to to create uh execute or cancel so you can kind of imagine how you could build any sort of permission structure based around that so that you can have um a dow that both has true token holder governance but also has the ability to execute things in a quick manner or can be used as sort of like a subgroup for for um treasuries a great example that we first had thought about when we were building safeguard was grants committees where grants committees themselves had this interesting situation where uh you know a proposal is created on governance that says okay let's give a million dollars to its grants committee and now this grants committee is a group of multi-sig holders but now they receive the money and they have ultimate authority over this money right it's not possible for the the governance to claim this money back from the multi-sig unless you ask the multi-sig nicely and this can sometimes be an issue right like you can you can distribute funds to a multi-sig that are worth you know a million dollars on day one uh you know d5 can go to the moon and they can end up having a hundred million dollars in that multisig so the sort of trust assumptions that the community may make around members or signers of this multi-sig may be different depending on the the levels of uh maybe different like based on like how much value is being held there but this sort of like delegation of authority in terms of delegating money is really one way so the idea here around safeguard was is that you could use it for example in grants committees where you can delegate spending authority to a group but the governance can still take it away without actually having to ask permission from the multisig holders to do that so what i i'll share here really briefly is just our repo so folks can see it and uh go check it out this is what's being audited currently at open zeppelin we have uh you can find it here at github.com backslash with tally backslash safeguard if you go through the readme i'm not going to go through the reading fully but if you go through the readme you can talk it talks about the sort of problems that i just laid out and the solution and vision that we have thought of including sort of a preliminary specification on how it works so this grant was uh for auditing it um the audit is almost complete we've just gone through the process of uh addressing some um just minor minor things that came up in the audit um nothing nothing major but that audit should be completed in the next couple weeks um you know optimistically next week um uh probably safer to say in the next two or three weeks and that will be available here obviously it's open source anyone can use it and happy to really talk to folks who are interested in finding ways to incorporate this with their multi-sig with their governance of multi-sig with their you know governance multi-sig end user uh externally owned account um i always call it like and because it's e externally owned account so we're happy to speak with anyone about that happy to talk more about that um you can you know uh uh go to the the repo here you can also always find us at uh with tally.com which is here so uh happy to take any questions and yeah that was awesome um thanks for that uh i i think uh it's less of a question more of like i want to give you more of a spot like after the audit is done specifically what can people do and what would you like them to do so after the audit is done what i would like to see people do is two things one is i would like to see grants committees set up where the governance has true authority over the grant money right uh it doesn't feel long-term right when we talk about ave grants committee uniswap grants committee compound grants committee these are very large dows with a lot of money with a lot of prestige and it's not so hard for them to find pretty high profile individuals who can be trusted uh folks to to manage these these pools of money however you know when we talk about the future and dao is really spreading not all daos are going to always have access to these these sort of like quote unquote famously individuals with a lot to lose and reputation in the space to manage their pools of money and they can certainly run into situation where maybe today you know xyz dog token you know maybe it's worth a thousand dollars but you know something happens and boom now it's worth 10 million dollars and oh by the way it's managed by five anonymous uh users on a multisig that you've actually never met right of which you're not even sure they're all different people right it could all be one person so so for these smaller communities the risk becomes quite high and that becomes a kind of existential risk to the trust in the community so if you use something like tally safeguard these grants committees can sort of insulate themselves from that danger on the flip side it also potentially and i'm not a lawyer i cannot give legal advice um but it can potentially help with the claim around decentralization right so you i'm currently so a lot of uh governances use multi-sigs as their governance um but in the eyes of uh some you know legal uh things again i'm not a lawyer um that might not actually fly right like you you have the concept of like an unincorporated general partnership which is what most multi-sigs are these multisigs are you know if you create a grants committee with a bunch of friends um actually each of you is responsible for paying tax on the entire sum of money that is uh received in that multisig because it's unincorporated general partnership again this is not legal advice um so you know using something like tally safeguard where actually the governance has the ultimate authority and for example you know maybe the multi-stick holders can propose ideas that still go past governance and if governance does not take action can be automatically uh you know effectuated um maybe in some cases uh supports the argument that you're truly decentralized right because today um you know using just a multi-straight really puts a lot of onus on the multi-sigs holders and a lot of liability potentially on the multi-stakeholders again not uh lawyer not legal advice um but you know the thoughts are like how do you build a safe protocol um that's both safe for the members and safe for um the the uh participants who are maybe signers so that's where you know i think that's a really great example for your for your governance for your um you know grants committee oh it's awesome and i think i want to also say that as a side effect of this setup you also uh get to design a system that scales with the user base like now you can have a lot of people come in instead of having two to three or whatever five people just kind of making a hierarchy around a two thousand person dow so uh you also want to think about those because that prevents growing even more amazing so thank you so much dennison and thank you check out safeguard on the tally get up repel excellent thank you folks all right with that we are ready to move on to our next talk and introducing next is will r robinson from b5 lines i'm also going to talk about what the file lines is and how they work with uh ave and everything that you can do to get involved with d5 lines so without further ado let's welcome well [Music] hi everybody uh excuse the background i'm reporting from stairs as my house is under duress um uh my name is will i've been at deep alliance for six months uh proud recipient of an ave grand uh d5 alliance has been around for over a year and a half building out uh an accelerator that helps grow deep by users to a 1 billion by 2025. it's an ambitious mission uh it basically means that we're looking to find new projects grow them invest in them connect them teach them through a curriculum that runs basically four times a year at this point we're finishing up with cohort five we'll be doing a keynote next week hosted by um joey krug uh who is from pantera and auger um and there we will showcase uh 25 teams two of which were sponsored by ave grants to build out protocols and grow on top of ave so interestingly early on we had partners from layer ones like cello and tara and al goran now [Music] lana and these ecosystems right they wanted us to bring defy to them and accelerate on top of them but at a certain point we realized that like ave is its own ecosystem um it's its own platform to grow and build on top of and this is the promise of defy right lego blocks and so ave wanting to support projects building on top of its foundational lego block like thus increasing its moat uh and importance in deep uh you know tapped us to when we tap them i guess to to try and do that uh and so only they and uh uniswa have been like layer 1.5 uh for us as partners uh and i'll show you my our website so you can get a sense of what we're all about uh you should be able to see it here so define alliance.com helping web3 startups succeed we have basically this theme around terraforming new lands um and ave's logo will be scrolling by in a moment there um so we have two facets we have the accelerators uh which are defined gaming now my own background is across both i used to be a financial auditor uh looking at crypto wallets and multi-sigs and making sure that the assets were there and that i could sign off on the books but before that i did a phd in video game design and so i'm excited to do both and think very closely about the intersection between d5 and gaming as well because we see gaming is like the road to future defy users and i i suspect we will be letting in avogadro if not in this accelerator in the next one as like a very cool example of a game built on ave and then we have this industry network uh these are you know companies uh that are made up of market makers and liquidity providers to help bootstrap our d5 protocols uh but also like lawyers who are really important and code auditors uh and community managers you know the sort of panoply of all things you would want to have to ensure success for your teams and we've accelerated some pretty cool alumni um and yeah what makes us unique is our access to liquidity and community and investment um and uh we have these like amazing mentors uh like the list goes on forever uh you could come see at some point who you'd like to to meet maybe one day um and the uh grant has allowed us to essentially bring these teams on without taking equity uh in their in their product this is allows allowing us to source better teams that just want to grow and don't need to worry about like the financials or anything and so we give them this sort of like vc privileged accelerator process um and that's like covered by ave so in some ways we're like a grand re-gifter in that sense um and we have a variety of resources we also manage something called defy grants where you can see not just aves grants but everybody's grants in the ecosystem and we're trying to make this the go-to place to find capital so if you're interested in that definitely take a look here we also in addition to d5 grants maintain something called defy jobs which is over here um and we have like 206 jobs in d5 this it's all a work in progress this is our old logo um but you can find like for instance the nine jobs at ave or you know jobs at some of our cohort companies and other companies we've accelerated uh the uh overall like goal right is to foster a really rich community full of like signal uh filter a lot of the noise that you find in crypto and make sure that we find strong builders who want to come work together from a diverse set of backgrounds and skills uh and if you're interested in doing that we'd really love to get your application in you can apply to d5 or gaming if you're building on top of ave we'd love to to hear about you you can get your questions answered here you can apply through our form right here so you know here's the cohort six application form which will be starting sometime we said november 23rd we'll actually be pushing it because we're also as the d5 alliance about to go down um we've been like a centralized organization trying to get this thing off the ground but we really want to um sort of dog food the web 3 that we're building um and think that it's totally worthwhile to experience being a web3 company accelerating web3 companies uh in this way so deciding to do that has meant this is a 40-day delay on this cohort i also can like show you our industry network so because we've succeeded at attracting um you know such great companies because they don't have to give up equity we have great sort of service opportunities so like if you want uh and join defy alliance i like you'll jump the line at quan steps quant stamps public queue for audits for instance um or you'll get to like talk to our hype marketing team or directly to jump capital or winter mute to get your liquidity um and so all of this is possible because of our sponsors like ave grants and the hope is just to grow deep by as fast as possible and be along for the ride my uh my sense of this is that uh we're we're kind of summoning like primordial forces when playing with crypto these sort of like self-perpetuating protocols that through value capture and then ability to redirect incentives grow a whole new um way of being and interacting and i think it's terrifying and also amazing and that's that's why i'm really keen to join this like ride and to see where this goes and so i think that's the passion that fuels d5 alliance is just let's make deeply happen faster and uh and think about it critically while we do it i uh am totally happy to um take questions if those do happen but otherwise uh i can also keep going uh kartik do you want to give me some guidance here yeah so we got a couple minutes i i think if you have anything else you want to talk about please free feel free to i think the one question would have is you sort of talked about the experience of the accelerator without the dilution which is a pretty good incentive and a pretty good pitch but could you go a little bit more into detail of like how the accelerator works what does it mean to be in a batch what are the things that you do for each of those companies and just a little bit more about that experience yeah definitely so it's something of a moving target as we're always refining and uh you know we're evolving with the times um currently the accelerator lasts six weeks where we do about six hours of content per week and that's like listening to payne warwick speak about how he built synthetics we're listening to kenny wintermute about how to negotiate your liquidity deal listen to larry sukernik on how to structure your dow or spencer applebaum about how to give away governance tokens in order to bootstrap your liquidity that way um so these are really detailed um lectures that aren't just like feel good motivational speeches but like technically like difficult problems that you don't even know you have to solve um from the industry experts which is not like the you know y combinator who people compare us to um right where it's just like here's how you like you know beat those guys and raise your spirits it's more like this is a complicated space here are some subject matter experts um and then we have uh like our ecosystem partners such as uh ave and uniswap and solana and cello and everybody sort of helping out and polygon and uh teaching our teams how to build on their systems we think the future is multi-chain like although we love ethereum like super deeply we do want to see all these other platforms give it a shot and grow maybe you know teach ethereum a thing or two and vice versa and so they're helping our teams navigate their own grants and their own code reviews and they're also giving their state of the union and their vision of how they're different so that's a pretty cool kind of value add and then we have our regional capitals uh so there's a european define alliance chapter where we get like a chat from ajit tripathi from ave and melton damires from coin shares and that's always a hoot and then we give a talk from china with uh our chapter there um that's usually headed up by mabel jang who's from multicoin and we have our indian chapter uh where we'll have like you know the polygon people and other like watson people and the other amazing companies coming out of india i give the lay of the land how to hire there how to market there how to like um think about your community globally through the lens of these regional chapters uh so that's like a big part of it but it all sort of like culminates with demo day and a big part of our program is making sure you can like pitch your company to a large audience of d5 stakeholders uh who are gonna know what you're talking about and need you to succinctly clarify what you're doing and who you are and why they should trust you uh something that people like often forget is that like d5 protocols until they're like living on their own are people right and like they're going to pivot and they're going to change and they're going to make code mistakes and you've got to really know who the people are behind that protocol until it's like you know past its like lindy effect stage so yeah that's that's our program um you chat with me and i get to help you out whenever you need it that's another part of it and when it comes to the game track well we're trying to get like the best game tokenomics people and the twitch people and the discord people to sort of structure your community so if d5 alliance d5 program is about liquidity um the uh game program that we're launching is about community those are the sort of bloods that run through the veins of these different kinds of web 3 projects that's a excellent pitch that uh if i ask anything more i'll probably ruin the good note that it's ended on so this is great everybody wants to learn more about d5 lines head over to the final lines dot co and i'm sure you can contact will on twitter as well as uh through the website so i guess encourage everybody to apply and uh with that we are ready to move on to our next talk thanks so much well bye-bye everybody so next up i want to introduce matthew who's going to talk about llama so uh matthew's here uh whenever you're ready feel free to get started [Music] i think you are still uh muted so we'll just give a quick second on uh being ready on the audio side all right can you guys hear me now here we go yep cool see and you can see the screen okay everything's good full screen here awesome all right so hello everyone my name is matthew from from the llama community the lama community received a grant some time ago from from arbay and it's focusing around our base treasury management so i had some difficulties right so within this grant we have a few main deliverables the main ones are focusing around the vision for our bay what we would like to try and achieve with their treasury how we want to put it to use and the direction we think we can we can take it in as a community uh we're also putting together um an asset management framework which kind of really structures a lot of the decisions allocations how we're going to implement how we kind of approach risk we're also going to put in some initial initial strategies so put forward some ideas they'll present it on the governance forum and they'll progress to an arc over time and then hopefully we'll get one of those through within this grant or maybe potentially the next grant so and then touching on some of the areas around like financial reporting what we're looking to create is income statements uh cash flow statements and balance sheets and we want to start producing those periodically on a monthly basis and with that what we're going to try and try and do different for more traditional companies want to try and make this kind of live data and we're trying to use data analytics and june to help us do that as a tool so summarizing the the first main deliverable which is the division document uh this is available on the rv treasury um governance forum if anyone wants to go have a read so this document is this outlines the vision the vision we're presenting to the community is to encourage innovation accelerate growth uh prudent financial management of assets while providing relevant and transparent financial reporting content we suggest that the community should remain overweight rva to capture the future growth upside whilst also hedging the risk against adverse market conditions uh assets are to be to be deployed productively within the guidance of best asset management practices real time financial metrics performance tracking we'll be providing transparency to the community and support decisions around how best to deploy the community's capital and we're also the treasury management and financial reporting is in its early days and requires nuance thinking within crypto and this creates an opportunity for our way to continue being a leader in space so within within the vision we're also looking at what how would you construct like a portfolio of assets that are they would hold within its treasury so within that we're also looking at a lot of risks which are going to be heavily detailed in kind of like the asset management guidelines we'll go into a little bit later we look into some of the unique features around like liquidity considerations at a asset portfolio level but then also in d5 specific like on chain liquidity so getting in and out of positions we're also looking at how do you remain long rv in your treasury and then also deploy it productively and some of the ways doing that is is through debt uh and whilst maintaining that really large long elbow positioning we're trying to want to hedge away some of the market volatility so if we're going to stay like a crypto winter the the treasury doesn't you know substantially forward the market so we're looking to try and offset some of that whilst also capturing that upside so that's really about like maximizing the upside and then minimizing the downside and really just trying to um deploy assets from the treasury productively so we can make the most out of d5 really so when we talk into asset management uh we're kind of really here we're trying to really create a framework that the community can kind of understand and refer back to in times like turbulence like we're really trying to drive this preserve capital whilst growing the protocol whilst also trying to like reduce risk so that's just touching on that hedging angle from a price but then idiosyncratic risk is also where you're deploying your assets you deploy all your assets in a single area and something happens to it then you've got a lot of exposure but if you spread it out across the space then you've got less specific risk on each investment so [Music] with this like the the risk angle is very important there is there's the credit risk the market risk there's liquidity there's infrastructure so kind of touched on those few few times now and then the nuance of d5 is today by specific risks and that's where you really start to think about like smart contract risk admin keys oracles open source code so basically making sure where you're recommending to suggest to the community that you've done the due diligence and this is a safe record safe suggestion so the way in which we tend to implement treasury management is through the aip process that means everything's going to go through the governance forum it's going to be open to community feedback engagement we really really encourage people to to review our posts and like give constructive feedback um we're all just trying to do the best best we can so anyone who comes up with like an amazing idea we really want to hear about it within the asset management guidelines we're also trying to think about long term for rba if there's any strategic assets that have a place in there so that could be just equity through alignment of two communities kind of objectives um and that could be like just through partnerships as well if we introduce leverage into the treasury we really need to have a strong understanding around that like really know where our health factor is like interest cover ratios what are we going to do in certain conditions like a lot of forward planning there if you think of the the treasury's like this asset allocation or asset portfolio periodically you're probably looking to like rebalance that and within each allocation that portfolio you've probably got bands of like mins and max's where you want to keep a certain allocation so that's something that we expect to be ongoing over time there's the potential there to do a a treasury committee and the suggestion we presented is that that would be something that would meet accordingly to review the the asset management guidelines the existing composition and you know how it all kind of fits together with the overall objectives we're trying to achieve so we look to manage the treasury in perpetuity so recognizing that like the community has been around a farewell now and it's going to be around for many many years to come and we want to make sure that we're planning for that extended time horizon so the best way for us to frame that is to consider this in in perpetuity so now this slide china shows some of the some of the work we've already done there's a um june analytics page that's out it was done by one of the llama community members so what this is showing right now is at the top left you've got like the ethereum reserve factor which is essentially or are they b2 b1 how much revenue or has been generated from it so as you can see here we're looking like 15.5 million which is really good uh we've got like the reserve factor sorry the ecosystem reserve which is basically the core array holding so and on the right we've got like the the polygon reserve factor which is how much revenue is being generated on the polygon network and you can see um from the from the charts like particularly the one on the left it looks a little bit exponential like it's a really great chart uh and you know polygon's done really well it's like coming out of the blocks and it's been super strong performance for the elevate community so there's a lot more charts on this ave and a llama dashboard so for everyone who's keen to have some of those financial metrics encourage you to go go have a look so coming into some of the more financial kind of reporting side of the the grant what we've got here is this is one of the first statements we produce which is basically a usd nominated um rvav12 like p l statement so what it's doing is it's showing monthly the usd value that rv is kind of is as revenue is generating usd value now you know from the previous chart when you accumulate it it looks pretty exponential we what you can see here is if you look across the bottom line as you can see ave is actually quite performing quite strongly month on month it's getting uh there's good growth you can think back and uh there's been a fair bit of volatility in the in the price of assets what you can see in here is the bottom line and rva is somewhat influenced but potentially not as much as what you'd see as some other protocols so what you've seen is a really strong upwards trend in this and it's uh it's it's quite a good balance sheet so this is one of the three main financial deliverables that we've got and these these are all available through the rva governance forum as well and if we were to look at the the breakdown of some of this what we're seeing is the reserve factor is very heavily concentrated in usdc um and dyer and usdt which makes a lot of sense because those are the the biggest pulls on on arbeit for lending and borrowing and the the polygon network is generating very similar but just in a smaller magnitude but the distribution is a lot more balanced than say say b1 v2 combines so that's really how what all the numbers are kind of presenting and if we were to to look forward to kind of what comes next uh we're looking to build out the balance sheet that's the one piece we haven't really yet developed we've got the income statement we've got the cash flow statement we really want the balance sheet and then we're really going to start going into a lot more data on june we're going to start looking at a lot more financial metrics like how's are they performing peer-to-peer ratios or peer-to-peer comparisons so return on investment all those kinds of just statistics is where we're looking to kind of develop out and we're looking to provide all this in a really easy format that the community can kind of take a glance at and really just kind of understand so and that's that's how our llamas today what we've done with our uh rv and a little bit about where we're playing and taking into the future awesome well thank you so much matthew and uh this is great um maybe just one question will be how can people get involved if they want to and uh sort of uh what are some ways to keep up with everything that's happening with llama sure so the best way to keep up with what llama's doing with rla is is via the governance forum like everything we do there is published uh if someone wanted to get a little bit more actively in involved in the treasury management side for arva in particular um i'd definitely be on there on the governance forum trying to contribute and throw ideas around that's really good place to showcase what you've got to offer in terms of contributing to to llama itself like i think probably just reach out to us by twitter so we're not really i don't really have a website with a discord we can come join yet that's something that'll come in time but yeah just reach out to us over twitter and we would love to have a chat awesome well thank you so much for that matthew and we are with that ready to move on to our next uh talking demo so um i'd like to welcome ben uh from rabbit hole and uh we'll just give ben a quick second to uh get set up and uh and whenever you're ready feel free to get started hey everyone thanks for thanks for having me today um my name is ben and i am the operations lead at rabbit hole for those that don't know rabbit hole is a platform that simultaneously does two things one for communities and protocols like ave we help protocols find the best users and participants for their network and then on the other side for for users we we help them learn about onboard into different projects um and and use different crypto applications um and help them earn crypto for doing so so we recently did a a quest the the core function of rabbit hole is is a quest where um a protocol uh provides some amount of rewards that incentivizes a specific action for users to complete if rabbit hole we verify using the graph that a user has completed a specific action that applies to the quest we reward them with the tokens that are provided so we recently did a quest through the out of a grants program where we incentivized users to both lend and borrow funds on ave polygon we targeted 2 000 users and actually had 2 000 users complete this quest and redeem the rewards within 12 hours i believe were the numbers which was incredible it really showed the excitement within our community and within our users for using and getting more acclimated with avec if we take a step back rabbit holes is really appealing to the users who are trying to get more involved in crypto and in what three um and to become better better and more knowledgeable citizens of of the the web3 world and so um partnering with rabbit hole and doing quest on rabbit hole is a great way to gain exposure to educate people um and to bring in more uh eager participants and and owners of the network so we're extremely happy with with the way this most recent quest with ave went we've are working with a number of other leading program protocols and communities in the web3 space we've worked with uniswap we just did a quest this past week um with polygon we're working on stuff with we've worked on stuff with the graph pull together all different types of protocols and d5 nfts layer ones i'm really focused on how to get users more educated and more involved in the leading projects in crypto and then for the leading projects in crypto agave um how do we find more users who actually want to use the product or not about speculation um we're about finding people who are into using projects want to be good stewards for your community want to be active users and i think moving forward we'd like to move further and further on we have the as a grand vision we look at ourselves right now as pioneering learn to earn so i'm sure most people are familiar with axe infinity and and play to earn um you know you you earn money for playing in a game we look at rabbit hole right now as pioneering learn to earn um so you you earn uh a protocols tokens for learning about them and and most importantly actually using them but moving forward i think what we'd like to get to is participate to earn and what participate to earn means is moving more and more into rewarding contributions to network and so what that might look like moving forward and we're working on these capabilities and we'd love to continue discussing them with ave and through the grants program but what participates earn looks like more and more is like how do we actually reward value that's contributed to the network and so um what what that might be is you get rewarded if you've um uh if you've lent a certain amount of money and and driven a certain amount of yield um over the over six months period of time and what that's doing is it's incentivizing real sustained contributions real value provided to the network and rabbit hole can be the place where you incentivize and reward those um reward those things rabbit hole has as i mentioned an extremely eager set of users who love to participate in web 3 um who are constantly learning and upscaling and can be a really good partner for ave as ave thinks about new things that they'd like to incentivize and reward whether that's launching on a new protocol like we recently did with ava and polygon um or whatever that might be rabbit hole can be the place where protocols go to find new participants incentivize them make sure that they're the right participants we offer the ability to filter based on different skills we offer civil protection so you know that your every user you get is actually a unique human and can be a strong partner in helping ave strengthen their community moving forward um as i mentioned had a we're really pleased with the excitement from our rabbit hole community about the obey quest we did a few weeks ago and look forward to to more and more hopefully successful ventures down the line awesome thank you so much for that awesome intro ben and uh just so uh people know how to get in touch with you what is the best way to learn more yeah if you'd like to reach out to me personally at ben schachter on twitter um but for rabbit hole you can go to rabbithold.gg and complete our quest credential yourself through our skills if you've done different actions on chain we provide credentials for that which can then be used to unlock new opportunities unlock new quests in the future and to dive further into uh being a web 3 user and citizen amazing thank you so much ben awesome thanks so much for having me [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
