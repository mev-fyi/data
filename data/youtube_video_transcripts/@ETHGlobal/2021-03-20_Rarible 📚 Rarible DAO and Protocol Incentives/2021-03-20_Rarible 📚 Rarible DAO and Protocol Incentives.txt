cool um hey everyone thanks for uh joining us today and it's cool to have you here on the call with us um this is a session that's going to be run by alex from wearable and it's going to be on the wearable dao and protocol incentives so i'm going to pass it over to alex and he'll give a quick intro and kick the session off thank you emily thank you guys for participating here today my name is alex salnikov i'm a co-founder and head of product at wearable uh wearable is an nft marketplace initially targeting all the categories and that wanted to be as as democratizing access as possible and i think we would have succeeded in in that regard somewhat um and we've been we've been growing for 1.5 years now and then growing quite quite large uh literally we probably are the first marketplace in terms of users uh actually making on chain transactions and the second insurance of volume second marketplace on ethereum in terms of volume um so this is the free float session more or less i wanted to talk about the dial and the progressive decentralization that variable follows um but first i wanted to ask it might be if somebody uh has some questions uh today before we start because the hackathon is uh is is ongoing and um it's all it's all going great we have a lot of people hacking building on top of variable there are some errors and stuff but yeah that's that's the best part of the hackathons so if somebody have questions beforehand uh yeah please please put them in the chat or just ask them with the voice oh okay that's fine so uh half of the year ago in july wearable was this early marketplace with not a lot of liquidity we had all the great artists on board ozinachi frenetic void and um but but there wasn't enough the bypower and the marketplace flywheel wasn't wasn't going the way it's supposed to do we had something like 30 000 dollars in monthly volume and uh we've been brainstorming uh solutions and ideas how to how to proceed um and we ultimately decided um to that that there is a spirit inside the community we've been always uh tracking the community sentiment always being on twitter asking like who to verify who should we support more like who are the cool artists out there and and this community spirit uh was driving us forward and we decided to to decentralize the project further and and basically uh follow this uh you know exit to community structure proposed by vitalik at some point so our first stage was to launch liquidity mining program so we created the very governance token and started rewarding people for making transactions in the marketplace so people everyone who is transacting on the marketplace each week is eligible to have the part of the drop of the weekly drop proportionally to the volume transacted so we distribute 75 000 prairies and half of that took into buyers half of that to sellers and um yeah we counted all the volume prop in the in the week and and distribute this rewards proportionally to the volume so this this works pretty great and we've seen how encouraging that was for for a lot of creators and buyers to actually start doing something with nfts uh and that was only the first step so after after this half of the year what we're doing now is we are creating an actual dao so the governance process the very governance token so far works like this if you want if you want to come up with the proposal uh to do something or if you have some ideas some some implementation in mind uh you can reach out to the team and the team will talk about this proposal with you and and then put it on snapshot voting and as soon as it's voted on the snapshot voting then uh we go to the execution part so the hard the execution part is the hardest one so we had these proposals on our snapshot like okay guys let's go to layer two and obviously that's that's a good proposal to have and that's that's good that people are voting for it but the execution part of that is the hardest so variable uh is in this process of of and decentralizing the actual execution so uh we are in urgent need and we want we welcome everyone to participate together in the tao uh to create this this piece of infrastructure for nfts that would be shared that would be trusted that would be governed as a public good it's a good example that we aiming to can be i see a n organization that's handling all the domain names on the internet initially that organization uh was assembled from from the big players in in in the in the small internet that that was long time ago and it feels like blockchain now the whole blockchain space is following some kind of um similar similar paths that is that the whole internet did in its early days so it's it's extremely important to to create these groups uh groups by interests that that came together uh that have common goals um and that have and that work together to achieve these goals the blockchain gave us so almost all the organizations in on the internet right now as this icn uh they are all non-profit organizations um and the blockchain now gave and the whole new level of um of possibilities for these groups on the internet that want to do something together we can actually now form dao's and and to make sure that um and and to make sure that this dao would that the dow members would benefit from this common goal uh so our big goal for the dao our big goal for the nft community is to unite the community and create this shared single space with with a lot of liquidity for the nft tokens because i think the single best uh goal the the the hardest problem of the energy market is this ability to buy and sell on ft whenever you want you bought an nft and then you want to sell it you need to make sure that there is enough liquidity and there is a lot of potential buyers but this buyers need to be connected with the sellers that's why we came up with variable protocol that allows this shared single order book the shared single liquidity source for all the players building on top of the protocol now it's sometimes it's it's hard to build on top of something but again as we've seen with the theorem uh the decentralization of of the protocol the decentralization of of the foundation level on which we are building on is the real like guarantee that that it would be governed as a public good with uh with all the interests of parties respected so this is our like dream and goal for the variable dao and um we we created very token and 70 of that token is is devoted to be given out to the participants of the protocol uh right now this is buyers sellers on the marketplace but we can extend it further so uh it's just it's just really important that we we take those 70 of the network and we make sure that the players who contributed to the to the network you should receive the the respectful parties so uh if you're building on top of variable protocol please reach out to us and let's try to come up with the specific incentives that would make sure that would make sure you're happy building on top of variable protocol so um i have several ideas in mind already i think we can we can extend liquidity mining program to something like developer mining program so that right now we give out these rewards to people who trade on the marketplace um but there will be several several parties now who who bring orders to this to this protocol level and wearable would be only one of these parties so variable would continue to to give out these rewards to the players to the participants of the marketplace but the actual other players who are building on top of variable protocol they can um give out only half of that and and i know keep the the past part of the stake to themselves so that's our goal to to create this incentive for developers to build on top to make sure that you will be this governing party of the protocol that was initial idea let's let's bring people to uh in control let's bring people who who bring value let's put those people in control of the system so yeah there is 49 of the network yet unallocated uh i i can hear i can see there is two questions from the hackers in the chat so yes we have a test marketplace uh on rinky by that's rinkyby.wearable.com uh let me just check that it works yep it's it's ranked by the variable.com as soon as you uh as as soon as you put some items on sale as soon as you create some items on the rink by network they should be indexed by our wrinkle by wearable marketplace and shown on the marketplace you can connect your wallet and try to find all the nfts that you created on the rinky buy network so this uh marketplace i i need to remind you that marketplace is running on on the previous version of the protocol um and we'll adopt the new version of the protocol uh soon but that doesn't mean that but the assets are still shared across all the marketplaces so if you create it an asset on brinky by network it would be indexed by our link by marketplace but the actual sale contract would differ so that's that's an important thing to to understand uh thank you guys for the questions um [Music] i almost felt like uh a common man yeah you're talking about the doll but we need to hack so where is the rink by marketplace and i'm super happy guys that that you're uh that you're you care about things to actually work so uh it's probably this session today is just for for you guys to understand that as soon as this hackathon is done after after you've got your ideas built and presented uh you can reach out to the wearable team and we can we can transfer that relationship into a long-term relationship with the support from our dao we can fund the development like multi-month development uh with the funds allocated from the dao we can uh allocate some some tokens for the volume that you brought uh to the protocol level so it's it's all this idea of of building because it's important to build something um it's it's hard to build something sustainable without putting a lot of your attention to it and we want to make sure that you would be able to to put your attention in it and and that we can cover you know some some funds or or something else that you need in order to fully concentrate on building so uh your there is another question and that you're reading our docs on sell orders and the epi docs seem to be broken since today morning so let me check that uh there is this variable uh wearable sponsor variable discord channel that we have um and uh our our two developers are there and and they they covered this this briefly uh on on how to put an actual an actual order into the uh [Music] to the to the api so it is like several messages above uh let me find this uh i'll i'll try to put that into into the terminal or into the i i will put that example to our um to our documentation as soon as this session ends uh uh i'm pretty sure that other people were able to uh to mint tokens on drinking by network that's that's the first like large win and for the um for for the actual orders to be for the actual orders to be met matched uh we do have several examples they are not yet in the talk so yeah let's please stay after this session in the discord channel i i will share some some some examples of how that work and again i i i feel that there is this important questions about how that actually works and i feel that you are guys concentrated on the hacking so let's put that thing aside and contact us after the hackathon uh on this incentives and stuff so right now uh let me try to remind you the architecture of how it all works so i i can try to get into more of the details now [Music] so if you want to sell an item let me share my screen if you want to sell an item uh you need to assemble a structure uh of this type and it consists of this maker it's the person who who wants to put something like make is basically the part of the order that you are willing to to to give up and take is something that you want to to receive in response so the maker is the person who is giving up an asset and you need to put an asset inside this make structure you need to describe this this token and token id that uh you you of the assets that you that you want to give up uh and there is these creators and royalties and signatures uh uh that's that's actually for the lazy meeting type uh you need to put up the creators and signatures um and then there is the stake asset the the the thing that you want to receive in response um that was actually updated this document was updated so please check it once again uh and there is this random salt this random number that uh you want to generate just to make sure that this is another order not the same order that wants to try that wants to sell or buy the same assets and there is this data field an arbitrary field that we designed specifically to add more and more functions to the orders uh so there is this v1 uh version of this of this data field that accepts beneficiaries here here you can uh you can provide multiple beneficiaries that would receive the proceedings of an order after the order gets matched and here you also can provide origin fees and by origin you need to provide an address of of the front end of the origin that supplied this order and this origin would receive this origin would receive the parts of the proceedings as well you need to sign you need to sign this order the actual signing is should be done with eip 712 712 but it's it's assigning structures inside metamask so this is how you should sign an order and then you need to put that order into our api here's the link to api it's a put order it's a put order that that provides an order here um to our api endpoint as i can see it uh this this this particular example should work now uh but let me check with the team again and after the session i can i will be in the chat so we can figure it out do we have more questions here from the audience is that streaming uh why do we have some questions on the youtube no yeah from youtube so uh your worry is that you can bring a lot of sales but because it's a dollar would get significantly less return that if i had my own protocol yeah that's uh [Music] that's part of the um problem that protocols try tries to solve so if you have your own protocol that definitely means that you have 100 proceedings going to you right uh and it's cool but it's really hard to kick start your own protocol you need to have a buyers and sellers and verbal protocols already have buyers and sellers and long term we have ethereum network ethereum network is being fragmented now a little bit so we have several different layer 2 solutions like starkware manic polygon we have xdi we have this this optimism and zk sync so people would spread their mfts across these different solutions people would fragment not only l2 but another other l1 as well so there will be adoption of blockchains like like flow like polkadot like near salana so nfgs will just leave everywhere i can i can promise you they will be everywhere and and they they will move across the bridges from one environment to another and and there will be a lot of places for the nfts to be present at and we really don't want this a lot of places to be fragmented in terms of liquidity that you you know that you have a lot of buyers on the ethereum network and but you have a lot of creators on on the flow blockchain because it's free to create on it so uh that's that's our goal to to assemble the assemble teams uh to work together on the protocol and to be a shared owner of that protocol that would that is the answer that mitigates basically your worry so uh it's not that [Music] you're asked to build on someone someone else's dial but uh it's an ask to build on on the shared ownership owned on the sharely owned protocol so if you bring if you bring a lot of sales to the protocol that means that you would receive a lot of uh a lot of control in the protocol and and that would be like part partially your protocol yep and the idea is to abstract away a lot of a lot of complexity um to combine uh nft's orders on nfts from every part of the of the blockchain world uh it feels like an internet of blockchains now so the the nfgs would move uh from from from other layer twos to to ethereum layer one and back and vice versa and and the protocol the task of the protocol is to combine all of it to to index all the data on the variable on other side chains to index all the nfts to make sure that we can move them across bridges so and yeah and the shared ownership of this public infrastructure is is our dream goal so yeah uh if if you have some some ideas uh if you if you're just willing to help let's let's connect and assemble the team that works together on this protocol it's not only working on top of the protocol you can you can also uh improve the protocol itself for example it's lacking on chain order book now we can develop one chain order book together for this shared ownership and uh it all can be done with proposals uh you can submit the proposals like i want to build this part of the protocol i want to build starquery support for the protocol and i want 0.5 of the network for that and uh the community the existing community can vote like whether that's fine for for them or not uh that's that's the global idea of this of the shared ownership of the infrastructure does wearable provide royalty down that brings royalty up a chain of resales all the way to the artists uh variable i'm not sure i've got the wearable dial part uh or the the royalty dial part but wearable provides this interface for the world just downstreaming directly to the artist so on the event of asset creation you can incorporate inside the asset contract you can incorporate this royalties interface basically when exchange is calling the contract the asset contract the rc 721 or 1155 contract exchange expects to understand like how much royalties each uh id of this of these collections each item idea of this collections uh like has like what is this royalty set up on our github there is two royalties uh interfaces one of them is a little bit old it should return two arrays the first array would be array of addresses and the second array would be a array of amounts how much each address should should receive respectfully that's a little bit old interface there is a royalties p2 interface that you can implement that returns then array of tuples and in tuple the first part would be address and the second part would be amount of how much this address should receive the amount is denominated in basis points basis point is 100 of of the percent so uh as soon as you implemented that on an asset level in the event of the orders being matched on inside the our matching contract our matching contract would call the asset contract to understand how much royalties it should pay out and it will pay out all the roads that are told the the matching contract to be paid paid out to the artist or artist and manager or artist and manager and their collaborator so you can you can provide arbitrary set of royalties there okay uh we're almost running out of time now if you have some more questions please ask them now okay um i think i think that would be probably it uh i want to encourage everyone to build i want to encourage everyone to build on this shared uh infrastructure i want you to apply for for this shared ownership of that infrastructure it's important if you decide to have a long-term relationship with the wearable down thank you everybody who participated today it's a real pleasure to work with you guys thanks so much alex um yeah thanks for taking us uh through all that and for answering everybody's questions if you have any more questions for alex you can reach him in the sponsorable channel and yeah he'll get back to you have a nice afternoon morning everybody
