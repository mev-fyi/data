foreign [Music] on stage here and both of them are going to be here talking about all things that you can actually do in terms of how you can best leverage all the tracks that we have going on in all the amazing ideas that you can build from repository of things that we've already set up here to uh really make the next two and a half weeks super amazing so uh Welcome Matt and I and I'll let you all get started fantastic uh thanks very much yeah so um my name is Matt Hamilton I'm a developer Advocate with protocol lab specifically working on falcoin and the fvm and here I've got Addie if you want to introduce yourself as well Addie absolutely yeah um I'm ADI Shazam I'm the product lead for fem um so you'll you'll see me a lot working with hangout Kevin and a bunch of the dxu including Matt oh so the point of this talk is to quickly talk about the various tracks some of the project ideas that we've got some of the bounties and also touch upon some of the bounties not just on regarding fem which is the the largest Bounty here but also some of the other related protocol Labs Technologies and bounties as well because one of the great things about hackathons is you can experiment right that's what's they're all about is it's about experimentation it's about learning it's about building things and there's a whole bunch of different Technologies both from within protocol labs and within protocol Labs Network and wider field that are a part of this hackathon so we'd love you to get involved and you know put together these uh Solutions these ideas these projects um these hackathon entries using all these different Technologies and see where you end up so first of all starting with FM fileco and virtual machine we have 22 000 US Dollars um in prizes available specifically for fem so um Sarah has just talked about fem so hopefully you have a good idea about what fem is it allows programmability on top of the filecoin virtual machine and we have three uh grand prizes uh five thousand dollars uh paid in Phil for three teams for the grand prizes plus 14 runner-up project of 500 worth of fill each so the categories that we have set out here if you've been involved in some of our other hackathons you might recognize these we've slightly tweaked them a little bit as we've been going on um from feedback from the hackathons we've had so far but breaking it down we have dated owls so uh you will have just heard Sarah talk a little bit about data dowels so the idea about having a decentralized autonomous organization that has some uh involvement with storing data right so um examples uh might be industry specific for things like decentralized science machine learning or things like you know a film um show or exhibition or uh you know film film festival or something like that that might want to store things I'm going to go through each of these and then we'll we'll switch over I've got a tab of some fem uh starter ideas and we could go into a bit more detail on them and then I'll come back and also talk about some of the other uh bounties we have available here so defy best defy tools on fem so just like other blockchains other evm blockchains you can build defy decentralized Finance on top what is unique about fem and unique about filecoin is you have the whole storage provider ecosystem underneath that so you have three and a half thousand storage provider systems on the network they're all providing uh storage capacity to the network right so something in the region about 12 13 exabytes of data on the network so this is all backed by physical storage uh systems hard drives ssds around the world storing data so you can build that you can use that capability as part of a defy system so it might be lending to storage providers um it might be allowing storage providers to borrow based upon uh future Revenue that they can prove through the blockchain if they take on a storage deal they'll be paid over time for that storage deal they can actually use that a bit like invoice factoring within traditional Finance so that's kind of where D5 comes in the next is tools infra and bridging uh so this is an opportunity to bridge with other networks and other systems as well and bring in some of their functionality so things like decentralized ID Access Control uh for example from some of the other blockchains and also allows you to export the functionality of filecoin out onto other networks so using Bridges um and oracles and things like that as well so uh Bridges like uh axilla for example um oracles like teller on the network you can use those to export functionality out to other networks programmable storage markets um so this is regarding like we said storage uh we've got the storage providers storage deals generally have a finite Lifetime on the network so programmable storage is building things like Auto renewing storage uh also replicating storage uh bounties for storage optimizing storage sectors right the way in which storage is is stored on the network there might be a way in which you could optimize the way in which deals are aggregated together for example so let's do that and then uh d-web it so uh basically looking at uh current web services and applications into more open uh secure and resilient sort of web 3 based decentralized based systems uh using some of the other Technologies within vertical Labs as well hopefully that covers it did you want to say anything ADI at this point or shall I switch over to the starter ideas no that sounds great Okay so we've got a series of starter ideas here and they're linked to from the bottom of the prize if you go down here there's under inspiration you'll see list of starter ideas uh so that's what we've got here and we've got a number of ideas here that you can kind of go through so uh things like repair as a service like we mentioned for example you store data is stored in the in the way of storage deals on the network between a client and a storage provider and you might want to have that replicated multiple times for resilience uh using something like replication as a storage but you could use repair as a storage to potentially uh automatically detect that data might not be stored to the level of replication you need or might have some fault with it and that you can automatically repair or replicate that so that's those two kind of top ones there uh renewal as a service uh you can uh like I said storage deals run for a certain lifetime so you might want to have something that automatically renews the storage deal at the end of the lifetime as well uh building off-chain storage deals so the farcoin network is is built extremely flexibly and it leaves a lot of how the actual storage deal is negotiated up to the users right so it doesn't all happen on chain a lot of it is left to happen off chain and then you can once the deal is negotiated and agreed that then is published on chain and it's then the the blockchain's responsibility to uh query the the storage providers to ensure that the data is stored so uh there may be things that you want to do around how uh data is kind of you know aggregated and how those storage deals are actually built uh before they pass to storage providers uh calling as a service so um this might be using things like cron jobs uh to to regularly call uh you know functions on the uh fem on on the filecoin network uh so you might have something that needs to run periodically so something like this could be very useful uh endowment managers so again you might have something that takes in a pool of fill and invest and invests it on behalf of the users so I might use something like glyph that have a thing called infinity pool which is one of the staking Solutions and there's another uh fillet for example is another one that um does uh staking so you might have something that Aggregates funds together and invests that on behalf of the users and use this the return of that investment to then fund storage for example um uh things like Renewal Energy certificates so native renewable energy certificate storing those on the network um and that's that's part of like falcoin green as well um as part of that that's a service we have so things that deal with that would certainly be of interest uh zero knowledge proofs so the uh fem is the largest production use I believe of zero knowledge proofs at the moment and uh there's a lot of other things you can build on top of that as well so and there's a link there to more information about that sustainability uh falcoin green have a project called CO2 storage and uh there are ideas that you might want to build upon that again there's links to some of those ideas around um uh energy validation for example uh certificates uh credits that kind of thing as well um retrieve.org this is a project that I believe is from Saturn I think it's it's ADI um or related to Saturn um and so this uh allows uh retrieval like a retrieval Oracle and retrieval assurances on the network so this could be something that could um check the network and ensure that stuff can be uh retrieved from the partners on there IPC is the interplanetary consensus um so this is a project uh within protocol labs to work on the next generation of consensus mechanisms that will take filecoin scaling up to you know millions of transactions per second and is going to be looking at using horizontal scalability with subnets and you can have different subnets that allow you to um run specific functionality on on these subnets so there's a number of um ideas around how you could have a wallet that could run on different subnets for example how you can have um things like eigenlayer for subnets um we've got multi-wallet subnets in there twice I think um and there's a few in there and visualizers explorers all these kind of things that kind of fit in with how IPC IPC works there uh on chain storage deals we've mentioned that data dowels we've talked about that there's a bunch of ideas around data Downs incentivization um that kind of thing ipni disputer so ipni is the interplanetary networking index uh it is the system that allows you to register when you when when a system stores a Content idea CID can register it with ipni to allow uh people to find it and there's a some ideas around how you can um ensure the Integrity of that index and what people are reporting so you know thing ideas a bit like uh oracles for example incentivization um for for valid response or penalization for invalid stuff and then finally ideas around uh Soul bound tokens again for sustainability claims for storage providers so a storage provider might say hey we have 100 renewable energy for our storage um system well how can you both prove that and how can you then allow people to access that information and maybe programmatically then build on top of that so I might have a system that says I it it's automatically only going to make storage deals against uh storage providers that can prove a certain level of sustainability for example so that might be something they they do there um how was that Ali was there anything else to kind of chime in on there yeah I would say one thing thanks for going through that Matt um one thing is uh that we have a couple of workshops next week around a couple of the programmable storage Market ideas that might be worthwhile going to and talking to people about um if you scroll to the right of this table there's folks inside PL and fem um that are happy to talk to you about these ideas and want to learn more about how you want to tackle them we have resources that we've linked to so that you can attempt to brainstorm or learn more about these Concepts and what underpins them and keep your eyes peeled the workshops are going to definitely drive more content more material away um that'll help you figure out how and what to build in those particular categories so June 8th as uh in parts of the next gonna be critical for that so yeah is June 8th Monday I can't I can't remember if June 8th is is that uh uh Monday no it's a bit later than that I think this there's also some workshops if you go to the east Global site and look through the schedule there's also a series of workshops on Monday so I'll be doing a workshop on um you know on building there my colleague Zach will be doing a workshop I believe as well so there's a number of workshops as well so keep an eye on the um schedule there now just to quickly kind of cover as well uh there's a number of other projects as well within protocol Labs also have bounties so for example uh just quickly touching on a few of these bakayow which is a computer of a data platform uh so they have a prize pool as well and uh some examples there of projects around decentralized compute filecoin Saturn is a decentralized Content delivery Network and they have a prize pool there as well regarding applications that build upon their decentralized um uh distribution Network interplanatory consensus I just mentioned that that is a scalability horizontal scalability uh for falcoin and they have some prizes there as well ipfs of course which is where all of this kind of started so ipfs have some prizes there as well so if you're using ipfs or you are um you know improving what's going on within ipfs there's that there lit P2P many people might not realize lib P2P is a library that underpins a lot of these decentralized systems and even other networks as well I believe I think of ethereum 2 and Salon I think both use lib P to be underneath uh for how their nodes actually communicate with each other um so they they actually have some prizes there as well um just looking here within here for other PL ones oh Falcon data tools uh falcoin data tools you might have heard of a project called Estuary which is an aggregator farcoin data tools is uh the next generation of the tooling behind what will become Estuary version two and uh I will be doing some examples of some of that on Monday as well for how you can do aggregation from fvm nft storage and web3 storage are also aggregators also part of um or spun off from protocol Labs as well and uh they specifically work with what nft storage as the name might suggest also specifically works with um nfts um but they have a bunch of prizes there as well uh oh d-rand derand uh so dran distributed Randomness one last one uh from within PL and so uh this is a Randomness uh beacon on the network that allows you to access uh random numbers in a verifiable manner as well uh on the network so um this is a functionality is often included or provided by tools um like uh chain link I believe or or one of them uh while drand is one that provides native um a verifiable Randomness on the Falcon Network so you can use that so there you go that's a a quick rundown to hopefully give you some ideas of what to build there is lots of prizes there there's lots of projects there you know please feel free to build stuff that uses multiple different Technologies both from within protocol labs and within all of our partners there if you go through there there's a whole series of prizes there a whole load of Partners there so please feel free to kind of uh join these together and I really look forward to seeing what you build um and I'm going to be hanging out in Discord as well as well as some of my uh some of my colleagues from the from the devrel team specifically um so Sarah who you heard from just now and also my colleague Zach like I said we'll be doing some workshops next week as well so keep in tune with that anything else to cover Eddie no I think I think uh just uh just have a lot of fun building we're really excited to see what you guys create um and uh and there's a lot of really cool things to build across PL and with an sem yeah okay thanks a lot all I think that's uh I think that's us thanks Matt thanks Audi this was uh really cool and uh I kind of loved uh this being a work session and a talk and everything else because this really is effectively going through everything one by line and talking about all the opportunities so I really appreciate you taking the time and uh telling us about all the things people can do
