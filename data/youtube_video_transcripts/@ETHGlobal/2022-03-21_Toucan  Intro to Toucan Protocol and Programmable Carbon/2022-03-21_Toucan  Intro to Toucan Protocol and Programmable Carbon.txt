great so welcome again um to our workshop on intro into the toucan protocol with alex here alex will be given an intro on the ecosystem and how the protocol works feel free to ask any questions in the meantime in the chat and we will take questions at the end also alex i'll let you take the stage awesome so hey there guys everybody i'm alex um and let's first like kind of explain to you guys and show you guys how to con works i'm not sure how how familiar everyone is uh first off with like just traditional carbon credits um could you guys just say like yeah we're familiar we're not in the chat if nobody answers i'm obviously gonna assume nobody is familiar okay so just a little bit okay i guess i should explain them quickly so the idea is that there are different projects um in the world where like people this is very roughly and very simply like explanation for dummies where people plant trees or do different things to either offset or capture carbon from the atmosphere and then these projects get verified by institutions like vera and they create these certificates which can then be sold on a traditional markets over the counter and what we do at two gun is we take these uh carbon credits or that are off chain people are supposed to retire them we verify that they are retired so when you retire something it means you've basically canceled it there's no more trading it's gone forever right and we want to take them on chain where they are far more liquid it's not just over the counter anymore now it's all on chain and it's much easier to trade them or to exchange them for different um like pools which are then much more liquid and let me just show you kind of how you would do that in the test and you can actually play with this yourself you can go here uh test.gun.art and you can play with this yourself so let's launch the app you're gonna need to have a metamask wallet like i do right here you have to connect your wallet this is actually only on polygon and on one base so the test tukon that earth is um on mombay and then the main net is uh polygon um and the reason why we chose polygon is because it actually uses a lot less electricity it's a lot it's a lot more efficient and such emits much less you do when you do your main net we're actually working with some teams to establish exactly how much uh co2 is emitted per transactions but that's kind of a different discussion this is once you connect your wallet the dashboard that you're gonna see in the main two gun app and you can see different stats like how much the co2 was bridged up until now but basically what you would do is you would initiate bridging as a normal user i mean you would pick your provider you can see we only have there alvarez the only institution that we work with right now but we are indeed planning to bring other institutions and registries so that people can um bridge credits from a bunch of other places obviously you're going to see that you have access to the registry because you actually as i said you have to go to the app of your registry so to the app and vera and you have to retire um your off chain credits once that's done you confirm this transaction and you will go through this process which essentially as i said it verifies that you've actually offs uh retired that um certificate off chain and then once this is done you will have um [Music] credits right here you will see in a second you are going to see in here that you have your serial uh you can't really see it because of the chat just a second um just a second okay now and basically whenever you get a um carbon certificate you will have a serial number that looks like these ones right here that i've used previously um [Music] i don't have one right now and it would take me a second to get one but i can show you how you could get one in the test network you would go to this link right here which i'm actually going to put in the chat and in here you can actually use this to graph to get a lot of data about all sorts of batch tokens and things but you can use this sub graph to get um serial numbers like these ones and to use that to actually bridge like fake projects and get pco2 this is one way you can get this co2 but what i've actually done and i think it'd be super useful for you guys which are hacking is i made a faucet here because um one thing that you should take into account is that obviously these serial numbers and whether they are retired or not are actually manually uh verified for now by third parties uh we aim to change that in the future but you can go to this faucet right here and once you connect your wallet right here you can get different tco2s you can get bct and nct as well we're going to explain vcdnst in a moment so this would be the process that the normal user uh uses but another thing um now obviously you guys are going to actually use mumbai so you're probably not going to use sushi on mumbai to swap but a lot of our users actually don't retire their own pco2 crazy but instead go to sushi to get bct and nct and then use that to get the co2 or whatever they have to do so once you put in just to kind of get back on track once you put in your serial number you confirm the cereals and then you're gonna have to wait for it might be a few hours it might be a few days even sometimes that's why i made the decision to faucet to get your tco2 bridged once it's bridged you're gonna see in here these things as i have them and exactly which balances you have of which and you can click on add to wallet to import the [Music] token to your wallet i already have it imported and that's how the normal user would uh bridge something now are there any questions about bridging or about how you guys would do it in a test environment hi alex hello i have a general question i i don't understand the purpose um when you i understood what is the carbon cruising market and that why i would want to retire some credits can you quickly introduce the process why we are doing that so why are you retiring tc like carbon to retire it or why are you retiring it to bridge it um the the first one i mean i'm a user i can get some uh some carbon credits why i would like that to retire um basically it's uh it's to help the environment right just to help uh clean up the air because every kilogram or ton of co2 that you retire is uh basically just offset from the earth atmosphere there's a project somewhere uh that as i said planted some trees that has done something to otherwise offset or cut or capture co2 from the air they created this verified project you can trade it that doesn't really help the climate but once you do retire it it's basically like you removed that amount of co2 and you paid to remove that amount of co2 okay and essentially yeah yeah then if i get some carbon credits i have two options once i can trade them in uh or i can retire retire them that is my decision okay understood so a lot of companies because you might want to ask why does a company even or somebody even want to retire um their carbon tokens you want to retire them if your individual and you care about the climate change obviously like for example i want to calculate i want to make a calculator this is like a personal project of mine that i want to do i want to calculate how much um co2 my car emits and when i want to retire it every year i think that would be pretty cool because you know if you care about climate change that's helpful and companies in general especially like corporate companies they want to retire for pr right i mean that's just the way it is but if they can show hey we have for example this private airplane that we have used and we have emitted x amount of tons of co2 but we have offset this amount it's just good br for them any further questions with what we've explained up until now okay so if that's good then if you as i said really just bridged your tco2 now you will have these projects right here just like i have them and what you can do obviously you can offset them or retire them right here this means they're gone and it just helps the climate but another thing that you can do is you can go right here and you can redeem a deposit your tco2 into a pool like bct and nc tv store offered by us they do have certain requirements um so for example bcd has these pool criteria it has to be a vcs it has to have gold standard it has to be a project from 2008 or newer and you can put for example 10 dcl2s you have to approve it first obviously you can pick a different tco2 if you want to use a different dc like if you have multiple ones but generally speaking like as a normal user you would like to put in the lowest quality dch that you have that fits the criteria of the um of the pool right once this is approved you can deposit the pco2 and then you will receive um base carbon on the token like the obesity um and it's going to hold like the actual pull contract is going to hold the pco2 in it so you can actually at a later date if you have um tco2 you can come or no wait if you have bcd you can click here on redeem tc02 and what it's going to do you're going to basically give bcd and you're going to get back tco2 now there's two ways to do that you can use the automatic redemption method which essentially means that the bct pool is going to give you back the lowest quality tco2 that it has in it um this is free there's no fees for this if you want to select what this you do is you want to receive from the pool from what's available in the pool then this is actually going to cost you 25 so you're not going to give one bcd and get one dc2 you're going to give one vct and you're going to get back 0.75 pc of and this is how you would um exchange your bcd for tcd now you're probably wondering okay why do we need bct or nct i'm thinking you probably think that well there's um like these dco2s these projects now they're on chain they are definitely more tradable than when they were off chain and it was a piece of paper and they had to do it over the counter yes they are more tradable and more liquid but they're still all different like this one is from 2018 this one is from 2014 they're all different they're not exactly easily exchangeable and tradable but once you put them in a pool that has certain criteria what essentially will happen is that pool this is why we have different pools for example the nct one as you can see has criteria to be 2012 and newer and it includes certain methodologies which are explained right here but essentially what a pool does is it collects a bunch of pco2 that are similar and then it gives you back that full token and now essentially this is so much more liquid i'm not sure if that's clear but i can kind of try to re-explain it are you guys understanding why we need pools and why they're good sorry alex for taking again the conversation but exactly if i have 10 co2 carbon credits and they are my carbon credits i deposit in obesity and afterwards everything from obesity what's what i win with what is what would i do that yeah so let me just so basically because bct is a pool that collects from a bunch of pco2s that are similar it's essentially more liquid and for example it could be used in different d5 protocols it's much easier to trade it it's much easier to extend it because it's all the same right it's it's got the same criteria and that is just yeah lick is the perfect word it's much more liquid okay it's a kind of we we wrap our carbon credits in a kind of tradable token yeah that's a good okay that's a very good explanation um and it's basically like a lot of projects because i know you guys want to hack on top of what we build like we have projects that for example take bct or nct and they bind it to an ft or they take it and they use it to trade something or they you know i mean there's different things you can do like that i think i even talked to a team that wanted to do something like some sort of a d5 protocol where you could like take a loan based on nct so there's all sorts of things you can build on top of bct and nct um that you couldn't really build on tco2s because they do have different great like different attributes and they're more unique and not as easily exchangeable with each other um this is pretty much what the main token app has to offer you either bridge tc02 you can offset it retire it you help the climate or you can exchange it for bcd that's far more liquid and then you can do other stuff with it uh let me show you guys sushi because you can actually go to sushi and you can exchange um let me just move over to polygon to the main net um if you want to work with sushi uh in your like projects for this hackathon you will have to actually fork uh the polygon main net you cannot work with mumbai because sushi doesn't have their um their contracts on mumbai but basically you can actually exchange usdc [Music] for either bct or nct if you want to do that now obviously if you guys want to use the mumbai to mumbai to build something as i said you can use the faucet that's probably easier for you but you know you can always go to sushi and exchange bcd you know usdc for bcd let me see if i can find it yep right here so you can just go here you can exchange it or you can actually do it programmatically too and this is why i wanted to kind of show you guys this example implementations repo right here uh let me actually put it in the chat too in here you will see this contract that i've made um that basically it abstracts a lot of the process to offset tcl2 so normally as i've just shown you to get the co2 you either have to bridge it so you would have to have an off chain contract or you have to go get usdc from kraken or whatever you're going to use then you have to take that and go to sushi and exchange that for uh bct or nct you would have to come back into our app exchange that for tco2 then you would have to retire it a lot of steps as you can see so i've made this contract um as an example but it's actually going to be used in production pretty soon too where basically you have this auto offset method that takes in your usbc and programmatically redeems it for bct ncp and then retires the tco2 and you can guys you can like take a look at it and see an examples like of how i uh used sushi to swap for bcd of how you would interact like on chain with um redeeming and with retiring because there's different functions that you can use there's also right here in the readme an explanation of like the main functions and how they work so i think this would be a pretty good inspiration for you guys to use in your projects um yeah this should be it i guess i can also show you like the contract opposite there's another little piece of inspiration but if you do have any questions about like the repo or about sushi go ahead and ask me and then i'll present you the contract officer because nobody has any questions about this so far so this is a contract officer i have presented at e denver actually too and what it does it uses the polygon scan api to look at all your transactions and then it calculates on the front end how much dco2 you have used uh previously and then you can use um our contracts to retire it so let's move back to polygon bay let's connect my wallet because this is actually on monday because it's not using sushi you can load your transactions and you can see you have all my transactions right here and the ones that it says through it means i've already offset them and the ones that it says false it means i haven't offset them yet and it tells me right here how much gas i've ever used it tells me how much i have previously offset because i have used this app before it tells me how much it would cost in kilograms of co2 um to offset these false transactions that are not offset and here how much it would cost in actually dco2 because tca2 is actually one pco2 equals one ton of carbon from the air and basically you would just you would just go to the process of depositing either tcl2 or bct if you deposit bcp you can redeem it right here for other pco2 and then you'd come to the dashboard load your transactions and click what tco do you want to use and offset it um i'm not sure how good we are on time but obviously this is not super amazingly hard so i don't think we should just wait for like the transactions to happen just to not waste time but it's a fairly basic dap and if you guys have any questions i can answer them but if you have no questions otherwise i would love for you guys we have a few more mins okay can you plug this into a smart contract tracking on chain transaction from a smart when someone else has deployed um so we've actually talked about how you could track on-chain transactions from a smart contract um pre-denver it's complicated you can do it but it's pretty complicated and we just completely left that idea behind because we felt like tracking transactions is far easier off chain when they're already done but yeah technically you can so since we have a few more minutes if you guys have like any questions about what i've presented so far or if you guys have any ideas of what you would like to build on top of us i can just help you give you some guidance hi alex javier here again um to understand exactly what you show us in your app actually you are scanning all transactions for an account you are putting this transaction in a database and then you are telling him how much it will cost to up offset all of the energy that he has used for these transactions yes and it's here with him then you update your database and the next time it will show that he has less transactions to redeem um like the concept that is is perfectly right but actually what i have done for that project is to store the last nonce of the offset transaction on chain so it couldn't be changed by a centralized database so everything that you said is correct but we don't store what was offset in the database we store what was offset on jane okay correct okay thank you yeah so if there are no questions like i'm just going to throw a few ideas out there of cool things that you can build with what i've presented so far as i said we have could you just explain what you mean by off change and on chain again um like carbon credits how they are off-chain versus option versus off chain transactions oh about the app okay um so basically you see that these are all false whereas these are true so obviously you have to store somewhere that these have been offset and these haven't been offset one way you could have done that is if you had like a centralized sql database which stores hey transaction with the nonce of 919 or 918 for this address has been offset or not you could do that in a normal traditional database or you could do it uh on chain in the blockchain um let me see because i actually have the contract for that app because it's a different contract i think it should be somewhere in my repos right here eco1 this is it contracts contract officer this is it basically and i think i'm actually going to find it in the poc is the poc okay so this is like what i the contract this is precisely the contract behind this app and basically um let me see if i can find last offset so it's not this one is it this other one okay forgive me guys okay yeah it's this one actually um so right here basically as i said yeah you could store which transaction was offset or not in a database or you could store it on chain in this contract so this contract right here with this mapping last offset nonce remembers hey 918 is the last um transaction that has been offset and so these above since they are newer they're not offset yet and these below are offset and that's how we remember which are offset or not offset in this particular uh project you could do it in a database but i felt it's more web free if i store it on chain i thought that's that's cooler right as their gas piece for tracking all the data on chain um so basically any view method that you call where you only read data is completely free any day any like method where you input data or state or change something in the blockchain is paid so there will be no gas fees whenever i click for example here on let me connect my wallet back again whenever i click on load my transactions there are zero fees for doing this when i wanna deposit when i wanna offset when i wanna redeem there are fees for that there are gas keys for them that's great alex uh thanks for the session and if there's any more questions feel free to follow up over discord it's a sponsor toucan and that's where you'll find alex as well thanks everybody have a the ideas oh oh yeah uh you know what since we have we don't have a lot of time let's take this to the discord chat i'm available there during european afternoons and evenings great thanks
