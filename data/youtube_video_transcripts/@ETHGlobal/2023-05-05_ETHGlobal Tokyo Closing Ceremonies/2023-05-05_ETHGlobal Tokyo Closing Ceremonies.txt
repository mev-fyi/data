foreign [Music] Tokyo how's it going [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] are you all excited good afternoon everybody and welcome to the clothing ceremony for eth Global Tokyo my name is cartigma the co-founders of Heath Global and can't wait to get this started this event has been phenomenal for the next one and a half hours we're going to be making you clap a lot and I can just see this room behind me back so I hope you can hear me in the back 1500 attendees are here in this building out of which almost 100 of them have been hacking for the last 36 hours and they're here from 59 different countries and the best part of it all is that 35 of them are brand new to wipe three these are existing Engineers trying to understand what's possible in crypto 400 of these are Japanese and 70 of everybody in this room is from Asia this is amazing give yourselves a big round of applause our biggest and our first event in Israel now this is not a conference this whole event is a hackathon and that means if you're any youth Global events that is a weekend hackathon we care about onboarding developers into this ecosystem and we do this by focusing on three key things I want to bring all Builders together our goal is to help you learn get help and grow and upskill yourselves and we really believe that showing is more important than telling which means that everything we're going to see today is going to be a live demo and not just a PowerPoint so let's go back to the hackathon I know all of you have been super tired from working on Amazing projects and I'm super excited to announce that after submissions were due we had 311 amazing projects that came out of this event that is absolutely mind-blowing that is a lot of projects in this space and organ gonna showcase some of them just in a few minutes before we get to all of that I want to give a few things to a lot of the people that made all this possible most importantly all of our judges who have been looking at hundreds of products over the last four or five hours giving all of you feedback giving all of you pointers on to how to make this better how do you take this to the next level and just helping you improve and make this more successful post this weekend so please give a big round of applause to all of our amazing judges I want to thank Ken Vera's Edison the man Richard James Joanne John Jeff Tom lasse Makoto Windra Jack Masa some old lionstani Austin Paris and so my heroes they've been incredible here talking to all of you and we can't thank them enough for all of this more importantly oh there's more Chris Jade Madeline for a second you know I was so surprised this is not 28 but more importantly uh 38 incredible partners that are here that are giving all these amazing prizes and have made this event possible so we're going to keep clapping and the faster you Clap the faster I'll try to say all these names so without further Ado let's roll one is metamask no to say psycho polygon toku Mina World coin that's quarter value sack falcoinum hobby Great South Grove great savior Foundation the graphs and hyperlane superfluided Max Junior small Foundation hudlow One Secured Finance quick note buns lit mask roll battle push protocol resend neep light beer sismo and pawn stab all these amazing partners are here I'm gonna be talking about all the prizes that you're going to win from each of these companies so let's go back to the 311 projects 9am all these projects were submitted from 9 30 till 1 pm we looked and judged all of these projects here in this floor and also upstairs from this we came up with 11 finalist teams what's going to happen now is that these teams are going to come on stage and they're going to demo what they built to all of you and we're going to see some really cool things that we're excited about is some interesting and impressive trends that we're going to see and we have been seeing in this space there's going to be a lot of interesting and recurring themes that we probably saw a lot of workshops on today or over the weekend uh and people talked about and just ideas that were discussed so we're gonna get all of that going and without further Ado when I announce all of our 11 finalists so please give a big round of applause to our 11 teams pop boarding ZK Voice key bailout aop app octo floor or Minot probably nothing now works Tanuki Euro and super play all 11 of these scenes will come on one by one and demo what they built now before we get to our very first demo I want to take a quick second to thank 300 amazing teams here I'll move out of the way so you can take a photo just because you were not one of these 11 teams it does not mean we're not good enough it does not mean there was something wrong our goal with the judging process was to highlight really awesome and interesting themes there's more interesting ideas and projects that everybody was excited about in this space especially our judges and we really want to make sure that all of you are not discouraged from working on your project after today and we are here to help we are able to help you connect with anybody you want to know or get feedback or just be introduced to anybody whether it's our judges or some Mentor or some other person in this ecosystem uh please uh take the time to reach out to us and ask for any help that you need and we'll be able to make sure that we can get you there on top of all of that uh this is being live streamed So for anybody joining us online or if you're on your phones you can head over to youth global.com showcase and see all 311 of these projects now they're all public and you can check out everything you're going to see here and a lot more about how they built it why they built it and their source code so I'm gonna stop talking let's get our very first demo for this afternoon please welcome introduce yourself hey everyone I'm Zach I'm Mia and we built palmboarding pom stands for proof of membership protocol and our goal is to allow any community of any size to be able to decentralize themselves without having to rely on any centralized Authority yeah let's get started you'll notice right off the gate that we're using email for authentication over connect wallet behind the scenes this is generated an ethereum address awesome it just verified that I don't belong to a specific community and now I'm going through the onboarding flow sweet as you can tell uh this is in in a tieform format so it's very easy for anyone who doesn't have uh you know crypto background to still be able to onboard their community and right now the emails that are being written here it looks like you're just inviting other admins um to this platform but in the background we're actually creating a multisig for this community yep and with that multisig you have some basic permissions on top including who to allow to add or remove members after the multi-6 made and how do you add other admins to the platform our default is majority approval sweet and onboarding is really the main focus we had for the hackathon um right now as I've finished up a multi-sig was created with me as the sole owner on safe core and there are two unconfirmed admins that are able to join the platform as the admins join I will get a notification through push and then be able to come back to the platform in order to onboard them too I wanted to create an experience that would allow anyone um especially those who are in the web 2 ecosystem to be able to onboard into web 3 again without any crypto knowledge so that we can onboard the next billion communities onto ethereum and other web 3 ecosystems thank you amazing thank you for our very first demo next up on my right is ZK Voice key so please give the Zeke whiskey team a big round of applause hello everybody so we would like to introduce Jacob broski it allows you to create a unique Instagram account just using your voice so it is very useful for values kind of key problems of Italian so when we use it for the key liquid system if you even if you lose your private key and you don't have social recovery and you don't have any sphere private key you can recover this one using your voice using your voice and when we use it for the on-chen 2 Factory authentication the smart contract will require you to or speak some or special words away you when you do some special or action on channel for example transforming a large amount of issue so in this model basically we have a registration process and authentication process in the registration a user generates a hash value derived from the user's voice and store it on on the Siam production and in the authentication process I use replace that it's a user knows the boy status which corresponding which is corresponding to the published hash value so in more detail it has three technical features first it extracts speakers feature vectors from from your voice using machine learnings and second we use Stillness plus to protect the privacy of this authentication process because if you rebuild the old data in this authentication your voice feature will be revealed to the public so we have to protect this privacy or using gkp and third a basically the voice theater at the humans theater unlike or stator is valuable even for the same person so our system can't sell this noise this noise of data using Transit commitment so even if your browse has some errors from the reference status which I extract we can extract the same hash value using plastic commitments so let's show your demo okay thank you everyone I'm really honored to stand here and let me do that quick demo so this is our application so what we have to do to a recover the key is first we should record uh the register our voice okay so what you have to do is to just to talk to this UI okay we only have five seconds so watch out I uh the sun is shining and the words are signed uh singing oh I'm Escape okay so from my mistaken voice uh commitment was created and after that uh metamask should open what's up wow okay so metamask should open but not opening okay so when we recover the oh okay where we recover the uh address what we have to do is to yeah okay let's think that both be I'm bored but I or got the secret ethereum address key so yeah I have to recover so what I have to do here we can try again it's okay let's just do let's start from again beginning yeah okay let's try to get it working let's start uh the sun is shining and the birds are singing okay thank you oh I was really upgrade okay so yeah uh now it's sent to ethereum and have to wait and I cannot wait so I will speed up okay got it so now that I avoid this releases okay but now next is the important okay we switch to Bob oh no no before that okay now I'm not I'm not the owner okay I forgot to address but uh so I'm not the owner of this address but the commitment exists so this is not the voice feature value itself but kind of past and commitment so it's safe to save this online and this is saved on chain okay so let's start to recover and what I have to do is to speak again the sun is shining and the birds are sinking okay hope it works well okay so uh yeah this is the commitment that's deployed on the uh on chain and this is the recovered so from The Voice I could recover the commitment so and uh actually it's created zkp but it takes five or ten minutes so yeah this time I will skip doing this and now I could just I succeeded to recover and I am the owner of this contract address yeah for the demo that's it thank you awesome I can't wait to see 50 more interesting use cases of of this I think there's a couple more please thank you everyone next up we have our third demo and that is Project bailout please give a big round of applause hey guys I'm I'm James uh we are bailout uh we build our wooly security pipeline between eoa Smart Control bullet and cold wallet and the two fa uh smart contract fluid which can be signed by eoa and Google account and using bailout you can use metamask mainly and put your main asset on Smart contract fluid and eject your asset all asset to call the wallet with a single button when something happens like uh like losing your private keys or devices okay so let me take a demo uh first you can see your UA address and balances here and there are civil setup panels below and the social recovery setup is a country a bit hard-coded okay let's go so now place the 2fs and up button and signing with your Google account and then execute our lead action to mean the lead protocol pkps to uh to your MPC wallet and signing to create a smart contract wallet and set up the eoa address and uh NPC wallet as in sinus and wait a moment and check the address yeah he's waiting yeah same again he's trying my game yeah now that contract will be deployed and this is your contract light it's sitting that 2fa uh signed by your Google account and UA account and then Now setting up the Google social recovery so set that contract bullet and deploying your lead action to ipfs and then you should set up your publication ID for lead uh lens protocol for the social recovery and set your social recovery address to the evacuated by your smart contract wallet and set up the social recovery and switch to the network enzyme it also meeting the elite pkvs and and set up the your social recovery address and other status on the smart contract and check the status okay this is your social recovery address and approval address and social recovery Escape address sitting on the contract and then you should send some money for gaspi to the your social recovery approval and this is your social recovery workout this is that now plus is zero and execute the social recovery one click and this execute function can be uh executed by any other wallet address without the godspeeds wait okay so the balance of the smart contract let is transferred to the your social recovery without this thank you and this is your smartphone track work address and the biasis now zero and the social recovery functional it was executed that's all thank you guys amazing thank you all right next up is Aoki app nft and we're gonna go with a translation here so this one will be a slightly long demo but trust me it'll be worth it so without further Ado let's welcome everybody on stage hello hey I'm Aoki I've introduced my project Aoki app NFD in recent years a generative nft become very popular in particular a nft with stacking layers of mainstream but this I think this is not technically challenging I think once nft is a technical challenge but on saying NFD has many gas costs so and so the way of expression will limit it so I propose a and so I propose a image compression method based on principal component analysis and applied our knowledge of linear algebra and and compress aubergine jpeg and the nft the vector is become sft so user can buy a picture experience so is it let's go demo follow it so I'll try my best to translate so what she's doing right now is prior to that she actually took 15 000 selfie images as a kind of sample data and based on that she run the python basic compression mechanism to uh compress it into 32 different elements and based on that you can basically manufacture uh 256 powered by 32 element which is almost infinite number of expression so what she's doing right now in the fourth element is just showing the different wearable lighting but all can be expressed as part of nft and in this second one is actually showing each kind of toggle of the Solitude Elements which you can kind of toggle to all the way to 256. so not only just the uh lighting she can also make some expression changes like you know blinking and okay like it's it's not like she can't open Mouse and stuff but like you can do more subtle expression changes or be as a generality nft this is eye blinking parameter amazing being able to represent all of that directly on chain as compressed vectors that's just awesome and this is on mainnet um or on on chain not on there twos so please give another round of applause to that project and next up we have oxoflower so please welcome them on stage hello everyone how many of you are new to web3 please raise your hand quickly so why I think it looks like everyone is experiencing that anyway so uh we built an AI power blockchain Explorer with human readable answers go off to plug so um block query Made Easy he's our lovely slogan so I'm sure that you in webto you probably heard of you know uh that people usually say in the data is actually over there on the blockchain everybody can see but have you ever wondered how easy or how difficult it is to actually query multiple data simultaneously on the blockchain where the tutorial polygon the answer is actually very difficult right so we have built a natural language query powered by chat tvt and uh we basically put the results in really comprehensible format that very easy for human to understand so we'll go over the technology architecture so the the kind of magic that's behind all this is two layers of llms um and so the first layer is an agent layer and the role of the agent layer really is to from a natural language query decide which llm to use and so the second layer is basically a bunch of models and we've supported lens protocol and air stack in in our kind of MVP here today and basically you can accept any number of different llms whose job is to translate a natural language query into a graphql query and so you can imagine that since as a community we've kind of adopted graphql as a very common protocol that we can go and plug this in to many many more models that are all trained to generate graphql queries based on certain schemas and the agent will help us decide kind of which one to use given a certain natural language input um and so there's also a second layer where we have a renderer and because we don't really know exactly what the query is going to return us we actually have to go and build out a mapping of all the entities that are possible and build a renderer on the front end to just side okay this is actually the day that we've gotten this is how we want to show it to the user and so we'll go into our demo now okay so the first query that we will do okay let's go with the yeah show me the nft pictures on ethereum held by Paradigm dot is please so this takes a bit of time because there's again there's these three big steps so the first thing that happens is that you have the agent that looks at this query and says okay which model should I use then it forwards along that query with a bunch of other information in order to actually generate the graphql query and lastly we actually make the graphical request to the graphql API and generate and get the response back that you can see here you can see this is all the images owned by paradigm.e so find interesting collection of image now let's go to our second query um which is this time we'll deal with collection stats so we'll basically we want to fight down the aggregate collection start in monthly sales monthly volume also in the width for the currency nft collection it was a very famous piece made by Damian host very well well-known artist in also in web 2 web 3 will the collection address is so as you can see now we can actually see the chat here on the vertical axis is the average sales price in usdc and on the horizontal axis is actually the progression of the price right since the main thing of the collection until the present day so it hasn't been doing so well because you know we're in the bear market right and you can actually also see the table here for all the raw data that we put in nicely format and we can actually send this via push very easy to do um so we've sent it to my teammate now wallet address right there so he will input it in send the message and yeah it will arrive to his wallet after we approve this transaction it's just as easy as that thanks to our sponsor two and next let's look at the third query uh find the top top 10 lens profile and then return the ID the handle the name and the number of followers sorted by the number of followed number of followers basically so yeah so in this actual bottom component that you see here what we're actually doing is it's actually the same component that we're using and all it's doing is it's actually looking at the response that we get parsing it and deciding how to render it so then as you can see the chat he's uh and the table is probably easier to see here lens protocol is obviously number one on there standing is number two with 85 000 followers very popular and you know the top 10 so as you can see and now let's um switch back so that was our brief demo uh quickly talk about the tech stack that we view we mainly use a lot of Open Source uh libraries and software activity launching react.js but we actually explicitly would like to thank our sponsor for uh push protocol for enabling the messaging airstack and lens protocol without them obviously we wouldn't have the data to show and then some of our roadmaps that I would like to talk about on this 36 out there's only so much that we can do right but ideally in the future we would love to gather more training data to improve the model accuracy and then um expand the use cases and also adding in aggregation so you can actually do a lot of interesting maths like some averages improve visualization and result in a dynamic way and then expand more data sources as well to multiple different protocols and then responding and go to market and make it happen so we actually um and this is a team that make it happen we have a product designer Andre who unfortunately not here at the moment the smart contract developer Felix although they might sell on the product manager uh only c key and Wilson low are two expert full stack developer so we hope to with this symbol yet easy to use I have to be able to help one board webpray user who are new to the web3 sphere but also would be useful for data gigs who love to explore data with the web 3 journey and that's it thank you awesome blockchain and AI have finally started to merge together that's going to be fun all right next up is Project Minot it's going to be a really cool Hardware hack so we're gonna have to spend 30 more seconds on a little bit more setup and then we'll have the camera zoom in when we get to the hardware part please give them a big round of applause um hi everyone my name is Dan and I'm here with my teammates and good friends hideyoshi and hiroyuki today I would like to share a hackathon project called minor I'd like to open to the question um what if we told you that more than 60 to 70 percent of the Japanese residents already have a hardware wallet the answer is yes it's true they just don't know it yet so minorizo project and Miner is a browser wallet specifically for Japanese residents that lets them use the government issued ID as a hardware wallet to send and receive crypto payments so this is a Japanese government issued ID it's called the my number card as you can see it's an ID card issued to all Japanese residents including children and foreigners storing the information you see here like name address birthday gender and a unique 12-digit individual number the main number cards have an IC chip in them and as of today they've been issued over 80 million people in Japan which represents over 64 of the population the main use case right now is limited to identity verification but going forwards additional use cases are going to be added by the government including the phasing out of the health insurance card and driver's license which will eventually be integrated into these main number cards so our mission with Mina is to drive mainstream adoption over a pre-tech in Japan by enabling the Japanese government and residents and connecting them with developers across the world the problem we're aiming to solve is private Key Management as you know it's very difficult to write down your seed phrase and keep them safe even for the most sophisticated users Hardware wallets as well are relatively expensive and have a steep learning curve making it very unrealistic for them to be used by most people especially here in Japan which is which has the world's oldest population our solution is the minor browser wallet and this enables Japanese residents to use their mind number card like Hardware wallet giving them a simple and safe way to self-custody their crypto and send and receive payments with just a few tabs of their card we also use the count abstraction to generate erc4337 compliant contract wallets for each main number card enabling features such as social recovery so before I pass it on to the demo if you could imagine a situation where any child or elderly person can receive nfts with a simple few tabs of there my name is card and with that I'll pass it on to the demo thank you Dawson uh I'm gonna show uh how to use the our word let me see okay uh so this is our brother word and I always say uh this uh my number card is uh and you see any of the communication using field communication so we need a NHC leader so but I don't have time I didn't have time to buy initial code reader so I turned my Android phone to in the browser I I'm going to connect this connect to this uh Android reader beer web built this so okay iPhone then I uh connecting okay now the uh this browser and uh NSE reader has been connected so then uh I'm going to generate the wallet actually the account obstruction word by one tap so let me so I'm going to type the this uh Japanese government issued ID card so then uh others is created and actually this is uh this address is generated by account obstruction so uh this uh other account has not been deployed onto the smart contract uh blockchain but uh you can send the uh ether or other energy assets uh to this uh conduct address so and also I the cost here so and just uh connect again then just by having the code then I generated the other uh word that is actually the the thank you very much it's awesome yeah okay uh actually this account of absorption word has been uh developed and then I sent some is here actually the market here yeah and then could you please explain the oh sorry okay and uh let me quickly uh talk about it technology uh we use the ELC 4337 component contract wallet which box based on our system which are listened why I I uh LSA signature I will play is because uh my currently my my number card only supports LSA signatures because that only supports analysis in HR OS and uh we derived the account contract account address from the modules which is our part of the RSA public key and then when when verify the signature from the entry point to the contract wallet are we verify the RSS signature uh there this uh the idea is very simple but uh yeah uh we have a lot of use cases using this kind of uh and thank you and just to wrap up so um doing this hackathon we built a browser wallet uh where um users could send and receive crypto payments um post hackathon we plan to build a browser extension where users will be able to not only send and receive payments but to be able to connect to webtrade apps as well um thank you for your time and we'd love to hear feedback if possible so please reach out to us thank you amazing how cool was that this is like a really amazing real world application congratulations all right next up is probably nothing that works give them a big round of applause and let them tell you what they built yeah I'm not brave enough to do a hardware demo live so uh hi everyone my name is Jason and I'm from probably nothing works hi everyone I'm Akira hi I'm Ray hey and I'm Alan and we're going to talk to you today about permissionless ads protocol back to Jason and I'll begin with a little bit introduction or background about what is advertising and who the players are just so that you can set the stage uh on the on the left side we have advertisers so Adidas on the right side we have in the industry what we call a publisher in this case yoga labs and then the community in this case board ape holders and the our pre-initious protocol basically matches the advertisers who want to reach your community and then Publishers who want to bring interesting messages to their Community as a way to kind of sustain themselves uh showing kind of our archetype of how we do this is everything starts on the lower left with a transaction so you we because it's permissionless so you can buy sell ads campaigns all on train we have a calf function that observes the order and then once it observes it it means nft that represents the what we call inventory or the campaign it displays it and then we for this bigger than we'll take the data back to Google ads manager for reporting which will show so we'll begin with a quick demo of what probably nothing that works looks like and as you can see it is just a very random or website with ads on it and to prove that the ads work you can see that we've basically pre-populated with some random stuff so that it's a live we're working at are we banned for the YouTube ad so now I will show you as a community how you can offer a collab and I'll begin to show our three contracts and try to Mint a ad unit the two the two contracts we have are ad units which is how communities say I want to offer a cold app and then a campaign is however they say hey I want to work with you on this cold app okay so he's jumping over and showing now that there's some history of campaigns that got created and then we're going to be doing some minting inside of uh inside of ether etherscan this is deployed on symbolia as you can see we have a budget we have a cost per click we have a image we have a name etc etc so we've already pre-minted some campaigns because the campaigns on the on the ad server side uh take a little while to populate even the nft minting is of course um instant on on the blockchain but it takes a while to for the campaign to start so what we're showing here is creating some new inventory so he's creating something uh at one zero with size with some with some size parameters xxy with height and uh you're gonna did you submit it okay and then submit the transaction and then back on the back on the website at probably nothing that works that's a Dap so it's it's totally not interacting with the back end at all it just reads data from ethersjs to get the information from sepolia and then renders the ad so as soon as that transaction commits it'll it'll be live when the campaigns were minted we should also call out there's a few parameters basically what gets submitted is the the creative so it's a banner in this case a landing page URL uh price per click if you want to run a price per click campaign let's say 10 cents and a budget so so what we do is we we're taking um the total budget and uh collateralizing the campaign at that time into the into a vault and then based on some reporting which Jason will show you in a second uh is uh is is uh what we get what the the publisher of the ad inventory gets it's paid out from you just created this one in the lower left right that's correct so as you can see we just permissionlessly created a new advertising unit that people can click oh yeah okay and so now what he's showing is um one of the nice things that's built into this uh centralized execution of the ad server is Google's put a lot of uh resources into making sure the the clicks are are not fraudulent so it's simple resistant in that sense and um what he's showing here is that uh we can collect some click data from each of the ads that showed up and also it's optimizing revenue for the the owner of the the space where the ad runs to make sure that the the revenue is maximized so not it's for example if something has a very high price per click it doesn't mean it always runs if there's another campaign that's going to expire soon you might want to harvest that uh Revenue quickly before proceeding with a longer running higher paying clicks so that's all happened here and then the reporting data we periodically uh pull this data into an Oracle and then make the micropayments out to the advertisers sorry to the Publishers who are are displaying the ads complete to summarize it is a permission uh probably nothing that works is a permissionless advertising protocol we allow communities to monetize their own Assets in the future we can have Futures like moderation that tells them say I want this I don't want to do this and the whole point is to connect web to demand versus web3 communities or connect web to demand to web3 communities and then lastly because these as are actually nft right so they become a tokenized revenue streams what that means is is a eovarian asset and you can do all the very cool things you could do with D5 things for example fundraise what with them borrow land use them as collateral uh do an interest rate swap whatever it is you want and these things are obviously tradable highly liquid etc etc uh that's it for our demo thank you so much for your time awesome another amazing real-wheel application it's good all right all right a few more damage to go without further Ado let's welcome app swap X please give them a big round of applause hey all I am Mohit from app flap XT and I'm deep oh so we started this problem saying that smart contracts are passive scripts and if we were to build automations or top of account abstractions let's create a smart contract module and that's how we started building out app swap X which is a smart contract module that allows you to automate transactions based on price change of a token or time change I'll take it over the world to show you how the product works yeah so let me uh go through the contracts that we have so basically we are currently live on polygon chain and genosis magnet chain uh we are like live on some other chains as well uh for this uh demo like I would be like swapping my tokens from polygon to genosis uh and it will be going through it will be an automated uh smart contract process which will be like powered by galato and uh we will be like making the transfer of uh the assets and we'll be doing on-chain swaps on the like the target chain uh through like the connects and all that stuff so let me talk about like this is our polygons scan deployed contract uh the same kind of contract with some additional features happening employed on genosis so our contracts live on multiple chains uh and uh what I'm going to do is basically I will be creating a deposit so it's like you as the user who wants to like swap your usdc from polygon and you want to transfer it to the genosis chain uh to like uh the Geo yeah limit order on the geot gno token so what I will be doing like I have this create deposit I have like uh Auto uh like already print some of the values so what we have like if if you are transferring like any native token you have to pass it here then we have like this from address which is like from which address you want to transfer the money it can be your smartphone smart Wallet account address or your eua account address then we have like this two address where on the uh the target chain you want to receive the amount and then this is the amount that we want to Target this is like 0.5 usdc and uh then there is like the price so the price is basically at which price I want to do this swap on the target chain and I want to I transfer the assets from this and then this is like the prompt to address which is like the usdc address on polygon scan and this is like a two token address which is on Genesis chain uh so I would be just like quickly creating a deposit between some aggressive because the cost transition so let me wait for the transaction to happen the contractors trying to store the Expo data as well as how it needs to be sent from Source train as well as or the destination Jade where it will be interpreted by x3c yeah so this transaction that deposited confirmed what I will be doing is like I have this uh gelato ID which is triggered in the event I will be just searching for this gelato ID on the gelato Network so you can see uh this is like our execute limit order that is automatically created from on-chain Smart contract there is no nothing a server in between like we have no node.js server on any server it's directly from the smart contract that this is happening and you can see like there are some task logs So currently uh uh this is trying to execute but the price is not matching so this will not execute now what I will be doing basically I will be like forcing the price I had set the price of 82 000 uh so I will be just changing for Speed the price because actually we are getting the price from oracles trustless oracles but for like this demo I'm just forcing it to happen uh so that we can do this transaction quickly yeah so let's wait for galato to execute this process so all the functions are stored there so that it's transparent to the user how the Expo is going to be carried out and what proxy is given to gelato yeah I think by now the invitation shut up yeah so we have got the transaction hash which gelato has basically automatically uh executed and this transaction as you can see on the connects so if I just search this project thing so you can see like our transfer is happening from the polygon chain to the genosis chain and we already have like Bridge the assets from the uh the polygon token and if I yeah just copy this and like search on like logs how this is happening under the hood yeah so you can see like it is going from uni swap it is like finding the best path to execute that Swap and from uni swap to like it's our contract and then it is passing to the context diamond and then the gelato is basically executing this transaction I mean on automated way and we will soon receive that points on the uh Target scene so on yeah so our motive with this project was like uh we want like if you have funds in your smart account and you want to like on the Friday or Saturday or at the price like uh 150 or 250 dollars when each reach that much amount and you want to execute a swap on any of the chains that are not in your wallet you can use our product and you can integrate our product in any of the smart contracts and do that stuff like totally in a trustlessly your funds are totally safe with us so that's our project thank you awesome well D5 is not dead and this is the type of automation that helps us do a lot more with what's happening on chain all right three more demos to go so for our third last demo please welcome project Tanuki hi everyone uh we're the team from Homedale we've built Tanuki so Tanuki is a trustless uh wallet score provider uh so what is a wallet score um a wallet score is derived from on-chain data and it's basically just a number that is associated with an address for a given service so we categorized uh the scores into three categories um you have credits credit is based on your previous activity on D5 protocols and it's useful to give you a credit score to determine uh lending rates social is uh useful for protocols like lens where you have a lot of bots um and this is like quite a common problem right now a lot of people from lens are telling me uh this is a pretty odd problem so you can build a kind of indication of um whether someone is a bot based on their historical on-chain data uh USF trading so you can give rewards based on volume so it's quite common in tradify to give uh you know discounts on fees based on volume that you trade in a protocol so these are some protocols that we identified that we think will benefit from uh scores so uh humor for example is a credit line protocol and right now they have a bunch of signals that they use to calculate credit scores but these are mostly uh they have some off-chain components always so it's not fully trustless um so there isn't really a solution right now to like aggregate data from historical on-chain data and build a score based on that so our solution uses uh Axiom which is a ZK co-processor and this allows us to trustlessly generate scores based on historical data so we write a circuit a ZK circuit um that essentially Aggregates uh data so it could be summing up transactions or something or something more complicated like summing up volumes that you've traded on a given uni swap pool um and that gets pushed onto a smart contract where the proof gets verified and scores get stored in in the score provider contract and then this allows services to consume this in a really simple way uh through a view score function so Tanuki is trustless um you don't have to rely on any any oracles it's completely based on uh historical on-chain data it's fair um an issue in Trad fire with credit scores is that the uh you don't actually know how exactly the credit scores are calculated and for certain demographics or for certain people they're not sure why they have a low credit score but here you can see exactly how it's calculated and you can verify that it's fair and it's transparent because you can see exactly how it's calculated on chain so this is a quote from vitalik uh the most important scarce resource is legitimacy and this is super relevant for on-chain data because you have a lot of uh really valuable data that's sitting there um but it's it's not being utilized um and it can be a source of like a good source to um signify if a given wallet is is a legitimate user so we uh built two use cases uh we built two services that build on top of the infrastructure that we built one is a Dao um gas subsidy service so based on your activity in a dial uh the more you uh use the Dow the more gas rebates you'll get on transactions uh so we calculate a score in this case a 600 and based on that uh they have a subsidy of 22 on any votes they do through the Dell second one was uh lending so with uh with Ave um as an example uh lending protocols can use the historical engine data as an input to how they calculate uh lending rates a few more use cases so obviously this can be used for lens like I mentioned uh and other social media protocols for spam prevention can be used for airdrops um so right now all the airdrops involve an off-chain component and it can also be used for insurance so if you know someone is uses sudden protocols based on their history then you can tailor Insurance specifically to them so in summary we think that there's a lot of very valuable data sitting on chain and it's not being utilized um in a way that's decentralized and trustless and we think that a lot of services can use this data to build services on top um and in combination with a car abstraction it can be used for gas subsidies and other use cases thank you awesome all right two more demos to go without further Ado let's welcome yuru hello everyone my name is Charles and me and my teammates uh Lambda Nick and Chang Wu and Randy here we are a team yoru and we're glad to be here to introduce our project so okay so euro is a privacy preserving the app uh for social crypto payment and there are two major Concepts behind that the first one is uh Steel's address which is uh for better privacy and the second one is uh a uh apps account which is for better user experience and let's say Alice wants to transfer some token or some asset to Bob so instead of uh transfer those token and asset to the address of buff directly the address will generate a one-time address for Bob and transfer those token to that just generated address and the new generated address is actually a Wally contract and it's actually a abstract account for Bob so the Bob actually has the ownership of that small country wallet and there's a formula of uh the how Alice can generate the the address for the Bob and when Bob trying to uh withdraw he's found that he just received all he has to do is that uh calculate the the new privacy uh from his original priority and then provide the value signature uh to uh to uh to to submit to the blockchain and uh and because uh the the new address is the abstract account uh actually the withdrawal can be gasless which means that the above doesn't have to send some ether to the new address in order to you know uh withdraw the token on that account so here's a link of our repository and let's go to the live demo okay our demo is pretty simple is comprised up to transaction the first one is the sender sending tokens to receivers still address and uh from everyone else's point of view uh this address is like a random your address nobody knows that this address belongs to the receiver and for the second Edge for the second transaction is for receiver to spend the token receive from the sender and what's amazing about this transaction is that the receiver is gonna have a third party paying for his for his guest fee and deploy his account session and also transfer away the token and this great user experience is only made possible by the erp437 account abstraction okay let's begin our demo okay so first uh we're gonna have a receiver uh logging to the dev and he's going to register uh why this register is necessary because he's gonna publicly share his public key uh this is because the sender needs private key to compute the receiver's still address and but don't worry this information does not leak or compromise receiver is privacy and you can imagine that in the future when did system is ready you can attach Twitter handle or telegram handle to your did and run it this information center can after sending the transaction via uru you can notify the receiver via the Twitter or Telegram okay now the receiver has registered and now we will have sender login and meta transfer so uh now uh as a sender I want to send some uh ether to the recipient so uh I can use uh like uh different social IDs to uh to get the public key of the recipient here we use a EMS domain for example and then we choose to send some ether to the recipient also we support us planning and nft as well so now I click Send and confirm the transaction in my wallet okay and now uh the transfer is uh really a simple uh yes if any uh ether transfer but uh you will have a event immediate on the blockchain special event email address in order to you know let the recipient of your word be notified that there's a coming transfer that he may want to you know check on uh the blockchain to see uh uh whether which which uh transaction he is receiving okay so um now the recipient have to uh log into to the app to scan through the the blockchain to see whether there's an incoming transfer for him so he could receive and then he clicked the scan so now you can see uh uh there is a a new address new generated address for the recipient that uh he can collect the funds from the address okay so so right now he can click the withdrawal to get the phone okay after confirm that transaction we can check online uh whether the the transaction how the transaction is uh is executed okay um this is the second transition we demo as uh we previously mentioned this transaction is amazing because you take care of the having third party paying for the guest fee and deploy the account contract and also transfer away the token and this is all made possible by the account application design okay and that's our demo thank you awesome a lot of account abstraction all right last demo and the last finalist for today please give a big round of applause to Super play everyone uh we are super Thai and I'm Marky from Super play on nice to meet you I'm your son yeah so we are like building super play for our website gaming and I'll make sure it's just very simple take on boarding the next billion people to Webster gaming you know we believed Webster gaming is the key for Mass adoption but you know we have a lot of Market gap between the current situation and all holiday gaming industry so as for the concentration we have only one million uh wallet address for the nft and gaming but as for the gaming itself we have more than 2 billion uh users in the world so let's put a market Gap we have more than 2 000 you know like Market Gap so he can get more than 10 or 50 of those kind of gaming users to crypto the huge you know so we have a lot of Frontiers for the crypto Market but still we have a little problem you know between onboarding for onboarding getting used as delivery you know like it takes a lot of calls for the bullet setup for the beginners and also like you know for gamers like uh the crypto stuff is too difficult for them to understand they're also the gaspi as well so that's why we made the Superplay yeah onwards with uh what we actually have built uh we have an infrastructure SDK all this slide is very very bright um SDK for implementing essentially um account abstraction through just an email registration so essentially we have we have been using web 3 off as a service that will generate an eoa account and then from there your aircon will join an A account a rather a kind of fashion right um which will serve as a intermediary between the user who's just logged in with his email essentially and the game which is on chain um with this we also fund the AAA account with erc20 tokens which will allow the user to actually do stuff on chain and then later on if he or she wants to continue on playing uh they can subscribe and get more tokens and more funds to actually do on-chain stuff so I will quickly just now go through the architecture I know this is kind of small guys in the back you can probably see this but on the left side we have the creation of the account essentially what's happening is the user just submits his email to web 3 of um it goes to our service so our service actually uses um saves SDK which creates a a wallet and also uses super fluid as a token streaming platform so essentially what we do is we fund the a account with tokens and we create a stream that goes back to us from the user account so essentially we have essentially built a free trial period for a game one chain um so that's the creation part and then the interaction part on the right side is a bit more simple it's essentially a user is doing an action that can be any game action and it's actually very easy to implement that it goes through our service then it goes to relay which is essentially a off-chain executor and then from there we actually execute the transaction through the account and the game and now we're gonna go to the demo you know that's it all right so if we click Start here and wait for it so this is the web 3 of um interface and essentially I'm just gonna do a login with Google I'm gonna use for example this mail and what's happening in the background essentially we have generated a um ethereum address based on the the based on the email the Google Earth on certification okay so we create an account and this is essentially a very very basic um a game interface let's say so essentially on the left side we have the profile this is the profile of the user so on the left you can see the name and then we have these SP tokens those are the tokens that we have airdrop to the account and essentially uh as you can see on the right there's says 100 SP per week so essentially it's seeping out 100 SP per week from the account and essentially by doing that you can actually set a period of time by which his uh or hers free trial of the game will um well be finished so and then on the right you just have whatever the game interface wants so essentially you can buy some game buy some items you can bet other users or do essentially whatever you want so essentially the whole idea was to create a modular SDK it's very easy to implement and yeah one other thing that we can do is actually charge so if the trial is done and we're happy with the game we can just click on charge and by using safes um um building safe kit we can actually just use stripe to pay in some more crypto and actually continue playing on the game um I think that's about it one sec this is our Tech stack I did the demo and this is our team rashimichi isn't here currently she's a speaker at DSi uh me Leon yuchen and modike and just as a final remark and as the final demo of the day I would like to thank all of the organizers and I guess we'll see in Lisbon thank you and congrats those were our 11 incredible finalist demos I know all of you are tired so I'm going to try my best to wrap everything up as quickly as possible but I don't think you'll have any trouble staying up for the next part because we're giving away a lot of money um before we get to that tough crowd um pooping I'm also tired it's okay don't worry I'm not offended well before we get to all through all that stuff um the most incredible thing here is that there are some obvious themes so we're seeing a lot of stuff around zkp's becoming more and more common and fast uh they're we're seeing a lot of real world applications and as you've already guessed looks like a kind of abstraction is about to be everyday thing so effectively his events become a way for you to see what the next year looks like in all of web 3 and Tech and we hope that you get to take home some of these teams and make them better for millions and billions more people all right let's get to all the next stuff I want to thank all these 11 families one more time for coming here doing live demos it's not easy things can always go wrong so congratulations to bombarding Zeke Voice key bailout Aoki nft October minor probably nothing else Works AB swab Tanuki Euro and super play and you can see all these projects and all the remaining 300 on eveglobal.com showcase so before we go into all the amazing prizes stuff I want to do a quick reminder that you get to finish the survey it'll help us make the ethereum ecosystem better this is the survey from is talk from the opening ceremony just quickly take a scan here it'll take you less than two minutes maybe more I don't know uh it'll be very quick it helps us really understand how do we evolve the culture of ethereum and how do we actually make all these events better and bring more people in so uh I'll wait for five more seconds but I really appreciate you all doing this there we go all right let's get

scroll I'm going to prepare myself for this one all of these teams are going to be receiving a lot of small amounts of money but five thousand dollars will be split between these 68 teams and looks like the world is excited about ZK EVMS and last but not least these two prizes are going to be announced very soon uh we couldn't get to all of them in the the time uh to do this thing so we'll be notifying all the reason and auto 01 price applicants if they want those prizes over email and they'll also show up on your hacker dashboard with a really nice pop-up message saying you want money all right these were all the prizes and in a couple hours you'll be able to go on your own project and refresh the page and you'll see what prizes you've won so if you didn't read this or you're sleeping now which doesn't matter because you won't hear me you can just go on your dashboard and you'll see all the prizes your team has won so congratulations again to everybody that was more than four hundred thousand dollars being given away and I I have five minutes before I'm being told I need to stop talking so let's try to wrap this up quick notes on some Logistics all these announcements are tentative and not final which means we're going to verify everybody's source code we're going to make sure everybody followed the rules nobody cheated and that'll take us two to three weeks this also means that if you are an applicant and a winner for a full prize and we end up disqualifying some team for cheating uh the numbers will change and you'll be notified of any of those changes so we'll take the next couple of weeks to do all of that and all prizes will be delivered on May 5th or by May 5th what does that actually mean it means do not ask me again when the prizes are coming before May 5th okay thank you speaking of thank yous no no you got you gotta take a break because we're gonna clap constantly now for the next seven slides so all right this is the last part of all of what I'm going to say before we enjoy the rest of our evenings so before we wrap this up I want to make sure we give a big shout out to everybody that made this event possible and that's a lot of people that are involved in making this successful 1500 people is a lot just look at this room behind you uh it's packed and it requires a lot of logistics and a lot of people to make all of this work and these are some of the people that are doing all this work behind the scenes want to make sure we give a quick second to thank them for all the time they put in this weekend and months and weeks before but before I get to thank all these four categories I want to thank all of you hackers for being here with us over this weekend congratulations to doing something amazing you didn't have to be here in a building locked up for the last 48 hours but you chose to do this you chose to build something you were excited about and that means a lot and that means we get to see more and more cool things in this ecosystem so thank you so much of course I'm all of our amazing judges for taking the time and talking to all of you so please give rjs once again a big round of applause so many volunteers and mentors taking 24 7 shifts not sleeping sometimes sleeping too much but also helping everybody get to where they want it to be and making sure everything runs super super smoothly so thank you for all of these amazing mentors and volunteers all of our amazing speakers who gave all these talks workshops that you get to use and learn from without this none of this will be possible this is the education we want to bring forward and make available for free for everybody so thank you to our speakers and I know you can won't be able to read it but this is all the list of people who were behind the scenes making all these things possible from all of our incredible Partners once you see any of them here thank them for all their work and time and also taking their time to spend the weekend with you to make sure you're successful so please give our partners a big round of applause and I want to give a few special shout outs to a couple people Mia Reno and aru N1 we've seen them constantly running around and of course Arena two more Masai and tarafora helping us pull this event off for the last four months for being incredible hosts making sure we don't make stupid decisions really and helping all of this be successful and last but not least I'd like the biggest Round of Applause for the Youth Global team I'm here on stage but they did all the work so a big shout out to huygan Taylor Fred Rory Wilbur at yours Chloe Kevin K Kevin Ivan Cree who we see Minnie and moas Emily Andrew and Jacob the sign of a good event and amazing operation is that you don't have too many things to complain about and if nothing is there for you to notice that means it was running smoothly and this is a team that makes it happen so they deserve all that recognition so make sure you thank all of them whenever you get a chance okay well I lied there's another section the finalists so we saw 10 teams come up we saw a lot of prizes from our partners and uh you kind of saw okay well all the prizes were for the partners but then not all the teams were listed there what's going on if you've never been to a need Global event before there's one thing that we do differently than everything else this event is not a competition our goal is to help others get into the space and understand what's possible and as part of that we want to make sure that we get to surface interesting ideas and not make this competitive where we get to force people to be first second third so effectively all 11 of those teams are our first place winners and as a finalist they all came in first so congratulations to all 11 of those teams and as part of being a finalist you'll be getting a 500 usdc in addition to everything form member from Heath global or being an incredible incredible participant this weekend but wait there's more that's not all all of these teams will also be getting up to ten thousand dollars in credits on ews us in case they want to make this forward 10 zippolya eat Port member so you have to worry about all the test netbeat an ens domain of their choice more than four characters for all the pragmas we're going to do at Heath Global you'll get a free entry to
