foreign [Applause] [Music] welcome to the CK 2.0 this is a join event with eat Global that celebrates the launch of polygon ckuvm mainnet beta this is a special greetings from Barcelona where most of the ckvm team is located and I am Grace I am from polygon Labs I'm also the ckuvm product lead and today I have the pleasure to also be your NC we're extremely happy to have these special days and to show it with uh to share it with our Global Community this is a community with whom we share values and purpose we have a very engaging program and we want to go through it very quickly we you will have some insightful conversations in a fireside chat style we will have the official launch of mainnet beta and that comes with a surprise I won't say more than that two awesome panels we have also an important closing remarks and without further ado let me introduce you to Sandeep and mihilo co-founders of polygon and the ones that will be opening the event take it away the MDM everyone uh today we are our you know Community has come up with this new thing which is ZM instead of GM so uh which where the Z uh you know describes a ZK part of it because polygon is going to be all about ZK uh from here onwards uh many of you have uh you know seen the Journey of polygon and today is probably the most important day uh in the in the Journey of polygon because at polygon we were always focused on mass adoption of web3 and uh we are very proud that and because you know now it looks very obvious but that time it was not that we chose uh you know layer 2 scaling on top of ethereum as the paths which can actually bring the scalability to the world uh with which we can take web c to the masses and uh you know we have been very focused uh we've always been uh you know dedicated towards scaling ethereum on Layer Two uh to have like you know these Global trustless Systems uh community-owned businesses uh to be built and uh you know provided to the users and empowering users uh especially the users who are uh the underprivileged and underrepresented uh which is which is obviously the core ethos of F3 and uh you know before in 2020 we started with our polygon POS chain which is which was kind of good which worked at that point in time whatever was available but our focus and uh mission was always to uh bring the world like true Layer Two Solutions and uh you know on layer twos there is like amongst the researchers there is kind of global consensus that zero knowledge technology is the end game right and uh because it it kind of like you know with the crypto cryptography and the mathematics behind it it ensures that you can technically have infinite scalability right which is very important for uh Mass scale applications to be built on top of uh ethereum to build on top of layer 2's and hence like you know today is the day where we launch our first uh true layer 2 solution which is uh ZK VM as you guys many of you guys already know and uh you know mihailo my brother and co-founder has been the architect of this uh you know polygons entire polygon ecosystems uh you know strategy or uh you know kind of uh approach towards uh scaling on Layer Two with ZK so without further Ado I'll hand over to my Hello to share his thoughts on how you know he has uh he you know what what's his uh master plan in his mind and what he sees forward from here May hello over to you uh thanks so much Sandeep hi everyone uh it's a true pleasure to welcome you everyone to this great celebration uh they're telling us in the background that there's more ten thousand more than 10 000 people uh tuned in at the moment which is really exciting and humbling and yeah first one to start by saying that Sandeep is just being too too generous and he's exaggerating it's I'm just a single contributor to this uh great success and Sandeep contributed at least as much as I have as well as the great team that we are very fortunate to have and yes maybe I can just say a few words about this this process so so uh like a year and a half ago roughly after a lot of research and experience with different scaling Solutions and thinking about how to approach uh this this Grand goal of mass adoption of web free that we have we decided that ZK technology uh we formed a firm belief that CJ technology is the optimal uh or the most promising technology uh when it comes to building web free and bringing it to the messes and we announced that publicly and we announced that one billion fund uh that we uh committed to this great technology and in the meantime uh uh we have on board it and joined chance with multiple uh extraordinary talented teams uh great individuals and we really formed what we we achieved what we wanted to do we established a ZK Powerhouse uh within polygon and the the first major result of of and deliverable of this great team and this great process that time really um honored to to have been participating in is this EK VM announcement zkvm is is a Sandy mentioned and is generally known it's considered the Holy Grail of of blockchain web infrastructure and that is because it simultaneously offers three very important features one is scalability as we know we we have we want to onboard the world to web3 basically and we're far from the uh sufficient levels of scaling so zkvm addresses that the second one is security we know that in general in web 3 we operate with economic uh Concepts and funds Etc and we want to leverage ideally strong and proven security of ethereum which is the strongest the most centralized programmable blockchain in the world and the third very important feature is evm equivalence or compatibility which allows us to leverage all these great important tools programming languages and user interfaces like metamask everything that has been built in the ethereum community so far with dkvm we can just simply leverage that we're leaving developer and user experience in Tech which is very very important so all these things together all these three things make ZK VM the Holy Grail or the optimal or ideal solution for for uh scaling blockchains we delivered we have been able to deliver this at least two to three years because before it was generally expected to happen and it's on top of that the ZK VM that we're delivering today is absolutely practical so there were concerns with complexity uh when it comes to the that has been always the main concern with the KVM whether it's possible to build and if it's even possible whether it can be practical will we need a data center to generate these profs and today we are incredibly excited uh uh and it's even beyond our expectations that the fact that we are able to run ckv improver on commodity DAW assistances and pay them 1.9 dollars per per hour which is how much our whole test net has been costing us so all in all this has been a great experience very exciting journey and uh I just want to say just one thing that I really have to say very very briefly um it has been uh why we delivered this this fast apart from great strength of our team and several engineering breakthroughs that we that the teams have made including a very very transformative Concepts like Goldilocks Fields like Starkey like plonky 2 and other things in addition to that that um the sense of mission and collaboration that happened within the team was really truly inspiring and I believe it's it's really great that we deliver this EK event we're incredibly proud and excited about this but along the way I think we just also got much much more uh interconnected stronger as the team more convinced about our mission and the fact that we actually can uh contribute a lot this industry and hopefully to to the world and yeah with this I would just actually hand it over to the actual hero and the person who made his mission to deliver this EK VM which is my good friend and co-founder Jordan and thank you thanks everyone again foreign
