foreign [Applause] [Music] and welcome to the gnosis builders Workshop building on gnosis chain the what why and where joining us today is Olu who will be taking us through the session and with that I will pass it over to Olu to get the session started hi guys welcome to the session um yes um I'll be taking us through this um very few brief session on uh building on Moses Jane um what you need to know about Mrs Jane um where you need to get information is that how you could go about it um questions we could be tapping to the chat and I'll I'll get to them thank you so this is um what the job is all about um towards the why and where of building on those exchange um we're going to talk about what this must exchange why you should consider them 16 how to build on this channel um we are going to talk briefly about nostal's builders so what is Mrs chain um nurses chain is an L1 POS based EVN of multiple chain uh basically what all this mean is that it's um is compatible with ethereum and you could build or need same as you could build on ethereum um it's operates with a drawer tracking system we have one tracking for gas and the order for sticking um the extra is used for guys at the Journey of taking it extra itself is packed uh one to one with the US dollar um and it's derived from the diet of the ethereum um what this means is that transactions are very very cheap almost exchange with um 100 you could do as many as the 100K transactions so even more depending on the type of transactions you're doing so and um the reason for uh having this Dua treatment system is also so that um staking can also be done very easily as we'll see um later on no system itself is excuse me it's Community part and developers focused and anyone in the world can become a validated on the chain and it is pretty very easy to do so what's the mission of Mrs J um no 16 aims to be the most decentralized blockchain um we have already tools that we use to measure decentralization as you see later on and um why uh Mrs Jane is most suitable in making the scripture because currently there are over 115 gig um validators on Linux trade on the screen and the entry to becoming validator is just one General like I said earlier um this is the reason why we have this to talking uh system the general is used for validators and you need just one of it to become a validator to contrast that with ethereum that requires it to help data now um I said earlier that the chain is compatible with um the evm so how do we achieve um this one gno to 32 at inspiring what happens is your one gno is converted to something called mgno and one Geno is 32 MGM so the M General is basically what is used for validation and that makes it compatible foreign add any advanced knowledge of how the internet's work with me we provide tools for you that you could go do a few clicks and become a validated so once the uh key priorities that's nurses change strives to achieve one of them is decentralization like I said we want to be the most decentralized um chain um we also prioritize qualitative experience we have an injective by a little experience um dashboard that you could use to basically become a validator without having to go through a lot of stress [Music] um for example if you're using stadium.net with just a few clicks and in a few minutes it will become if I if validator and everything is set up very easily for you um user on boarding as well is very seamless and accessible and we have a very robust and growing ecosystem um there are a lot of dealing rules and dabs that have already developed and deployed 16. so why should you be interested in all of this why she why should you run to period on your system like I said decentralization is very key um with about 315 validators no 16 is the second most decentralized chain um accessibility is also very important whether you're a developer on a user getting started all those exchange intuitive is Affordable it's easy um how that thing is speed transaction time almost Exchange in 45 seconds which means you could do lightning fast transactions it is also cheap um with 0.01 x that you'll be able to make hundreds of transactions and um it is stable stability um uh paying for um transaction using X style which is uh basically you want to go with the US dollar means that um your transaction fees are predictable and they are not subject to Market volatility which I will lead celebrity okay so this is uh the current state of you know 16 you could see this info onosismatrix.com um we have about 27 000 active accounts um in the last 30 days about 1.6 million International process about 3 000 X die I've been paid in fees for those 1.6 million transactions about 115k validators um value of University deposition is about 12 million and the currency for validators is version 10.2 percent so all of this info can be seen more if you go to the traditional active accounts foreign it is user friendly we have a strong Airport System we also have a grants program um so that your period that you're building you apply for Grants and uh there's an ecosystem that's you know and a deal that you know walks around that and helps to support public good projects um yeah so you could receive support for not just for uh grant money receive support for marketing of course liquidity receive support for networking and so much more for them sspcasting so where do you start from um first thing first you have to connect your wallet to the chain you could use the RPC endpoint chain ID adequences simple let's display um alternatively you could just go to the chainlist.org and go to the slash chain slash Android support and for you and I mean again this is all very easy and it treats it and straightforward you need to have um special knowledge of anything to people to do this and after you've connected your wallet um like I said it is 100 EPM or particle basically this means that you could use all of the dark development tools you use on ethereum or nurses chain without changing anything you could take a smart contract or a project built for ethereum and deploy it on your system without merge access in fact most of the time you don't have to change anything just deploy one-to-one so what this means is all of the tools that are available or on ethereum can also be used on those exchange is any uh your remix your or others your trophy whatever tool you used to develop on ethereum you could use those Sim 2016 apart from that all of the libraries are also 100 on particle you could use any open the screen library or any other library library familiar with um almost exchange as well so where are the resources you could you could get started with um the first place I would recommend to go is nurses.io this is the main website it provides a very quick overview of what notices changes um you also provided by view of the grants program and how to get a little card um the next point of code is docs.nosischain.com this is the entry point to all documentations for loss exchange for um validator or you're just reviewing this is the best kind of call but if you are a developer and just want to start development right away you could go to the slash developer sub part um is also a good resource here you could see all the available wallets um that uh are supported on Mrs chain and your code um easily click to um and select your preferred parameters and you get um links and you know documentations and stuff to the wallets that fits your Preferred Choice um access to faucet is also very important so we have nurses for sale.com where you can get a small amount of eggs dye that you can use to start building immediately uh deploying transition um if the excite you get from 640.com is not enough you could also visit buy xdi.com we have a lot of resources there to show where you can get extra easily either you want to buy with credit card that you want to swap it on chain or you want to bridge it through the arterial loss exchange we have a lot of resource systems for you and just a few clicks you could get started and if you want gno you just put the slash GM supports on and you'll be able to get you know and finally we have a validated notices.com is iron also very simple interesting interface to guide you um if you're interested in becoming validator ordinance Exchange again all of these tools are very very easy to use you don't need a lot of specialized knowledge to use them so they might just click tools and you get some simple is to follow guides on how to do business so um finally I said we're going to talk briefly about nurses Builders so what's this beauty is um you know since Builders is um an ecosystem thing for uh you know system we are basically committee uh that um build for Lucy's chain um you could visit our website to find all of the various tools I'm talking about um and you could use all of these links to get in touch with us as well we have a developed us program Mrs Peters that comes to Attica Lopez we also have a user's program um you could check the validators and if you want to see all of the events and the other community that supports go to the slash community um sub parts so also you can reach out to us if you have a project you want us to collaborate with you on or that you want us to support you could be just from musesfield gas station as well and um yeah we also want to see that we're on Discord on telegram you could reach us easily on any of this channels and that is it folks thank you awesome cheers thank you Olu um does anybody have any questions we had a comment uh that knows his chain is the only evm chain compatible with ethereum at the Beacon chain level um by Ethan yes thanks yeah that is very important I guess if anybody wants to ask a question feel free to type in the chat or take yourself off mute uh Gavin asked gnosis has uh I'll save pre-compiles then yeah yes um so like I said it is 100 even compatible you don't need to do anything whatever it is that you do you want ethereum you could just take it one to one like that and to promise exchange without doing anything yeah can you talk about the hackathon rewards I um okay I don't have I don't know is isan from um I can also try finding uh stuff from from the site in the in the main meantime uh Ethan I can get back to you that um the next question was is the nose is safe anyhow related to the gnosis chain a wallet that is that you could use to do uh uh not signature so it is not uh it is not related to nurses chain uh but it is also a very good resource you could use if you want to do a multi-signature wallets okay and is gnosis compatible with polybase I'm not sure what's 40 basis so um I can't yes I don't know if you want to take yourself off mutant maybe verify or you can type in the chat as well um in the meantime we can if now we can move on um is there a run I'm not sure is there a rocket pull Fork already on gnosis um none that I know of oh uh let's see it says uh so yeah guys we have a second part if you don't mind because we have just 10 minutes left uh we want to present one more product and then we we continue with questions in the end yeah that sounds good um can I share my screen or do you have my presentation yeah no I just stop sharing foreign okay cool yeah so I want to yeah to introduce Hashi so it's a project by agnosis Guild um and in in the diagnosis ecosystem in general this is very very new um so I want to introduce this guys to you because they're relevant bounties around that so um yeah what what is Hash exactly so hashibri means bridge in Japanese um and we aim here to define a standard for cross-chain communication um with the main difference is that we we want to be based on additive security and multiple inputs we call them oracles more on that later um at its core uh how she is a header Oracle aggregator and the ultimate goal here is to basically distribute trust for Bridges but on the security mechanism level um yeah if I can use just one phrase to to describe that uh what has is doing like why it was just one Bridge security mechanism when you can have all of them right um and next one is why why Hashi was created so uh in 2022 we had more than 2 billion uh in in hacks uh because of bridge issues and news leaderboards all the top projects four out of five are really the bridges so what is the summary here is like no Bridge security mechanism is 100 secure um all designs have uh trade-offs right so um so a couple of of principles around uh Hashi the way it was designed so uh we want to standardize uh at the lowest possible level and this is the block header it's not like on on transaction or on tokens but it's on the Block header level and the goal here is to to diversify uh this cross chain communication uh by different implementations so different kind of bridges right um so we we assume here that no bridge design can be considered 100 secure um so we will basically check um multiple bridges for the result they're giving uh to to validate a specific block header from another blockchain um and and of course when we Max my security um over latency so here uh the the whole design of the system basically makes the makes it slower um but we have enhanced security so a couple of uh yeah main components of this system um so imagine we have we have the applications right so applications are a token Bridge a governance bridge and any free bridge any kind of uh Bridge you you can imagine and then we have the blockader oracles which are the actual Bridges so here there can be uh Bridges you already know um for example Wormhole or the diagnosis chain A and B or whole protocol or connects any any Breeze basically um and then we have the core contracts which I'll present right after uh the main one is called Hashi which is a the aggregator um giri giribashi and other Japanese I don't know if I have any Japanese speakers in the audience uh this basically is um taking care of governance so uh which oracles will be added and and thresholds and so forth um then another component is the storage proofs um we need basically a proof on this concept that the specific transaction is included in a specific block header and and this is uh um this is done for example with a project like Axiom um but there are other Alternatives that you can explore and then we have the reporter contracts and the relayers which are basically um helper components that will initiate the message transfers and listen to events uh cross chain um and yeah this is the most important part to understand uh Hashi um is an architecture overview so it might look a bit uh yeah uh difficult to describe in a couple of minutes but uh um I want to focus here so mainly let's say we have to change that we have ethereum mainnet and we have nauseous change so these are the two main contracts I just mentioned before uh the hash in the giribashi uh and and this um this here are are the bridges basically right so uh the examples I mentioned before you have a and b this is the gnosis uh only Bridge maybe you've heard of it uh Wormhole the level is a solution by System clubs zika breeds any kind of bridge right and then we need to build adapters for all these bridges that feed into Hashi right and high level what is happening here is that um we are asking um from like on the application Level so here it took as an example a token Bridge um we're asking through this helper components here um a specific block header from ethereum mainnet to be transferred by all of these Bridges right so the amb will transfer the blocker the Wormhole will transfer the block header and so forth and on the other side Hashi will get the answers from all the bridges and it will compare them and I this is the gearbox is about the governance so you can say okay if two or three out of five or five out of eight whatever you want to set I agree and give me the same answer then I can be very very sure that this is correct and this connects to what I just mentioned uh in the beginning that uh here we don't trust any one of them 100 we we basically ask all of these Bridges to give us the same input we ask them give me a block error from the other side and if one of them is compromised let's say telepathy or A and B is compromised and and they give a wrong uh result that is different by the majority then we know these are compromised but their system is still intact right so that's the thing the main uh the main lesson for uh for Hashi that we want really to uh to create additive security and aggregate all possible Bridges and to be I'll secure as sure as possible that we have the correct result um yeah and and this part here is what I just what I mentioned before about the storage proofs right so uh this is a quite complex I'll I'll maybe explain a little bit later is um we need a component here a contract that basically will check that the specific transaction is included in a specific block header right so this uh will will give a block header and here you have to check oh the transaction that I initiated here is it included in a block here and then you can say if it is included then you can make sure that these actual uh token Breeze transaction on the other side happened right and and yeah then that's basically the token can be breached um what can you build now with Hashi um so now let's go that goes to the hackathon and connects to to many of the prizes we have there uh you cannot write an adapter for another Bridge um so the similar to the one I do the ones I showed uh you can write this contract this miracle Booth um that proves that basically specific event um or the transaction is including a specific block header uh then you can look at the uh the governance contract we have and improve it in any kind of way it's uh can at the moment it's very um I want to say simple but it doesn't have a lot of complex use cases yet and you can also of course I mean this is quite hard at the moment but you can try and build the uh end-to-end application that will make for example a token transfer super super secure by a three four five different Bridges um and yeah to help in that these are the resources we have so far so the main one is uh the repository uh you will see there that they already adapter is implemented for three um Bridges um you can add more and if you want to play around with the or even interact with the contracts we have already on test net these are the addresses so we have a girly and Shadow at the moment which Shadow is the designate of uh you know system and yeah I think I'll stop here and maybe we can check is there any questions because we have three minutes left and yeah yeah there's a good amount of questions um Sky scrolling back up to the top uh uh see is there a rocket pool Fork already on gnosis um rocket pool oh fool I'm not sure about that uh by the way guys for any questions you need to uh you can you can I think there should be a channel in This Global yeah yeah we'll get that link and we'll monitor that because there are different teams like the Hashi team for example the builders and then we can uh if you have for example Hashi related questions I will jump in for other projects with that person will jump in um and uh What uh what are some cool projects on gnosis uh cool um I think I already respond to that we have quite a number of projects that are on this exchange I could quickly share my screen to show you a slide uh so these are some of the projects that um you've been able to put together that are almost exchange you can see we have the file we have infrastructure projects we have Taos nft games not providers so and this list I think is a bit old um I'm sure there are other projects that are copied number as we speak yeah I'm sorry uh although I just saw that you responded to some of these questions so just go into ones that haven't been responded uh Manu asked what are the more important things you were looking for in projects in the hackathon um I can't really say because um what um first and first Bridget needs to be interesting is to solve a particular problem it needs to there needs to be value you know some sort of value that is in added that to the community you want to change under the projects two years okay and uh wouldn't actually be very slow to reach consensus yeah I was just uh and answering that uh so yeah it depends so the main point here is the hash is super modular and configurable so uh it depends if you want to make it super fast you can use these two oracles with some two multisig Bridges and that will be super fast but if you want to make it super secure uh what we want to make for example Hashi ideally one implementation that will combine a lot of ZK light client Bridges right together with multi-stick Bridges and that will be slower but a lot more secure and are the deployed contracts and dogs and um actually no because I think we deployed it yesterday but I think they're not in the Ripple but feel free to ask the questions there um and I I'll provide you an information you guys need and uh the ERC 4337 entry point contract is deployed on tenosis chain is anyone building out bundler infrastructure for 4337 on those things none that I know of I think that's all the questions right now and yeah if if people have more questions than I posted the uh the Discord link there and um to gnosis so I posted again here please feel free to reach out to them um at any point and they'll deal to answer anybody from the team will be able to answer any other questions that you may have but um if there are no other questions just say thank the team for the great presentation and thank you all for for being here today um and uh yeah have a great rest of the day and happy hacking
