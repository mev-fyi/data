hello good morning good afternoon good evening depending on where you're calling in from uh we have Amanda here from Lighthouse who will be doing a workshop on Perpetual storage and building token gated applications if you have any questions they can go into the zoom chat and it will be more than happy to answer them and with that being said I'll pass the mic off to get it awesome thank you so hey everyone uh welcome to Lighthouse so today I'll give a session on what Lighthouse is and what do we mean by Perpetual storage and how you can like store your data on Lighthouse and build token related applications using the lighthouse SDK so if you have any questions meanwhile just drop in the chat happy to answer them all so we'll just go through basic overview and then even show you a live demo as well and yeah like George Orwell once famously said that who controls the past controls the future and who controls the present controls the past again like referencing to the issue of information control and manipulation and in the past we have seen like libraries being burned down and Scholars being buried like most famously like Library of Alexandria was destroyed in India there was like very famous nalanda university which got vanished and most recently Iraq National Library got bombarded so the point being like data physically is not Totally Secure it is it can be destroyed due to various reasons although most people might think that data on on like digitally on the Internet is secure but also that's not the case uh in webto the data is also Transit and it faces two key problems of Link Road which refers to like broken links as it was seen that around 25 percent of links in the New York Times article do not even point to the original content and the second thing is content drift uh this again refers to the issue of content manipulation data loss or let's say DNS changes uh pointing like aside to again like a manipulated or a different content which was previously meant to be and in web3 again we see like this problem still persist with your files uh web3 we have seen like there have been like a user owned app concept and we are creating experiences and nfts in which user own their data uh but the problem again is like the records and transactions of all of these uh data is like permanent on Gene ethereum but the files are not and hence we saw recently with FTX as when the centralized platform got down uh nft um all the FTX nfts eventually uh went broke and also in on openc we realized that many nfts due to their centralized uh point of failure do not even uh point to like the original link and in many cases like this case it says like not found so yeah that's why we thought okay let's build Lighthouse and we identified like there has to be you know four Key properties on the storage layer side uh to make it like work for all kind of use cases first is persistence so with Lighthouse or when you store data we store it on ipfs and filecoin and ensure uh minimum replications of your files and that your files are stored long term forever so let's say rather than renewing your filecoin deals you can pay once and need not renew deal again and again so permanent storage on filecoin and underlying there is this endowment pool model that pays for your file still perpetuity and the second thing is like a lot of users uh demanded us like can we store like private data on ipf as a filecon using your SDK so then we even build this uh this feature into the lighthouse SDK where you can not just store even private data but even token get your resources and files which I'll also demo today and third thing is again like this property then we inherit from using ipfs and filecon underneath which is like being tamper proof and distributed so Falcon has a big minor Network and has like around 18 exabytes of data capacity onboarded so which again allows us to you know serve like big scale data as well and uh like distribute your data on like bunch of Miners and the fourth thing is again many people complain that distributed storage systems are like quite slow so we even have like dedicated gateways using which you can like store and retrieve back all kinds of files be it image video you can even like stream 4K video out of it so it's like quite fast and yeah as I was talking about um underneath lighthouse we have the smart contract based growth endowment pool as we call it which ensures data files as total perpetuity and uh it's like multi-chain and it's controlled by a Dao and uh when you pay for a file some part of it goes to the filecon miner and remaining part goes to this endowment pool where it accrues fees through various protocols and yeah as of now Lighthouse suit contains uh three things one is our CLI tool next is our SDK which I would highly recommend using in your hackathon projects which is like this npm package that you can either import on your website uh front-end click react view or whichever framework that you like and another thing is like backend in node.js as well and third thing is again our website which is Lighthouse dot storage and I'll also demonstrate Lighthouse files app right now so yeah this is our main site and the URL is lighthouse.storage so you can as for starters you can come here and click on the store files Now button and then you can log in in into like whichever login method that you prefer like through metamask if you prefer any other chain or Google GitHub email login as well so we also support like fileco and wallaby as a test Network so given like this is a FM hackathon so I highly recommend you to uh connect to wallaby and uh build applications around it yeah but you can easily log in through your metamask wallet and view all the files that has been uploaded so if you want to upload like a public file uh let's say this file that again like the upload is quite fast and all of these functionalities that I'm showing you you can do these from our SDK as well so this is like just as a demo purpose that what all functionalities you can do with Lighthouse and let's say if you want to upload an encrypted file you can turn on the encryption and um let's select one of these files and again for this encryption you need to sign in from your wallet to authorize and then you can view this uh connect to your wallet sign again and then you should be able to view this file which you just uploaded and if you try to download it from the ipfs network you will be able to but then that will be encrypted file and only the authorized persons can view this file after signing from their wallet but that's not just it you can even do like more things with it so since it's a encrypted file you'll see like there's a blue button here called as apply access control so if I click on here I can add a condition and I can add a condition like let's say if you are on wallaby which is like the file coin test Network and if you want only the owners of a particular nft collection to view this particular file so you can select whichever token that you want to have the logic on let's say ERC 721 which is the nft token and then you can mention the contract address here and let's say I want only the users who have of more than or equal to three of these nfts on wallaby chain to access this file I can mention uh more than equal to 3 and then create excess condition and I can also create you know multiple uh conditions as well so let's say three tokens nft tokens on wallaby chain but a thousand uh e uni swap tokens on um polygon chain even like that can be done like cross lot chain logic can be built around it so I can then put in like let's say if this is the uni swap token address then create access condition and then I can create like a combination of these conditions as well like C1 and C2 so now what it means is like the user in their wallet has to satisfy both of these conditions and only then they will be able to view this file and then you can like create access condition and then again authorize from a wallet and then if I now share this file a link to whoever I want to and if they satisfy those two conditions in their wallet after signing in they should be able to decrypt the file and again like this is something that you can do from our Lighthouse SDK which is like the key purpose for this hackathon you should be using Lighthouse SDK to qualify for the bounties as well which I'll talk about and yeah as for developers you can come here or get an API key and again sign from a wallet to generate that API key uh copy this API key and then um here's our documentation link which you can also find from our main site as well clicking on this uh documentation page and here we have like bunch of code examples let's say if you want to try out our CLI but let's say if you want to integrate into your browser front-end and node.js backend so we have bunch of code examples here so let's say if you want to upload uh the file here so you can like just copy paste this code enter the API key here and just start uploading files to Lighthouse and even on excess condition side which I just demonstrated so they're like bunch of code examples here like on node.js you can apply the success control conditions and mention whichever chain and what the condition has to be and the access conditions are multiple like I showed you how you can add in like a ERC 721 logic uh to token get your file or erc20 logic but you can also even apply time based excess control as well so let's say you if you want to time lock a file for let's say next one day or if you want to unlock a file only after next one month so accordingly you can specify that block number here that only allow to access this file only when this block number has passed so again this is pretty interesting uh like feature that you can use to build some useful app on uh in the second one as well which I highly recommend and coming back to our presentation your Lighthouse files and for this SDK as I just showed you can go to our documentation this is the link for that and yeah some of the use case that I would love to talk about so for example question protocol uh we did an integration with them recently so now all the ocean economy and ocean ecosystem dabs will be able to store data on filecoin uh through the lighthouse SDK and then there's this another great project called as okay contract so they created something very interesting like these web2 widgets so so these web3 widgets that you can you know embed into any front end be it any web 2 or web 3 front end so let's say if you want to have a nft functionality so you can rather than implementing it from scratch okay contract builders on Lighthouse that um they had this minting nft functionality and the data is being stored on the nft data is being stored on Lighthouse and now anybody can just go and use OK contract widget into their front end and then start storing files on Lighthouse and then link is another like gaming uh project so they are storing all their gaming assets on Lighthouse as well but yeah I think uh as part of this hackathon there's already a idea list uh which I think you can find on the space warp side but they're uh like this is like another bunch of examples that you can take an idea from like what is possible with Lighthouse but again this is like just some basic raw examples you can even build some more interesting examples but yeah if if you want to try like something like pay-per-view media time block retrieval those things can be interesting to experiment or you can use it generally for your Dow storage or nft storage if you are using any of those uh ideas into your projects and as part of the second one we are sponsoring in total of 2500 which will be divided among five projects so let's say five hundred dollars uh per project so for the best use of Lighthouse SDK yeah so here is our website Lighthouse dot storage and this is our Discord uh you can also find that again in on the website as well but feel free to scan this link and happy to answer any questions so I so it says how would we so one question is how would we whitelist wallets uh to view so yeah again this is something that you can do through our SDK as well so like just to show you the UI interface of it let's say rather than doing this apply Access Control part you can just click on this share button and enter all the addresses here like all the public address you want to share and then those addresses will be whitelisted and only then they can do this file this functionality again you can Implement from our SDK as well there should be code example or to whitelist public addresses who can view this file and next question is can we hum how do the conditions get applied can you provide insights into how these work behind the hood yeah I think that's a very interesting question I think we also had a Blog around it um as well on our site on how this encryption works but yeah underlying we use like this threshold cryptography so the decrypt so every file gets its own unique decryption key and encryption care decryption key which are whatever you want to call it and then that key is splitted using threshold cryptography like BLS cryptography and split it across various Lighthouse nodes and none of the nodes know the full key part of the file so like they cannot decrypt the file on their end but when you as a user you authorize from your wallet as I was showing on like signing from your metamask so all of those Lighthouse nodes verify on their individual end that does this user have access to the file and then they share their key Parts which is aggregated on the client's end so we also you know open sourced our uh this SDK as well so for if people want to use it for other storage systems as well you can do that uh let me call it coverage so underlying it uses a threshold cryptography to make this magic happen and let me see what's the another question how many sites have integrated the wallet um I'm not sure what does that mean how many sites have integrated the wallet if you can again ask what do you mean by that um and Manu asks can we use Lighthouse SDK with ionic framework or app gear I think what I'm not sure about these Frameworks uh I think these are primarily front-end Frameworks if yes so then just post it on our Discord channel one of our team members should get back to you on how should you do it but essentially if ionic already supports npm package then you should be able to do it and then there's a question on how do endowment Pool Works so yeah right now uh this endowment pool is not totally live it's like live on a test network uh but it like we just got it audited uh last week and then it will go live mainnet in the coming um month but yeah what you can imagine how how endowment Pool Works is you can imagine it like a Dao which is controlling the spool of funds and the spool of funds and show that our files as total perpetuity so when you pay for a file some part of it goes to the Falcon miners as per the replications you have asked for and the remaining amount the buffer amount goes to this smart contract Biz endowment pool which is uh like Collective for all the users buffer amount not just you but every user's buffer amount goes to this endowment pool and it will be transparent so you can check okay what's the estimated uh amount in the pool and how many estimated number of years this pool can support and this also accrues fees through D5 protocols through our encryption bandwidth and other functionality uh usage as well as those generate fees and yeah another question is will we will support hyperspace test net will have support yeah definitely I think uh it should be added in couple of hours hyperspace test net uh but right now wallaby is already live but hyperspace should be done soon so we'll update on the Discord as well when it's done in couple of hours or by the morning and then the question is how does Lighthouse decide a judge what a good implementation is so I think um yeah just make something which could be interesting again It's tricky to say like how what would be the best implementation but uh I think they're like bunch of projects that you can refer to in the e-global um projects history as well so just see okay what are the winning projects and what are like common Trends between them one thing that I would definitely encourage us whatever you do you have enough time so make that thing live host it on a let's reversal or any other platform that you prefer or like just make it live so that people can actually users can actually go and use it so I think making the product life as much as possible as much as usable and not just keeping it localhost or on your GitHub would definitely be important and Lighthouse SDK you can use it either for storing your data or it can be used for like this encryption and token gated functionality as well so obviously if somebody goes far to you know leverage all the functionalities that we have that makes up extra marks for them but generally you can also use it for uh like storage like even public file storage as well that should be no problem and another question is what's the maximum storage we can use for free so like right now whenever you sign up like using your wallet you get 1GB free so we can uh like this increasing the storage capacity part will go live officially in the coming week but meanwhile you can uh message us on Discord if there's like more amount you want for this hackathon purpose you can manually top it up as well but yeah I think those are some of the questions and happy to answer if there's any more questions from the audience foreign live all right uh I guess that's all the questions for now um as Nana said if you have any more questions um oh it looks like someone's asking if you could post the GitHub URL um but otherwise if you have any questions um feel free to join the lighthouse um Discord it is posted in the sponsor Lighthouse Discord channel on the um space warp Discord um and I'm sure someone from their team would be more than happy to answer and oh and the discord's right there and otherwise knit it thank you so much for um actually I think you're getting a couple more questions if you want to answer them yeah so I've posted a GitHub link as asked by Julio and shekhar is asking what specifically a data Dao is so I think that's a very interesting question and I think there's like bunch of resources as well that you can refer to on like Google around us but essentially I think how most of the um Dows that we have seen on ethereum are you know collaborating around just pool of funds I would say data Dao uh users can you know have um like control over data maybe they can even contribute to that data together and even monetize uh that data as well so let's say somebody like even let's say open AI which is like one of the most uh great examples of what's happening in the AI right now with the chat GPT model so imagine if a lot of users together come together and have let's say genetic data in one place and they let's say all hospitals in a place they collectively pool data resources and they control and they can let's say monetize that data and also let's say if somebody wants to use that data uh they can let's say have an on-chain royalty or something like that to access it uh but I think yeah this is something a topic that you can learn more about on you know like fileco insight as well but generally you can imagine it like a way to uh collaborate Lee bring data together and even monetize data and I think that could be very interesting uh use case that people should explore so for example I know one of the projects which is building one fpm right now they build something called as Glacier Dow so like how GitHub had their Arctic code walled I think Glacier Dao is doing that same thing with uh let's say users can bring in their code repos and then uh that is stored together and maybe there's a way to monetize that and maybe in future somebody can run compute on that let's say GitHub has their own GitHub co-pilot but somebody in future can use Glacier Dows or data and Glacier Dao contributors can be can get paid uh whoever like as per their contribution to this Dao so but I think even if Global there was a summit previously so there's a video on this like f evm submit unlocking data dose with fpvm so must check this what these guys are doing with Glacier Dao language Tau Etc so those could be a starting point um but yeah I'll also drop in some of these resources in um uh Discord as well and is there any other question so retrieving data from Lighthouse can be data time specific again this is something that maybe you can ask in our Discord uh right now I think it's like on the Block time so let's say if you wanna uh excess control it that the file can only be viewed after some specific number of blocks then maybe I think you can multiply that with like whatever the block time is and then get uh the amount for which the file will be locked but if you are asking specifically for uh like let's say log discontent for next one year this is something you can ask in our Discord but I think right now we support just block times yeah no thank you so much Amanda for taking the time to do this Workshop um and thank you so much for the rest of you for tuning in and asking so many questions um definitely feel free to keep asking any questions you have in their Discord Channel um and with that being said um I hope everyone has a great rest of your day and the hackathon officially starts tomorrow so excited to see what you all build thank you bye everyone goodbye thank you
