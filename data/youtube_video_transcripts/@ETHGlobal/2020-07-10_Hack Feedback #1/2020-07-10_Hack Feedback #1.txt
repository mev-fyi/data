[Music] okay we're good welcome everybody is the first time I get to say this but happy end of week one it's been quite a week I know a bunch of you have been attending stuff since week zero there was a couple workshops last week and now there was a bunch this week so kudos to everybody who's been coming out to these workshops and all these sessions been a blast so far I knew I'm learning a ton and people are building stuff are probably learning even more as they're as they're digging into all these projects and all these sponsors so as the event title suggests this is the hack feedback session and as the first one it's going to be focused on ideas the big picture of what you're building and to help give feedback we've got a bunch of experts in ipfs file coin web 3 all sorts of good stuff with us here that includes smart teen from the graph one from plough poin Carson and Andrew from textile Co else we've got and at egons here from the graph hope I didn't forget anybody don't hold it against me but yeah so what the format will be is hackers we're gonna we're gonna limit it to one person per team speaking so if you have multiple team members it just pick one person to speak for your team and you'll have two minutes to talk about what you've been thinking about try to keep it general we want to want to have you talking about the ideas you've come across where you're considering integrating any sponsors you're thinking about just try to give us a general framework of your idea and any challenges you can keep my face and what you're considering to be building for the next few weeks as part of hackathons okay and my PA enough talking for me is anybody have any questions before we get started give me a wave or drop it in the chat and I can answer juan has a question hey never the questions just super excited to to see what everybody's working on and yeah oh yeah and I wouldn't want suggestions was that we do this and take notes in a collective doc so we can collect all the links that are suggested I'm gonna get that started typically what we'll do is we'll have people sign up ahead of time but this is a little more loose so we'll just take people jumping in as they are ready so whoever would like to volunteer themselves go first now is the time to do that who's gonna be brave karate you beat out tightest by one second so unmute yourself give us maybe a one or two minute summary of what you're working on and then you get some feedback all right well thank you very much for the opportunity to speak and I want to thank you all for all the content you've already preached and given me for the low low price of free I still know when I used to pay thousands of dollars for all this education I have dated myself and I did go to Berkeley not Stanford but anyway so aside from that my app is described and Springs comes from the word to scribe which is Dean's crying most people don't know it's not Deen crying it's Deus crying although everyone you're smart about it to me and so described is to describe it basically an off you skate this secret knowledge and that's the title of it and so essentially my actual dog give you the real goal and put it in there is to build a platform for people to publish on the decentralized web and be able to do subscriptions and maybe eventually do pace around all those other okay and so but I have it very tight right now because I have a tendency design these wonderful products that nobody's ever seen anywhere because they're all like about 66% finished you know in a trash can someone so basically what I've learned this week is how to integrate the different platforms together I was already looking at textile and powder date before I came in here but fleek really is coming in really strong I was very impressed with space demon yesterday and what I'm basically going to be doing is I'm building user stories I have a Trello board on my on my repo I am hack solo you know I know I didn't come up with that name someone else did but it's stuck and that's also because I want to learn how to build an entirely integrated application I don't actually quit working for Amazon to build a decentralized web I quit about a year ago and this is what I'm doing so that's the technology some time together to be aetherium ipfs I might use wire which I didn't mention those you guys all know why right because people need to have multiple on boards and the kick off for this was that I was trying to describe subscribe to the defiant those of you who know the dudes defy that know she has a wonderful blog she's worked for Bloomberg but all the friction like bank lists diplomat on with us it's a hideous on board it's terrible though they want me to use the credit card I'm trying to get rid of so that's really what the rule is and I got that from Eric Raymond the guy who wrote the cathedral in the bazaar which is if you're at the rule of being a hacker is to solve your own problems because someone else probably has it and solve it once [Music] sorry everybody should be able to unmute but it looks like setting may be a little finicky right now so yeah yeah they were administering it yeah that's really good could I ask a couple questions and then just to see if I can be helpful yeah can you maybe talk me through higher thinking of integrating the pieces or like maybe like what I could what components do you expect to be to have like what what are the kind of architectural components of your app so right now the current infrastructure is I mean you use something like Jekyll which is a form of basically static blog that you can post to the web that's the first part I'm thinking using textile buckets with creating the organizational key by the administrator the platform administrator that I'm going to send an invite created great for each month each month will have an encrypted group bucket that when the user subscribes they get a key to that right and they have forever has access to that content cuz that's how it rolls right they get a month and that's it and so then I thought about doing the first month three eight free and then the way book addresses it's probably gonna be array on a smart contract when they send the transaction to it you can read from it that's the basic idea right now yeah that's it somebody can click somewhere again I want to thank anybody didn't see the presentation watch that video today yeah it was definitely a good session earlier highly recommended even with even with the hiccups the experience it's still great if there's not anything else for karate we can move on to the next person all good all right just this is a reference if you just want to go next just add your name on that doc and we use that for taking notes suggesting links Titus I think we had you next yeah okay hello thank you for having me present here can I share my screen because you know an image gives more than thousand words yeah sure just remember you I hope you don't have a huge presentation plan because we just want to keep it short it's one screen that's the best go ahead okay so I did this mock-up today I had some pre-existing stuff but do you get my screen okay so the idea is I have been building this this content identifier which is basically a fingerprint so it preserves components for example if you have a JPEG image and the PNG image with the same visual content and this part of the identifier would be identical and so it takes different perspectives on the on the data and on the parsed data and this is an identifier that everybody can create from the open source code that I have been building and the idea for hack of S is to build a registration application where you can register your content in a smart contract on a cereal which would just simply drop an event that this this is EC identifier has been registered here by this address so this would be as the signal to the world and maybe put some metadata and preview data and DJ granular fingerprinting data on ipfs or fine coin and then basically give the user back a short identifier which is owned by him and multiple people might adjust to the same content and get a different short identifier so it's your also it could be registered anywhere else the contents so that's it that's the basic idea yeah what are the what are the some guess eights so I here this is my contract and there's some registry of information and tracking that how are you modeling the registry well the registry is basically it is it's a meta registry so you the short code that comes up is basically by parsing the contract events and maybe even parsing other blockchain so you could register this IC code on on any blockchain which implements the protocol and you have a metal registry in Excel I have been thinking about maybe the graph would be a match for that if they integrate more blockchains so you you basically watch the immutable stream of events and create these short IDs which are then basically binding the IDs short owned and binds the content to the identity who registered it and from one short ID you can find all the other people who have registered the same or similar content and from a fully as you see you can find all the yeah got it and if so I'm hearing so there's these events happening on on the on a chain or multiple chains that are creating these kind of individual items that are being added over time and they're they're getting a shortcode registered to them that make sense are you kind of grouping together those so is your time to kind of have a process outside of the chain that gathers all of those and then links them together into inter chain of itself of its own so that you can see the entire registry or you kind of keep them separate and basically it's just a protocol we might have a an open-source implementation which you can run to build that then index and it will depend on what metadata and how we standardize metadata what you can do with it in the end but the idea is to have an open public space of standardized fingerprints and data which enables developers to to collect data on which basis they can build like content matching stuff or whatever they want because today you cannot do that because all this fingerprinting data is owned by big corporations is proprietary and internal I Google and other big companies hold all the fingerprinting and matching information for for all the content and we want to Democrat democratize that and standardize that yeah got a premonition it would be think through even without having to to actually build any of that think through like two or three use cases for is to see meaning like how like think of like a concrete ways in which people would be using the metadata itself that you're you're aligning so the title description and any other information you're trying to gather and then as you think of those use cases consider consider whether or not you need to you need to make use of that index or not because if you do you may have to do a lot more of the kind of modeling of that index itself and and how to make it part of the protocol meaning meaning um like it may be beneficial to just establish it there's going to be for sure an index and so on and here's how it works but but it kind of depends on the use cases so I would maybe maybe might feel that could be get a get up some more concrete perspective on over those use cases and how how to serve them yeah yeah ok quite quite quite some use cases we have a lot of collection there we are talking to to I saw we are have a I saw working group and we have experts from 30 countries from the commercial publishing industry which we are discussing use cases with so there are basically many the idea is to have some content identifier that is in the usual sense does not just identify data because I think what what what the CID from ipfs is doing it is identifying data it's not a Content ID it's a data ID because it's a cryptographic hash and what we're trying to do with ICC is have a higher level of traction because it really identifies in a more abstract manner the the perceptive content are you talking about it the metadata because you can you can model the meditators parts of the graph and you can use see IDs to map to a point in metadata are you saying like I think the benefit of putting a spar contract on it is that you have a stable identifier that can mutate right so if you have a stable identifier that you can then map to updating the metadata for example you you add to the minute in the future without changing the identifier I think that's the utility of having it on on a smart contract if you don't have if you don't need the immutability at all then I don't think that you need a smart contract at all you can just model that metadata you can put all the minute data and say a textile thread and you can be building up this registry with all of the all the data structures that you're describing like title description and a whole bunch of other meta data and you can accumulate all of that in a in a chain of claims and a chain of records that that doesn't have to be rate limited by a blockchain so then you can grow way faster and don't have to deal with a transaction cost of a blockchain but um but but if you if your goal is to have mutable identifiers then then definitely yes definitely use the smart contract and and mutate that but at that point like really make use of that no I'm more I'm more talking about having identified that basically preserve now you see this is the JPEG image with color and this is the TIF image smaller and there's a black and white so it's completely different data and if you decode the the ID you can see that the data and the instance ID are different for the two images but the content ID and the meta ID which is then generated from the metadata stays the same so it's basically a hash that changes gradually depending on how much the contents changes and you can index the identifiers itself because it's a 64 dimensional vector which puts the semantically syntactic identity into a 64 dimensional space which you can search so you can search similar or near content just based on the identify itself so that's the main idea awesome any any final comments for Titus I was thinking about what I have one question I would be interested in how maybe I'm not sure if it makes sense to to integrate the IACC format or identifiers into into the multi formats world I could use help there maybe yeah I think I think it would be I love you kind of look mo more closely and play around with it and give you a bit more feedback would you mind dropping a link to the is that if that's live somewhere would you mind talking a link in the do you want to have this demo or the site I send you both yeah whenever you have a don't do anything special for me I can definitely just come in whenever you as you progress in your hack and and and so on but but yeah I'm happy to happy to play around with it and give you giving okay great thank you Titus and remember if anybody it doesn't have to be just one giving feedback anybody can jump in if you have a question or a comment feel free to take part in this this is meant to be a collaborative collective thing next up Sherif are you ready to go hey how are you okay so we're not as technically advanced there's a lot of people on this group I think we just have a good idea maybe two months ago three months ago so definitely not experts I think we could use help on is maybe a lot of guidance but I'll tell you the idea very quickly it's it's a concept so that you know you get into the strange for yeah the tenant in the land moat and we're trying to create for the different apartments that you'd like or don't like and at the same time you have a previous tenant that can show the apartment and get a rebate on their rent so I'm going to this quickly because I don't we have two minutes but I think the core idea was will do that off the blockchain so we did work and solidity a bit and tried to code that our issue was you know marrying the front end so the middleware I guess is what it's called and finding the best way to create a verified way to verify some of these users coming on platform because the the core part of this is really just and lumping them together to be able to get you know a better rate at the bank or whatever so that you know instead of you know getting peanuts off of the interest you know within a year you're actually getting some real money back landlord of course us for so the simplest concept is trying to create a bid for a property the landlord has the ability to see a property so the bidders bit as well as their credit score and their background and be able to quickly make a decision and once they've sort of selected that person automatically they get our account as the service provider and the first and essentially what happens is when you have a number of users just deposit three thousand dollars because I'm making this really good do a lot of you know financial products off of the back so that's that's the concept in a nutshell I think what we where you know that front-end fluid legal for the future as well for us in the sense of building a database so I don't know how how much depth I need to go to in those two minutes to be able to explain this because I'm sorry I heard a lot of different presentations I just don't know how to you know bring things together technically our team is sort of trying to struggle with that we're still virgins so any help on that would be would be lovely awesome thanks for the summary first question is what have you looked for are you building your own claims network or verifiable claims framework no yeah I think that's something we would probably outsource so that's something we're looking to see what what channel is there that we can like an app on our website before where I did you know a verification of my credit score and it goes to Experian and remember the a checker so and then it automatically gets that file and that was part of what we're trying to build into here but I think the key for us is really being able to all this secure without any of the complications that you have in dealing with a broker and someone try not you know up you on the price everything is transparent everything is there you're taking away the middle and it saves money I mean I think this is a scenario where everyone saves money in the process and actually can make some anybody have any comments or feedback what about something like I was just trying to think of how to get rid of the credit and everything yeah please awesome what if you just so this would be the two-step process what have you just let the renter's stake and so you could put up say a year's worth of rent for the opportunity and then you only get that back when you're done renting now what do you do for renters they can't afford that what if that stake earned an interest so as long as the stake existed the person who's renting you the place would pay back to the interest because they get this guarantee that you'll keep paying and so you could have other people's stake for you and earn an interest on that stake that they make that's an interesting concept have you ever looked at that angle honestly they're like so you could socially ask people like a girl that's my family to stake for my rent because I think the only concept that comes to mind is how fast can that sort of pick up versus you know the individual trying to do it on its own so but I think the optionality of that is actually actually being able to give someone a chance it's yeah I feel I feel like my landlord if they were if they knew that rent was guaranteed they'd happily give me say you know two three percent offs experiment off but instead just have that go back to the stake pool I think from from my side it's so that sort of takes care of that side how do we and we're trying to tie it in so that it flows nicely into the blockchain there's JavaScript is a lot of different learning as we go and I'm wondering is that conceived a little bit of that effort I don't know I'm not your guy for this I just there I think there's it I would also note that um there's a lot of countries around the world where they don't have very good financial infrastructure for this precise kind of problem and so being able to use the kind of super powers of defy to enable all of this I think would be would be amazing and and you could get a lot of markets to be a lot more secure for for a lot of folks right without having to rely on the local infrastructure without having to rely on local notions of credit or anything like that and so things like leaning into the advantages of that you get from like the defiance kept I think will be really useful in terms of the suggestions for the technical side of things I would probably recommend I think that there's you know a fair amount of complexity here in terms of building the application deploying it to as a as a as an app that you know people can can look at it's a website and then kind of user accounts and dealing with a smart contracts and whatnot I think super-new if everyone in your scene is super new to all of this you'll probably struggle with with a lot of that both of those pieces and so we'd recommend either trying to find trying to like level up your team's knowledge by maybe finding another teammate that is so another person that might be looking so looking for things or working or or taking or like finding a way of getting a lot of guidance over time through office hours or our discussions on chat of like hey you know how we're trying to do X how should we do that and just asking for a lot of help on on architecting the the the buffin because I think if you if you kind of nailed that architecture upfront then you you may be able to kind of make it through like this little hack without without having to uh to to learn a ton about all the pieces but if you if you're trying to figuring out as you go then then I think phonology is gonna be really key and so having a having somebody in your team that can sort out a lot of that those those pieces will be really important thank you so much one appreciate that we'll definitely reach out to you guys in the hours and try to see how we can work this out definitely a big this is an online market for example the MVP is four properties first so it can have the ability to list these properties and so there's gonna be an order book type of component there's gonna be basically a matching component right then there's gonna be the smart contracting component and so the things that I said was when you design your MVP for something like this I'm very good at like so you want to break these into modular component so you can build a very basic system that you can present right and then get out there as quickly as possible so that people can see it and so I just wrote think about the data structures what is mutable what is not immutable what does identity what is not an identity what is gonna be browser-based it's gonna be on Kane what is gonna be off chain and then you can look at what's already been built there's a lot of stuff out there already you can look at and then you can compare it and make it better but there's so much this product is like it just goes on forever as a property owner I can imagine if I could move there's so many things that the service market there's so many services that would love to integrate this I'm talking about what like I recently had a leak I'm in a condominium controlled building right so the owners like to deal with all these things insurance markets servicers this idea has okay yeah that's exactly you hit the nail on the head I mean I think what we're trying to start with is get the traction and all these ancillary services thanks guys thank you sorry no worries next up do web where you at yeah hi I'm graven I got Cody Hatfield on here with me and I'm not sure if any of our other team members are on here but we're working on a project we're calling Geo web essentially we're trying to build decentralized infrastructure in an administration system for a new type of web experience where user geolocation is the navigation the primary navigation mode instead of domain names so the idea is as we go from smartphones where we have a discreet interaction open up an app go to a website as we go to smart watches and smart classes where it's just a quick check or I'm walking down the street you can create a frictionless user experience if it's done in an orderly way and you're actually providing relative good content so essentially the linchpin is a DNS like registry and said domain names its plots of land there's one owner for every plot of land on earth and they have the right to link content to that and then the second big piece because there's other kind of a are property things on the blockchain is utilizing a harbor harberger tax system I'm not sure if people are aware of what that is but it's kind of like a blend between private ownership and shared ownership it's got some really simple rules that can be implemented direct with a smart contract it's essentially anyone can buy a piece of land but they have to self assess the value of that land and they pay a tax on that so they don't want to over inflate their their price but the catch is that anyone can buy that land for sale by paying that self-assess price so you get to that market equilibrium you get an allocated efficiency and you get essentially hopefully the good actors owning the piece of land and do it in a decentralized way rather than having to verify are you the real landowner you get the digital land near world-version so it's kind of it's a big project we're focusing on kind of the infrastructure and administration as it grows out they'll have to be like a browser that interacts with this some four different types of content they'll have to be different resolvers if you guys are familiar with how ENS did their their DNS structure and what else is there I guess the other really cool thing what I think this is awesome for ipfs is because people looking for content will be geographically clustered so a peer-to-peer method for transmission is the opportunity to be really efficient rather than the client server because everyone's standing right by each other questions I guess I forgot to say what it could be used for I said AR but it really could be any type of digital content from like simple data feeds you walk up to a restaurant and it shows you how long the line or how long the wait for a table or it could be something like high fidelity augmented reality content anchored to a location so you go to a park you see some art you go into a museum and everyone can have that shared experience of the authentic reality scalpel sculpture you mentioned believe you mentioned ENS and you're probably looking at a bunch of other things for what other prior art have you looked at and have you found any errors that you're planning to try to avoid or kind of how are you going to structure it differently than this this is excuse me way that it's already been approached previously yeah it's definitely ENS was a big time help them they've got a pretty elegant implementation we're looking at different things for how to define land and whether it's just geo coordinates like a polygon defined or whether if there's Google has an open-source tool called Plus codes that they've essentially gridded out the whole earth and they're all unique so some work to do there I'm not sure what the best best method is there as I mentioned there are other augmented reality platforms on blockchain but I think the big thing is the harberger tax and getting that allocate of efficiency to make sure the right people have the land and I mean it's meant to be open-source meant to be a public good so that tax revenue can be reinvested back into the system to create more social good I think is really cool really awesome idea I think that there's a lot of potential for for creating a a virtual registry of a physical land and and there's a lot of applications from from yeah like a are to games through all kinds of things I think that the idea of like yeah a bunch of the ideas and how to do the tax and so on yeah really cool to export of those I probably find a I probably break up the idea into individual modular components that can provide useful like can can be kind of like a useful building block for for something else meaning when you think of like the whole idea and the whole the whole platform there probably a lot there and way more than you can finish it within this time frame so really kind of figuring out like what what the MVP of the hack is - - and and ideally thinking about like these different components that could be could be used in in ways yeah I think getting getting to that definition would probably be a a really good next step oh and then from there you can derive like one of the technologies that you actually need to use and and how you get like a few a couple prototypes working I would probably emphasize getting to something you can test out with like actually users before like settling into hard into a model for the registry or a model for the for the app and so on just think of like the first people types of users has a way to like get a lot of understanding of how people are actually going to be using this because you might accidentally think the registry should be shaped like a and then once you go and spend a you know many many weeks building that then you realize actually there was some important fundamental difference that users really needed that puts you in a different spot so it would probably aim to go to like working prototype so quickly yeah I appreciate that we've gone back and forth whether we need to show the user experience of the administration first anybody else and that Carson has a ton of mapping mapping knowledge that he can get help coming up yeah we'd love some yeah it's my old my old stomping ground be happy to Andrew to actually our whole team has a geo background thanks Kraven and Cody Thank You Jimmy next up is Dave J carpenter show us what you got all right well thank you this is really cool so I guess the question is you know what's missing here what's missing out of this decentralized web and space and so forth and you know we've already had at least two projects geo web as well as Titus's project the iscc that's starting to touch upon some of the points that are missing and I think some of the points that are missing are the need for like a global directory and we are working in a similar direction on a global direct directory basically and it's but it's something that sort of sits above everything that we've talked about aetherium protocol labs all that sort of thing many of these projects are looking for you know discovery decentralized identity all these things we keep hearing this use case over and over and over so the name of our group is called phone web workshops and we have five team members and we also have another person that's associated with us who's hacking on his own is also on this session Randy Graham but Chad Islander is one of the team members but the idea is to stand up a blockchain that is basically consists of very very little information other than a pointer and a public key and strip it down to the bare bones essentials we plan to use go and live p2p for the construction of this directory chain let's say that anybody and everybody can use and the other part of it is it has to be Swiss neutral so that nobody can ever own it it can never be bought or sold and it's basically as open as as possible so I'm passed my two minutes I'll leave it at that and open it up for questions so just off the bat maybe one can speak to this even better but building a new layer one is very hard it's a big big problem so have you thought about how you might contain sort of limit the scope to the next few weeks because it's gonna take a lot of effort sounds like a big project that you've been thinking about for a while so wanna make sure that you're setting yourself up for a successful project over these this next short time well first of all I've been amazed at the tool sets that have been presented you know every time I think I know what a particular tool set is it can yata textile unstoppable domains and I sit in on these sessions there's always an aha moment where I see something that can be applied to this tier one directory we'll call it and Trent you're right I've been in this conversation about building a Tier one directory for a long time so I've encountered many of those issues but basically we're looking at three minimal pieces number one is a very stripped-down block chain that I'll call a Spartan block chain number two is some sort of example of the user experience and how all of us will be able to interact and put our data associated with this set of pointers and number three is a key piece to this working is there has to be a marketplace for the pointers because the pointers are not just you know plain vanilla one pointer is the same as another each pointer has certain unique characteristics much like geoweb there will be more desirable pointers than others it's sort of like cyber real estate so those are the three elements very simple blockchain very clean number two what does the user experience start to look like and number three what is a marketplace for these pointers start to look like that's our minimal objective I've never seen a fairly simple blockchain so I you what what is the basically what is the content açaí the wisdom have you have you any any plans on that yeah this is a new type of consensus algorithm with a new type of skin in the game and you know that'll be defined as we go along but I'll call it for the consensus algorithm proof of property rights okay so that's it and another key piece another key piece I mean you know part of this tier one pieces how do you get people do I adopt it and how do you get people to or how does it scale does it have scaling capability and yeah and another big piece that I see many people kind of overlooking is how do you create a marriage between human friendly and machine friendly so those are some of the key elements that we're working on yes one yeah I think um I probably echo the same the same thing that I said it is watchings are extremely complex to build and especially if you're making anything new and consensus you know be ready for a very large group of researchers having to spend years of work to produce the thing potentially especially if you're going to do something that hasn't been already kind of low hanging fruit that has been already made I would I don't think you need that I think what you need is just a trace and a record of you needed that the directory but you don't need to make your own watching I think you should totally just use something like a theremin or some other chain to to maintain the record and then just think about how to model the chain of claims and the registry itself and you could probably just do that over in the same way that EMS does it um on top of unit of aetherium you could also do it as a textile thread that you add and then you just stand into into a theorem or into falconers things like that and I would maybe focus entirely on the on the directory part and what is like what is the they utility of the names and and rebinding those and and so on and like actually making like the marketplace core for buying these names and and thinking about how those names get a good map to to content and other things like that and just get that part of working like don't get don't get um sucked into the whole building and an entire block and thing and just use do some tooling that's there now later on if you if you find a very strong need for making your own chain and so on you can address upon then but but I would claim that that's that's probably that's extremely unlikely thank you thank you for your all your feedback appreciate it all right yeah if you could if you have anything written feel free to if this it's a big idea you're trying to convey so definitely if you have written things share those in chat all right we're gonna we're gonna move on so we can get through some more people in Tangled storage are you still in here yes that's me go ahead never to keep it short so we can everybody all right so first off I'm glad to make it to the end of week one thank you very much for the great programming it's really learning a lot of stuff meeting cool people so the idea itself is fairly straightforward we just want to build erasure coding layer on top of IP FS so I am familiar with erasure coding as by itself I'm kind of new to the p2p world so I'm fortunate to have met some people who are more about burst or part of the team so the basic idea is to use this novel form of an erasure coating called entangled alpha entanglements which allows you to use redundant blocks reuse redundant blocks for more than one data block so with read Solomon encoding for example you just have a data block that sorry hurts a bad note background noise well yeah we three Solomon coding you'll be able to use redundant blocks only first one certain data block but for entangled storage you can actually use redundant blocks for more than one kind of data block so four different files that are on the network you can use them in it it's fairly straightforward works with XOR so that's that's all there is to it in terms of the idea I think the challenge so far has been for us we're like I mean I think this is just a research base we haven't even gone to development yet which will probably be like next week yeah it is going to be like I mean finding out where to put it in the ipfs stack so I'm kind of new to the world of IP LD Lapita P in general I've heard a lot of stuff there I've done some stuff initially when I came into the hackathon I was thinking of integrating it with the distributed hash table layer I was thinking something have it like in Kedah meliha itself like and in like certain branches you have redundant stores or redundant data blocks across the branches so that it's accessible even if like like data blocks go down in like a bunch of branches but I've heard about IP LD end like the capabilities offered there so I'm kind of looking into that to see how we can leverage it so that's pretty much it as a description goes so what what is the use case so in the end I you are trying to recover data where you have bit rot and be able to recover data by the foo data is not there yes so either that or and we also want to simulate I think the end goal for us is to simulate like a lot of know churn either very high no churn or very unstable no churn it's like where random we know it's just keep dropping off I think that's the end goal for us we'd like to maybe benchmark it with just standard IP FS then reed-solomon codes and then alpha entanglements I don't know how ambitious that is at this point but I guess we'll find out over the next couple of weeks another thing I'll add is I've I think they're they're doing similar stuff in swarm I think the exact same team with Veronica I think she's the one who wrote the paper Veronica galini honest and yes I'm kind of in touch with her as well they're super helpful to like kind of give advice and stuff yeah and I'd also appreciate any advice if like I I know there's an open issue from like 2016 for further you meet Salomon coding so if anyone knows of any work or like that's happened so we don't have to wait you know reuse a lot of work I would also be really cool I don't know if you've interacted with Ignacio from the textile team he's not on this call but I'm volunteering him to give you some feedback on that he did some work on on this we had a internal team hackathon where he implemented just basic read Solomon for file coin and I'm sure he'd be more than happy to share any details here I'll put a link in the slack just to that demo yeah thank you very much this is really cool at the it's awesome I think if there's a ton of utility in a lot of different ways that this tooling can be useful in a bunch of different parts of the stack I think that the also if you need a couple kind of the how you use different schemes of erasure coding with what a specific algorithms you're talking about meaning like if you create a pluggable thing where maybe you have them in one at the beginning but it's relatively easy for other people to create different students that could become a pretty useful library that you can plug in to a bunch of different projects the I think the yeah it's been like a very long standing to do for the entire stack to think about how to how to integrate this in a bunch of layers I think you you have a lot of room of exploration and a lot of really valuable pieces along the way it may it may depend may be like yeah advice would be think of like a concrete looking very concrete kind of achievable goal for the hackathon to like show something that that either produces a library and that integrates it into one of the one of the pieces of cooling I think maybe power gate might be like a good a good a good example of like if you add it in as a feature either on top of or underneath on Formica alongside power gate it might be like a really good way integration point another point would be to go deeper lower level in the sack and start looking at seeing it as a library like right before you hit I confess where instead of like things writing to I professed their right to this other tool first they break up all the a chunk everything and that you get like the actual you get the actual like blocks of data and like the actual graph and then you take that and import it into IPA for us that might be also be a really good integration point I'm happy to talk to you through what different approaches to to writing this ruling I thought a lot about this this problem how to how to how to combine many different kinds of schemes with like a with an interface that is pluggable into inter different libraries like there's a lot of like thorny parts of this where you go one route you you make it very difficult to use in some other context so happy to what you do a later point and the I would say maybe maybe look for a and easy to implement algorithm at first I think there's a lot of what really awesome stuff in there she could land I would just use a library that already exists that you are comfortable with don't have to like implement I lost a lot of stuff yourself unless your goal is to actually get get some experience building that algorithm but you might just spend most of your time getting now working really well as opposed to getting the integrating it into products and integrating into other things part so maybe like really figure out like what what you want to get it what you want to achieve in this time period and what will be like I say there's like some other thank you yeah I think that the the yeah again I think it's a great really cool idea really great to like do the entanglements you could also think of I'll throw another nice application for this think of like creating a contract where or a standalone application where you add your data to it and it will entangle it with everybody else's data and keep keep like producing this very large record of stuff that keeps getting eraser coded into different different shares so then you produce like this large collection of content that is very difficult to to to to delete right so you can create the notion of a public record it is extremely difficult to to lose so that's like an application of things like alpha codes and so on but that's less than a profile basis and a per in a small piece of content and and you're creating like a very large ocean of data that is all entangled together so a lot of really good papers from mm I think talking about this where people were building systems entirely to entangle each other all you know large large amounts of data together alright hey I hate to cut it but we're gonna have to move on I'm sure one will have plenty of links to drop thank you thank you go before we move on to the next team let's let's try to get everybody to throw on their video and just throw up a one for the end of week one you just go to screenshot this is the closest we can get to group photo so wait for a couple more people to throw on their video see if we can get it full anymore all the pose of the pose awesome cool that wasn't so bad okay we're gonna keep moving next up is social activism platform Nestor hello thank you thank you first of all thank you for immolated percent okay the the project that I'm working is basically a platform of semi private profiles of tech and low tech savy Jones change maker makers and social activists to build on immutable profile that allows civil society organizations to allocate resource so the products that I'm planning to use our contracts Inara uni logging with Maine and textile which up I don't have it clear how to implement ideas so the feedback that I will not have are mainly two first ideas on you know the a profitable business model on it and second is on the part of semi private profiles because I mean the idea is to have this contract smart contract where change makers can post and create a record and multiple record of their actions and there is the you it didn't rip apart because I want to allow this cheese maker to do an action and adduction that could be public sometimes but sometimes private because let's say you're an activist that participated in an international democracy forum but you live on an actual charity gym so you like to steal other opportunity to your profile but at the same time you want to keep it private it means encrypt but a design at the same time you want to you want to provide like some sort of an exploration key to an organization you are applying for an opportunity for instance let's say they an organization that isn't a platform create a new opportunity for a democracy program number two or for 2021 and you want to apply for that so you want to share your profile and say okay you can access to all my records and some of them are public but some of them are private but do you want to have to give you know some sort like this key but this key like have an expiration date in order to you know to come back and lock the the information that you think should be private to you but only open that information for a specific opportunity in a specific period where they need to analyze you as a change maker of social activists decide if you are a right handed eight or not so basically that's area and I'm open to ideas so just to summarize you want to be able to reveal and conceal different bits of information at different times effectively but at the same time have it in a book chain you know invertible to prove that you already did those actions at a specific time build that trust so the first thing that comes to mind is Maci which is minimal look at a minimal anti collusion infrastructure which is sort of similar but it gets into ZK stuff so it's it might be a little bit to it I mean I'm not developer so this is all too advanced for me but it might be a little bit difficult to kind of wrap your head around something like this and integrating it but basically it allows you to do a vote on something without being able to prove what your vote actually was so it eliminates some eliminates some blackmail attacks for or bribery attacks for certain voting schemes I put it in in the notes for your section so maybe there's something you want to look into but I'm sure other people here might have a little bit more knowledge on that and others seems that you can possibly use thank you yeah one one thing that's mission so pattern we've we've recommended a lot of people utilize in your scenario when you want to use say private information that you only want available at certain times the cool thing about ipfs is you can put data into it but you don't actually have to share it to the network you can still get that hash or the content identifier back so what you could do in your scenario is say you could run your data through the hashing algorithm and then put that hash on the blockchain without actually hosting that data for the rest of the network so then in the later point in time what you can do is you could say hey this hash proves that I did this at this point in time but now that I want you to have that information I'm going to actually upload it to a node and share it all right yeah yeah thank you but but the idea that I'm not clear is how to create you know this revocable key is this key with an expiration in order to okay you have the information stored a private event you store in the blockchain who the hash no yes with a hash that is an IP address but how you will provide some sort of like a URL to an organization when you are applying for a next opportunity in order to say okay you can read all my traceability of all the actions that I did for this time that you are deciding if if I'm the right candidate or not but after that revoke that access that's where like there is a basic problem that anything you put into the map matrix stays in the matrix so even if you could revoke access there it is once it's on ipfs it's it's you never get it out potentially once you have any some information anywhere you can it's very difficult to pull back I think I think the a good a good direction with this is being able to show to be able being able to selectively decrypt some pieces of the content there's a lot of really good work on this I think what you're talking about necessaries is getting to a point where you can gather a lot of different claims that are very themselves verifiable encrypt those claims and make it easy to decrypt only individual claims and show them to another party now if they go ahead and leak that claim to the rest of the network and and show and so on yeah then you know it it's kind of hard to get around that that's just a general problem with computers you can't really prevent anybody from leaking something in one leaked but um but at the very least you can definitely get the get the ability to have immutable records of of claims that um that are kind of like or yeah immutable in the terms it's an append-only log of records and claims that's growing but then you can tear selectively decrypting for specific parties and I think there's there's a few libraries around around that I recommend looking at house e cash did this for the allow you to selectively decrypt only some of your transactions so you can show them to a certain party like if a party is trying to audit you or something you can selectively decrypt a portion of your transactions to that party and it's this kind of this kind of work there's other works in in kind of like medical record space where people have been thinking about this problem of how to do how to do specific decryption of only a subset of a data structure and I think this this might be something really cool to build on top of of textile threads where it may be really useful to have a textile thread where you're accumulating all these records and all these these are you're kind of like pointing to all these data structures that that um that accumulate these claims but the claims themselves are encrypted with individual keys so then you you you are able to kind of just hand out those keys and selectively decrypt those pieces and that was so kind of like the most of your problem in terms of aggregating the records for a specific party then from there to create like this broader registry with a lot of people and so on like that's not harder but that takes it in a different direction I would probably encourage you to kind of break this up into pieces and then find one piece and get a demo working for that piece during the hackathon right I mean I think I would just maybe have a look at proc cerium Krypton yes that does exactly what I was going to say it so perfect timing thank you yeah combining that with threads would be probably great you can encrypt at one time and then use proxy encryption for specific parties awesome I put a bunch of these comments in that dock so make sure to check that out Messer all right we're gonna keep pushing next up is Josh Purcell with web three contacts thanks guys hopefully this will be quick I've had this big idea and I've tried to boil it down to something that's really doable doing the hackathon but it's an automatically updating contact at so you would just update you would just put your contact information in this app eventually it would be like a mobile app potentially but then you would have you would share that with other people and then you would be able to request information hold on one second sorry sorry about the background noise but you would be able to request contact information from other people and then he would slowly build up an address book and that contact information from other people they would be able to update it themselves you don't have to worry about it my grandma would not have to worry about remembering what my new number is but over time you would just have this address book that would be automatically in sync I'm thinking about a threads DB he would be a perfect database for this but keeping it in sync and also you know changing out the information to the new hashes that's something that I haven't figured out entirely but so far I'm not running up against any particular blocker and interested to hear what yet see yeah I mean without trying to make this into the thread show I think that's a perfect application for that and essentially if you have like a well-defined structured like identity or like address book schema then the like automatic update of those would happen like it there it's it's mutable so the thread deviate handles the sort of like mutating state through all these immutable updates so in addition the cool thing there is that you'd end up with like syncing state like syncing contact states but you'd also have a record of like the history of that so that you could trace back and since I swore that like so-and-so's address was blood and you could actually trace back and see like when that address changed you know potentially audit your friends yeah you know that's always fun when you can correct your friend and a conversation no actually I think you changed your address on this date so yeah I mean that seems like a perfect fit the mobile piece is is a little bit more tricky but something we're really interested in supporting so we can we definitely like to talk to you about that yeah I think that the schema around the profile would be like ceramic looks awesome three box in ceramic or both really like that's I think one of the reasons why I'm here at the hackathon so that plus textile or the the big technology I'll be focused on awesome yeah and Andrew just posted in this in the chat here yeah if it's a react native web app that's actually good to go we do have libraries working there so it could be a good MVP on some things perfect let's keep moving with the next video hello everyone I'm Andrea and just to clarify I started coding three years ago and that's when I when I found like open block chains like refugio so my knowledge is pretty we focus on what three I don't know so much about web too so maybe I say something anyway our goal is to build a fully decentralized app so we thought we could do a like kind of video vote for a content creator so I kind of teachable calm but decentralized so they're they can store their content and we were thinking about using a smart contract type like use one to give them the possibility of every content creator to sell his own authentication token and make people only who have their token on the wallet to be able to see the content and that's more or less what we're trying to do we are like looking a bit about textile about the way for storing the content in a private way and we are trying to research if we can make like a multi most multiple steps of private data and and more or less is what we are trying to do they our goal is to make it like pretty simple like just if you buy like a full-time membership like buying their token and all day of the content creator and being able to access the content so at the moment I have known so many questions but I will have them the next day exist so I hope I can reach you out yeah I'm assuming you staked for the event but unlocked protocol is the service we use for that and it provides a really similar functionality so if you're looking for inspiration or want to see some some projects that have already done some work in this look up unlock protocol and I know there are probably a few others in the etherium space especially there's a lot of content creators I'll have to find which ones I can't remember the names now but unlock it's definitely very very similar to what your your base yeah I think there's a lot of really good use cases there just being able to kind of share share content and media that you can unlock either for for a fee or for or with specific token potentially just getting doing something maybe on top of like um like a bucket or something where you where you make it easy to produce a a website that is itself a encrypted most of the content is encrypted but it has kind of like though the part of the web app that allows you to put in the key or something and then so you can get people a link they open that link and it gives them a box that where they put in a key if you get that piece working then you can integrate something like unlock or some other protocol to figure out like the payment and and whatnot to then turn that box into like a you know pay here to a lot unlock this content and so you can have like these like self instead of thinking about a large platform you can think of like these individual statically hosted sites that you know are kind of like pay-per-view and and sure somebody could like pay ones they crypt it and reshare it or something but you know like so you could you could also record like a Netflix stream so I think with enough friction it's good enough and you can get a pretty good prototype of it working and then you can solve the harder problems later I probably recommend back pockets for that we're like you can have like a little filesystem and a bucket for for that individual site and so it would be like thinking of the thinking of making like the HTML page that allows you like to do the decryption directly in the browser so we could like use like subdomains or like in order to make like every single main you totally could do that and if you want to go to the more platform route you can definitely create like like a thing with subdomains and you can have the accounts of users and show the activity tivity and so on I kind of see that that is kind of like an fork in the road for you we're doing one of those things is gonna be doing the platform route or doing the making the encrypted piece working will be quite a bit of work so you may want to do you may want to focus in one of those and get to like a really good MVP with that and then think about how you integrate the other components so yeah maybe narrow narrowing down the MEP will will help this help you decide what do you think is more valuable for this this great thanks any final comments I have something for you you might want to look into LCP it's quite it's an open source kind of content protection system I'm not sure if it's a good fit it's called LCP and it's coming from the e-book industry and you had a link in the I try I have to look perfect all right let's you want to well if you're talking we can't hear you let me see if I can unmute you will can you hear us let's try this again calling will if you're using wireless or Bluetooth headphones sometimes they have issues connecting with zoom nope still nothing yeah well once you try to get that figured out and will swing back to you next all right Eliza if you're ready to go you can hear you yeah can you hear me go ahead Liza okay I'll try to solve this with will all right cool I think's thanks for organizing that phone I've been learning a lot our idea is kind of to solve a very specific problem that we're having with with with a platform that we're building for it's it's essentially an ad network for VR one of the one of the problems that the advertise an advertiser might want might raise with us is as is they've got a lot of pixel data that they send over to us from a Unity game and they want to make sure that we don't we don't own this data that this information is kept kind of by them but but we also need to have access to this information in order for us to calculate the conversion on on our ads so when we when meet when we put up some sort of ad creative on our end we can we can understand where these you know we have some sort of unique identifier for the user and essentially what we're doing is we're doing a set overlap calculation over some sort of identifier such as an IP address and we kind of calculate this intersection with what we have and then we'll what what the ad advertiser might send to us essentially we want to decentralize that so we don't own any of the prof identifiable information so that stuff like GDP ours as complied to and like the ad kind of business and industry has always been really bad about this sort of stuff and yeah essentially we're hoping to use ipfs hopefully encrypting encrypting this PII sending it to ipfs and then doing a some sort of computation on it but some sort of third third party I think there's a lot of uncertainty around like where this computation would be done and I've looked through a kind of a lot of the issues in ipfs and the github and there's then like I think I think some some chatter about like how private information like is it really private if it's encrypted it's like available to everyone like that sort of thing so I would love to hear more about your thoughts on on the idea as for the uncertainty isn't like it like a good path forward for for solving this with ipfs and I've also looked into like the textile white paper and there's probably some there was I think there's some solutions there and so um yeah I think this is really cool I think very interesting problems I think that the the question of hey you have some cyber attacks and people might leak them will always be there I mean it's there right now we're right now talking over something corrupted stream somebody could be grabbing the packets of our entire video stream later breaking the key extracting the keys and then decrypting the entire screen that's always there definitely the problem worsens when you have like the ciphertext permanently addressable so like not only do you have to catch them but like it's very easy to get them but I would but I would say like that's always gonna get solved over time with with protocols about collateralizing this kind of thing meaning you can you can collateralize protection of a ciphertext where if you find that ciphertext publicly around then you slash into my career seen immediate collateral so you can think of of tooling like that existing you may not be interested in doing that you're just kind of us can assume that that will exist in a certain amount of time might not be in the next year but they you know I wait I would predict that in three or four years like this will definitely be it kind of be a bit easy to do the maybe the the more interesting part of what you're describing is the ability to do that computation and say okay great like you're you're moving some that you have some data stored in a bunch of places how do you do like an interesting computation market around that computation in general is pretty pretty hardest you you got into not only the concerns of the data that how do you verify that the computation was done correctly there's a lot of different potential potential worlds there I think what you were talking about in terms of said intersection it sounds like you're doing like proper verifiable computation like some using using some sort of preferred methods for this sounds really sounds really cool and I think you can you could totally play like a cloud a little cloud of verifiable computation for some specific problems I think you may if you don't already have a library for that that you could rely on and maybe I would recommend someone like this our works stark where staff or or a bunch of the snark libraries of people are doing you may spend many months getting that to work because the tech is really really wrong and really rough and like one mistake here like blows out the entire one small mistake and blow the entire encryption so maybe recommend my final library that already does kind of what you want and then focus on the past scheduling of how do you go from people submit data people like submit a one two want to apply a function over it and then you kind of run that the other direction you could take is is instead of doing verifiable computation and do something way simpler which is create a reputation market for this you have these these nodes that have some important reputation they stake money the reputation they run some computation and if people submit claims that they've you know acted unfairly you can have a public way of handling that like you could even like call in an anagram courts or something like that and if a stake is big enough then then like the reputation system will kind of kind of kind of sort out a lot of people have gone after another you know fully decentralized anonymous computational cloud and like it just a lot of the tech is not there yet like a lot of the verifiable computation generally you can't really do general-purpose verifiable computation fast enough to like really be super meaningful for a lot of use cases right and there's us links s-sorry you can also do a CX or some trusted execution environment type of thing I think you know X is like super hated for a lot of really good reasons it's it's it's a it's a bad um it's a bad model if you only have a few hardware developers on this but broader use of SGX my impression is a broader use of it will be a good thing because it'll cost more developers to produce other hardware so you could also go that route contract and yeah I guess this would for our for our application this is just for like for ads but you can kind of extrapolate this out to other kinds of computation there is also like an issue with like you would need some sort of data schema so that you know like so yeah cool cool [Music] and money streaming using severe and multiple token shops in one tab so we are trying to ease the process to manage to to and essentially so why we're doing it through hack hack offices because the data that is for the companies it's confidential right so we need to store them in a decentralized way and in an interpretive trauma so that's why I think it makes sense for us to use something like I give this file Conan textile so right now I think it would be good time for us to discuss about the architecture that we're trying to build yeah so for the decentralized and this encryption thing the architecture we are planning is to like using planning to use textile for it so let's say for each user we have this ffs instance ID and that ID can be stored in a smart contract in an encrypted form and and that encryption key can be easily deterministically calculated by you just private key so that he can just interact with textile and just store any encrypted data on it so so this is like the basic user authentication and encryption sort of thing we are planning so is it like this make sense and we want like feedback on it and who do you guys think Oh is I don't know if our team member Aaron is on the call throw him under the bus here well I was curious I was just curious the FS tokens I don't know if you can set those deterministically so that might be on consideration there I think it I think the power gate only generates them so but maybe you're talking about buckets because they're two different API so no power gate definitely like provides this token right so what we are planning is like we take the signature from user and our smartphone track will stood that s FF s ID in an encrypted form in the smart project whenever you want to interact with textile your authentication part interacts with our smart contract and that encrypted us to FF s ID is extracted and decrypted loopy and after that you just you know get the data from my PFS and sorry from power grid and just you know see that data and that that key which is in the data is deterministic using signature cara cara cara okay cool so what's the what's like benefit that you're getting from doing that flow exam not like actually familiar that much with your with your like the space of your air area that you working on so yeah just curious yeah yeah yeah so what we're trying to do is we're trying to manage crypto payroll for companies so we trying to make that easy so how to manage that in a decentralized manner so right now service that provides crypto companies to manage payroll right so we'll we're trying to do is we're trying to store all the confidential data in AI be efficient in encrypted form so that data privacy is maintained and there's no leakage of data plus what we're trying to do is essentially doing so right now the problem is the employer has a different token to pay and to use this feature where you can employ again accommodating token employees and that can happen for multiple employees in one single time so these kind of people today and you're also integrating money streaming and we're also thinking of having a delegated credit line from our way to provide to employers so there's a lot of lot of features they were trying to cover in the defy space so but data privacy is crucial for the project to succeed I think because don't have to not have to be centralized so yeah I think I think like I've been like in you know previously I was also like into this shoujiki recovery architecture like but now we have you know like lot more tools to develop such an decentralized fully encrypted application so previously like it was not there so I think that's why we had like totally focused on a decentralized service go um do you have any like readme or anything right now yeah nice we have we have a video demo I think this is a it's a good idea to be able to you know probably have infrastructure for for doing this kind of payroll and accounting and so on in a centralized setting I think there's been a lot of hope for that and yeah the private information piece is what prevents a lot of organizations from something on there so I think you're totally right that that's really key to do I think we now have like the right at least uh a subset of primitives that can put us in a better spot I mean you again it would be you could probably do not only into an encryption but also controlling which parties get access to the data you get a little bit of a policy restriction there to to decide which groups it's only the employer and the individual users who like end up getting getting those ciphertext so maybe that can help the I would recommend looking at the ad Aragon Aragon has done a lot of work on on building a bunch of UI to do the payroll and all that kind of stuff so maybe one direction you could take his think of hacking with Aragon and just figure out how to do how to make all the information that it captures the and to an encrypted by default so bring into an encryption to our gun might be a way to do this where where instead of having to replicate okay instead of having to do all of the UI and UX and so on and top you focus on that piece yeah you could also take taken a different route and it just focus me on the payroll piece and try to like narrow down the scope but I think you could you could easily like to just spend a ton of time making a thing without kind of like getting it fully working into end and so again I would like we've said elsewhere before narrow the focus on on something you feel like you can you can do in the next couple of weeks thank you guys for context parcel was actually they got their start or were heavily involved in hack money so we're excited to see them coming back for another event yeah so it is 5:30 sorry it is well 5:30 Eastern if anybody has to drop I totally understand but if there's anybody who can stay I think we'll stay for a little bit more we have looks like one and maybe two if we'll comes back and we get this audio working so if everybody's good we're gonna do one more at least maybe two cool awesome this has been this has been really great so far so without further ado Peter you wanna everybody can you hear me yes awesome I'm really enjoying hearing about everybody's projects having a good time in this hack FS thanks for the organizers our project is it started off I started off solo ended up getting a bunch of for other collaborators to join in so now we're a group of five so we call the project PI gate and what we're trying to do is bring Python to the thylakoid and ipfs ecosystem so right now a lot of tooling is for java javascript and go line developers so i'm very keen and interested in doing what elijah talked about and my day job is a digital archivist and i work in a digital preservation field and i see a lot of potential in decentralized storage on ipfs and follow and we do a lot of like pipeline processing of large batches of documents and government records and all stuff that needs to be private but that's a that's a bit of a long-term goal and so my short term goal is to be able to build something like that with the Python framework where I'm comfortable so for the hack if s four-week project I just kind of mapped out a bit of a road map and then like I said I end up having four great collaborators join me on this so the first step that we're working on right now if you guys can see that little concept diagram is is creating a Python G RPC client for power gate for textile power gate so that we can make all our calls from a Python library by a power gate and do all the get all the good functionality we get through power gate so we had our first hello world milestone with that yesterday so we created an ffs through the Python client and so we're making good progress on that and then as a second step hopefully we'll start in this next week we're gonna use the Python flask framework which is very popular in the Python world for web app web because it's a web framework for creating web apps so we're gonna move to creating a web application that uses that PI gate T RPC client to move data to and from the file a network and then to monitor storage deals so very baseline functionality from a web app and then this is a theory that we're all working on none of us have ever tried this before but there's some people out there in the community that have done this they've put flasks as a back-end into electron so so it's it's running an electron desktop client so that's gonna be our third step is move that flask application into an electron shell and then allow for drag and drop files from the desktop and then add more more sophisticated monitoring of the the various deals when they expire a bit of arbitrage like finding the best deals that kind of stuffs and visualizations and monitoring this this was planned before we heard about slate so I'm very interested to hear about the slate workshop this afternoon and this is very much I think kind of overlaps with what slate does but obviously for for JavaScript developers so I think there is gonna be a bit of overlap but it doesn't hurt to have yet another tool to be doing something similar and again opening it up to different world of developers and then if we get that far ideally what we like to do is add in the theory and smart contract that helps you that's going to be escrow so let's say I'm a user and I want to I don't want to be monitoring deals every every week every month of the year every day so I'm gonna put 200 bucks in my escrow account and say tell the client to renew deals every day every week every month like keep shopping around for the best file clothing deal out there and have that handled through a smart contract and and so the user can toggle the settings on what they're comfortable with as far as risk and what they're looking for is longevity and then reliability how many how many different replication copies they want on the file core network and then obviously but handle retrieval deals as well so that's that's our project and then the idea is to make these all stand each for component a standalone component that can be reused by other projects this is really cool this is awesome I think that the key RPC client for her power gate will be really useful to a ton of things so I think like even that with like a few example demo stuff like plugging it into other things like ipython notebook and or you know another tooling I think would be could be really really good I think one definitely come to the work the state works up I think you'll you'll get a lot of utility out of looking in that because Slade yeah it's on electron it does a lot it has a lot of the UI components and so on Slade is meant to be modular it's meant to give you a bunch of components you can plug plug and play and so on definitely in this JavaScript what you may come out of from the workshop is just a better understanding of thought of the like the work around all those deals and then what you you may something you that I would encourage you to do is think of like all the science application use cases of information flow in Python and then what you could do is like instead of doing an electron app that that kind of instead of trying like replicators like a lot of the same functionality in Python maybe consider using slated cell and using the election app that's there and then think of the next thing think of like think of that building hey what would be like a really cool application for some of the science use cases of mixing the mixing some of maybe it's about like mixing tensorflow with with this or ipython notebook with this or like maybe it could be a back-end for for your your notebook files or you know there's a whole bunch of like interesting integrations there where if you think of slate not just as a good model to to replicate but think of it as components to build on then then maybe but it can save you a bunch of time and and you can move on to like a like a direct direct application use case I think it's still it's still it's kind of like this Python oriented component and it would be kind of mixing the Python gr PC client plus some way of integrating Python components into slate itself and then that that could be build to be a really cool platform for doing all kinds of scientific their programming yeah we think there's a whole world out there that's it hasn't Falco not BFS hasn't tapped into yet so that's part of the motivation so thanks yeah I love all this obviously anything is super cool but yeah the Python stuff you're just unlocking so many different directions you could go from there that's so that's really cool so really excited see where you go I dropped in another one that I've been like mowing in my mind for a different for a different use case but it's it's basically basically being able to write PostgreSQL as foreign data wrappers in Python so then you could open up another whole world of data people that could use basically ipfs and and file coined deals in their PostgreSQL tables the actual data behind the deal so that might be a future hackathon but it's just like an idea of like just open hostilities yeah we haven't decided on the database back in for the flask app yet because that could easily Postgres as well we might just you know my distant secret like to begin with for an MVP but totally super cool and actually do have a question and you're like we we really for a client we want we're really counting on encryption and we love the fact that that's now I love with buckets and I think I've asked you this in the in the slack channel before but I guess we were kind of hope I we heard at some point I think maybe that there's gonna be bucket support in the power gate API is that is that true like will we be able to have bucket like functionality like we'll be able to use the power gate API and and to use the bucket function encryption functionality or do we have you have to use buckets separately so well yeah maybe just an explanation of the motivation there the power gate library is really meant to be a library that you can plug into different chains so it doesn't have really strong opinions about how you format your data like it just takes a cid and we'll start doing things with it in ipfs or file coin everything that like buckets does with encryption and folder management feels to me like a whole different set of problems that so we don't have a plan to like shove it in so that it's just there with the power gate but sander has been from from our team has been working super hard on getting buckets carved out to be a standalone thing so that you could run alongside whatever power gate you're running you could just run a bucket component so you could basically chain things through so you could like run buckets get everything formatted just like buckets does use the encryption flow if you want and then push it to your power gate instance and so you'll get everything you want there but you just would run it as two different components in the same service if that makes sense yeah that's right that's what we're thinking of doing already yeah so we're sprinting hard on that for you cool so no guarantee there cuz I don't want to put all right it's and you're under too much stress but we're working hard on it for you guaranteed to work right away with zero bugs cool yeah love all the tooling level those like it's great guys it's a great ecosystem really enjoying being part of it I know awesome are we got a wrap very soon for the six o'clock session but if we can maybe sneak in will let's give it one last try for your audio okay can you hear me yes all right it's the webcam mic I'm worried about reverb so I'm going to mute you all for the just a minute and as I go through it real quick I am working on a distributed proofreading system and I wanted to real quick if y'all can y'all see my screen can y'all see you can okay it is I'm working with the Hugo and nebula award winners it's just I wanted a problem that I really wanted to solve and this is a collection that I would really like to exist and have available my question now I'm going to ask since I have just a minute and I'm going really quick for this is for anyone who knows about textile I want to use force directed graphs to do the navigating of these collections to where this is the data that I've loaded from the internet speculative fiction database you have an award and then a year and then a an award category and finally a book wanna have these these books currently I can use the covers because the covers are not copyrighted in the same way as the works but I eventually want to have it's getting complicated number in that time my main question is whether or not for a graph type structure like this if textile is appropriate and I'll Carson I'm gonna leave that one to you I little I don't know I'll give you first pass on this yeah I mean textile is a protector like thread DB is appropriate for grass style structure in that any document type store could be appropriate for a graph type structure but it is not a graph database so it's like not optimized for graph quit like graph based queries and things like that but before I like shoot myself in the foot and you find something else we do actually have some people in the the textile slack community community that I've been doing some like graph QL wrappers on top of thread DB to like facilitate like true graph QL style queries and you can certainly represent you know like relationships between entities using like foreign keys and IDs between objects so it's you know for sure it's doable you it seems like a so you wouldn't actually store like is the graph data the database would be really just representing the like relationships between entities and things not the actual raw like works right so you will have it will actually eventually resolve to the content references they'll have a was thinking that they'd have a force graph like this but when they click on an actual book or they hover over a book they'll see initially just the covers but eventually through a distributed ledger I want to distribute fuller content and I came in for some there are some copyleft books in this in this set and there's also some public domain stuff so they when they browse down to a book I want them to be able to see the contents of that book right so then you'll definitely want to use buckets for the actual binary like book data so it'll be a combination of like sort of content addressing the actual content within your structured database but yeah I mean I think it's doable and ER it's just a it's just like kind of like a linked data challenge but it seems all doable but it gonna take some planning is all okay okay I would that is oh sorry I'm mage that one one more thought which is depending on the size of the graph database here look browsers are really fast and can deal with a lot of data now so you could actually just my impression is you could probably treat storing all these all the data in a thread anyway ten types of thread anyway or a bucket and put the entire like whole app alongside like all the static front-end app and so on and then if the data if the graph it is not super big then you could actually just load most of it into the browser if not all of it and then just process it there it might just let you work with graphs of you know hundreds of hundreds of nodes and that might be fine so if you think about maybe partitioning that data that way you could just you know how that how they work in that way if your goal is to make a much larger graph when you're dealing with millions of nodes then that point like you probably have to yeah yeah but it would be harder ok yeah I was wondering about the size constraints for these types of databases and whether or not scaling but it's not specifically these collections because they're relatively I mean there are thousands of entries two or three thousand entries but they're not huge just write benchmarking it just to try tried getting getting it all into the browser and then see if it works and then and then later well after you do that then apply the force craft my impression is the resource hog will be the force craft not the not the database okay cool wow this is a really amazing session I'm glad we actually ended up getting through everybody and then everybody's stuff around or uh giving feedback really great session we're gonna wrap got to get to the next session late at ten minutes but last quick plug at the end of week one we started a new thing with some of the people on the protocol labs team we are encouraging people to go to the showcase channel and share either short videos of their project or just a small update short video of you and your city with the words hack of festered on a piece of paper we're gonna put it on the big compilation at the end it's really cool to have people from all around the world so we want to celebrate that so there's two different kinds of videos you can make as well as they're looking for just a few sentences on why you were inspired to join that cough s and then that written section is going to go into a file claim blog post so go to go to the showcase channel share your successes make some short videos and write a little bit about why you or you think a confess is important why you think the DUI was important stuff like that and then to add to that there is Monday will be the first official check and we've actually had people asking when is this check-in gonna be I am been missing my check-ins don't worry we did them weekly and the first one is Monday so there'll be a little the place where you stake to the place where you did your application you're gonna go there you will write a quick very short four or five bullet check in just about where you're at with your project any blockers sponsorship plan to integrate is it's very short and it just helps the eath global team keep track of where you're at and help me resolve any issues so go to the showcase channel check-ins are Monday and we're gonna have a ton more things scheduled starting tonight setting up for week two great workshops office hours AMAs the fun is going to continue thank you again to the people who showed up to your feedback there's a really great solid content solid stuff and with that we will wrap this up
