so my name is CM Abbasi I am a Technical Evangelist and today my sock would be using either blockings this case specifically use me algorithm so here's our some members of the team a vase of oxygen whatever community baths or community organizers Russ another technique Phyllis myself Sylvia these are our co-founder this is one of our product managers Evans at the back where Brian here's this is our safe harbor statement okay so by the way we have a competition for you bees will not accomplish it's a watery so if you just scan this QR code put in your email and/or sir fill out a survey I'll give these out at the end all the way just like we're trying to figure out what our developer market fit is this is all in that effort in the sense that we can go after the more standard crypto developers or the etherium my chair or we can go after non blockchain developers given that we have the suite escapades modern programming language so this is part of our effort coming to conferences talking to everyone going through these surveys so these are at that dachshund pep talks are a bit overdone fellow get out I'll grant Ward and our SUVs founder dr. Slattery these everyone here is participating in our colony I challenge but first place is $1,000 a code drone and a tool back packets for my personal favorite that's backpacks that was going on and in second place is a goat in a matrix a creator and a Raspberry Pi 2 plus 2 matrix Creator is like an iOS device topography community sensors temperature sensor accelerometer gyroscope these are actually this is a matrix creator go attend is your profession networks which your great it is how that works but it basically a dome tenant communicates with another go antenna for radio frequencies so this effective product is designed for emergency situations more of these fringes with respect to internet access and you have an app on your phone that talks with Bluetooth so you need any cellular connection and Wi-Fi so so these people here familiar with watching is anyone new to prove transparent and there should be some sort of trust list trusted environment this is kind of a turn like a lot of terms into watching space that's quite ambiguous rates it's a very nascent industry so things like the centralization things that can be building even things like trust and influence or people being when they when they when they use it as a trust is a really important one or trust this trust yeah so again this is more of the general Bloch incredible but our centralized economies are clearly broken for multi reasons and we're here to try to fix that as best as possible so what is Al Green so a Legrand is a peer group from state watching I'll go into that in a second from your permission list we have very fast credit actually through good in finality depended about thousands yes less than five seconds of great walk and there is no 14 in the sense that the network itself consensus wise can't split mathematically and with this type of design in that architecture you have proven scales through the buildings of musics at a much quicker pace adoptions also part of that influences so the weird consensus channel works is through process called brf's so is everyone you've been really early the CK's Marx was your knowledge fruits probably heard of it mister so so Silvio our founder is actually one of the authors of zero knowledge groups one of the pioneers in photography so the RS are kind of derivative is the kiss marks in a way and that gives us or your class transaction people what's basically happening is that every account that has value as in it I'll actually read this just to make sure so then to the bureau's output when executed for an account this used to sample from a binomial distribution so the emulator call for every algorithm usually count the morality was a to account for greater chance to count as it being selected it says everything algo made an account participates in its own water so with respect to the decentralization when I mentioned earlier the Bitcoin space for instance talks about the centralization of perspective validating all transactions in the network if you are a participant you should be fully validating every single transaction it's never happen in the network that's happening down that will continue to happen what we mean decentralization in this case your incentivized to run our note because if you're participating in the economy or integrity reasons you want to make sure that your property is as maintaining integrity as best as possible both what we need in this case is more of economic conceptualization whereas even if you have moralities or more well than someone else the network you have as much of a fair chance to be able to not only get rewards the right to the blockchain but also vote on who is the person who gets the rewards if we get surrett from watching so consensus in that case in centralized this is more of our consensus so generally a one account is chosen to be post walk and then a committee is chosen to vote on that person of around a thousand you ever take sometimes it's more sometimes less and once that committee votes advantage of watching so it's practically very hard to break these consensus to break this model mathematically which is why we see this so we have the algorithm Foundation as well the Ida grant Foundation runs a monetary policy doesn't he token offerings the options and sets of war policy I'll grant Inc who I work for Devon works for I was contracted by the Honoria to build the test net that's awesome it's quite quite a tribute so obviously recommended that you first build a definitely test net so we have our own definite kind of right again that you can go test it and then an entertainment that's fantastic it's test let's get up to about yeah here and a half or so by the way our maintenance window mind for two months so part this is so if you guys invite tools so we have two main processes there's alguien que ng algo de maintains the integrity or runs the protocol credit and kmv is more of the wallet process so we have no consensus process happening in candy that's the more meant for Liberia wall development for both developers goal is our command line tool I woke user standalone command line and so that's just a bigger overview now we have things like clerk and ledger Clerk love your sentiments I see the cross sent functionality so STP is a swaggered it's a beautiful area to describe structure radios this is not swaggered up hub and sample code is generated from your language of choice as well so our SDKs are written in go JavaScript Java and Python now again this was designed to make it as easy as possible for a non watching developer to get into this I know when I was getting into watching etherion who is obviously the lowest barrier to entry to JavaScript how it reads but at the same time you're still barrier to entry because they have to learn you sweeping language now that's a very strange thing in the space because I think through their developers solidity is like central tenant it's like a it's you know it's a it's a unifying factor in who they are as a community we're taking kind of a different approach currently where we have SDKs most modern languages but yes you had your key in your effort your algorithm you a creating it can be even more for air-gapped applications yeah that's to be run offline so development these actually I'll show an example and I'm gonna go into my uh example second just to show you what it looks like so so we don't have smart contracts as of now the objectives that have smart contracts and your we're actively working on it now off to a development several strategy planning so it's not just a roadmap item we're actually not now the way it works currently is that inside of a transaction an algorithm side of a transaction object appeals order field is called no fuel inside that field is right about to let the data and then commit that solution so you can run all your logic off chain and then almost like a time saver here use that as so so look this looks like a nasty case you have to have an object this is the pipe honesty center P first I'll around last Val around this is a no-kill that I was talking about the deficit in Tennessee's hash I just want to show you what that looks like a month ago visuals I think it helps here's an example so writing a transaction to a file so you knew a couple things that would get suggested params here to make easy now you see here you know don't even need every single parameter that I just showed me to write a transaction for instance in this case we're just writing simple transactions they don't and you don't feel any kind of data venom fuel so that's just unclear but it's quite straightforward answer is actually it's read file as so here and this one is actually working with the note field so this is what that looks like you can define it here in this case we're doing an option but you know bytes that's passed in love to encode it back and then you can add an internal transaction object here and there and then use your project so these are our management projects that are coming up bolts is meant for almost like validating block there's a Bitcoin ditch it should make easier to host your repertoire chain and to validate and send to us for people to run notes these are atomic squared swaps so this should allow you or issue the atomic swaps a lot easier in the sense that you wouldn't have to do these small steps to prove that you deserve to basically be a counterparty risk in this case you should be able to do time that swaps more than one and one go and then smart contracts [Music] so you can become an algorithm Bassett er we also had a meteor from pure sample true sake it's kind of like our cursors you can basically make API calls with millions missus plans here and so let me then what this thing and show you about the recipe works so I just made a very very simple and I'm not a hardware engineer so they may look impressive but it's not necessarily it's very easy to do okay it's simple item to device excusing are using our pipeline well that's booting up does anyone working with a raspberry but before yeah so what's great about weather advisor that well you're incredibly versatile obviously so this is an RFID reader our buddy scanner I have this is a PI itself is a single board computer but they have GPIO pins with your general purpose and putting out the pins so you very much plug in anything you want into it in this case I have our call to read words these are just they're just pins at the bottom of it allows you to set up a certain tree properly I just have all these pins attached to this one these have a bunch of a bunch of labels so it's easier for me to plug things in and out then I have these plugged into the wires on this breadboard is attached to my RFID scanner and these have different functions here so you have to plug in the right function to the right of corresponding pin this was an awesome project honestly because I've never actually had to what's called solder like like melted incredibly fun so let me show you first we can find all this so this is Gracia by the way this is rescue to us in Raspberry Pi as you can this has been mounted different operating systems but different micro SD cards and swapping they're not addressed requite make me involved again again to credit so you can find i'm gonna publish my book today that you can find the arena at least here i will walk through that with you everything my keyboards a bit pushy it's really good travel with us what's up so it's killed president okay so let's just actually get started I'll run it once so I as an RFID tag and so it's at Berkeley readies and you can match that that's your application or you could write a tit to it so right now I have a hard-coded accountants gonna read from so this one I believe in read my balance yeah so my account that's how much i had in my my account right now this one should read about pending wards Italy any more words through this one should be my total rewards yeah these missiles so all this is doing is speaking requests by the Python SDK to remote since I have run you can also run together a I'll grant notice and raspberry pie already that mysteriously but in this case I wanted to show you so now we can grab this account go to the oven dispenser make the audacious move my robot user confirmation they jump back in here that's the change fast this is this now we had a pageant test set so there's a bit of a collision Awards so it wasn't working earlier absolutely it's not like now it's probably gonna be zero they typically should change it's just a passive process that we're going through right now not total our total rewards again should change well that is radical something but that's basically how this looks very simple but I wanted to do with this or what I might to open please click on some sort of moving object like a toy train right so you can basically put aside the idea that you know different tags on the track will represent different stations you can run the alarm I can taste the RFID reader under the Train of any page that is a good one but with are really fast transactionality things like this year possible so let me show you the code okay so so what's important really it is this come on domesticated it's actually demonic account you're out there with a client this is me sort of tinkering around a thunderstorms over and so here's where you clear your token for L baby and then the next relevant line which type of algorithm here so this is what you're defining if you're calling from this okay tell people your address your pending awards your amount and this gets you focused so really just in once you can talk about this at eight nine maybe ten lines of better so you can make some basic functionality it's the next thing obviously supposed transactions using this using the RFID tags again this is a very simple prototype how you can build an IOT device watching are there any questions okay okay thank you
