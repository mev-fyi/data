exciting um thanks for tuning in we'll get started in just a moment looks like more people are going on camera love it all right all right number one oh sorry heather no i was just gonna introduce you but you're doing a great job um thank you everyone for joining we have christine perry from scale who's going to tell us how to 100 times what's the title uh 100x your dap with two lines of code and tell us all about all the other exciting stuff that scale is up to so without further ado i will let you take it away christine awesome thanks heather um so the skill labs team is definitely very excited to be here at this hackathon it's going to run for a month so it's going to be a journey which is very exciting for us because it means we get to see all the cool projects that come about it as heather mentioned i'm christine perry and i lead solution engineering at scale labs so if you have a project and you want to partner with us if you have a dap and you want to build on us and if you want to be a validator reach out to our team and we're more than happy to help you before this technical workshop i'm going to break it up into two parts one to give like a small foundation of what the skull network is so that way we kind of like set the stage there i won't go into too many details because jack o'haulier and our ceo is going to give a more broader overview of scale network tomorrow and chatwick our vp of product is also going to give an overview of the scale network tomorrow as well um the second part of um you know the presentation is going to be really getting into the technology going through the dev docs um actually seeing what you can do with the scale network and kind of playing with it within remix truffle and a fun game that i just started building that's not quite there yet so you guys get to be with me on that journey too so i'm gonna share my screen guys and girls and women and everyone and let's get started all right so this part we already covered um the agenda um but just uh you know overview again i'm going to just do a quick overview of what is scale and then really get into how to use it and at the end there's going to be time for q a but i love this being interactive so if you have questions post it in the chat ask heather ask myself turn your microphones on let's make this as conversational as possible now the scale network is pretty interesting because one of the early visions was that we didn't want developers to have to learn new technology or new ways of coding in fact the scale network is an ethereum native side chain and so what does that exactly mean basically that means that all the tools that you're used to using truffle web 3 ether.js every wallet and some sponsors that are also um you know sponsoring this um you know hackathons as well you can integrate that with scale um but the way that you'll go about doing it um as the title says is it really is it's kind of making a small change and sometimes just two lines of code for that change where you get an end point it looks just like infuria and because of that what that means is you're able to swap it out what you're currently using for ethereum and run it on scale now i want to back it up just a little bit more to explain how the skull network is set up and how it's set up is that similar to ethereum we also have nodes all around the world last october we launched over 150 nodes around the world and what that meant is that these nodes were able to create the scale network and offer you the ability to create something called your scale chain and i emphasize your skill chain because what's interesting about the scale network is that instead of having one chain to rule them all instead you have multiple chains so each dot developer gets their own containerized environment which means that you don't have to worry about anyone else taking up all the data all the storage or pretty much just like creating a really slow experience for you because they're using more resources than you are the only one that you have to worry about on your skeleton is going to be your project and what you're doing there now what's great is that every so frequently to add more security we rotate out a node that's operating on your scale chain so while we group together 16 to create your scale chain over time you may have 70 or 90 of the network eventually working for your skeleton at any given time within um you know your use of the the scalp network now again just want to highlight that your chain is one of many and one of the things that you'll notice here is that some of the chains overlap with nodes and the reason why we do that is because within the scale network you have the option to choose whether you want a small medium or large chain and that determines how many transactions per second you get how much storage you receive as well and it means that you can grow with the network as your project grows so the more users you get you might need to upgrade but you won't have to manually do anything for that within the skull network you're automatically able to upgrade from a small medium or large chain by directly hitting the ethereum network to spin up and change your skill chain at um ad hoc um again um jack and chadwick will go into more about that tomorrow but just wanted to lay the foundation here now i do want to talk a little bit about how each node operates because i think this is pretty cool um again just like because the way the skull network is built it is an ethereum application as well so we have the series of 36 or 40 smart contracts deployed to ethereum that make up something called scale manager and skill manager is what pretty much just like operates and determines how the skill chains work with the network but within each node they do essentially one of three things one validated orchestration so if you recall back how i told you that the nodes rotate in and out of the scale chains well that's part of that node auditing is just to make sure that things are really secure each node kind of creates a report card on every other node within the network to make sure that it's meeting uptime and it's not doing any malicious from the network and if so because we have these smart contracts deployed on ethereum they can automatically um directly within code either remove the node from the network or slash it and remove the um you know the delegation that they have and then lastly the scale admin piece is really for that developers because everything such as evm entertain messaging and file storage which again i'll get into later in the technical demos is managed here so i want to talk a little bit more about interchange messaging though because i think this one's going to be really interesting here at this hackathon for that developers that want to integrate with this and the reason being is because a lot of that developers they've already started building on ethereum they might have tokenized their application erc20 erc 721 et cetera et cetera you can use entertain messaging agent to be able to create a bridge between the scale network and ethereum and so what ends up happening is you're able to deploy you know smart contracts to ethereum deploy those same ones to the skeleton side and the setup for the adapt developer the only thing that he will have to do is link into smart contracts that the scale that the scale network has deployed directly onto both ethereum and the scale chain and register the contracts on both sides so the setup part is pretty simple pretty easy but once you get through the setup part the usage part becomes really interesting because it means that you can take advantage of the faster transactions and the lower cost pretty much zero cost and the scale network by locking up skel um tokens that you have deployed on ethereum and the scale network will automatically create clones um on your scale chain now what that means is once you have these clones um over on the scale network it's always mapping back to what's happening on ethereum but essentially you're able to remove all the michael transactions so today if you deal with transferring an erc 721 or erc20 token that price could be between 75 or 100 which is kind of insane and so right now on the scale network if you were to transfer or manage that token in a clone-like environment what that means is that you remove that gas cost completely and you can do that a million times it doesn't matter but at the end when you decide that you want to free up that token you can finally exit and reach liquidity by releasing it back to ethereum and the million user later they're able to have access to that token because we were able to map and maintain um who actually owns that token within the scout network so just a brief overview of what interchange messaging looks like now let's get into the fun parts of actually doing some live demos so you can see how easy it is how to navigate through our documentation and then also how to actually use it and really cool tools that you've probably seen before such as remix and truffle all right so if you head over to the scale network documentation i'm just going to head into the adapt developer section here and one of the things i want to highlight is if you go to the beginner section it really just gives you a quick overview of what it looks like to use a scale chain and give me just a second so it's really just four basic steps um one get a scale chain two prepare your scale chain and then three migrate using um truffle or any um you know tool of your choice and then lastly send a transaction so really simple flow for eve global we have a really dedicated page on some really useful information about how to get started and how to use your skill chain that will have available for you at if global here um so you can head here head into the discord and actually reach out to us we have mentors within that channel to help you get started but what i want to start with first is the wallets because a lot of times the first questions we get are how do i actually connect the wallet that my end users and i am using that's already connected to ethereum and if you come in here you'll see that we're connected to quite a few of already just like the top wallets that we see out there any wallet that's ethereum native though means that it can automatically work within the scale network you'll just have to like reach out to our team we can help point you in the direct direction but let's point out one here i'm called metamask i'm assuming most people have heard of metamask but if you want to integrate with metamask one of the changes that they made that i think is really cool is they now allow any layer two solution to be automatically added to their drop-down list directly by the dot developer and so i'm gonna open up my metamask here so you can see like right now there are all of their test networks and you have this custom rpc um way of adding um and you know a layer two solution now it's done a bit differently and so we have this sandbox here where if you access it it'll take you to the same code snippet that you see on the page but you can actually use this by replacing it with the if global um you know endpoint that we give you replace your chain id and simply click the button what that means that it'll do is it'll take that code snippet that you know metamask um graciously like opened up for everyone and allow you to automatically change for the user on their behalf directly to the scale network to your endpoint and the proper chain id i'm going to go ahead and approve that and go ahead and switch the network and what you'll see here is now if global that the endpoint and the access to it within metamask now appears here directly for end users to use so let's go ahead and use that and again i just want to emphasize that the only change that we really had to make to code here this is pretty much just like an excerpt from metamask but we changed two lines of code basically which is the endpoint the chain id and we're good to go i want to now go over to the scale chains because we have some really um you know cool ides here that you can use such as remix um if you haven't you've used remix before it's pretty much just like a really easy way to deploy simple smart contracts and what we've done is we've created a really simple smart contract for adopt developers to use which is just called hello scale so when you click on that link it'll automatically download the smart contract within remix for you to use you can view it to see how it's constructed you can check to make sure that is compiling properly in solidity and then lastly you can change your environment to again the metamask um you know implementation that now has on the scale network here and deploy it within the scout network and one of the things that i want to just kind of like call out here is that although you will see light gas up here every transaction within the scale network is completely a zero gas transaction it doesn't mean that gas is not used it is used but it has no value the reason it's used is to prevent anyone from ddosing your on scale chain only people that you um you'll manually send um you know scale based scale um chain eth to will be able to run transactions on your skill chain if they don't have it though transactions will be denied and so that's just more just like a ddos prevention but for you it means for your end users they don't have to worry about buying this um each in advance and also being um you know weighed down with micro transactions as well i'm going to go ahead and confirm that and you'll see that the transaction just goes through extremely fast which is expected on the scale network because one of the things we wanted to make sure happens is that we reach like um close to zero um well sub second block times and so every transaction is meant to happen immediately and we don't care if you're transferring a token amenting a token or simply interacting with a heavy computational smart contract it doesn't matter and so let's go ahead and just use this smart contract and again it'll use metamask which we're all familiar with it'll save the transaction there at the bottom and say hello and as you can see everything works as you would expect as if you were in an ethereum ecosystem but all of this is running directly on scale all right so now that we've used metamask we use remix if i head back to the dev portal and i go back to the beginner getting started guide here let's go ahead and actually use what's recommended here which is just using truffle and to do that what i want to show you guys is a game that i've been like working on called scale match um i found this online um it's an open source game and i've been i'm tweaking that and playing with it to get it to work within the scale network and the whole idea behind this game is that you can mention a new nft every time someone creates a match by clicking on one of these um you know squares here let me show you what the code looks like because what i've done is i've taken that truffle snippet directly from the dev portal and i've added in this new section for scale where all it does is it points to my scale chain endpoint here now you're seeing my very insecure private keys please don't steal my fake eat but essentially the idea here is that you're able to use truffle combine it with scale and deploy directly to a scale chain very simply as if you're deploying to ethereum again there's not very many changes here because it's an ethereum native side chain so i'm going to go ahead and stop this game and let's go ahead and redeploy that and again all of this information is on our dev docs portal so all the different code snippets all the different ways of knowing how to deploy using truffle or remix you'll be able to find that all there and some really cool other tools about using our file storage and entertain messaging too all right now the deployment is going just as fast as i would expect it to go um basically again sub second block times for deployment i'm going to take this contract address because i want to make sure that as i'm meanting new tokens or this on the side chain that it's actually being saved there so i'm going to go to assets let's go ahead and hide this one because this is one of my tests from before hide and i'm going to add a new token do a custom token and paste that there all right so we have our token contract on the side chain here and then let's go ahead and restart this now while that's restarting what i wanted what i do want to show you here is that the smart contract that was used within this um open source project that i found um is essentially basically just like a standard erc 721 token which is commonly used for creating nfts um and nfcs have become all the rage lately so be really cool to see some projects using that but to show you what this looks like within the game the way this works is i've changed the game so that way when you first arrive to the page it does exactly what metamask now allows you to do which it will allow you to switch the network on the user's behalf once i'm there again i'm back on the scale chain and i can start playing now i won't say that i'm the best at playing the match game but luckily i got lucky that time and found one super quickly i'm going to confirm that my tokens automatically meant it there and one of the things i really want to drive home here is that with the scale network you're really able to create a ui that works extremely fast and what that means is that you don't have to wait you know 15 a minute 10 minutes before the transaction goes through before you can show something to the end user it happens immediately just as fast as that token showed up on the page that's as fast as it was um actually saved to the blockchain here and that token was minted now i'm not sure if we'll get lucky here and and find another one but essentially that's how the game works it creates um nfts every time that a match is found using the scale network now what would be really cool at this hackathon to see is that if i go back to our dev docs we have something called file storage and if you're familiar with ipfs or filecoin or any other decentralized storage solution what's really cool about those solutions is that it really allows you to store files in a decentralized manner well with the scale network we have file storage that allows you to store files directly to on the scale network on blockchain and so what that means is that you could store images all of these images could be stored um as let's see all of these images could be stored on directly to um you know the blockchain within on the scale network now if you can do that imagine what that could mean for your nft as you're creating it instead of having a loosely coupled nft to asset situation you could use file storage link that to your nft and have everything being able to be verified directly on the blockchain so it'd be really cool to see if any projects will integrate that within their solution at this hackathon um and definitely if you have any questions head over to our dev docs go to our on discord which links to the eve global hackathon discord channel and we'll be able to help you out right there all right so that went by extremely quickly but we only had 30 minutes together so i had to cram it all in but if you have any questions definitely reach out to us on our discord channel we do have prizes available for you um that total up to fifteen thousand dollars um definitely head over to um the scale network if global website and you'll be able to access and request your skill chain right away and start tinkering with it ahead of tomorrow um again thanks for like having me and listening enough to the to the technical workshop it looks like there are um some posts in the chat but mostly information so if you have any questions i think now would be the time all right i will stop sharing my screen and open it up for q a let's see if there were any questions following all of that i've been um following the chat on youtube there's a lot of scale stands lots of fans handstands on the youtube live stream but um if anyone has any questions please jump in now's your chance i assume that there are events being emitted as things are peeling off to and from scale to the chain that we can follow uh so what's interesting about the scale network is that um again because like each chain is unique you would have to get the end point that you wanted to follow in order to like follow the events that are being emitted from that in the future we are working with some really cool partners to actually index all of that data and create a really cool blockchain that will combine all of that information but that's going to be a v2 of the scale network but in the meantime like as you are building your project um we do have a block explorer that's dynamic meaning that you can enter in your endpoint see all of your events see all of your transactions and get all the data that you need as you're um building or tinkering from there so yeah awesome about the f5 storage but how how much space do you do you have on your uh on your on your network yeah so because we have 150 nodes currently there's a lot of space available for um you know sidechains to be created depending on how many small chains medium change or large these are created for the largest chain we have up to two terabytes of data storage um and then we divide that by 32 for the medium chain and 128 for the small chain so again just like depending on the amount of storage given time that will determine which skill chain you use but one of the things that we wanted to make sure to do is to make sure that um within the layer two space that the amount of storage that the developers would have access to far exceeds what's currently available in the market today and so um when you use on the the skeleton you won't have to worry about um you know figuring out where to store your data whether it's an artweave with a decentralized solution or somewhere else because you have a long runway to use the skull network um directly um with a layer two solution so very excited about that um because this is kind of related i do wanna also mention that the block storage or the block limit um is extremely higher than what you would expect on with normal network savings about 250 like million and what that means is that you really don't have to worry about tinkering or changing your code to work within the confines of what currently is additional blockchain you can just develop your application and have faster speeds and lower transaction costs so hope that helps answer the question yes thank you awesome all right well maybe you can tell us ah let's see how much faster in terms of block times is scale all right um so i think i i answered that in my previous question so i'm not sure if i saw that late but i'll just reiterate it again um essentially you know block times within scale are less than three seconds and so what that means when you send a transaction to scale it'll pretty much like save to the blockchain immediately and again it doesn't matter if you're doing that for um you know a heavy computation smart contract mentioning nfts or transferring back and forth to ethereum on the scale chain side it happens instantly and we do this because um if you go on the dev docs portal you'll also see this large section around the technology that goes really in depth about on the scale you know network consensus protocol and what's really cool there is they're using um something that allows us to um you know send transactions back and forth between the different um servers very easily for fast finality when it comes to actually creating proposals creating those blocks and storing them to the blockchain um and again just like definitely go there see all the content because it's really cool interesting like how we group together math bls signature threshold systems and sgx so a lot of technical terms there but as i swear we definitely just like explain it all really well there so there's a question do you see this yeah um oh that's celine all right okay i think we have um three minutes so yeah i can answer this last question um so maybe you can go through how skell is ethereum native um an ethereum orchestrated which is not the case for most layer 2 sidechain solutions happy to go into a little bit more detail about that um again the theory of native piece is everything you saw me just do basically being able to use truffle being able to use metamask being able to use web3 etherjs all of those are ethereum native tools and if any layer 2 is able to like reuse those tools in a seamless way that's what we considered ethereum native and um the scale network again that was vision number one really just making sure that developers didn't have to change their tool set their entire tech stack in order to work with us they didn't have to change how their smart contracts were written they could literally pick it up put it down in the scale network and have everything work as normal so that's what ethereum native means now the ethereum orchestrated piece basically means that again scale is a dap that runs on ethereum because we have 36 to 40 i think between like smart contracts running on ethereum and all of that manages the scale chains meaning you don't have to contact our team to get a skill chain you can go directly to the ethereum network request your skill chain and simply stay can just keep it going what that means is you can keep it decentralized you don't have to always be the one paying for it you can open it up to a dow or any other um you know creative way of making a decentralized um sidechain solution that's still connected to ethereum there's so much more that goes on within those smart contracts obviously because there's 40 of them that are out there um but just because we're running out of time just wanted to highlight the main parts that matter to the dot developers here on the call um but yeah if you have any additional questions definitely reach out to us on you know the discord channel if global or the skull discord channel christine there's just um two questions two or three questions coming in from youtube if we can spend one or two minutes on them i'm happy to do it okay um what can be built on scale which job categories which categories so that is a fun one when i started at scale um wow i was coming up on three years now ago i thought that there was just going to be gaming and d5 because that's all i heard about but what i was surprised with was how much else was out there so we have the scale innovative program which means that we've been working with that developers over the course of the past two years to help get feedback to make sure we're building the right solution and in doing so what that meant is that we ended up getting introduced to that developers that are building um within of course dfi gaming space the wine industry the meat a social media think facebook for blockchain industry um let's see um we also have lots of nft um nft projects being built on the scale network music streaming enterprise governments i did not think that governments would be interested in using a sidechain solution but the fact that it's containerized and you're not sharing space with other networks really drives them to the scale network which is really um interesting um liquidity solutions dowels of course um pretty much anyone that's looking to lower the transaction cost and have faster speeds um are was able to build on scale so i would say that the amount of verticals that we could potentially service with the scale network um appears to be endless and it's just growing every day so nice uh one more uh is it applicable only for public or also for private networks so because it's ethereum native um what that means is that you are still going to have um you know public blockchain so there was an earlier question of can i um access or see events on the blockchain and the answer is yes if you have access to the endpoint or to the blocker s4 that we will be building on the next few months um you will be able to publicly see anything that's going on with the scale network now what that does mean though is that for those looking for more of a private environment they would have to um you know use other um encrypted like partners to make it work as well so there are some out there where they're offering the ability to send data back and forth between the blockchains in an encrypted manner and so using that plus scale kind of gives you that private environment but not really because you're still able to access everything that's going on on the blockchain so it's still not going to be that private environment and we didn't strive to be that the goal was to make sure that developers that are already developed on ethereum can have a place to go to where again it's not an ethereum killer but it more supplements or helps advance the project to reach on better heights so if we have time for one last question yes um uh block star logic asks how does the file storage behave um eg change slash delete etc how does the i'm sorry i didn't how does the file storage behave um it's uh example uh change slash delete etc okay um good questions so um if you go on to the documentation you'll see that we have two ways of interacting with the file storage one is you can absolutely use the smart contracts that are deployed to the side chain and work with file storage in that way because again all the files are going to be stored on via those methods however to make it more approachable and user-friendly because scalability problem is also a usability problem as well and so one of the things that we did was make sure to build a javascript library that sits on top we've had some other developers build python libraries and look at other libraries too but what that means is when you want to interact with it you can use this npm package to upload um download or delete your files and because the question was around well how does delete work i want to dive into that a little bit more the delete as you can imagine with every blockchain you can't actually delete anything that's stored there but you can't obfuscate it you can hide it and the idea behind that was just that okay for that developers that want to work with the file storage and list entire directories of you know what's stored there kind of like a content management system it means that they can remove the files that are returned back at that point in time and so it's more of a helper feature there to quote unquote delete but hide a file that's on the blockchain now to map this back to one of the requests that i um you know mentioned where it would be cool to see that developers really um stretching the limits of nfts and using skill file storage what that means is okay if you can't really delete that file it means this loose coupling that currently exists between an nft and the actual assets that might be stored on dropbox and anyone can change the link or something like that if you have it pointing to a link within scale file storage it's immutable which means that you can't actually change or modify that asset once is created so it means it's actually the nfc is going to stay at nfc forever so hope that makes sense and definitely happy to you know elaborate more on that later on discord awesome thank you so much christine this has been a great workshop really informative um getting lots of love on youtube and uh as you mentioned if anyone has questions for you they can reach you on discord both at your scale discord and on your sponsor channel in the scaling ethereum chat thanks thank you so much cheers thank you
