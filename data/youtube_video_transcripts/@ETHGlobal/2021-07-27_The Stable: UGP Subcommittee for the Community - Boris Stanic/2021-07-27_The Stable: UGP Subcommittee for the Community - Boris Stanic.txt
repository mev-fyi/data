hi everybody uh nice to see you again hopefully you enjoyed all the previous talks uh they were really interesting to me at least and now for the end well just you know something that everybody can you know you don't need uh really to understand tech into the deep to understand um a little bit about what the stable is about and what we're doing it's just community stuff as you'll see and yeah i'll share how we try to empower the community within the stable what the stable is all about uh and yeah let's let's start let's go to the first slide okay so uh hi everybody my name is boris tanich uh i'm croatian and before i started doing unesco community stuff uh i was a a beckons team lead for a night gaming company here in croatia which means i don't know too much about community management marketing or things like that but i am fairly comfortable with tech topics and crypto topics and yeah i've been in crypto space actively since 2017 [Music] and right away i started with the community stuff and then in 2020 i joined the as a contractor the the union swap team by pure luck as it says here i don't know really why they chose me uh it was i was just lucky and then this year in may the stable was born and what is the stable so stable is a subcommittee in the units of grant program and we are focused on on the individual individual grants so we provide financial help but also we try to provide mentorship technical guidance connection to the community and and whatever our grantees need and somebody asked me previously okay what is this table is it like the subcommittee is it you or and i think the best answer to that is the stable is both the subcommittee in the ugp and its grantees so if you become a unicorn in our stable you kind kind of you know shared the values that that we tried to promote through this table um and the natural question is why is their need for this table and d5 space and crypto space is really specific there are a lot of enthusiasts and these guys so guys and girls sorry uh they kind of work for free really like they are the best employees you never have to pay uh they you know they they are fueled by their enthusiasm for the d5 space and crypto in general and every project should value those individuals and in my second point i put here it is irresponsible not to support those people because you can't really count that that these enthusiasm will last forever or if they you know encounter too too many obstacles in their work maybe they'll get frustrated and give up while with not so much effort you can really you know nurture their enthusiasm and your project will benefit immensely it's just insane how much work these individuals can you know accomplish and like how do we operate uh it's really simple uh so every one of us in the stable so as i said this they are me and the grantees we spend unhealthy amount of time with the community so you'll basically currently we had only way one and we have uh so there's a six of us now in the stable subcommittee uh and basically you'll see somebody always online in the official unified discord next thing that we do is we encourage the most active candidates to apply so everybody is invited to apply but the problem is they they need some encouragement because they it feels to me like they are a little afraid of a commitment because they think they'll become employed uh if they join the stable but that's that's that's really not the case my third step is we just let them do what they enjoy the most and just support them along the way so we try to find area uh each grantee will focus on but there's like minimal micro management or anything because these guys already know the best and yeah they already proved so many times uh also ken sometimes drives his car in new york city uh to promote uh the stable and uniform grant program and you can see the picture here at the bottom uh what are the challenges so this is more for me personally than for the rest of the grantees the first big challenge is we as a sub committee we get unit tokens you know to to move forward you know to give to our grantees but financial help is nice but it's not usually the highest priority so from my experience our grant is you know they usually have their main jobs and some people like i don't know to to read novels in their free time and these guys love to spend time with defy uh or unislav community uh what's also hard is breaking the barriers on the grantee's way one of the barriers is always reaching out to the core unit swap team and sometimes you just need to reach out to them and this gif at the bottom shows how it feels sometimes to reach them in dms but it's understandable you know the unis of core team maybe they reach 20 members not sure but they are managing such a huge project and there's all only a handful of them so yeah they have their their you know they focus on different things don't have always time to to respond to the messages and one of my biggest goal is to make sure the grantees get the recognition they deserve so all all the great things that they do daily i try to to make sure that general communi unisop community knows about them and recognizes them for the that great work that they do uh some of the stuff we do as the stable subcommittee so one big part is the community support so you have an opportunity to listen to serve that e-theme so they manage a lot of repetitive support tickets which is usually gas prices and stock transactions and metamask issues however if you listened carefully you could hear that chair we mentioned that if they get something that they're not sure of they always reach out to other helpers and friends of unisop and other helpers and friends of uniscope would be the stable grantees so they're always there ready to help we got couple of really you know i wouldn't say senior level solid developers but close to and they're always ready to help if they have time we also do a lot of educational resources such as guides faqs some tips and tricks for example rachel which is one of our stable grantees she wrote a really nice guide on how to recognize scam tokens because we notice a lot of people that are new to uni swap end up buying scan tokens so if you're new to unispot make sure to check out that guide and quality of life tools um maybe you know a simple tool that would allow you to see all the allowances that you did and stuff like that so our grantees build all those stuff another thing we do i put running in in quotation marks but basically core unit stock team doesn't have too much time to run the units of discord and our grantees kind of run it it's not far from true community calls so yeah we had four of them uh the fifth one will be june 14th uh you can submit your topics for the agenda we'll always keep it really open it was really interesting for example on the last one two days ago we had couple of interesting projects that are working on automating liquidity providing on v3 and one of them has like insane aprs not recommendation that you should uh invest in those projects but it's really interesting you can find like nice projects during our community calls and we also discuss different governance stuff what should we do next uh not we but units for project and stuff like that we also bridge the gap between the units of course team and the community so yeah we have a system where if somebody has a like an issue uh that uniform team needs to check we have a procedure how to notify them and stuff like that and efficiently and that this camera program you heard a talk from our guy dubstar he is an expert in that field he he's in the space in internet space for 30 years he knows all the tricks and he keeps our discord clean and saves all the new users from phishing sites and yeah last thing we do uh but we do but more but last thing i put here is making uniform inclusive to non-english speaking communities so one of our grantees yg shout out to him he speaks i think two or three languages spoken in asia and he helps out that community uh reports back on on what's what they're talking about just so we know and the coordinates of team what's what's going on in non-english-speaking communities uh and yeah what what is our end goal um so our end goal for this table is to make community self-sustainable uh self-sustainable i just made it up basically but uh it's a state of the community where if there's a need for something the community will organize itself to produce a solution for that need and yeah that's my definition of self-sustainable community uh also provide financial and other support where it's needed uh so it would be nice if you know governance would recognize if there is some money needed and there is an efficient way to to send that money to solve that problem at that right place or any other help whether it's educational technical whatever uh and yeah we we try to make uh unisop community an overall cool place to hang out so uh our big goal is to make it feel like your voice is always heard within the uni swap community that's that is why for example we'll let the community choose topics for the agenda for the community calls and if you join a community call and raise your hand you'll end up on the stage you can you know last me the call we had almost 200 people so it's an easy way to share your ideas in front of 200 other community members and you don't really have to have you know twitter clouds to reach that level you just join and raise your hand so right now you're probably wondering how to get involved uh first step so i made a nice flowchart say goodbye to friends and family because you'll enjoy spending time with us so much you'll just forget about them and next step is maybe you already have an idea uh that that would benefit a uni swap community and if you do reach out to this table uh we'll jump in a call and yeah fine find the solution for that idea if you don't have an idea at the moment just become an active member of the community best way to do so is join our discord uh sono tower but unispops project discord uh you'll find the links pretty much everywhere i forgot to put it in this presentation but maybe somebody can share it in chat and yeah eventually you'll get an idea how to improve the uniform community because there are so many places and ways uh this young community and project can be improved and then you'll reach out to this table and and we'll just find a way to make that happen uh and for like the last one is is the model uh old creation saying is if you take steps in the right direction eventually you'll end up in the right place unless you're on the wrong side of an escalator uh and yeah so first thing to consider is are you on the right side of an escalator and unislap project is definitely on the right side of an escalator and our goal at this table is to always take a step in the right direction so we understand that we don't have enough you know power to really revolutionize anything uh in the uni swap maybe it happens but let's be realistic it won't but we try to make you know a lot of smaller steps in the right direction write a guide to help another community member answer somebody's question uh or create a cool tool somebody can use and all these steps will accumulate and unislap as a project will be a happy place application form huge link here uh i'll share it in youth global chat as soon as i'm done with my presentation and for any questions uh i'm available uh didn't have the chat open so i didn't catch any questions uh but maybe uh you can help me out with that fatigue yes um we have any questions just yet but i think uh kind of the biggest one would just be understanding uh maybe you're just clarifying sort of what it means to be involved on the egp side versus the stable directly so if somebody's interested in in helping out in the union community are they making a conscious in a exclusive choice of uni grants or the stable or what are the some obvious things that they can go to this table for and and how do you think about how is it just generally set up so that they know where they can go for help for various specific things yeah so we at this table uh try to work on on a smaller project with an outsized impact so something that that uh you don't need a whole team of developers uh or you know a whole team in general uh to make happen uh but an individual can and uh if you need you know more like uh guidance technical help and uh less uh financial help then the stable would be a right place to you however me and can we talk every day we go through all the applications and if we see that some of the application would be more suitable for the stable or that this table application would be more suitable for the ugp we just you know mix it up and you'll end up in the right place also there since we are the subcommittee it's not like if you join the stable you will never reach out to ken or uh if you uh are in the ugp don't talk to boris we are all like a big family help each other out we just really focus on different areas so yeah use the stable application or use the ugp application both will work will manage
