foreign [Music] was quite a Powerhouse in crypto and what I found that was pretty Pleasant many of them were pop collectors so I felt pretty welcome it's just so exciting to see so many people from across the world come here today we have many people from different countries here people from different projects different Industries verticals and it's growing because Portugal wants to be a crypto Haven for people to to come here and attract professionals so it's amazing to be here in this community [Music] different kind of kind of role of attitude of perspective that really makes our decentralized ecosystem something that is very very special [Music] I'm really excited about people building and consumer experiences in web 3 products where you don't necessarily have to be like a web 3 believer in order to want to use them because they're like just useful and a delight to use so I think what I'm looking forward to the most is meeting the hackers behind the projects not necessarily just like whatever they're working on but also the people behind that one thing for sure is that we need to give people peace of mind using web free products so with smart accounts we will be able to have much more secure setups for for users I think that like I mentioned in my talk one of the things that I was really focusing on is kind of bringing the ux that we have of web 2 along with the characteristics that people value in web3 the big problem that is still not quite solved yet is around wallet ux so that's kind of in my opinion the final hurdle and once we get there I think that we're going to see a lot more applications that are quote unquote web3 Mass adopted mainly because the user isn't even going to know it's a web 3 application you need to start small you need to start Focus you're not going to solve everyone's problem you know with one application and so picking one lane and doing it well and building something that's you know truly differentiated and useful ultimately at the end of the day value ends up flowing I want to be Amazed by the creativity of people I don't have any concrete idea at the moment but it is such a powerful primitive to have a human on chain that there's so much doors that it opens like we started it so that we can build Ubi it's a requirement for that but it unlocks so many doors I know where we are going we are going into Mass adoption it's gonna take a long time but it does looks like we are past the Tipping Point for not getting that like the Chain Reaction has started it's not going too fast but it doesn't look like it's going to stop Mass adoption will happen [Music] [Music]
