foreign [Music] we're going to talk about reputation and making it useful and portable um and then we're going to talk about uh some sdks that might be useful or interesting for some of your hacky hacks um I Am David Phillips this is me on the Bird app the Twitter um I put this picture in there so that you know I'm cool um respect me yes yes I'm it's a California native born and bred uh San Diego um now I reside in New York and now I'm here to chat with uh all the Parisian wonderful hackers and people from around the world um but we're gonna we're just gonna jump into it so quick context show of hands who has heard of dids or who has built something with them exactly one-third oh exactly half of them um so we're just gonna do a quick overview contextualize like what is identity how do I see this in the world and then how does this evolve into you know this digital analog hybrid crazy feature that we have going on um traditionally we use credentials to get access to things um the the the passports right we all had one to come to the country uh in the U.S the really militant about making sure you have an ID card to get into a bar even if you look 50 they won't serve you a drink um but um these credentials generally come from black boxes they're institutions that we don't really have control over inside into or on deep understanding of how they work or why they work how they do um but they allow us to do lots of nice things these credentials these identities that we carry around or proof of identities that we carry on in our pockets we can ride airplanes we can get mortgages so right now there's just like massive Trend and that's ongoing it's not slowing down so it's just a you know a couple of data points for you eight percent more time year of year has been spent online every year for the last 15 years um so we're starting to run into this thing of will we have these really nice it was really nice versions of of physical ID cards in analog identities but that's all starts to break down when we start to look when we look into the Digital World um you know how does I how does identity how does it how is it useful right how do we take our self with us to different parts of the internet because if more of our lives are happening online well you know wouldn't I like to have some credibility uh when I show up to a different ecosystem um so that's the next point of like okay we all have wallets it's a wallet and identity um I would already know some people would argue yes but I think good identity ultimately um is Sovereign secure and portable and that's the litmus test that it needs to be able to pass and so identity our wallets are great because they are secure and they're Sovereign but um they're not at wallet address isn't necessarily useful beyond the bounds of a specific blockchain ecosystem so we can build all sorts of wonderful history and ethereum but it breaks down when we you know go over to Twitter or some e-commerce platform or anywhere else that we do things that are important on the internet um racing along here but what we are going to look at today is what is an identity graph how can they be constructed and how can they become super super powerful tools uh not only in the as a vehicle of individual sovereignty but in terms of what you can reliably gain access to or how you can represent yourself online so what is a did um yeah what is a did so a did is a key pair it oh yes a did is a key pair um so you have a public key and a private key the way next ID works is it's the same you can there's the same Keys they're using on ethereum um and it is a key pair that is used to sign and certify control of an identifier or an entity on the internet so as you see in this little visual you have like an avatar or an ID that is a key pair that is a did and you're signing a message to say I own or I control this ethereum address I own or I control this lens profile uh this ens or a Reddit or Reddit account or a GitHub account and so we're doing is we're taking these disparate identifiers these different pieces of ourselves and we're creating a single graph that is a more holistic representation of our self um and we didn't know why this matters and why this can be cool in a little bit but I'm just going to pause there and take any questions that have come up from anyone because small group I can create base now so the cool thing about dids is you don't actually need a specific ecosystem or a blockchain because a cryptographic signature is at as a standalone as a standalone unit uh publicly verifiable it's really easy for me to say to look at a signature and say you've proved by signing this message like when you sign into any doubt you've proving that you control that address without basically giving them your private key for them to be able to execute transactions and so we don't have like in did world we don't have the need for distributed like a a single distributed Ledger because there is no double spend problem there's no like oh this is a transaction that's being used to spend money it's very much um using your like a base cryptography unit to say I control I control a Twitter account or I control this address was that a little helpful great question great question yes increase so who creates the standard who creates a did for a user for a user so because it's a key based technology it is by nature Sovereign in that sense and what I mean there is you as the key holder you can only create a did um you can you can only modify this graph if you hold the private the private private public key pair yes no this is great no this is great I'm sure common questions yeah yeah um so when you sign in to adapted have you signed it with ethereum yeah um there's not really a huge question of does the person who signed this message to gain access to the system did they control this public did they control this address uh it says the exact same mechanic um in the system as that system I know that but I'm just wondering have you been painting and trying to solve exactly that so because it's like it's whatever commission sending public priority yeah so you're talking about that from like a an attribution in kyc standpoint yeah so we don't we're we're a bit agnostic to that that part of the world uh there's a lot of people thinking about that problem doing really great work on it and we support all of those use cases uh where we you know like the people that want to build really rigid kyc systems there are people that want to build like fully Anonymous did graphs and we we try to create treat them both the same to power them both yeah of course there's one more question okay cool I'll keep moving um dids are basically a self-issued key pair and they're used to certify ownership and control um so you're taking an avatar or like you know verify a um linking a bonding entity you're saying I own this other thing pretty simple just the connecting fiber like in a spider web um yeah so for the today we're going to we think about it as like this is doxing technology or this is like this is a violation of privacy uh because there's a lot of different strong ideas in our field um we like to think of this or conceptualize the the data data and identity there's above the water Iceberg and there's below the water Iceberg below the water requires some sort of selective disclosure um but all of us probably have some sort of public online presence uh excuse me thank you um so we focus entirely on like what do you want to present to the world um about yourself that you you similar to like you participate on Twitter so you're generating a public data footprint uh so now we get into a little bit of like how that gets built and how like it's generated there are three key pieces to your next study that we're going to talk about and how to use them so there's proof service this is the create and store the dids there's relation service which is querying them um so if there's anyone that's ever created a did for anything we've ingested almost all of them and so it's a simple API backed up on our weave so it's publicly available um but you can relation service is a way to query them you get the data so you create the data you read the data um two different services and then the third thing we're going to talk about is a nice new way that we package those things together and for Universal profile experience so we're going to talk a little bit about what a universal profile experience is in a minute um but that's the part that we are most excited about in that we really hope that um you have a look at as well because we would love your feedback because we just released it this week it is not in the App Store but it is there are docs available for it yeah super good question um so we talked a little about what the identity graph is revisit how it can look um this is an actual example from our system so this is my co-founder yisi we have here the ethereum address and then that was linked to Twitter which was a little late to a key base thing and that way I share all the way it over to GitHub lens profile and then our our next ID binder so what we think is really really cool and exciting here is if you have any node in this graph you when creating our system can return and resolve to any point of it so what that means is if you're building a wallet for example you're like oh it would be really nice if I could you know have a secure way of sending someone money using their Twitter handle if someone's interacted at any point with the did system and bonded their Twitter which is the most common activity um now it becomes trivial because I type in you know david.david.you know Twitter David David's Twitter or at David and then I know beyond a shadow of a doubt I'm certain that the that the owner of that Twitter is the owner of that address so I can send money on basically anything um so we're just jump into the universal profile SDK here um pretty simple there's basically four different endpoints um and I'm happy to get in the details or you know just talk directly to you after but the docs docs are all there this is at api.web3.bio so please check that out and let us know if it sucks we want to hear about it it doesn't um and then I'm going to jump over to proof service in just a second um but I'm going to demo live demo why not where is it [Music] cool what if I don't say let me do bear with me one second so what you're able to do with um it always breaks when you demo it huh um yeah so this is a universal profile of you and this is what you're actually able to get with the API is all of this stuff that our friend yisi has done is available in this display and you're actually able to plug this into your apps so that when someone signs in with an address you hit our API and say does this person have a an ID graph and then it returns a diagram the did graph and so you're able to create a super rich display of user information without forcing them until like manually Port that over once again like they have a hundred times before um so we have hundreds of thousands of current users that have um that are that have dids and then there's um a module where you can actually prompt them to create one for the first time as well any thoughts or any questions there yeah so you said that yeah neither and then uh they can be yes yeah so we use the same all the same crypto cryptographic processes that ethereum uses because those are best in practice but these actually live in in on our weave so they're totally decentralized database that everything gets pushed to and then we have we keep a copy of those in AWS and have a really high performance API to make it so you can actually do things with them super easily well transactions that are done out there and question so we don't we don't try to dox or aggregate any data that a person doesn't want aggregated about themselves and so a really important thing is like a did is not a transaction between two addresses it's a signature certifying that the same party controls two different identifiers or two different entities yeah um so our apis are really high performance they handle about 50 million calls a week right now um so we do actually have some users and we look forward to welcoming you into to that family as well um so on the proof service side it gets a little bit more technical I'm going to try to say higher level and now we're getting a bit more into the weeds towards the end um but the way for example that you can actually create a did that binds an address to Twitter is with something called a proof post so we have our Avatar or our you know our what we call just think of those as Keys you know your did Keys you're posting a special string on Twitter that uh our system ingests that is the verified basically uh you have to post a special string that the system generates for you to say yes this is the cryptographic signature that says I own this Twitter account so it's like it's like you tell us you're telling our back end I own David PCO that's my Twitter handle yes yes and then you have to post a special sequence of characters like zero x one two three four on your Twitter account uh to then complete the generation of that proof that you own that entity and then the did gets issued in the system or by your good deity gets issued by itself through the system so a little bit um maybe unfamiliar but uh I promise you when you look at it it's a three-step system and uh is pretty easy to build on so if you're interested um this is kind of our full stack and structure detailing you know where stuff lives uh how the model and data storage Works um love to talk to you more about this but uh I don't think it's too important to go into right now and uh that's where we're gonna wrap it up so thank you guys for coming if you have any questions I have five more minutes to monopolize the space um and you have been wonderful yes oh thanks uh thanks man uh so the the integration to these other kind of web 2 properties is a done deal off or maybe I miss that um so the answer the answer is yes and so we we like to bypass oauth whenever possible to reduce and eliminate platform risk um and so we do that with that uh proof post mechanic that I showed or that I showed a second ago because um like for example a post-based social media won't turn off like they're not going to eliminate somebody everyone's abilities to post but they do turn off API right so you just essentially do it out of band really yeah we don't count on their consent to be able to certify that ownership or their their collaboration though we do have it in some cases any other questions yes hey um so you you did tell a few talkies uh about um yeah take a reputation anywhere um have some a research on um I've been some reputation score all this kind of process yeah just to assess a reputation or provide any seniors or insights regarding exots yeah so reputation is there's a lot of different approaches for it and I think the easiest one to talk about is Bitcoin passport where like the more things that you have linked together the higher degree of probably like the higher score you have of being a a person um what we view as reputation might be a little bit different than um we have then we have historically or traditionally and what uh what I mean there is what I mean there is we treat humans and machines the same we don't really care that much if a machine is participating in a certain ecosystem because it can provide my machines can provide value um is I'm not sure I'm really directly answering your question but what's important here is that you have a persistent footprint that can travel with you beyond a single chain or Beyond a single platform um so what we want to enable the same way that D5 allows for monetary and transactional portability across dapps what we want is to where have it is to create a world where wherever you go online you've brought the parts of you that matter along with you is a group The did is exactly the glue yeah it's the webs of the spider web yeah and after you can build on top of all that any kind of algorithm that will score the reputation I guess you are doing this for example writing the glue that's enabled to link you Unchained of chain social network I'm sorry and there's also there's other standards called verifiable credentials that are getting great adoption um where you actually can package up a government-issued ID without disclosing what that ID is um and say there is a government-issued credential associated with that this address without showing your name or kite or address or anything like that so this is the glue layer and then the other pieces they get built and put in on top of that so if you did want to have a proof of personhood on top of a did system you know there's there's a lot of cool things people are doing there yeah thanks everybody
