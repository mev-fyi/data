welcome just given a few seconds for the live stream to get set up great we are live so welcome again we have vivek and sam here from the swing team and they're going to give a session on how to build cross-train gaps and yeah i'll let you both take the stage sounds good thank you so much ho chi appreciate it hey guys welcome to the uh swing developer workshop um and it's great to have you guys here today um we do have eight thousand dollars in prizes up for grabs and we'll go more into our hackathon details uh later on later in the slide um for for those of you that don't know uh swing or first time hearing about us we are building cross-chain liquidity infrastructure apis for crypto developers our goal really is to make the lives of developers easy when it comes to thinking about how to build cross-chain decentralized applications and we'll go more into that as we kind of dig into the slides here quickly about what we're going to cover today uh a quick slide on uh the swing team or background uh talking a little bit about the growth of multi-chain liquidity and challenges the swing api the uh i think you're not sharing with me oh sorry about that one second can you guys you know yes cool cool there we go sorry about that guys um yeah so i think just take it from the top here for those of you that haven't heard about swing we are building crosstalk liquid infrastructure apis for web view developers we we've been focused on figuring out thinking about ways to make the process of building a building crossing apps easier for developers and not having them not having developers think about all the different pieces under the hood that need to happen in order to enable cross chain liquidity between apps and we'll go more into this as we kind of go to this slide here so a little bit about what we're going to be going to cover today uh the swing team the growth in multi-chain liquidity and challenges uh the swing api bridges and blockchains that we support uh details about our hackathon prizes a little bit about our hiring that we're currently going through and then uh we'll be doing a demo on the actual building the uh i'm building cross-shanked apps and kind of walking through our api as well um as a quick introduction myself my name is vivek i'm one of the co-founders at swing and we also have sam with us today who is our technical co-founder at swing as well it's a pleasure to be talking to you guys today so just quickly um the swing team um we're actually all originally x engineers from silicon valley all based out of california from apple amazon uh linkedin uh oracle team kind of spans across uh multiple different companies out here uh we actually met back in 2017-2018 actually um at a meet-up group out here where we were working on ethereum plasma solutions back in the days before when plasma was actually uh kind of a popular potentially desirable scaling solution for ethereum clearly today zika and optimistic has have kind of taken taken that role today but we kind of stuck together and we've been kind of working on different ideas and uh we came together to start swinging back in 2020 where we were we're thinking about cross chain liquidity between ethereum and other siloed ecosystems like polka dot actually at the time is how we got started which then kind of evolved into what swing is today uh we have a pretty solid roster of investors republic capital arrington capital uh ava labs whose team behind avalanche uh a sense of assets skynet trading bitcoin.com and a few others as well that have been honored that i've been behind us since day one just to kind of quickly set the stage here um you know the growth and i think in multi-blockchain liquidity has been an interesting thing to kind of see uh evolve over the last i'll say i just last probably a couple years you know in 2017 2018 was all about ethereum you spoke about defy and it was really just programmable smart contracts on ethereum uh and that's how it was for for quite a while until 2019 2020. um even in 2020 it was still private the line share of d5 was still on ethereum but over the last two years we've seen that tvr grow from you know less than 50 million which was all on ethereum to now over 200 billion dollars uh spread across multiple major ecosystems right terra b chain avalanche solana polygon i mean it's it's no longer a doubt if you know are we living in a multi-chain world we certainly are that it's no longer a question it's a fact and so what we've been seeing as we kind of started working on swing was that you know there's kind of a different set of challenges that were emerging as cross sheet and multi-chain kind of really took stage and became a much more important topic uh for for developers and for the ecosystem as a whole and some of the key issues that we've been we've identified ourselves as we were kind of walking this process of crossing liquidity and thinking about how to solve some some issues here was that you know first off there is a fragmentation problem with liquidity across multiple blockchains you know try to move liquidity from one blockchain to another whether it's for a token transfer or whether it's for an actual swap not an easy process to do there's developers are usually forced to choose between you know security say scalability price trust speed it's usually not something that's straightforward because of all these different factors that are involved in making that decision about which bridge to choose also what we noticed talking to you know numerous developer teams over maybe about 50 to 100 teams so far is that it's just a very time consuming process to integrate one bridge at a time typically anywhere from two to three weeks per bridge just to integrate and so what we realized from these conversations and just kind of understand the problem set here was that there is a need for a unified liquidity solution here um you know we were seeing that there's about 20 plus blockchains there's about 15 plus bridges today and there's applications that certainly are honest they're on single chain that are thinking how do i go across chain but there are some issues around that problem you know developers are having are having to integrate one by one with these bridges and it's a time-consuming process if one bridge gets hacked now your entire application is is is compromised if you want to go from ethereum to solana you're likely looking to use the wormhole bridge if you want to go from phantom to polygon or polygon to avalanche there's about three four options connects or cellar or or synapse but again every bridge has their set of trade-offs and so i think it can get a little confusing in terms of which bridge is the right bridge for me and so this is what we've been trying to think about and really solve for at swing we were building cross-chain liquidity infrastructure for crypto native developers our mission is to really is to build the fastest and easiest way for developers to integrate crosstalk bridges and multichain liquidity directly into their decentralized cross chain apps and we'll go into about into more about how we do that as well later in the demo really the the swing api is a single integration that gives developers access a total multi-chain liquidity but the idea is that you integrate our api once and you get access to unified liquidity across blockchains bridges liquidity sources all in one go and so as we continue to expand blockchain coverage you get it for free there's no extra work needed on the developer side just that one-time integration is all you need to do and so now we kind of cut down developer time from weeks of integrating multiple bridges to just hours of integrating a single api here and we're going to be launching our sdk in the coming actually next week actually and that will take it down from hours to minutes uh we've done a lot of the heavy lifting to make sure that's even easier for developers to build on the swing product here as well um here's a kind of a quick overview of the different pieces that of the difference are blockchains bridges and liquidity sources we support over 20 blockchains nine cross chain bridges all the major bridges you can see here as well um and then 40 plus liquidity sources and that and this list is continuously growing every month uh as we continue to add to it so you think about who are we building this for um you know of course the crypto developer is our number one user here and developers have typically come to swing because maybe they're looking to discover new bridges or blockchains that they want to work with they understand that there's instant access to trusted cross chain liquidity and volume in one place again you know one ap integration means dozens of trusted bridges and multi-chain liquidity on day one as soon as you integrate and again we reduce the bridge innovation time from two three weeks or more to just hours and again when we launch the sdk it's gonna be minutes in terms of how quickly you can get up and running with cross chain uh liquidity within your own crashing decentralized application we're talking to crypto wallets dex operators and nft marketplaces and we're actually integrating with a bunch of these guys as well today if there's any ideas here that you guys are are interested in or or you want to want to explore feel free to reach us we're available on discord you can also hit us up on our twitter we also have a telegram channel as well a little bit about the hackathon prizes uh for for hack money we will be awarding eight thousand dollars in prizes to projects that will be building meaningful adapts and integrating with the swing api it could be building a website which then integrates a swing api to build things like cross chain dexes cross chain arbitrage bots crashing wallets crushing yield aggregators universal depositors i mean the this list is not a hard and fast rule but certainly i think this this would be some of the more interesting use cases that we could potentially you could potentially explore um we are giving away two types of prizes the name prizes and also the pool prizes uh the name prizes first places we were giving away two thousand dollars thirteen hundred bucks for the second prize and third and third uh 700 bucks for the third prize a pool prize of four thousand dollars will also be given to projects that build meaningful adapts and integrations with their swing api and we'll walk more into about we'll be going exploring more into how the api works and just kind of giving you guys some uh ideas in terms of how to get started with that process and last but not least we are hiring at swing today we're a team of about 18 uh members 85 percent of our team are engineers we have a few design and marketing people on our side as well but we are a technical team primarily first and foremost uh we're looking to hire web3 backend engineers crypto pms smart contract engineers front-end engineers and rust engineers but there's a lot of work to be done and if you're interested in digging into the future of cross chain or sorry the presence of crosstrain feel free to hit us up we're on the break around the uh disco group at hackmoney uh sponsor dash swing or if you are and you can hit up myself directly or any of our team members in the channel uh come directly to our discord discord channel that's also on our twitter page as well uh swing underscore xyz is our twitter handle or just send resumes directly to careers at swing.xyz and one of us will get back to you we're gonna move uh forward now and uh and sam is gonna be presenting the api ui demo uh for swing sam please take it away thank you very big let me present my screen sure all right so hey everyone i'm sam from swing team um so in the next two slides i'm going to demo you the api and ui from swing and also i will give you a real demo on how to use our ui and how to send the request to our api okay so this is like a the bridge tab on our ui this is like powered by our api um so here okay so even though it's called bridge actually our api enables cross-chain swap as well but here i just show you how like how it looks like if you want to transfer token from for example optimism to back to ethereum you can enter the the amount of token here so in this example you're trying to like transfer usdt from optimism back to ethereum um after you enter the the amount uh it will show like all the available routing here below going through all the available bridges um so i will be able to show you a real demo afterwards um this is like the uh the the the page like the uh the ui that's powered by api we also offer you like trade and wallet page and the status page and you can also buy some like you know native tokens if you are like running out of gas tokens here on screen as well um but yeah no okay let's go to the api as well like here is the uh the api diagram like the flow diagram um so the api will enable you to do some sort of you know smart smart routing from one chain to another so say if you want to swap or transfer any token from maybe optimism to ethereum you should be able to get the quote from the api so that's the entrance point you you'll be you'll be able to you know get quotes from the api and then you will be able to see if your code is like native token or not in the example of you know swapping from bnb um bsc to medic on polygon you don't really need to go through allowance and approval step uh but if you're you're trying to you know maybe transfer from usdt to usdt you should go to the approval like workflow now it's pretty much like the same you have to give approve allowance to the uh the the bridge contract and also our contracting user to use your token and then afterwards you should you know hit transfer uh or swap so like the swing api will enable token transfer and token swap so if you put like two tokens let's say like it really depends on like the parameter you put if you wanna you know transfer usdt from a bsc to usdt to a polygon you just need to you know enter the uh the request and then hit transfer uh and send transfer requests i mean and then you should be able to get the uh uh all the other transaction data and then you can from the api and then you should be able to you know send it on chain uh super web three uh but if you are trying to you know do a cross-chain swap you just need to you know give the send as a request uh for example the bnb token on bfc to matic token um polygon and then you send that request to us we should be able to generate the uh the transaction and then you should be able to you know send the transaction once to web3 again and then execute the the transaction um so swing right now we we can you know do all the token transfer from evm chains to evm chains and also we enable nine evm chain token transfer as well so if you have some assets on solana or you want to get some assets on solana you should be able to use swing to transfer from the serum to sunanna or from ethereum to tyra or from serum to oasis we're trying to extend to more non-evm chains like later this year so that you'll be able to connect to maybe near vertical or you know through rainbow bridge or you'll be able to connect to uh other like non-uv engines uh furthermore if you are curious about like okay what's the trend name for or the channel id for avalanche or what are the available tokens that we support on avalanche you should be able to get it from our ap as well we provide you a get config api where you're able to get all the rpc you know like available rpc nodes or like you know chennai d chain information for avalanche or for solana or for tara from our gekko api and then you should be able to you know show it on your ui as well okay so this is enough about like uh slides i will jump to a real demo all right so let me first show you the uh the bridge tab uh as i promised so if you go to app.swing.xyz uh you'll be you know you're you'll be like you know uh direct to this page this is actually the uh single chain swap you should be able to you know enter your uh uh any like if you want to you know maybe swap from bmp token to usdt to be able to you know enter the bmp token here and then you'll receive usdt uh on the same trend so here's the bnb chain that's renamed from bsc uh but this is like okay this is no more aggregated work but what's more interesting is like if you go to bridge tab you should be able to you know like uh sun token question say if you wanna you know transfer 66 token usdt token from uh bmd chain to avalanche you should be able to you know just type in like 66 here and our ui will be able to you know give you all the possible uh like other possible bridges uh so here like say you want to uh just in this option you're going to transfer 66 usdt through cellular bridge to avalanche and the next option is to you know transfer through connex bridge to avalanche um after that you'll be able to review bridge token and then really start the transfer i won't start the transfer ran up but feel free to test it on our ui so this ui is fully powered by our api and if you are wondering like how much token you have on your uh meta mask because like this is question right it's really it's it's kind of you know um hard to you know switch from you know uh change to chance to check your uh available tokens or available like yeah available tokens in metamask you should be able to just connect to our wallet uh page here it will show you all the tokens the question app like i've i did a lot of tests because i have a lot of token across all the chins uh so it will be it's really a like useful tool for me to find out like how much soap can i have on each chain so that don't miss out anything yeah um so if you're wondering how to use our api uh you can go to documentation.swing.xyz and they will direct you to our api page on this api you should be able to find all the information you want uh here we have like several resources here uh you'll be able to join our discord find out our medium and then uh follow our twitter from here but i think more interesting to you guys is like this section build this swing uh you should be able to find all the blockchains all the bridges are the liquidity source of its support from the api right now so for the non-evm chains as i mentioned earlier we support solana tara oasis and we're going to support polkadot because for polka dot they just launched the xcm uh we're going to support customers against their cardinal and like we're going to support more non-uvm blockchains in this list for the evm blockchains we support all sorts of pvm functions already and this lease is like ever growing so for the bridges we support sea bridge connex hub and many more and we're planning to support like uh gravity to you know connect to cosmos and all other native bridges and also cross bridge and they're all under like um construction but we've already support all these bridges so if you are wondering like uh how to use them or you know are you wondering like if you want to fetch liquidity from all these bridges feel free to use swing um and also like say okay uh how to send request to swing uh you should be able to you know go to swing swap clustering swap api here uh and it will lead you to this page um so here like we show you like the production uh server endpoint here there's like swap.dev that's wind x5z who have the production so this is the developer server we'll have the prop server as well um so here and also like we have the discord link here um if you are trying to you know get some you know smart routing you you're gonna first uh hit this endpoint it's to get quote um so like i think the the i like this api like doc uh is because like you are able to send real api requests from here uh say like if you want to test it out if you wanna you know uh send anything from uh psc you just need to select psc here and then put the uh the chin id for bsc say if i want to uh swap uh sorry transfer maybe uh usdc token so here's the usdc uh token address you just copy from bfc scan and then put it over here and then put your uh address here the two chain like you can go to any chain in this demo i just you know select a pocket that's a polygon uh you can select like you know uh ethereum or you know avalanche or any other chance and the two chain id is 137. we have we have tuition id and tuition uh just because like for some uh you know chins uh for example solana they don't really you know they don't use evm so they don't really follow the channel id you know standard so it's so in that case you just need to put two chain id 0 here and then select the chain slack transition name here to solana then you should be able to you know transfer to solana for token amount so uh usdc on bmb chain is pretty weird they have decimals 18 so say if i wanna you know maybe uh transfer a hundred usdc uh so i have to put the uh the 100 plus 18 zeros because we take the uh the the weight value so let me put it here okay and token symbol is i guess i mentioned usdc and then you'll be able to send api request and then this api request will we're going to send the api request to our you know uh server the production server which is swap that that that's windexfesty and it will return this like output this is the response from the api uh so from the response you'll be able to see okay uh we have the bridge available and here's the alpha amount debris they did a great job uh they're gonna return um 99.9 you know usdc on the destination uh and also you have any swap which is you know they change name to a multi-channel we're going to change that too uh and also nxtp uh this is connex bridge uh seller pretty much like everyone supports the specs and apps and you have the free but from token information from chain information to the open to chain information um so after that like after after you after you've got all the possible uh routing information you should be able to choose one um you should be able to like uh get allowance or you know approve the bridge after choose the bridge and then what's more interesting is like okay uh it's now it's ready like you are you've already made your man and you you want to you know swap or transfer through api as well like screen api uh here is the uh the uh the endpoint that you want to hit uh so in this example like uh we're trying to you know transfer a swap from usdc um phantom to matic um polygon uh so the uh usdc on phantom has like decimal six so i'm trying to you know um swap 10 usdc fountain to some metic polygon uh so in this case we're gonna you know and also like you wanna specify okay this is from context bridge uh so all this information gonna be like you're gonna get it from the quote like here in the possible like routing and then after you hit api request send api request you'll be able to get the transaction data here and all other information and for this transaction data you just need to send it uh like this block to uh uh to like to uh in this case fountain uh through a website package uh we have examples uh in our repository as well uh so you'll be able to you know shoot engine like you'll be able to uh fire this like a crosston swap um so you'll be able to show it like the you'll be able to like let metamask to send the uh the request for you if you you know uh send this transaction data function um and also we have this transaction history uh panel also you'll be able to get the transaction uh sorry a transfer status swap status or transfer and swap history here so the status you have to take you have to put the transaction hash this is returned by metamask and then in the history you should be able to put your user wallet address here and then you should be able to get all the response it takes some time because i've already done a lot of like you know crosstalk and transfer questions for testing purpose um so it will you know uh here's the response example okay it's back to be able to get all the all the transactions so this this transaction is actually from xcp and um it's it's successful and the function id is like i'm trying to you know send from bsc to polygon everything i have like this long list of transactions after you send any transaction you'll be able to find all the transactions here and also we have the skype config endpoint you'll be able to get a list of chain ids and here release and also all the tokens that support by each chain and also all the bridges support by each chain and tokens um yeah so that's pretty much it so if you have any questions uh once again you can just you know join our discord channel uh like everyone from our team will be waiting for you there to answer your questions or help you out um yeah that's pretty much it going back to you otherwise yeah thank you so much sam for that presentation and so uh that actually brings us to the end of our presentation here um we're happy to take questions uh from anybody in the group here uh and answer any uh anything about crosstrainer token transfers uh anything to do with the multi-team world i think there's a question in the chapter of event when making a swap uh you can can you make bridge x to bridge y or or you have to do bridge x to ethereum and then to bridge bridge y um yeah i think sam just answered that yeah you can go directly to bridge y uh juan john maybe you can give us a particular example is there a particular set of blockchains you're looking to transact between you're free to mute yourself that's fine it looks like we've got the question answered any other questions and so also as uh as sam mentioned as well feel free to reach us directly in the discord group uh we are we are all available there and uh we've actually already had a few members reach out to us about potential roles at swing and we are looking actively higher so if this is something that's interesting to you the the world of multi-chain and cross chain we're certainly looking to meet with you and speak with you is there a repo with use case of swing for arbitrage yes so um we actually have we actually haven't i think the arbitrage use case is very interesting um especially when it comes to uh you know a simple example is you know there's let's say there's uh the same token hack token on on two different chains on polygon and also on avalanche for example you buy 15 000 hack tokens on on polygon immediately the price goes up by five percent on avalanche the price is five percent cheaper you immediately buy these tokens on the avalanche side bridge them over using swing api and then immediately sell on the avalanche side to could take a quick profit there you know especially given assuming that we can minimize slippage in these type of scenarios arbitrage actually becomes very interesting when it comes to cross chain the reality today is that is that the price differences across different chains for the same assets there certainly is opportunities to to perform arbitrage uh kind of trading over here um it's kind of like the early days of of decks trading back in 2017-2018 if you guys remember great thanks for vectoring sam we're just on time awesome if there's any more questions feel free to connect over discord and enjoy the rest of your day thanks a lot guys appreciate it
