foreign [Music] so I want to give you guys a background about me I just want to make sure can everyone hear me cool thanks for having me eth Global and uh hello to everyone at home thanks for uh listening in and tuning in uh my name is Matt K I go by crypto Matt k a little bit of background about me I've been uh in crypto marketing for about two years now I'm a social media manager and a digital Community Builder I'm also an AI nerd and you guys may or may not have seen me around at some of the ethereum events I DJ them sometimes um I'm also a core member of the eth Warsaw team I run socials for them and help them with their marketing efforts uh that's my handles right there crypto Mac a um so to give you some background you know my path uh I started working for Forge it used to be called bondly Finance I've taken their Community from about 20 000 followers to sixty thousand Twitter followers uh in the six months that I was there this was during like the 2021 bull market we uh pushed around five million dollars in nft sales that was about 25 000 nfts sold at uh mint so that's before secondary market sales I ran projects for uh Tory Lanez it's a rapper if in case anyone doesn't know Logan Paul and Louis Capaldi uh then I switched over to trufi uh at trufi I joined the company when they had about 20 000 Twitter followers and uh grew the account to about 87 000 Twitter followers um when I joined there was about 3 000 Discord members and then by the time my time ended there we were at around 25 000 Discord members uh throughout last year I also helped uh bring over 5 000 people to our in-person events uh that we hosted around the globe so these are kind of the three topics that I want all of you to walk away with understanding um the importance of building community in web 3 one of them being uh Community is a pillar to project success uh Community is web 3 marketing and I'll go into that to kind of give you all an understanding of like how marketing used to be and where we're at now and where we'll be in the future um as well as understanding that persistence is key A lot of people think that you know you come in community is just built overnight but the reality is this takes like three to six months nine months actually like Implement and execute like a proper plan so I want to kind of introduce and start us off with explaining the good so what what does it look like when a good uh attempt at Community happens so the Logan Paul nft sale is a very great example um does anyone know who Logan Paul is in here do you guys just want to raise their hand let me know do you guys know who Logan Paul is okay so this guy clearly as you guys know has a very active Community online he's a YouTube influencer he is like super hype on Pokemon so during this time we helped sell nfts around his Pokemon release launch and so like he kind of went in and allowed people to come visit him and open the box with him and they made a bunch of content around that after this sale um so that is what it looks like when Community is good and dialed in and there's you know proper implementation there another one is Tory Lanez if you guys don't know who Tory Lanez is uh he's a rapper independent music artist out of out of the US uh helped launch a an nft sale where uh he sold something like a million copies of his digital album as an nft for one dollar so in like 90 seconds he sold over a million copies of his of his digital album generating like a million sales and a million dollars of Revenue so what does that mean he ended up getting like a couple of wards after that um so these are really great examples of what you know proper Community execution looks like now this stuff is the bad so this is like the opposite end of the spectrum right so as someone that works in community I've been a community moderator I've been a community manager it really sucks to get messages like this this is during times of low sentiment during times of low volume this is when you are engaging with your community but there's nothing being rolled out from the product and Engineering side this is like when morale is really low and you start to lose faith in what you're doing as folks in community I mean we're all here and whether you guys realize it or not you know Heath Global ethereum is a community as well and uh we're here to kind of help each other grow through these efforts of the hackathon for instance right so um this is kind of the negative aspects when you know things are down and it's really tough to get out of this situation um I've been here before um it's not fun uh and uh you know it takes a lot of like grinding and really being persistent and and present to show the community that you're not going anywhere to kind of like dig yourself out of this hole so this is kind of a slide on you know breaking it down how to build community within web3 um first you want to Define your community I'll show you guys the spaces model in the next slide um and kind of unpackage that before we go into steps two three and four um here's the spaces model uh this is by David Spinks he's one of like the most well-known creators in the community space since it became kind of like a thing in web 2 uh he kind of put together this spaces model where um if you're someone that works in community and you want to show kpis to Your Business Leaders at your organization this is the uh direction that you want to take your program in from the exception a lot of companies have um one to three of these in their growth implementation models um and you want to kind of prioritize each one of these Avenues once one at a time because if you do too much you have a team that gets burnt out you can't report proper results and um then it kind of just leaves everyone frustrated and wondering like what went wrong right so if uh you take a look at this slide this is kind of what the current landscape of community looks like within the spaces model as organizations imp Implement each one of those layers you'll see that the top three are pretty much support so that's kind of like customer support external engagement those are folks that are actually empowered and confident and have faith in let's say the protocol or what the technology is internally and they help adapt uh techniques to um to approach folks that are outside of the organization success is that last kind of important um pillar that that folks lean into from the spaces model and that kind of shows you know you you have tried out certain campaigns you've seen what the results are and you're tweaking them moving forward to kind of um you know reproduce uh better results in the future so we're in web 3 I made this meme you know all of you guys are devs I'm a community guy I'm a marketing guy like none of y'all want to be approached by targeted ads like that doesn't look good no one likes that it's annoying so you guys can read past that right like you can just go and check out those the the code and read through all of the nonsense that the ad is telling you so um you know you want to be part of a group that helps Foster ecosystem growth and you have like-minded folks that you could talk to about the technology versus being hit by the ad right so moving on this is kind of like what it looks like from a business perspective as well as like a user lifestyle perspective on how to implement a community growth plan and you want to start off by cultivating community Through Discord telegram Twitter uh as you all know everyone loves memes the recent you know Meme coin season has been out of control and you guys see how much engagement that produces on socials uh that catches your your eye that's a way to kind of sell what you're building as a uh as a community within your um organization right so at once you join you know once you got kind of pulled in by this uh Outreach um and you're and you're within the the system you kind of want to you're like okay what do I do now so people need to educate you uh internally and they can do that through uh a light paper blogs videos amas are a great way to Foster engagement and education within a community this helps people kind of sit in a room together like we are today and uh learn about what the technology is what your value add is to the ecosystem um later on as you get educated and empowered you kind of enter this adaption curve where more users and Builders join the protocol and then it kind of starts to like have this like that yield curve where you kind of hockey stick up and that takes time I mean this is like we're talking about months to years now just to get to this adoption curve once you get to the credibility you know that's when you start really focusing on press releases Partnerships with bigger uh communities you can bring on influencers during this time as well as like proper team leadership so that means hiring folks from you know web 2 that are veterans and D5 or like you know Wall Street Veterans for a D5 protocol stuff like that uh eventually you get to the build phase which is hey we had V1 that was dope we crushed it let's Implement V2 and let's execute on this model now and then you kind of start that cycle all over again because more and more people start joining and then you engage with them to uh push them through the life cycle of a of a Community member so circling back to the three topics that I want you all to walk away with ZK sync um I guess I'll start asking who knows ZK sinking here do you guys are you guys aware yeah so ZK sync Layer Two scaling solution uses uh zero knowledge proofs uh to push faster or cheaper transactions right they've been really really really uh present as leaders in the space for over a year now constantly doing spaces on Twitter constantly doing amas on Discord hosting Town Halls pushing uh product and Engineering updates now they just launched I think it was like a month or two ago that they're on on mainnet I'm pretty sure it was last month and within 30 days I think it was even like 15 days they went from zero to 100 million total value locked within their ZK sync Network and I mean that is without a doubt a tail sign of what it looks like when you've been building for months even years at a time um to have this sort of metric to share with uh you know the ethereum ecosystem um number two that I wanted to point out here is Qui network uh does anyone in here know quiet they're relatively new so I wouldn't be so you do so small smaller percentage of the room knows about Kwai but I met the Qui guys at Heath Denver and they are an L1 that uh claims to be pushing like 50 000 transactions per second so we all know that like L1 competition is very stiff out there we all know that l1s are you know not as popular as they used to be but Qui is all over the place and they're present because in their tokenomics model they've actually built out a portion of their future token airdrop and you know token release to be distributed to folks that help them with the marketing efforts uh for the L1 network uh that is something that it Hypes people up it lets people feel you know bounded to and invested in something that um you know is to be in the future and uh I've seen qui's social media engagement as well as you know they have different hashtags for different projects that they're pushing different efforts and it's insane to see how how the community is so engaged and so active to pound the pavement and like let the world know that quiet Network exists it's going to be really cool keep your eyes out about quiet net worth it's going to be cool to see where they go in like six months to 12 months from now when they uh eventually head over to mainnet so this is the second pillar that I want and in my opinion this is like the most important pillar of this talk because I want you all to leave understanding that like Community is marketing it's Marketing in the sense that you know social media is incorporated into this um press is incorporated into this but also presence and um I I think that when folks think about marketing they initially go to like web 2 marketing and how things were built back in the day where you get hit by targeted ads and newsletters and stuff like that nowadays in web 3 we're doing stuff like what I did for trufi this nft project help create like 120 000 emails for us we had about 13 000 people mint this nft it took our uh Twitter followers from like 47 40 000 to 87 000 uh Twitter followers and our Discord grew twice um from 12 000 to like twenty five thousand members and so you know my app what I want to ask you guys to think about is like what did we do with these folks afterwards I guess I'll like pause here like now that I've spoken about you know the the the kind of implementation model if you think you meant this nft and now all of a sudden you have it like you're excited about true fight but you don't really know what it is like what do you guys think we did to kind of help Foster them and educate them um does anyone have any ideas take like a break here so it could have been something like doing amas with them pushing blog posts um posting kind of Live Events digitally so that they can come in and ask us questions about what we were doing um true five by the way is uh decentralized uh lending protocol and so um you know the nft had water flowing in and out of it and that's kind of like what represented um the liquidity that enters and leaves the the protocol um so through amas and spaces we were able to educate them on what we were doing eventually we took them through the life cycle and they became contributing down members and token holders so um that's kind of another good uh lesson learned around uh Community Building um now this is uh an nft project I know my my guy before me was was covering nfts I think this is a really good example of one of the three kind of legs of a table of of uh community building and web three um persistence is key um these guys that are uh in this nft project I see them as like the Builders of web3 right now within the nft space these are folks that you know may not have made their you know Financial gains or whatever in web 3 yet but they're all there tinkering and building and pushing um the ecosystem to grow more I've actually met a lot of other marketing folks and VCS um through this uh community that I'm now doing work with um to help you know build their portfolios out and and kind of scale their marketing efforts up um the reason I the reason I add them as the persistence leg here is that they almost died they went you know they had their rise up and then the nft market crashed the crypto Market crashed and they almost went to zero but through folks like literally just showing up every day and grinding and creating different narratives to show like Hey we're still here like just buy a seal you coward is kind of like what they say but um eventually they got the seal of approval from the ethereum nft community and now they're kind of back to like a nice and reasonable sustainable level um this is another thing you know they created this you guys will see I'm sure where a lot of nft folks this is my seal by the way but they have this uh meme generator where it pushes uh use unique user assets so that you can kind of create your own content online um and and these are some examples of what that looks like uh I'm using I want to explain you know what some tools are for building community in web3 um you guys saw that nft by trufi earlier that I was describing uh galaxy is the uh the organization that helped power that effort so what we did was we launched the nft on Galaxy's platform and through uh leveraging the two communities we were able to amplify the noise um that that we uh had during that campaign um zealy is another tool that helps Drive growth and engagement nft inspect if any of y'all are in nfts you can use nft inspect to kind of uh compare and contrast different uh metrics across uh projects um Quest is kind of similar to Galaxy um Quest and Galaxy you kind of need to complete um you know different steps different credentials to uh earn the experience that that's at the end of the road there uh lens is here um they have a table lens this is pretty much web3 social media it's like the Facebook of web3 I like to say then we also have super spaces that help supercharge your Twitter spaces um and then you all know Discord Telegram and Twitter I would consider those like your base layer uh tools for building community and web3 that's where your main communication channels are now Food For Thought uh I kind of want you guys to leave here also understanding like we're in the space where we're doing community-based engagement because we're so early people want to feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves and that's another reason why we're all here because we want to build the next best thing and bring that to the ethereum ecosystem to keep expanding this um there the the plumbing doesn't exist like it does in web 2. if you want to go for instance and change your euro to dollars on your on your revolute or whatever the button that you press to create that exchange to sell off your Euro and buy dollars doesn't exist in web 3 yet and that's why we're really clunky and that's why we haven't really reached Mass adoption yet so I'm curious and I think you guys all can think about this as you leave this talk to think you know what does the future of web 3 marketing look like is it going to be focused primarily on this community building aspect or will it grow to shrink into a smaller Community Building aspect where uh we focus more on user-based marketing because we have all of the elements and you know the plumbing required to make it user friendly versus the way it is right now um wrapping it up commute the three topics that I want you guys to understand from this conversation is community building is a key pillar of growth Community is web 3 marketing it's a it is one of the foundational legs of the table that is web 3 marketing I think without it you don't have a product or a company rather and persistence is key this doesn't happen overnight this takes it's you have to grind to make this a reality and you need to have a plan over a six to nine to twelve month kind of period of time in order to see this growth happen so once again there's my information my Twitter is at crypto Matt K I'm at crypto Mac a on Telegram and uh thanks for having me guys really appreciate the time yeah if if anyone has questions uh mine time is at the top of the hour but I'd be happy to take yours sir thank you um so the question is uh an AI chat bot within your project I guess right so my thoughts on chat Bots are do it they're only getting better uh transparently this whole slideshow was made by AI so like I'm a huge advocate for AI I use chatgpt for my work almost every day uh I use mid-journey to create all the graphics that you guys have seen here like use the bot you don't have funding like major VC companies do like implement it and use it as a means of like creating a funnel for yourself as folks kind of break through that barrier to uh get to a human you know you're saving a lot of time and resources by doing that so I think in the stage where you're at I would I would highly recommend you you lean into it yep anyone else what's up so where am I transparently this is my first talk and I'm I haven't even spoken the web too I haven't even thought of doing that I'd be curious personally to see what that looks like because it's a completely different conversation and I think that just thinking about this in real time like I would focus on kind of what they're doing and then just explaining to them like what this is what I just explained to you guys and why it's important in order to create like a bridge uh there was a talk that I that I sat in on where we're actually like as marketers looking to withdraw from crypto native because eventually you're gonna get you're gonna hit a wall and then you're gonna be like all right well I have as big of a Mark should share as I can like how do I get more users and that is by going and talking to the web 2 folks so um consider this the beginning of something and uh it's gonna get fine-tuned as we move forward here yeah man uh any other questions sweet thanks guys so much I really appreciate the time and I hope you guys have a great hackathon
