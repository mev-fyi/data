foreign [Music] hi everybody come on in if you want um yeah I'm gonna kick this off it's 4 30 now and if people are joining later that's okay um I'm gonna uh talk to you about cello so thank you for joining I appreciate you folks being here looking forward to seeing what kind of ideas you have and if you if you need any help look for people with bright yellow shirts we are in the uh one of the main Halls um so I want to talk about solo today uh cello is a a blockchain protocol I can't move this uh blockchain protocol that is um built for what we believe is prosperity for all the blockchain started um with the focus on mobile user experience so trying to help people reach people through their mobile devices it being the most common computer that people have access to and first off I just want to say who I am my name is Eric nakagawa I'm actually from San Francisco and I'm happy to be here in Tokyo and looking forward to meeting each of you I lead the developer relations team for the solo foundation and I have here Anna and a bunch of folks at our booth who are here to to help out throughout this whole thing so we'll be here with you as long as we can um we've got Anna or Paul Daniel and viral so I talk about what solo do some demos um that we'll talk through bounties because I think uh you folks are going to want to know how to maximize your chances for winning a bounty from solo uh from the seller prizes so like I said before cello uh is kind of built with with a focus on Prosperity for all uh we actually launched the project back on Earth day which is coming up by the way next week back in 2020 and we when solo started we didn't have the word regenerative Finance what we had kind of focused on was social impact um climate and things like that but now with the word regenerative Finance uh it's allowed us to have a better kind of better a better word or term to use to kind of describe the work that we do and the way that we look at the work that we do um on cello is to focus on more than just the financial impact we also want to figure out a way to have a have an additional change um that in many cases can be climate it can be helping your community and some of the projects that have been built on cello uh focus on refi and actually put some of the early kind of leaders in some of the um in the space Have Been Around the concept of universal basic income is a project on solo that I love called impact Market which helps to distribute money to people all around the world um uh through a Ubi kind of concept another one that recently joined solo it's a project you should take a look at it's called good dollar good dollar is also another project um that helps to distribute money to people where they need it and actually one of the projects here if you're looking at bounties uh superfluid launched on sale to support good dollar um so supporting good dollars migration to Sello and so if you're looking for bodies to stack uh take a look at Super fluid they are launched on mainnet not on testnet right now but if you folks need some help come come find us we can help you get set up with solo you don't need a lot of tokens to deploy your contracts other things that you know sell has helped um focus on has also been natural cap national capital backed currencies and that means things like land and trees and like I'm tokenizing that and this is very common nowadays but just remember two years ago nobody was really talking about this and we're happy to be a part of and I have so many more people um joining this community with us other things that actually attracted me the most to sell it was the concept of community currencies I'm from Hawaii I live in San Francisco but I'm from Hawaii and the concept of the value of land being given to the people to do something with it I think has been really um really powerful and I've actually benefited from some some people that have locked away land for native Hawaiians um also kind of creating the creating money without debt or uh nurturing a community um nurturing the community of people that are building these things that are either climate focused or social social about Focus we also want a prize which is cool I'll be on a crypty award last year I'm very happy um to be recognized so what is cello cell is L1 so if you're thinking like how does this help me you're building a if you're writing solidity this weekend and you're going to be deploying your contracts you can deploy to solo zvm compatible and allows you to very a lot of tooling that we'll get into that could help you to deploy your contracts we also have a bunch of core contracts that can help you out there are several stable coins that are over collateralized stable coins that can be used to as a core part of your if you're building like a D5 thing you can support cusd which is a USD type stablecoin c Euro serial so you have some support for Brazilian users out there and then as I mentioned before seller was launched with a focus on mobile and what we mean by that is everybody here has a phone I'm pretty sure of it but how many people have you met with a phone that don't have a crypto wallet it's actually very common so one of the one of the cool features that solo had built from the beginning has been a concept of being able to send money to a phone number and the way that it works is very straightforward if the if the phone number um you do a lookup and if that phone number has a wallet address you just sent to that wallet address if it doesn't have a wallet address you can set up an escrow so that when that phone number is attached to a wallet it can then release those funds and so it's a great way to onboard a lot of people so again I don't know I'd love to hear some of your ideas kind of areas of focus but if you're trying to build for Global south or any sort of like emerging market or you're looking for ways to help onboard new people into the space not just people that have been in you know crypto space for a long time or they still call it crypto like me um but into the web 3 space then take a look at some of those tools and one of those tools would be called Otis which is a way to private like securely prevent people from kind of just like attacking the service to figure out who's in your address book um and account uh social connect which is phone number support and then we've also started adding um support for things like GitHub and other social accounts that just help you to send money on cello without needing a wallet address um if you look at you know how many people are using solo there are these numbers a little bit outdated over a million uh unique wallets um and seeing where people are based uh it's quite a large number of people again spread um in Latin America across Europe in in parts of Asia um and we're really proud of the number of people that are using solo uh in addition to the people that are using um using it there's a lot of companies that also support this so um cello has over 200 members of The Alliance for Prosperity which is a commitment for organizations to support um reaching seller's goal of prosperity for all um from uh from I think within the first month of launch cello introduced a concept of um uh carbon offsets so from the beginning we've had a bunch of offsets in place and it's all set a large number of CO2 there are actually some new proposals coming out that will actually increase the amount that goes towards offsetting through um through both validator Awards I'm opting in as well as increasing the amount of the amount that's being burnt towards uh the offset fund uh there's over a thousand projects built on solo um again these numbers are very round it sounds big but there's a lot of real people building projects on cello and I mentioned projects like like good dollar impact Market there's a lot of you know games there's a lot of you know all sorts of projects um and again these numbers a little bit about outdated but over 200 million transactions on solo I think last time I saw was like around 250. so a ton of people um uh throughout the world uh here's just a kind of a quick glimpse of users across over 150 countries so when you're building on solo You're Building to potentially help people in all these different countries all over the world and we're really excited to see what you can build so as I mentioned before cello is L1 it's proof of stake and what that means is nowadays it's a little bit different um but it means there's there's very fast finality so if you make a transaction it gets settled very very quickly and it can be useful for people that are building financial services and they want to make sure that um uh when something is completed it's it's completed and and submitted on chain I'd mentioned the optimization for mobile first development in addition to the phone number mapping um we also have some mobile ZK type support for lightweight mobile clients I don't know if you can really work on that in a hackathon to be honest but something to think about when you're trying to build out your your plan your growth plan for your your project if you do decide to turn it into um something bigger um one cool feature that I like about solo is again when you're starting with uh somebody who doesn't have a wallet and um they they only have a phone number and they then associate their mobile phone with a their mobile number with their wallet and tie that together how do they transact right like how do you start from no no tokens or no gas how do you pay for gas one of the things that solo does offer is being able to pay for gas with some of the Stables so you can pay with cusd cro um serial and the cello the main seller token and the reason that this is I think really cool is again you could say you know onboard some person give them you know take their number uh deposit I don't know a penny and then have enough gas to like transact as much as you need in that short amount of time until they actually either bring in some funds or do something of value on the train um so that ping ping with uh erc20 tokens is a great benefit and um that number that number of tokens that are supported can expand in fact good dollar right now is looking to include their token as a method for paying for gas and the reason I think that's exciting is that could help to onboard tons of more people just with good dollar to pay to pay for other tokens it's not here yet it's it's a governance proposal that's coming together um and very exciting we also have a bunch of regen or refi type building blocks so toucan um recently announced uh retirement of carbon and uh that's pretty cool I've never actually done that until recently I've heard about the concept of carbon but never actually did something with it I mean even still today I can't even how what does it look like is it in my you know it's hard to touch and reach but like if you can do something on chain like that um and this interests you take a look at Toucan who's deployed on um on mainnet and available to you to build uh this weekend uh the community is decentralized and just like every project I mean it seems obvious but um there's a lot of community proposals that um actually I think someone here uh Juan from the community is actually here he's a volunteer uh has been helping to create a dowel to focus on Latin America so people that are trying to start things in um in Latin America can can go directly to the people that know their um the things that they're probably trying to solve and allows them to propose um to those groups uh we have also a bunch of crosstain interoperability um out here there's hyperlane hyperlane is another project you can consider as if you're trying to stack your bounties um they you know if you're building tripolane include cello they are one of the they supported cello kind of early on and they're built um some of the team from uh from uh from Cello uh started that company and uh it's a very very friendly space um I mentioned the stable coins and then transaction fees are very low um it's proof of stake so it's extremely low and really use I think good for um just doing either high volume of transactions or not impacting the the user so you're not like spending a lot of you're not having to second guess um how much you're going to spend on these transactions we have a bunch of Primitives I know this is very hard to see um which projects are supported on solo but some of the ones that I'm most excited about is our recent worker on chain link is still not on on launched yet but working on that I mentioned impact Market um there's full metamask support so you can just swap in the chain quite easily if you're looking for a mobile wallet take a look at valora valora and then also Opera again there's tons of little icons that if you zoom in I'm sure you've heard of of these projects and protocols there are several uh uh amms like like sushi swap um we have uh unit swap as well and uh I mentioned some of the other projects like good dollar and others like that so there's a lot um and I think you have all the tools you need to build in addition to the the tooling that's there there's also a lot of projects um or companies helping to kind of again commit to the alliance for Prosperity I mentioned 200 of them some of them include Mercy core T-Mobile runs validators on cello Grammy Foundation impact market now runs a validator so a lot of great projects help with the secure the network in addition to building on top of solo um and then as you're thinking about you know the refine what that means um think about like building your smart contracts with some purpose Beyond of course as a hackathon but can it do more than you know just accrue value can it actually have a um have an impact beyond that um there are also um as a upon launch I said mentioned that a portion of the um uh the reserve uh was going to offset uh carbon and right now I think the amount's like 0.5 percent with some of the new changes that are coming it's going to be much larger I'm excited about that and if you're building into the refi space consider um building your project and pitching it to a climate Collective which is um a fund that actually invests in uh climate projects um again I mentioned on-chain carbon assets if you go to sellerreserve.org you can see the full list of where all the where that's all going um and you can you can you know you can double check in terms of actually building this weekend uh you can launch on inferior uh if you're a sports solo uh there's also quick note I think they might be a sponsor and then lava if you're looking for a more decentralized um endpoint infrastructure in terms of refi or tools to use take a look at Tucan I mentioned impact market and one of my new favorites called spirals which actually takes um in uh uh staking rewards and actually just redirects them for you to a bunch of climate protocol or climate options for cross chain messaging they don't like you saying that calling everything a bridge take a look at hyperlane there's also um Albridge portal and XLR support and then oracle's chain link coming soon we also have Redstone pith and band and some others and uh super fluid I mentioned super fluid and for wallets if you're building I would be building using metamask it's so easy but if you're trying to get into multi-cigs of course include safe at safe.sella.org deployed by the the safe team and then finally when you're when you're troubleshooting your uh transactions uh ether scans on solo but we call it celloscan because everything has its own name um so use that for troubleshooting your smart contracts on both Tesla and mainnet and then same thing for explorer.sell.org that's the that's the um the alternative blockchain Explorer so what I want to do is just show a quick project I know you folks can't really build until eight so you got a couple more hours but if you're looking to just prototype and build something really quickly um I wanted to demonstrate uh so what we call cello uh it's actually called eat Global Tokyo you can scan this QR code if you're looking for a starter project um and this is just this is just it running what you'll get when you start it up is going to be a simple startup page with a video explainer um a storage uh sort of protocol running I think on both mainnet and test net and this is really simple it just takes numbers um and the reason that we pulled this together was um scaffold eth is here and solo uh composer which this project is built on is based off of scaffolding we just added a bunch of changes to make it a little bit easier so if you're trying to build for react we got you if you're trying to build react native both Expo or non-expo you can use that if you want to use flutter because some people prefer building in flutter you can use that um and then we also have angular support too so uh yeah here's a just a quick just a quick example the reason that we we wanted to give you folks this is you don't have much time and um anything we can do to kind of help out is great we also embedded in this um we have it we expose a subgraph just to help with iterating through the responses um and it's very simple so this is our it's already a published subgraph on graph uh on the graph and of course demos don't work ever um in real life but trust me these images are there and you can use this to to uh kind of jump start your project if you're going to be kind of doing nfts or something like that or if you're going to be publishing data in some sort of fashion that may need a way to iterate kind of quickly through that data without parsing it yourself take a look at the the subgraph support and then this is a little bit out there but Masa Finance recently launched on cello and we've introduced um just a quick look up for let me just kind of this will not work uh I think I own this one so it's just a way to to quickly look up um similar to like ens Masa masa.finance take a look at that and again these are just some some example projects there's more that we've included in the repo so there's a couple branches if you want to take a look at spirals implementation we have that as well we didn't want to include it here because it was still kind of you know these things are um they might be not ready for production per se but enough for a hackathon for sure and then going back to my slides real quick um so yeah I wanted to show you folks this and then I wanted to show you solo composer so if you're thinking that project seems a little bit too basic uh you can use solo composer and what solo composer can do is just like with um just like with um scaffold.eth you can quickly spin up a like a Bare Bones project just want to run through this real quick give me a second so you can run this uh I'm sure it'll work for you it may not work for me but you just run a command line and you can just quickly choose oh let me scroll down quickly choose like what you want to build so you got react react native flutter and angular and we built this to speed up time this can get you started in like five seconds I'm sure you don't need that much time you can use two projects for um accessing the seller Network either react Solo or rainbow kit um and then hard hat or or truffle support and it can come with a kind of a basic subgraph again it depends what you're trying to build but we're just trying to help you folks speed up the time to to launch your project and make sure you folks don't get kind of caught caught up with stuff because it's based off of scaffoldeth uh they can help you out but you know we are happy to to answer any questions you folks might have and another fun thing actually is I wanted to show you this um oops I wanted to show you folks this project um this one is funny so uh someone in the community actually built uh built a tragedy BT based off of our docs and so you can quickly ask it like you know um which libraries support fee currency fee currency support is paying gas with erc20 tokens so you can um just ask it let's see if this demo works oh my gosh of course um uh anyway so you can ask questions about um how many validators are on solo you know demos work oh here we go it actually came back okay great so it tells you an ESR information you might come up with you can ask us we're happy to help you out but if you just have a quick question just ask the solo gbt project the link is here in the presentation and then uh I think we can also include it in our notes on the on the uh hackathon uh info information page um so let's talk about bounties sorry for taking so long but we're here so we have uh five different prizes we're gonna be giving out uh climate refi Focus as I mentioned earlier payments D5 or any sort of any utilization of stable coins you'll be good there public goods and sort of community type efforts if you're trying to build something that's more down focused um consider the dowel nft gaming section and finally Wild Card we're just going to choose the best project comes through if you're looking for ideas for um the the climate refi Bounty take a look at um topics like natural Capital tokens if you're building an oracle if you want to add incentives if you want to add liquidity for natural Capital tokens taking or general Finance or anything that asks that offers stability for payments it could be lending front ends use cases for cross-border payments uh cross chain lending protocols using super fluid will count here specifically and then low liquidity asset pricing auctions and then finally using mental stable so I mentioned cusd serial crl for public goods we are looking for projects that either have educational elements to it some sort of content production either from the community or from your team increasing awareness about cello that's more obviously helping benefit get the word out about Sello and then for Dao's most of these are gonna be dial focused but you know ways to kind of like create the concept of like more fractional dials more education some of these May overlap and you can apply for both of them if it if you think your idea fits the concept of dissolvable dials like what happens when our job is done and we're able to move on what does that look like um and then in the concept of nfts more Dynamic type nfts were interested in seeing those especially if there's a refi component especially with refi having a change in our planet they should be able to reflect that on an nft some sort of carbon nft mechanism play to earn but with an offset component some sort of carbon offset and the final Wild Card we're going to look for things that are more experimental maybe more researchy so like offline transactions anything that deals with privacy to see take a look at plumo which is our project that helps to create a lightweight client mobile client ZK uh ZK mobile client a we've been looking for ways to see that someone in the community build a wasm like client um some sort of better way to kind of estimate gas so like uh gas estimation is generally hard but something that could be better than what we currently have on chain would be nice and then some sort of method for in the community like voting on proposals things like that and as I mentioned before when solo started we aimed for mobile the mobile use case and the challenge with Mobile use case is you're dealing with people who might not be technology literate or you know number literate and so how can you design a browser that can work for folks that you know aren't you know aren't uh familiar with with English kind of designs and layouts and finally again these are more researchy but like referral Rewards or cashback programs um for the specific criteria that's actually not that complicated for us um we're just looking at your project matches one of the solo bounties um if you have a question come and see us if you are stacking your projects here's a couple here that we're happy to talk to you about so super fluid hyperlane as I mentioned safe um you know Swap and and graph sub graphs um uh the main technical criteria is I'm expecting really cool projects but like you got to deploy your contract to testnet or mainnet and demonstrate it to somebody on our team there's about five of us so you um you should definitely have an opportunity to find someone to demonstrate and that's pretty much it so um we wish you all the best of luck we will be hanging out both physically here and for folks who are working remotely or if they're not here right now they're watching the stream we'll be in the solo sponsor Discord Channel and um that's it cool I I think I have a little bit of time for Q a if anybody has specific questions and if we run out of time I think we only have like three minutes um happy to have a conversation outside or away from the next speaker any questions yep okay cool all right thank you very much everybody foreign
