cool and we're good to go welcome everyone um to the first day of nft hack 2022 workshop um we're so happy to have you all here and also super happy to have leo from harmony here who is going to give his workshop on cross chain and a cheap bridge on harmony so with that being said leo the mic is yours thank you anna um i'm leo i'm the vp engineering at harmony so i'm also driving rnfte and the metaverse initiative in harmony so today just give a brief introduction about the harmony energy and also cause horse chain efficiency in harmony so we know we are in a massaging world right now and there's a lot of massage mt been developed like when one know the the well-known open c on ethereum and uh flow is a another blockchain dedicated to nft nba top short is the top project developed under flow blockchain so on harmony there's also a very popular game type project developed recently called the d5 kingdom so in a multi-chain world oops we're talking about the croatian ft so croatian nft basically is that to have your nft in different chain and you can use a cross-chain bridge to bring your nft to different chain so uh harmony launched a cross-chain ft bridge in december last year so right now we supported ethereum and we are going to support the bsc and the polygon so the nft bridge will be able to support the um those uh um ethereum bsc and polygon and the harmony to have your nft and transfer across different chain so we then need to build a tool to empower all the builders like you guys coming to build across your empty and utilities so our bridge the enemy bridge is one of the um earlier nfg bridge in the industry right now so it provides a high security bridge um by our multi-signature operators it's a two-way bridge you can bridge from harmony to ethereum and the front is certain how much how many i also mentioned the bsc and the polygon support run are in progress so it supports standard ess 721 and erc 1155 why do we need to build a crosstal nft and because we believe nft is deemed for everyone on different chair and there are different users and the ecosystem developed so it's not just everyone going to be on the same chain and of course but when you have an mft as your identity or as your collectible different chain you want to make it also usable for other ecosystem so each chair has their own unique ecosystem so that the crushing ft will become a utility here and become a nicer choice so also we know on different chains there could be a different fee and a higher fee or slow down the adoption of the nft technology so that's why and we built the crossing mt to enable global market and the direct market on different uh area of the uh in the world so people may use a different chair and also different use cases so that's why when you move to different markets and your nft and your identity or your um digital collectible you want to make sure that they're usable that's why and the croatian mt becomes useful so some of the key strategies and some ideas and we were considering to be able to enable by the question i have key so the builders like you guys may use those ideas and build the different interesting products and the application uh using the crosstalk empty um primitive so for example the derivative and the lending protocol so you can have a premium ft for example like the ape on insertion and then you characterize it and you can build the derivative on a compatible chair like like a harmony so that your original ftw steel on your server but you can have a generate a different derivative on different chain to provide the mass market adoption so and also for example like a premium fashion brand they can also build their premium nft on a different chain but using a question to be able to support uh other lending and the derivative on the chain as well so another utt use case could be the mp fractionalization so ifta functionalization better to enable cross-sourcing and market making on nft and of course don't forget about the game fi in the metaphors so and the game 5 apparently and the huge volume and the transaction and makes it not going to be a sustainable on any serving and by the harmony is definitely something um people would love to play with nft harmony and so that's why the d5 kingdom in the game five project uh national harmony gets a huge success and uh we also actually working with the uh divide kingdom team to bring other um ift from other chain to make it also useful uh in in the harmony ecosystem so um our goal in harmony to provide the infrastructure in the metaverse world for other creative and artists so that due to the uh lower uh transaction fee and the higher tps of harmony will be able to enable uh different use cases like uh streaming loyalties and negative access and how many also we intend to provide the tool and other middleware to enable the the use case in in the methods so how many also provide a 13 million an ft grant so to all the builder and the project to be able to launch a harmony the recently there are quite a lot of ifd projects and gamepl feel free to apply for this once in open format by clicking this link so this is a workshop so i'd like to give a little bit more detail on how to build on harmony so for the crosshair energy bridge we do have a api document yeah so this document provides the the backend api that enables people to build a front-end application but on the back-end is using the question and bridge and to finish of the crosschain function so the application builder you don't need to build your own icon for the question and the application and um this is an example that's a the api or be able to support the utility so here those are the the endpoint for the for the back end of the bridge so how many horizon quarter bridge actually built on top of the backend api as well some detailed description and example also provided in this document okay so um beyond the api we also provide the sdk let's take a look at our sdk ripple yeah this is a bridge sdk so you can integrate the sdk on your own application it's written in typescript okay so this is a sdk ripple so um for for the builder and hacker and there is a test net bridge that can be used to check um to test your application this is the test net okay so uh the test net works on the harmony test net and the carbon test bridge test nets and you can see on the testing it we already have the binance and the polygon support as well so i mean it's right now only have the for the nft won't have the a7 support on testnet the banners and the political support are already being added okay and so right now um in harmony there are uh two main marketplace for for nft one it's called the davinci and that is called the rft key so that's actually been launched on how harmony for over a year and the ftk is a new marketplace financial harmony so on davinci they also provide a sdk so that for the ift project him you can build your rfg using the davinci sdk yeah here okay so all the information is in the in the in the slide so this is a avengers decay the basic using that that this enables the artist you don't have to build your own marketplace or build your own contract and using the davinci debut building a smart contract under the towards support okay yeah so you have any question so feel free to reach to us and through uh we have a developer telecoin and also a developer just called channel the link provided okay so i think that's all um for the um presentation today so let me check uh the questions it looks like more uh more div has one more if you feel free to admit yourself if you want to ask that question live all right thanks um yeah i have a little question because on the discord uh actually i didn't ask but i was interested in the answer how to um transfer nft so from heath to harmony and in both ways and the answer we got was that it's not implemented yet but it's uh it's going to be in the near future but then after re-reading and after listening uh to the intro of this um talk i'm having a doubt maybe he was only talking about the sdk but the api the bridge api is functional i think i said yeah the bridge itself the functional well and the sdk will be ready um by uh by uh end of this week so right now we only have the api support the sdk and take a little bit time to to further implement so yeah that's probably a little bit confusing so actually you can see the bridge yeah in the bridge we also implemented a check of the openc api to see if the nft is verified on openc already it actually will show up mark here so okay here is a bridge yeah i can give a short demo here about how the bridge works so basically put the er system 21 second address here oh okay wrong network okay let me share a new okay here a new browser okay yeah so actually i put it here already so i put the an address of the ess 721 token here and the the bridge where actually fetched the metadata from the smart contract under them this week here and oh yeah right now the gas 3 is so high so basically estimate how much you're going to pay for this one so the first time um yeah this is actually 7 21 and token on i7 and you can confirm and then it can be bridged over so all those functions basically present in the front end will be supported by the icon and now and the sdk at the end of this week any other question yeah i have a question hi um currently uh you guys have a lot of solutions and a couple of interesting people in your ecosystem how um in in the in the spirit of not reinventing the wheel um if we use a already presented solution to to further our idea is that still considered building on on on harmony one like for example for example if you're building the dow you use aragon yeah so basically we encourage all the project launcher harmony one so it's not just uh you don't have to use a crosshair api right so basically it's nft uh hacksaw you can build any nft like a launch empty project and launch a generative art project and also even some game project would it be possible it'd be considered to build on top of nfp on harmony so i mean i just present the crochet nft bridge which is a new thing to harmony but they're not limited to the um to the crochet and empty here so let's think about um something that won't be possible on other chains but you can definitely do the harmony like we recently there's some partners talking with us they want to build like a billion rft which is not going to be scalable on other chain to also not going to be economy to to mentor those ft because they're building like a virtual land project right they want to be able to um have this uh like at least a billion nft so that's some of the projects can be in durable and usable and harmony but may not be on other places yeah we have some questions in the chat as well so and yagu peter um is the sdk also not yet available for the test app bridge oh okay so the sdk will be ready at the end of this week so we are getting there so right now the uh the the only the apis the backend api is ready so uh the sdk will be the end of this week yeah and then nester asked are there any sets of data on nft cross chain that harmony would like hackers to address during this hackathon um okay so as i mentioned right so actually i um present i talked about a few ideas that would definitely be useful and for example you can have a um nfte and staked on but in the meantime um since he's already sticked on seven and you can create the derivative on harmony and the derivative you can have a huge amount of derivative and which you may not be an economically visible uh usable on a server right so those some of the idea and also like a lending protocol or fractionalization all those uh protocol will be able to do it in a in a mass way which is only usable on harmony not on its own right so those are the idea so i don't have any specific um mega idea i want to address because then basically we provide the infrastructure that's the hacker like you guys can basically and be creative and also think about something that can be done also as your two artists also there's something interesting how many i actually didn't talk about here is that we do have a special extension of the evm we provide called the vrf it's a random ang chain it's a truly rundown random number on chain that's actually can be interesting to generate some of the generative arts or any uh nft like prediction market or anything that can be useful so i can actually provide those information later we do have a complete document about this uh uh primitive we provide extension to the to the evm where justice do you have a follow-up question uh yes uh still about the api uh the the bridge api is there a bridge between uh harmony test net to ethereum rinkby for example uh ryan i want to have a uh koban we don't have a recopy right now oh you have coven okay okay thank you also uh some of the um viewers were asking if you can post the dogs um either in the chat or maybe even on discord in the sponsor channel uh that would be great okay yeah so all those link maybe i can post on the uh i don't know on the youtube channel or anywhere i can actually send all the link to joanna and maybe you can post in the comment of the youtube uh sure i'll post them on discord i'll hack um all the viewers here will have it on discord yeah okay yeah so um i will actually post our vrf document i think that's something unique tommy that could be interesting to explore okay yeah i send the document for the where and how to use it within the smart contract this is something also unique to harmony and that could be interesting to explore more diff did you have another question no sorry i will stop raising my hand sorry no worries does anyone else have any questions all right if that's all the questions that we have for today's workshop uh we can end things here unless uh leo you have any other things that you want to show for the next two minutes um okay so as i mentioned uh we do have a uh i need to show the page so beyond the the hacksaw i think hacksaw will be a great way to assemble the idea and the team but we do have the 30 million dollar grant and the bounties on ft so definitely check out the page here so some of the ideas something we would like to see uh we can definitely say that will be supported by the team and would like to see on harmony but they're not limited to that right you can't extend that but those are the ideas we want to say so let me post the link here to the chat okay yeah i guess uh um that's all awesome thank you so much for taking the time to host this workshop leo uh that was super interesting and i'm sure everyone who is watching um learned a lot um so leo will also and the rest of the harmony team is available on the youth global discord in the harmony discord channel so if you have any questions please feel free to chat there or in the harmony discord server and thank you so much for attending this workshop and once again leo thank you for this i hope everyone has a great rest of your day thank you everyone thank you
