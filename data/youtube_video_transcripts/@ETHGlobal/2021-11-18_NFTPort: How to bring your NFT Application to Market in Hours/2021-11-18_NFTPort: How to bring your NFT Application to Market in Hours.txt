hi my name is johannes and i'm the co-founder of nfd port we hope that you're going to have an excellent hackathon and nfd port is destroyed for nfts a one-stop and simple nfd infrastructure and apis for developers so our goal is to help you bring your nft application to market in hours instead of months and we believe this is super helpful especially during hackathons who time is of necessity so during today's video i'm going to show you what's possible to be build with nfd port and get you up and running super quickly just for context some themes that are using us range from small startups all the way up to leading ethereum applications such as poep and nfd4 is pimp team affects nato moniz and nvidia and backed by the co-founders such as polygon wise and skype so why nfd paw is necessary or the reason why it exists is because developing nfd application used to be really really hard or slow basically because the whole blockchain stack is complex you know learning and crafting everything and especially all the technical answers is difficult then everything related to the infrastructure is by the nature is difficult so our sort of goal is to really abstract the way the complexity and enable developers and so that's that's our mission is to really empower developers so they can make the internet ownable by end users and citizens we have three sort of core products which help you in your development one is multi-chain data so basically that includes metadata files contracts etc so if you have to build any kind of nfd data into your application then you can do it super simply uh with simple rest apis which i'm going to demo to you as well then secondly easy minting so you can programmatically mint super easy using our apis and so and and the most simplest api is you just have to make one api goal uh and you can do basically anything internally and then we also have an enhanced apis apis which allow you to do uh very cool things uh such as basically doing reverse image searches um finding duplicate nfts etcetera etcetera and this if you get stuck anywhere or you have any questions thoughts ideas you want to share then we have an uh public nft developer community as well in in discard which you can join anytime so just a few examples so let's say you want to pull in all the nfds and you can do it super simply either from ethereum polygon so you can just basically get folded all the nfd's that are on ethereum's chain now let's say you want to do a little bit more something specific and you want to get let's see all punk's data so i'll make funks contract and um i'm going to get all of these for this contract so i just put in the address set to request and then basically i will start getting or the api returns all the nfds to their part of this contract and now as a next step let's say you want to drill even more down you want to get specific metadata about these of these then this is the bunk number one and you will have all the metadata about this one attributes image url where is it stored and a lot of nfds are hosted on ibfs so but the downside is it can be really slow at times and end users don't want to wait uh for ibfs to load they will also have a cached image url as well so you can basically use that url in case you are building fast end user applications and you want to display nfcs to your users as well uh we offer or you can actually get nfd zoned by account so any wallet account address you can see for a dollar all then if these this account owns so let's select one example account i have here and the api returns all of the entities that this wallet owns again super used useful in different applications and normally previously you had to do a lot of engineering to get this kind of functionality then the second part and as a few examples what have you built already with these multi-chain data endpoints so one is fringible so which is basically google for nfds so let's say you have a cool cool vitalik image and you want to find [Music] let's say maybe some much better image format and they want to find basically similar images just uh similar entities just like google reverse image would does work and basically that's that's what we get as you can see we have italic and other similar profile pictures as well and this again quite a large [Music] design space all the products that can be built um using these simple multi-chain data apis then uh the second big part is what we initially saw a pain that we ourselves had was the minting is super um hard uh like obviously for people who know how to write solidity um then it's you know it can be easy but it still takes a lot of time so that's why we abstracted away a lot of the complexity and one endpoint easy meeting is basically so simple that you can just run one command sorry one api call the mint and fd so [Music] let's uh this is that let's take um let's see if you can get that image here and let's say we wanted your that internationality then what we can do and we'll meet down currently on polygon but the theorem is also available so [Music] i'll put big paste the url here [Music] and now i'm into my address [Music] request and there we have it and we'll also show them let me check check it later and the polygon scan as well also obviously it opens it etc etc you can use any [Music] or sort of the most popular languages as well so let's say you want to do it in python then we show the exact code snippets to do it in all of the basically most popular programming languages now if you want to customize your minting meaning let's say you want to create your own collection and open c then what we can do is deploy an nfd contract first your own contract again let's do it in polygon because it's free so we provide up to 1000 nfd mints for free and polygon and if you needed more than that then just reach out to us and discord and we can happily increase those limits uh but we just set the limit so somebody actually doesn't ddos us at the moment so uh my contract [Music] all right something went haywire here anyhow i have to do some debugging but it usually works and when you have your contract deployed then as the next step what you can do is use storage you can upload a file to ipfs so let's say i copy paste it here i have this nft port logo here [Music] a little bit of png [Music] um super simple we cut back then i hyperfirst url now what we can do is upload metadata.ipfs and here i would be basically pasting the file url and so this is the logo that i just uploaded [Music] oops file yuri uh and here i will put 10 of the name description i can actually do that as well and i can set all right let's put the nifty [Music] description and if you want to set any attributes for the nft then you can do that here as well and we get back type fs uri and that we could as the final step we reduce that basically in the customizable meeting and in the customer mis minting the contract address would be the contract that we deployed but it unfortunately didn't work at the moment did the metadata uri would be the one that we just got back from the upload metadata ibfs and made to address address that you want to admit it and you would shoot it away you know some of the application applications that are built uh with those kind of easy minting apis um you know this all the way up to uh nfd camera app this is built for example only by one person during weekend so that's super super impressive considering considering the time frame and you can take any photo and turn it into one nft uh so using and it is built on ftp port there's a lot of other teams uh all the way from building basically spotify for nfts and doing ticket events for nfts turning books into nfts and turning k assets into nfts you name it uh basically uh i live with different teams building on top of nfd port uh using this kind of super simple capability meeting wise then i'm going to show you there's also some user endpoints where you can basically get all the contracts and nfd is that the you as a user have here deployed or minted then we have search basically meaning you can search across [Music] nfds by text and you get back they have results were either in the nfd title or description is this uh string so metallic then we have recommendations ai which is basically uh something that you just saw in google for nfts so this uses recommendations ai and we also have copy detection ar meaning we can use this endpoint to basically let's say if there is you know somebody takes punks crypto banks and tries to basically mimic them or sort of tries to fraud users then you could basically find duplicate nfds using this endpoint and it uses ai to do that kind of visual visual matching so here's the sort of the quick rundown of nfd port and as as i said previously as well if you have any questions thoughts um need any kind of support then we are more than happy to help during uh during the hackathon that's why we are here to give you wings so it's the best time to build nft based applications and to bring your ideas to life and with that we'd like to thank you and have a happy hackathon
