great and we are live so welcome to this session uh we have prashan here from spheron who's going to give you a workshop on ui decentralization prashant i'll let you take the lead thank you and thank you very much for giving us the chance to come and present here so i know a lot of uh first of all thank you everyone also for joining in here um i'll be taking a very interesting session today i know time is not uh too much for me but i'll try to get a little bit deeper into why you should do that and all those things and then i'll jump into the demo side of uh this pheromone like how you can achieve the same wire spheron and in the meanwhile if you have any questions you can just hop into our discord channel or even uh discord channel the hack money channel itself and we'll be more than happy to answer there as well so yeah uh getting started with that um so there are a couple of things i just want to take it forward so first of all uh what exactly is spheron is and uh why we are building um so spheron basically provides an automating uh workflow or you can say you can automate the entire deployment workflow for your decentralized infrastructure so that is what uh estron basically provides on the very high level um coming to myself who i am um i just wanted to share myself here also uh so we are i'm currently building in the web 3 for the past three years and prior to coming into web3 um i have worked in a lot of places like some corporate startups and all these places and and got a very good understanding on how to manage the team based code practices writing the codes building the infrastructures and and doing a lot of things so yeah i have a very good experience in in group 3 as well as in web 2 as well so i so if you if you see this round you will you will see the thing which we have built it has both the flavors in a in a very calculated way so that is where my experience and expertise leads the entire team and we build that user experience onboarding for the viktor intra this is about myself now coming to the topic like uh ui decentralization and and before i even jump into the ui decentralization part the most important part of is like why why why do we why do we even need ui decentralization um and there are a lot of factors basically uh 2.5 years back i still remember the date when uh we started building into this space nobody was talking about it and then suddenly uh there were some questions been raised by some of the community members team members even we were also the same people who were raising these questions and the question was something related to this um so we are building dow we are building d5 we are building nfts we are building lot of things and even though the dao exit or the founders exit via dao or or anything happens on the nft side whatever whatever happens it happens on the user interface side uh most of these user interface today are being controlled mostly by uh the founders even though uh they exit via dao uh if they don't then they have this uh the repository which even has a private they have access to change it a lot of things which they can actually do uh not only that like it becomes very impossible difficult for the communities to uh get hold on a user interface which is attached to a centralized domain just imagine a scenario where your let's say one day one fine day uh somebody from uni uni or somebody from any of the d5 protocol which i'm building and say we are not anymore going to support our domain uh in that case how exactly the community is going to react uh are you really comfortable in going and swapping your token via ether scan or even even ethers can also has a centralized domain so you so it's it become very difficult for the community once that hits up but in order to make sure like we protect ourselves from all of these things that is where your ui decentralization becomes and plays a very uh very vital role and what exactly those vital roles are so the first role is which basically plays a very important role is like giving control back to your community itself uh what does that mean is because is let's say if i'm deploying 10 versions of a web application which has been evolved over the time i as a community member should have access to the uh let's say i love the fifth version of it i should be have an excess of it like so it should not be like my domain is controlling the things um and if you see the decent infrastructure we are trying to remove the control right so we don't want to give the control to one centralized person or entities to control most of things but indirectly that is happening but the moment you go on a decent license part it just gives you the control back uh once you get an improvement can be placed uh what does that mean um there are a lot of uh thing which happens in the decentralized ecosystem not only defy uh on nfts as well on wherever it is so i as a user have have a possibility to go and access the specific questions coming to the improvement again so let's say there was some improvement which has been taken care there was there was there were some uh changes which has been made into the older version and anything like that right so all those things can easily be traced uh via this uh this entire ui decentralized mechanism which we have built um coming to the most important part since most of us are building into this space and we most and mostly we all are going to be uh startups are trying to get into the space um i have a very good experience in web 2 i know uh how web 2 developers think because web 2 developers don't have like lot of money where they can just start spending on hosting their servers on aws and on these spaces and uh even their credit also works only when if you have a uh good uh funding coming from a very good good investment uh people so that is another different different question for them so uh when it comes to the centralized version it becomes more expensive for the startups and people who are building into the space but the same the moment you go into decentralized space uh the things become much cheaper either it is either you you take a file point as example either you take a skynet for example even either you take rv in terms of the one-time payment phase these things are way cheaper than what you can get in uh in any any other centralized uh version so that is one of the ideal advantage and it also reduces your cash burn as well the fourth and the most important part of this ui decentralization uh is basically it allows entire video to grow and when i say that it has a more deeper uh question and more deeper analogy into it uh the first is when use when you when you start using this web 3 infrastructure products like uh even any of the infrastructure projects like our viva file coin any of these we are directly supporting the vip3 infra and we personally believe all these things has to go up in order to make them uh go up in order to make them a web 3 native and everything and bring more adoption on top of it your participation is really necessary in order to make that go uh into the market and even today i was reading one of the articles like a lot of notes a lot of storage protocols nfts marketplace and all those things people are using sometimes domains even in even a centralized server as well in that case so um these things becomes very very very important when it comes to ui part as well so uh we at esperan wanted to tap on the ui section first in order to solve that issue so that all the people are building into this space and the founders and the developers or the upcoming people they should be aware of about ui decentralization aspects at least uh once they are designing their d5 based application or something or even daos or even nfds or anything so that is where it becomes very important for the team to participate in the growth of the vipre infra so coming to why exactly uh spheron and uh what exactly spheron does uh there are a lot of things which we do um if you guys have ever used netlifeversal uh we provide the same kind of feature uh around the web3 but it just talks to the web3 infrastructure protocols instead of the centralized one so if you go to let's say on versacell they use aws for hosting your applications and edge caching and all those things uh but you come to spheron you will be using filecoin rv or we are also working on to integrate compute as well so you'll be getting a computer in a decentralized fashion not in a syntax fashion so all of these things that layer under beneath this phenom is the decentralized layer the layer beneath the versailles identifies the centralized one so that is what basically the biggest uh differences in terms of like why is ferron and and why we should go ahead and start hosting wirespiron uh coming to the some of the uh pain point which we are trying to solve by esperon is um it basically allows you to forget about learning process of the decentralized infrastructure and when i say that it is basically means i'm i'm also a developer i'm an architect um if my team comes to me and says hey you know what i have to query multiple different wallets i have to carry uh multiple different tokens buy those tokens from the binance transfer to the different wallets and or either use any bridge to bridge the assets and all those things most likely my answer to my div is going to be no not do not to use not to use these things because it just over complicates the thing as we proceed and as our team grows uh in that perspective uh spheron basically plays a very vital role it just removes uh all these complex processes of token migration managing and all those things apart from that it improves the productivity of the developers who are building and trying to get into the recent infrastructure and how does that happens the tools and the uh the suit of product which has been built around it so we what basically we do we reduce the learning process and improve the productivity graph so that is what uh on the very high level we do at this firm apart from that there are a lot of things into this phenom itself which basically helps you to automate the entire process of your uploading of your data not even so currently we are working on providing the data part so our ui part is live so it just automates your entire ui decentralization process and how does that happen i'll also demo you the same but in the second half of the entire call but just to give you the context here uh the entire automation process helps you to push your entire code by a github git bucket bitbucket or gitlab we are in a process of integrating some of the decentralized repositories as well we are currently working on radical let's see how that goes in um and if you know any more decentralized depositories which are getting better feel free to just drop us a message and i'll be more than happy to talk to them as well uh apart from that you get all those things what you get on a centralized based uh like a tooling which are network universal like you have uh your domain where you can manage your centralized domain but we also have a decentralized domain management feature where you can just go and manage your decentralized domain as well uh create multiple environment for your development and recovery product for a broad environment in github itself or even bitbucket or even gitlab wherever it is supported and there are a lot more thing which is for unprovides and i'll walk you through all of those step by step into the uh the moment i start showing you the echo version of the spiron so yeah i will not take much more time more than this talking about esperanto but uh if you have any more questions you can always reach out to these of the links i'll i'll drop this ppt also into our discord server in all those places you can always go through it so what i'm going to do next is i'm going to walk you through sphero in action and one more important note here before i end up if you are willing to use this spheron version which we have uh basically built only for the people who have the xs or who holds the nfp of this phenomenon hq in a test net version they only will be able to access this version which i'm going to demonstrate now if you want to if you don't want nfps you don't want to access that those features there is one more version of the app which you can always go and use it is it is very easy you can just log in to use but i highly recommend to get into the aqua version because it is very stable much faster much smoother and more uh robust uh tooling and functionalities into it so let me just quickly open spheron.network and walk you through guys what we have built so far and where exactly we are just let me know somebody okay yeah got it so here is our equation so yeah uh once you so basically this is uh where our site is uh once you get on site so the moment you click on the deploy here it will it will take you to the app dot which is very older version of uh this firon uh but if you go to the acquire.sphero.network i'll try to uh basically put this here so that you can have access of it um so if you go on to this you will have the newer version of this rounder network and which is much is much better looking and and has a better ux and feels and everything so uh coming to this acquire spare android network it's nft gated access so i will be able to log in very seamlessly but if you try to log in you won't be able to do that because it is it is it is blocked uh and the people who only holds the nft will be able to access this uh coming to how exactly this entire functionality of this round works we have given the three uh repositories access so far into this field the first is the github by default which most of us basically use continue uh like you have a gitlab and bitbucket as well and we are eagerly waiting to integrate few more let's see how that goes but this is what we have today uh the first thing you as a developer has to do here is to just go and log in via github um and if you haven't signed up make sure you you sign up as well uh but if you are coming on aqua you just don't need sign up as well you just need nft that's it and and that will be enough uh now coming to just to give you the answer here how can we get an nft access to dequa just click on contact here you will be able to get to the discord channel and and just ask for your access and tag like you are coming from hackmoney and will give you the access um so coming to this one just click on continue with github the moment you do so uh it is it just checks your nfp you have an ft in the wallet or not and everything and just it just opens the user interface for you uh the moment it gets open it's a very simple and nice looking ui which basically explains it it explains everything on its own but even though if you are if you are confused uh to use some of the part of it you can always go to the docs.sprout.network which is here you can always get into this and and and check out whatever you want to check out now coming to this interface on the equal side there are a couple of things which i'll basically walk you through what i'm going to do is before walking you through the features of it i'll walk you through a simple deployment process into it so the deployment process basically looks very similar and neat so you just have to click on new project connect your repositories whichever you want to connect and if you haven't installed your app you have to install the app first so in order to install the app you have to just go to configure and just install the app here uh once you are done with that you will be given this particular uh the entire access you will get the deposit is coming here and then the next step you have to do is just click that particular repository uh which you want to access and once you are done with that it just asks you where exactly you want to host your application do you want to host it on file point pinata scan it or rb we are coming up with few more which you will be able to select that as well uh let's say if i want to use and you if i want to go and use a file coin for my for my uh use case so i'll just click on file coin and the moment you do that it just auto detects your entire repository so this is a view app it just detects detect it like that and if you have some root directory uh some monolith or something you can always go and and put those root directories as well we have a new if you have some runtime variables which you want to pass you can do that as well and then it has your published directory yarn package manager and everything so just go and click on deploy and the moment you hit the deploy it just starts the deployment process and deployment process is a it's a very straightforward streamline deployment process it just goes through it and you start to find it so i have uh received one more question a friend you have asked like yes it is it's work like reversal what framework are supported so currently we are supporting react view angular node angular and few more which you can always go and select into the dropdown of the version so around six to seven uh frameworks which you are currently supporting and you are you can basically use that um so yeah once the deployments starts uh you just have to forget about it it just happens everything i'll now walk you through a few more uh things around it um so before we let's say i am a developer i just don't want to come here again i don't want to even see my easter on ui again so what you can do is you can just go and once your deployment is done here you don't even have to worry anymore so you can just go and see uh what exactly is happening on your on your deployment now so if you see this deployment is literally it has been late has been triggered right so you can always track those deployments directly via your github branch or or wherever it is so it is currently in the process if you click on this you will see like this the department is currently in the progress apart from that you also get these links where you can always it's a it's a very readable link where it basically serves your decentralized version of the app on top of the domain directly so that is one added advantage on top of it apart from it we also have these environments where you as a developer can go and create different environments i'll walk you through how to how to do that so for example if you want to create your development environment or production environment you can come here go to the settings go to deployment environments and then you have all these environments just created now in this environment itself you can just go and attach a different branch which you want to reply on different environments and it just works like a breeze so you don't even have to worry about it so that is how easy it is to set up your deployment environment as well and in order to see your deployment as well like what exactly happened in my last department you can just click on it see on view deploy deployment and it just serves on the internet gateway directly so if whatever gateway you want to use you can use that as well uh so this is how easy it is to track your entire deployment apart from it when i was saying you don't even have to come to the sphere on ui i mean that so we have a per commit per commit based depend model so which means let's say if i want to edit my readme.md i just have to go and let's say my developer just said hey you know what i'm just willing to put hyphen here instead of dot and uh and just go and commit this change and once you do the change the change has already been done on the main branch and now if you come and go to the deployments and just refresh the screen and you will find like there is one more uh deployment just got triggered now and which is now started building now so this is it is like is rigged just now it has been triggered let's say if i want one more commit which i want to get into just go here again add one more have a hyphen which i just forgot again and just add a commit again and the moment you do that uh and come back and just refresh the entire screen because we are working to provide the screen here itself now if you see there's a there's a diploma which cause which got queued as well uh which means like you have a very streamlined automated fashion of deployment not only that once that happens you also have a flexibility to raise a full request and the moment you raise any of the pull request you also get a preview of that pull request what happened with that deployment so these are the previews which you can go and always check here itself without even going to the sphero at all so we have added everything whatever you need in order to make your application go into decentralized environment and give it access to your user community and people around now coming to the major factor major part of it like how exactly the things are working how so do we have to pay any money do we have to do something so in order to give you the context we have a billing section where you will go if you are coming via hack money now if you are claiming energy now you have a pro member access membership uh by default so you can just uh login into your system you will have a proper membership your your starter membership will be there which you can start deploying from the day one and you don't even have to carry any tokens there so no tokens required in order to even do the deployment on this front so that is how easy it is so you don't even have to worry about file tokens you don't have to worry about audio tokens you don't have to worry about any of the token which we have uh the integration which will be supporting in the future as well so that is the best part of this round where we don't even require anything so and for example if you need any more bonus you can go and add that so today it is free of cost so for example uh if you need any tokens so we have this faucet.distributed network which i'm going to put here as well again on the chat it gives you the free usdt and usdc or whatever you need um to basically pay here as well so uh make sure you go and claim your tokens from positive.json network and then come to the espheron and claim your nft and get in the into the system and just play around with the features and everything you have enough money to play around with that um now coming to this plan users here you can just go and see like what you have used so far what are things are into the progress how much build execution time which we have used for and lot more things invoice is the part which we have already built in you don't have to worry about it's in this net so you just you can keep on using your faucet uh token which you have now go to the members so this is one of the main point in the web3 ecosystem where if i am an admin admin offer let's say i'm the founder i have 10 team members or five team members who are working on a department of the user interface or they are working on something and i need them to use my wallet instead of somebody else's wallet right uh because the moment they deploy via their own wallet that data ownership belongs to them not to you as a founder as as someone who is building this entire entity or company or whatever you are building so in order to make sure like the ownership retains at one hand this is where you can go and invite your team members just go and let's say i want to invite him send the invitation the moment the invitation will be sent it just goes on a pending once you approve the invitation you will be able to part of this uh organization and what does that mean you as an admin can give them an alliance how much they can how much they are going to be using for this organization so for example if you are adding this in the bill uh you are adding let's say 18 per month or something your organization your teammates can only access eighteen dollars only not more than that um and all those features around it and all the deployment what they will be doing it will be attached to the main wallet not the user's wallet or the developer quality whom you have onboarded so it basically uh just eliminates the process of the all the complex process here so let me just quickly also share one of the discord link where you can always go and join us here's the discord link so yeah coming back to the team member site so this is what we have uh now apart from that there is one more thing which is built in and which is one of the interesting part of this field is we take care of the development very seriously and we make sure like each and everything whichever we're doing our users are getting a proper invitation and everything so if you see the invitation has been sent the build has been triggered and all those all those things has a proper streamlined process of notifications which you will be able to receive here directly apart from that since we are into the devnet yes still and we are we are testing a lot of things uh you can always click on this three dots uh go through documentation you can the moment you click on docs uh it basically gives you the change logs not the docs dot is surrounded network and the reason we have put the change lock in serial dot instead of dog because most of the users don't understand like what are the features so this basically gives you the high level features of this firon on every release whichever we do so uh you can just scroll down and you can see like what those features are and how they basically work how they look like and everything so you can just go and see all those aqua release versions version 3.0.0 and and you'll be able to see those changes there um so yeah so that is and and one more interesting thing you can always go and your settings you can change change a lot of things so once you go on nft side uh this is where you'll be able to mint more energies for your team members and teammates and everyone and and that is how easy it is and apart from that if you want to create multiple organization you can just go and create different organization you can invite different teammates different team member different building different everything from the starting so let's see if i'm into decent organization this particular starter pack is like i so it is starter pack i haven't connected my wallet also so uh and you don't even have invoice or anything right uh so you can always go and use this starter pack and and start deploying from any of the other organization as well so yeah this is how easy it is to use the spheron and and make sure you guys uh do the uid simulation from the day one uh and and and leave your uh and and help with you to grow uh help us to grow help us to spread the word and knowledge around the ui decentralization um and if you haven't uh yet reached out to our servers feel free to basically come on these places follow us on spheron hq uh this is our discord invite which you can always go uh we have https colon slash slides round.network click on that click on contacts and you will be redirected to the discord channel if you have any personal questions anything which you want to ask from me directly feel free to drop me a mail or at esperanto spirono.network and uh that will be like uh that will be really cool to see how uh you guys are building the defy and ft and house so thank you so much guys uh i believe i have taken the time correctly uh it's 11 28 now so there is a just curious where is this run website is hosted so currently the spiron website is built on the next app uh which we are not supporting the dynamic one and since we had to sub we have to host it on uh one of the servers but we are planning to move it completely once our compute integration comes in but if you have a static web app which you have which you might have then feel free to use us because we support only static as of now thank you i believe i have covered most of things i'll drop all those links on our channel that's perfect yeah just some time thanks a lot for the presentation and we can follow up over discord awesome thank you thank you so much
