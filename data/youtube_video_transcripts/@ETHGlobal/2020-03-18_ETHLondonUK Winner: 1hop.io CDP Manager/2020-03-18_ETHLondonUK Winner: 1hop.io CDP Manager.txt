all right hi everyone it's a pleasure to stay on the main stage thank you very much with your information theorem global so what I built on this weekend this is CDP manager city manager can be used to migrate CDP position collateral tap position of the user and can improve the usability in defy so I and you can see in the screen there one hub dot IO it's actually deployed also in the minutes here I have a compound position I learned 195 thigh and I borrowed a little bit BB TC and I would like to to move this position to our because it's more profitable for me to to land and borrow there because creates interest rate on RM so and you can do it just with a few clicks which I will not execute the transaction because it's no Manhattan you can take little time so and after the migration to an NFC token [Music] you can actually easily migrate between different provider like compound like maker down like hour as well so I will show you a small architecture diagram how it works and why I need here and an NF gtalk nurse's 121 so it's also a big problem like if you have onion wallets you are really limited on compound you can have only a few positions there and if an ER c 721 and if G talking you can have as many position you want yeah I try to build small like mini or micro service because I love also my team from one inch loves the compressibility of defy just black every available service in into your own service and expose clear usable api's to everyone so that everyone can profit get profits from from you service and you get profits also from from other service so in this and this diagram you can see as a user with normal if you don't wallet you can create an empty token which would hold the position in a smart contract under the hood and I like flash lots so and yes maybe you hurt me we hacked fulcrum with flatulence white hacked in January before it's started to be popular but this isn't a straight I likely used to flash lands from our of course this little fee but they do a great job of that it's really usable so what I did I migrated the position from the wallet into the NFT token proxy so smart contract by asking for a flash LAN on our way I repaid the user lab to be able to migrate the position and I grabbed the user collateral totals from the user and I created a new borrowing position on compound and repaid back the flash 1/2 hour so first of all in the migration part and to create to just migrate to you position from your wallet to be flexible to emigrate to other services from from an NFC tag and the emigration works similar to the import logic it's the same you have already deposition in you nfg talking and again flash lawns and actually the same I can show you how such flash lon looks like this is it's a tool from my colleague Anton bukhov you can see the whole stack trace from Paraty a trace more in little and usable also to the back and you can see it looks like if some I had here more than 137 hops in in different smart contracts sure to just import a position so I also used here at Taurus yeah also great solution to login with it with Google Sam's Amara off provider and what I heard they plan also to release solution for free guest transactions like that we are going to integrate them I guess so like some cool things yeah thank you very much that's all [Applause]
