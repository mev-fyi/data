foreign [Applause] [Music] welcome everybody who is excited there we go I'm kartik with me I have Juan Bennett from protocol labs and we are going to be your moderators for the next hour we're going to talk about a handful of things we sourced a lot of questions from uh from the audience here we have a lot of tweets that we're gonna have him justify and uh overall I want to just learn about what he's thinking about and ask some of the questions that you submitted so please join me in welcoming Metallica from the ethereum foundation whoa [Music] all right we're gonna do a quick uh Mike test metallic how's it going huh I think I think I'm good I don't know are you are you hearing me well well we can hear you we just can't understand what you said try it one more time okay hold on um one two three four there we go we have now successfully calibrated well thank you for joining us there's a few thousand people in front of you we'll kind of switch between uh the audience here and uh well we're gonna make the best use of the next 45 minutes and I'm gonna start with a few questions that we got a lot of them are definitions that people are kind of excited to understand a bit deeper about uh so my first kind of question is a couple months ago in your taka and Eve Mexico you talked about how the next step is to reduce the transaction costs and fees to uh by 100x and a lot of that is just improvements to scalability and how we kind of add ways to compress and and kind of roll up information but the question that we kind of got from that was could you tell us what gas is as a concept and why is there a gas limit and why is there a fee market and overall how does that change over time as we go to super low transaction costs um sure so because it in a job watching uh every uh full node in the network needs to process every transaction that it gets included there has to be some limit to the number of transactions that get included into the chain right because if everyone was able to include transactions Without Limits then people would like run basically their web server servers on top of it like I would put an encrypted backup of all my music and my pictures onto it and there's just like all kinds of extremely low value uses that if they were actually allowed on chain they would add up to like such a huge amount of space that there would possibly only be like four or five computers in the world that would actually people like to run a node and the whole channel would just be super centralized and not very secure right so to prevent that kind of situation and to strike a balance between um making it reasonably viable for people to write to the chin and making it reasonably viable for people to read the chin there's this notion of a transaction fee market right where the two sides of the coin of that are transaction fees and a block size limit right and they're related because uh you know the of a supply and demand right so the you hire the block size limit which is the parameter that's actually set in the protocol the lower the fees end up being and then if you shrink the limit then at least in the short term the fee has become higher because there's just more people clamoring for and competing for a much more limited amount of space right so every transaction has to specify a fee it is uh now originally it's it was a fairly simple mechanism the transactions specify a fee and that's just like an amount of if and if it gets included in the chain then it pays that amount if it doesn't get included then it does not pay that amount right so gas is a mechanism that is used to measure the amount of resources that is being consumed uh to buy a transaction right so not all transactions have the same size and you don't want to treat big transactions the same as small transactions because those big transactions actually have a much higher load on the network that they're imposing and a network that can handle you know 1400 small transactions in a block that's like actually roughly the maximum amount of transactions they could get into a block right now it can't necessarily handle you know 1400 big monster transactions that are trying to you know prove some complicated ZK scenario or create a new contract to get it included on chain or like stick 100 kilobytes of data on chain or something like that right and so gas is an attempt to measure the resources that are being considered by a transaction um so there for example the base cost of a transaction is 21 000 yes uh in a an up code so one uh computational step in the ethereum virtual machine is uh somewhere between two to ten guests for most operations uh so things like just pushing and popping numbers onto the stack uh very simple stuff that's to be built for weak as but then some module or math operation that's a little bit more involved it goes up to 10 gas and then there are a few things that take even more gas right um bytes in a transaction so every byte in a transaction in the transactions data is 16 yes if it's not a zero and for gas if it is a zero um editing the storage so editing the blockchain state is uh it depends on circumstance but like roughly speaking it's about 5 000 gas if you're just changing us uh the value of a storage slot it's about 2100 guests if you're just reading and it's a 20 000 gas if you're filling a new storage soil right so there's like a lot of these numbers in the protocol but they're all intended to measure like basically how much of a load is your transaction imposing on the ethereum network and then the fee that you have to pay is proportional to that right so the Olympic in the the in the uh chain is is the guess what so there's a little bit of 30 million gas that can be spent in a single block right so that's where the 1400 number comes from 30 million divided by the Yeah 21 000 base cost right is uh not going to be a one about a thousand four hundred and twenty eight um but uh and so that's like you know basically the basically the fee market right now recently there has been this change made called EIP 1559 which kind of changes the mechanics a bit right where there's this uh concept of a base fee and a priority fee and that's just uh I mean not important to talk about that in too much detail yet but basically that's just I changed the tries to make it more the the fee Market more efficient uh so before one of the ETF was that of these stuff was like you would send a transaction you would choose a fee and then when you choose a fee you would make this complicated balance between setting a fee higher to make sure that you get in really quickly versus setting a fee lower to save money and but potentially we have to just like wait an extra five or five minutes but like sometimes it's one minute sometimes it's five minutes sometimes it's an hour and it was just very unpredictable and eip1559 basically kind of flips it around and said instead of the user setting a fee the protocol says to fee and then the user just has to pay the fee they have to set the maximum of the Rolex to pay and they have to send like a little bit extra to as an incentive for the transaction to get a good in a block but now you know as a result of that like basically the mechanism is like you said roughly you know you set the max that you're willing to pay your transaction gets included you you pay whatever the fee is uh that's uh determined by the protocol and that goes up and down over over time but you know at the end of the day it's basically just a mechanism that makes sure that uh you know these very low value use cases that I cannot like really are not worth it to get included in a chain right so like if for example I tried to send millions of transactions to uploaded encrypted uh copy of my music or my photo set to the blockchain then that would like cost me incredibly huge amounts of money and it would not be worth it for me but if I just want to send transactions to do normal stuff and it's like you know a couple hundred bytes to verify a couple of signatures then we'll be able to do that right so that's uh what the transaction fee system does and the gases is like the unit of computation that was incredibly comprehensive and informative this is this is awesome um I'll I there's already kind of transitions into another question that came in uh and this was from uh one of the tweets that we saw from an AMA you did a while ago um could you give us an update on what's happening with State rent and uh just well what that problem is and what the potential solution is and where is that solution in the implementation okay yes uh very important question uh so there's a few different kinds of resource one chain consume right so we talked about computation if you're a transaction that can consumes computational resources then once that transaction gives a good and a block and every node that has to download and verify that block has to run that computation and that's a one-time cost for that node right there's data costs which are the same except instead of computational cost it's data bandwidth and then there are storage costs there's two kinds of storage costs there's the cost of reading and editing storage right so I mentioned 21 000 2100 gals to read a story slot and 5 000 gas to edit a storage slot and these are really just a different kind of computation right there's just like a one-time thing where instead of like your computer having to do math your computer has to read or write from the disk right now there is another kind of storage cost which is the cost of filling new storage slots so creating a new account that did not exist before filling a new storage slot that before was Zero because every storage slot is zero by default and now it becomes non-zero and at creating a new contract that has a big piece of code right so anything that increases the total size of stuff that goes into What's called the ethereum state and that nodes currently have to store forever right and the problem with the state is that it is not a one-time cost it's a permanent cost right and it permanently increases the amount of work that you don't have to do so right now I think the state is like somewhere between like 40 and 150 gigabytes depending on what parts you count how hard you try to compress it whether or not you include the Merkle tree but that's the number that's increasing over time and that's the cost that we're stuck with right so like even if everyone stops using ethereum tomorrow any new node joining the network would still have to download those many gigabytes pretty much until the end of time right and so this is kind of unfair right because it basically means that you can pay once in order to Force the ethereum.org to suffer these costs forever so there's two two approaches uh to trying to deal with this problem one of those approaches is to just say well okay we're just going to set the gas cost for filling new storage really high right and that can be done and to some extent we kind of do it already right so like as I mentioned there's a cost of five thousand to edit a salon and twenty thousand to create a use one but at the same time there's like a lot of economic problems that appear if you lean on that too hard right so like one of those problems is that well there's some applications that really need storage for only a few months and there's some applications that need storage for 30 years and you want to charge more for the second than the first um another uh challenge as well gas prices go up and down a lot right like sometimes the gas prices five Quay ugly is a millionth of an eighth and when we say five ways or a billion radius and when we say five way that means five billionths of any eth uh per gas right so like for a simple transaction that would be five times twenty one thousand gray which is a hundred and five thousand way which is a zero point said zero zero zero one zero five uh if so it's uh around like 48 cents uh to pay for a transaction for a basic transaction right um so that sometimes when so when the gas price is five way right you know again multiply that by twenty two thousand so it's filling a new storage slot that's uh point zero zero zero one on Ethan it will take you about to 13 cents to fill a storage slot but then when let's say yeah If instead of filling the storage on a Sunday you want to fill the storage on a Wednesday well maybe the gas price will go up to like 50 way and then instead of paying 13 slots you have to fill a pay a dollar Thirty to fill a storage slot right and this is uh this does not make much economic sense because like really the difference in terms of the cost you're imposing on the network between filling the storage slot on a Wednesday and filling a storage salon on a Sunday is very tiny right the difference is just four days and then otherwise the many many years after that it's basically the same right so it makes no sense that you have to pay ten thousand more to fill out on a Wednesday than to fill it on a Sunday right so that's another problem um and then there's the third problem which is that like it's philosophically ugly because it still means that storage keeps on increasing forever and if we're only nice if we could have a balance right that says well the maximum storage there is a maximum to the storage that a client a client needs to have and that's going to be proportional to the guest limit so there's all these reasons why just uh charging higher doesn't really work well and so the big category of alternative solutions that we've thought about for a long time is well what if we take away this idea that you can fill a storage slot once and have that be part of the state that everyone needs to have that's accessible forever right so instead if you fill a storage slot let's say by default you get it for six months and then if you want to have it longer well you'll have to pay for it again and again right so this is a very economically clean and it solves a lot of the problems if you want to fix this issue of like well make why should it be 10 times more expensive on what to fill on a Wednesday then on a Sunday then you know you could even have a separate uh a kind of different gas counter that has separate IV adjustment mechanism that doesn't have a gas limit that accounts for that and so the price for that can be much more stable than the price for or like just computation and bandwidth um so that's like a very economically nice but it has this really important problem which is that uh well basically it's like ux nightmare right um like if you have erc20 tokens does that mean that your erc20 tokens uh disappear every six months unless you actually maintain them what about storage spots or applications that do not correspond to a particular user right so like let's see if it's taking drc20 as an example in an erc20 the storage Salat that corresponds to your balance doesn't go into your account it goes into the contract that is the erc20 token and so the erc20 token then needs to have this extra complicated logic to kind of pass off the cost of maintaining that storage slot to the user right or another one like what if you someone sends you 100 coins and then you wait for six months and then let's say the contract tries to include some mechanism to let you recover those coins like you proved that you had them at some point in history and then you recover them well what if before that someone else sent you 50 coins and now the 150 has to be added together right so there's just all of these really complicated developer experience consequences and about like one and a half years ago I made this proposal it's the state expiry EIP let's see if I can uh find that it's uh um if you're going to uh notes.etherium.org State underscore expiry of underscore eipl just like send that link over to cardik that's uh like I get I have this concrete proposal for how to do uh State expiry um and it's kind of complicated it's uh if you can see some of the some of the diagrams near the bottom it's uh you know basically instead of having one state you have multiple States and you create a new tree every year and there's a mechanism for uh kind of keeping uh your state updated there's a mechanism where well if your state becomes old then it can't be accessed by the EDM directly but if you provide a proof that that state existed that you can revive it so there's like a mechanism that's less bad than anything else I've seen anyone come up with but like you know it's still kind of annoying right and so the question is well are we going to be forced to do that or are we just going to kind of accept the cost of a permanent ever growing State and not deal with that now there I here we do need to get a bit into the proposal Builder separation uh discussion right uh because PBS actually massively decreases the costs of uh just not caring about the problem and letting the state grow to a terabyte right and so basically what happened with PBS is that there's this uh idea of separating the role of creating a block from the role of proposing so with proposing but proposing to what I mean is like being a validator right so if you send 32 Ethan to the deposit contract you can be a validator and roughly once every two months you get assigned the ability to create a block and when you create a block you choose the contents of the block right what we have discovered over the last couple of years is this concept of Mev right and roughly what this means is that there is this extra Revenue that you can get on top of collecting transaction priority fees um that where you collect that Revenue like be you can only collect that Revenue if you are the creator of that block and so you get the ability to choose what are the first transactions that go into the block right so one simple example of this is uh just crypto Market Arbitrage right so the price of eth is uh 12.72 right now but let's say yeah in the next 12 seconds some event minor events happens could be random Market movements could be um you know some random views about regulation it could be some centralized exchange going bankrupt could be lots of things and let's say on binance over the next 12 seconds the youth price drops from 1272 to 1262. now on the blockchain there's still a bunch of decentralized exchanges other platforms whose last memory is that the ethereum price is 12.72 right so if he takes you in a swap for example well what could you do then what you could do is you could sell some if on a unit swap in the first transaction of the next block and you can keep selling until the price drops from 1272 to 1262 right and then you would collect some some revenue from that and then at the same time you would buy the ethon binance at 1262 right so you're basically arbitraging the two and on average you're making that difference of five dollars as profit right so that is revenue that you can get by being the first person to Korea or as a person to choose the first transaction in a block and that's that kind of Revenue and contain earn that kind of Revenue especially as the ecosystem continues to evolve there's more exchanges there's more D5 there's more fancy stuff happening on chin that's uh that requires sophisticated algorithms right and that's not accessible to everyone that involves proprietary algorithms it requires having a lot of skill and so the concern was that well you know are there going to be substakers that are much better at this and other stakers and are those stakers going to create pools that everyone joins that just uh end up dominating right and we have numbers and the revenue that like Mev or stickers that use like amazing nav algorithms get right now is from producing blogs Isabel double the revenue that regular sakers get right so that's not including at the stations or any other benefit that's just like is just taking into account uh proposals um but uh the like this creates centralization pressure right and what we wanted to do to fix that centralization pressure is uh basically create these open markets where individual stickers can say well I'm going to Outsource the right to create a block to someone else and it's going to be an open market so people who have these sophisticated algorithms can go and uh create the block and I'm just going to accept whoever offers me the highest bid right and then I as an individual Staker would be able to get the benefit of earning I think it's like on average about 0.16 each instead of 0.08 East per block but and then but I personally would not have to like incur the burden of being having all this specialized software it's specialized Hardware specialized equipments to try to like try really hard to collect this extra Revenue right so that is so one of the interesting side effects of that mechanism is that if all I'm doing is accepting bids then I as a state Baker eventually am not going out actually have to even store the ethereum state on my node right so this requires another upgrade which is called State those clients out of stateless clients it's basically like it's this upgrade that where nodes can verify ethereum blocks without having the state themselves and the way that this works is basically that whoever creates the block um has that block it contains and transactions it contains a the Merkel or the root hash of the new state and then it also has a list of keys and values that basically say this block touched the code of account number one two three four five and here is the code this block touched storage slot number 678 of account number 912 and here is the and here it was the previous value this block touch to the balance of account number three four five six and it's balanced before this was five thousand so it just declares what all the states are that it that it read and wrote to and it also includes a proof that those states are actually correct right and uh if you want to learn how this works you can there's a yeah blog post that I have on Virtual trees um so you know go to uh I think if it's outlook.ca and just control that for Oracle that's like a v-e-r-k-l-e um that's I'll just uh lick that to garlic too but that's uh how it works right but these yeah the property that that does is that it basically again means that uh um you know if you uh as a person writing a node I would not have to have any of the state myself and other people can go have this uh other the people who create the blocks or the builders be the ones that have to have the state and they're already more specialized actors so they're okay having many terabytes of data and I as I use it as a built proposal it can just be very lightweight even if the state is extremely big and so that just reduces the cost of the state being big right so to Circle back the debate is basically you know given this kind of proportion Builder separation reality do we even need to do state expiry or can we just kind of like let the state get big and accept the fact that there is a smaller number of specialized nodes that are dealing with it and that's like an ongoing discussion and state expiring is something that can be added after 5 or 10 or 20 years if we need to so it's uh especially given PBS I think it's uh I feel it's generally I read my core developers to be a low priority thing right but that's like roughly what they do greatest okay fine Carter cut I see you yelled at me so I'll try to be faster at the other questions the goal um no that's awesome and super comprehensive and super useful I think a lot of people learn a lot through that um we have a bunch of questions so maybe for uh the upcoming ones uh let's aim for like two two to three minutes for many but uh that was awesome uh and I think a lot of people will share the links on the live stream uh the the two links that we just got from him on the referencing the Articles and uh we'll get that out there yep so um there's some questions around like public goods funding I think a lot of people have gotten super interested in the ability to use crypto and web3 to fund public goods um but it might be useful to for those of us that are new to web3 to kind of talk about a little bit of a high level why what are public goods why are they important what are some of the mechanisms that you think are super good for funding public goods in web3 what are some of the achievements that you're excited about that you think you know it's great that we've done X Y and Z or something and maybe one of the experiments that you think are in the Horizon then maybe people should think about um trying and and who are they might be excited about uh a lot of people are hacking now and we'll be hacking in future uh hackathons over the next few months and so if you kind of see some really good ideas now they they might get built over time yeah so there's a lot of different ways to Define public goods and like we can get into the technical technicalities of like excludability and rival or assist and all of those things but I think the definition that matters the most is like things that are valuable to lots of people but where there is no good way for the Creator to capture that value without uh you know completely ruining the uh the value of the good right so one uh simple example relevant to the yeah crypto space is uh the design of new algorithms right so uh you know designing new protocols for zero knowledge proofs um designing you consensus algorithms uh designing new I mean signature schemes um doing um analysis of existing algorithms to verify whether or not whether or not they're safe right these are things that benefit everyone who is part of not even one single uh blockchain Community but just part of the crypto space as a whole and even uh going beyond the crypto space but these are not things that you can monetize right because like once you release it it's out there anyone can go and use it um if you try to keep it secret then well because blockchains are a space that depends so much on openness for verification that's just going to completely ruin the trust properties of the system um you know if you try a patent tip that also like you know completely ruin people's ability to effectively build on top of your ecosystem and feel comfortable joining it so it's something that is uh very important but that can't be monetized using a kind of you know traditional organ of capitalist minimum Market means right and so the question is well how do we fund these things and there's a lot of different ideas uh for how to do this so there's obviously centralized foundations and centralized Grant giving organizations um and then there is these more interesting Democratic approaches like quadratic funding is a big example right quadratic funding is basically this matching scheme where anyone can donate to projects that they find valuable and then the system provides matching from a matching pool right and the way that the matching works is that it's not a fixed ratio the amount of matching actually depends both on the amount that people contribute and also on the number of distinct people that could contribute right so if project a gets 500 from uh me and 500 from cardiac and that's it it might get a little bit of a match but then if Project B gets a thousand dollars for where it's one person one dollar each coming from a thousand different people then like that good is much more public than the good that only matters to me and cardigan so that like that could get some much more of a subset thing right and so that's this is a mechanism that's been tried out by Gateway grants for a couple of years now and it's funded a lot of interesting stuff um another interesting one is retroactive funding which is being experimented on by optimism right now where basically yeah instead of getting grants to things ahead of time here or you give uh rewards to projects that have already produced some results and there the idea is that well it might be easier for the mechanism to judge things that have already given good results than it is to judge uh things that are um if he was full ahead of time and and the idea is that then the retroactive grants ecosystem could be combined with a proactive investment ecosystem where people would like basically be willing to invest in projects that seemed like they could be promising public goods in exchange for getting a share of the retroactive reward when that ends up happening right um so basically yeah you know the the idea is to try to like create this pipeline for rewarding the production of public goods that it comes as close to the quality of the API plan that we have today for rewarding the production of uh private Goods great awesome um and what are some of the uh experiments that you think um so there's definitely some retroactive experiments that you describe right there but uh do you think there are other interesting mechanisms that uh maybe could couple to um whether whether it's quadratic voting or some other structures um for how to let large communities Orient the the allocation of funds I mean we've seen some good experiments in terms of um definitely funding um uh you know things like the Bitcoin Grant rounds and so on but we haven't yet seen you know some kind of larger scale utility or some larger scale development process being funded through public goods um what are your thoughts there like what are we sort of missing what kind of mechanisms to kind of aggregate our thinking or aggregate our preferences or kind of Route the funding or collect the funding what do you think is are some of the experiments that might kind of open up like larger scale aggregations um I mean I think in this case one of the big bottlenecks is of course that like unlike much of the rest of the crypto space where a lot of people um easily jump in because it's an opportunity to get money public goods funding is ultimately a sink for money like you have to the money has to come from somewhere right so in the case of Gecko and Grant State you have relied on a lot of individual donations for a while and then only more recently there have been protocols that have been contributing to the matching polls and there have been uh doc coins given to them obviously and things like that um but and then in the case of Optimus they are retro funding is uh going to directly get a share of the token of the op tokens right um but like in order to find public create these larger scale sources of funding public goods like you have to find the larger sources of funding right and so if a version of public goods funding succeeds is at a 10 million dollar budget level then like if you want to scale up to about 10 billion dollars that doesn't just happen automatically because more people get excited and want to join like you would have to actually find the 10 billion dollar or size matching balls right and that's hard right and uh I think it is valuable for crypto projects to and eventually outside of crypto organizations like corporations or governments to contribute to matching polls but like that's an investment that's required on their part right and that's uh something where they would need to see the value in order to contribute to these matching polls and it's something where the value of these mechanisms and the ability of these mechanisms to scale is just something that needs to keep being proven right and I think the existing experiments have done a good job of proving them at small scales but like it's uh it is something that is just inherently going to take a longer amount of time for people to feel comfortable than for you know some a project where it's just like some Define money making thing and you know if it's attractive to people then it can just like jump up to a five billion dollar size relatively quickly right it's just uh like finding public goods funding is more meaningful than those things but it's also just like inherently a longer slog because of the commitment that it requires yeah let me talk you you kind of brought up a an interesting uh kind of stuff topic here in that answer and uh this was a tweet I think two days ago and I quote uh the notion of governance rights as a narrative for why a token should be valuable is pathological uh and it followed no other second explanations uh or or comments or replies uh could you uh give us a little bit more context on well why uh what this tweet actually implies and and more specifically uh what is a better framework of thinking about this um sure so I think there's just a narrative that a lot of people used where they yeah basically say that a token is valuable because it's a governance token and like the governance power is the thing that makes the token valuable right and like I've always thought that this narrative is extremely screwed up uh basically because what that narrative in like in general voting is not something that's like very monetarily useful to any individual personally right like voting actually is an example of something that is a public good the reason is that every individual voter they're making decisions that where they only have a very small probability of affecting the outcome um and the outcome that they affect matters not just for them but it also matters for a very huge number of people right and if you're trying to translate voting into a token context you get this effect where if you're just a small token holder then your probability of attacking the outcome is Tiny and your ability to benefit from the outcome is Tiny because you only have a tiny share of the tokens and so your like actual ability to gain from voting is Tiny squared right but then if you look at big funds that cannot afford to buy you know five or ten percent of the entire circuit Supply out of something well they have a big ability to influence the outcome and also their um ability to benefit from a particular outcomes is also much larger right um and so you have this kind of quadratic effect and so if the only value of a token is a governance power then like really the only people who are actually going to get enough governance power to be to be willing to pay for it are these really large funds right and so you're basically saying well this token is valuable because of the possibility that some at some point down the line its governance is going to get captured by its by extreme of rich people that will do things uh to uh kind of push the systems worth their own interests right so like that's not really a healthy narrative and like actually we don't really want protocols that are capturable by wealthy a special interests right we want protocols that kind of serve all of their users in Asia in a more E coli and that and so what I think we need is like we need healthier and a more sustainable narratives for like why uh protocol is half value right and like there are I think there are definitely are narratives that actually are saying right like there's uh you know direct use value like especially if he had you know in the case of ethereum like you know you have eth and uh you have uh if when you send ease to pay a transaction the the biggest portion of that transaction fee gets burned um and so that is actually gets consumed to pay for the right to get the transaction included right so that's like a kind of Addicting future cash flows there's uh there's just all like there are about the exact but the these better narratives that are I think like much healthier but the problem is it's like it's harder to create a project that actually like has them right and like I understand or attracted to these kind of wound narratives for like basically one of the unfortunately like pathological thing that happens is that these narratives are like more appealing for regulatory reasons because it's like the good narratives are the narratives that put you into a highly regulated category more often and the bad narratives are the narratives uh that like like basically if you if you just say something that something is a meme coin you're not regulated at all right and so there's this kind of unfortunate effect and like I think ultimately in the long term the only solution to this is going to be to like actually talk with Regulators possibly starting in places outside of the us that are more flexible to just to kind of figure out and set examples that work um and then you know and you know plus in just smaller countries in general um and then uh moving up to you know both uh India and the us over time right but that's going to be a long and complicated discussion it'll require buy-in you know from regulars and the crypto Community but I think uh you know in the NHS in the short term like it's uh it is something that I think people needs to be like more cognizant of right because this current approach of like saying things for governance tokens like it doesn't actually give people the ability to distinguish to distinguish between tokens that actually have a possibility of making sense versus things that are all obfuscated new appointments right and I think uh in general in one of the things that the crypto space needs to get better at is the crypto space needs to get better at like distinguishing between sensible projects and scams and that's um and so um you know giving like being having better ways of talking about valuation and narratives for tokens that like really create a big distinction between a token that's valuable because it deserves to be valuable versus a token that's valuable because it's just a meme coin bubble and it's a meme coin bubble that's pretending to be something else to try to get more people buying it like that's something that we do have to get better at distinguishing between and speaking of governance governance rights um right now we've seen Dao's develop kind of direct democracies and maybe some amount of quadratic voting to start making some decisions but we haven't seen um more sophisticated or many sophisticated decision-making structures and it seems right now that dials are you know kind of very labor intensive for a few people that end up being you know very intense Community managers and so on and help guide a lot of the community and so then people end up with kind of doubt burnout and so on and we haven't quite evolved the kind of like work structures that maybe um you know governments and corporations and other kinds of structures um evolved how do you think this is going to play out over the next couple of years like do you think we should be doing more experiments in kind of like um dividing authorities for daos or um you know how do we like build a an open governance structure that doesn't kind of fully centralize into hierarchies but at the same time it's able to kind of coordinate better in a larger scale yeah I mean it feels like yeah from direct democracy to The Republic is kind of the phase we're at and we're not sure if it goes back to the models we have now versus a new unique one that is maybe more interesting and possible yeah I mean I think there's going to be the like this process over the next few years where we really figure out what is the difference between a doubt that makes no sense and a doubt that does make a lot of sense right um so like one of the posts that I wrote a few months ago is uh Dows are not corporations and I basically argued that the class of Dao that tries to be a company is probably not something that actually makes any sense right and for companies it might even be better for companies to just be regular companies and you know if they want to do things like if you have more assurances to their users you know they could there's other kind of non-dowie ways of doing that like committing to open source things efforts of for example and uh you know a lot of kind of innovation within traditional structures like basically the difference is just uh like the difference between Microsoft being a company and Microsoft being a dow where the Dow government structure is the same as what the company would be is not large right um and so we have to like separate between that and the cases where Dows are really meaningful and I think there's two cases where generally Dallas can be meaningful one of those cases is like basically yeah things that need to go very fast and the other is things that need to go very slow right so things that need to go very fast they're like you know small groups of people coming together possibly from across the world for some specialized task and uh you know having a high level of agility is supporting lots of different groups working in uh working in different ways um so that kind of a thing is uh something that is uh like delps can actually just be more efficient than a traditional corporate structures for doing this Towers can provide a greater level of decentralization and a greater level of trustlessness um and you know they just work and we kind of the light overhead nature of them uh actually works well and then the other extremium is dowels that are intentionally solo to change right so if you want to have a stable coin to run by Adele for example one of the challenges is that the market cap of the stablecoin is going to be much larger than the yeah expected uh you know discounted future profits that the stable coin system can extract right and so the stable coin and the assets that are collateralized by the system are going to be much larger than the market cap of the profit token and so if you have token voting governance then it's just inevitably open to this attack where somebody applies up half the profit token and then uses the ads to basically attack and take over the system and uh grab up a huge portion of the underlying assets right and so you need governance that is kind of intentionally slow that intentionally adds friction is intentionally non-financialized in a lot of ways possibly gives people an opportunity to leave if the system starts being taken over and all of these kinds of things right and like confidence is a like a governance that is intentionally not efficient and it's potentially frustrating in a lot of ways and it's only goal is to just survive right like what are the things that you notice in crypto after being here for a long time is that one of the ways to win in the space is to just survive right like I remember on Twitter there was this like I think autism capital or like one of those they made this a long list of you know quote main characters in crypto like basically people who are like you know big crypto personalities and uh then like basically checked well how many of them are still around and how many of them have suffered some kind of Economist fall or just uh you know disappeared into a luxury Caribbean retirement and the number of exes I think was larger than the number of check marks right and a lot of those exes were pretty spectacular right so um you know you have mode gox so you have uh you know now you have Luna you have FTX um you have a lot of uh EOS is one that kind of uh you know I think uh faded into the background quietly but at the same time you know people were like there was block one that just kind of made billions of dollars off of it and as I'm you know just you know wildly taking a you know going on a vacation somewhere right and so just uh you know creating a system that survives for a long time and continues to be aligned for a long time and particularly that solves um what uh some of warrior calls the succession problem right like the problem of a creating a system that continues to serve particular values even after the original Founders that put those values in place are gone like that's hard right and so in like Dallas said aim for stability the hardest work is not even in the code because you have the code the hard work is figuring out exactly what are the rules what should the rules be that the coach writes the animal lands and that's like a big and important Challenge and I think things like Bitcoin grants and optimism and stable coins they're all going into going to need to solve that and if they can't solve that then they've obviously created something really great right but they have to actually get there yeah it seems like uh the next output is a lot more experimentation and then see kind of how do we get these communities to actually persist and grow before we kind of settle on a Model that actively Works uh over a longer cohort size instead of just uh a little while uh maybe a quick one that really is a recurring theme especially at eight Global events uh there's a really big shortage of quarterly test net how do we make sure the future test Nets don't get into the same situation I don't know the the core devs that I've thought a lot about assets probably have better ideas than I do but like I think in general like what could you do you could uh just uh free Mine a huge amount of eth and uh put that into some organization that just like gives it out on a faucet and uh like keeps enough so it can uh so the faucet is able to give but keep giving more tests that needs to people who need it tim.bako at ethereum.org just just emailed that guy and he'll send you some meat uh so there's a lot of interest in social networks and you know you and I have talked a lot about we together the three of us have talked a lot about social networks um over over the years and we are seeing a lot of activity happening around the world with you know balkanization of social networks there's of course all the Twitter Madness recently um people want to move to other more decentralized structures and yet we haven't quite been able to crack the nut on making uh social networks work well there's some like really good highlights like lens and others uh who are like um sort of like getting there what do you think is holding us back like what what are The Primitives that are missing um what's going on like why haven't we been able to make a really strong social network that's web 3 web 3 first I think the Asia thing that's uh holding back social uh decentralized social networks is the same thing that's holding back Network states which is that a lot of the eight people think of these as it being a technology play or even a social technology play but I think ultimately the successful ones are going to be a community play right like uh the the pro that all of these things have is they have to fight against a really powerful Network effects gradient we are at the beginning they have you know very few people uh competing against systems that have very many people and the only way to survive in that kind of environment is uh to have a high quality people right and I think so trying to figure out like how to have a yet actually good and a high quality Community from the start in these systems so that people would want to use them despite the lack of scale like that's a really big challenge um so far it feels like a broadcaster has done a better job than many others from what I can tell like I've poked into it and I've used it a bit and like you know discussions on your seem high quality it's not a ghost town right and they've succeeded at that um so yeah I think the question is uh how like if you're building one of these like how do you actually create a community that people want to participate in and where that Community has like a lot of uh interesting people that enjoy being there with each other and they can attract uh other interesting people over time as well right and uh I don't think like that's that's not the lens through which the failing projects are considering this real right and I think that is the answer which is successful project circus are considering it through absolutely Fair it looks like uh time uh time will tell or you got to really Force everybody to sign up for that account um we got a couple questions on this team so I'll kind of combine all of them and sort of uh synthesize it to a generalized uh question but uh kind of from your perspective what's one of the biggest dangers that the ethereum ecosystem is facing what's one challenge that the ethereum ecosystem is facing yes yes um I think there's like basically the biggest one is this kind of implicit race between scaling technology and the kind of impending next moments of large scale adoption right whether like that's uh you know a kind of bubble in the same way that we've had previous bubbles or just um you know any allergic recent people well I took to use the chain in general like things are in a bit of a role right now where like as this you know we've done the math before and now you can include said the transaction for 14 cents um yeah sometimes but that's that wasn't the status quo a year ago and that was it this has two or two years ago right one or two years ago we had a crazy fee market and it would take multiple dollars to send even a simple transaction and then if you want to send video receipts what do you would have to pay over 10 if you want to send Services get started privacy preserver then you'd have to pay hundreds of dollars and it was just completely insane right um so I think uh right now we've been given this kind of temporary respite from that situation but like that's temporary right or rather if it ends up not being temporary then then crypto has failed right um and so we have to scale fast enough to actually be ready for that next moment and uh to make sure that the transactions and ecosystem actually continue to be affordable and that's not something that's happened yet um and uh that's something where obviously roll-up teams and a lot of bunch of other people are really working hard on but that's something that we uh you know we need to keep working on to make sure that we actually get more scaling by the time that we need it um so we're here in India right now with a couple thousand people about I think 20 000 people applied try to get into this hackathon um the Webster Community is growing a ton in India and is one of the most populous countries in the world one of the largest economies the most populous country in the world one of the largest economies um there's a lot of Builders there's a lot of growth in the ecosystem uh people are super excited to build uh really great use cases and really great things what's some of the advice that you have for Builders setting off in their web 3 Journey starting to build their applications whether it's kind of like the things to try and build or kind of how to kind of set a vision and stay the course or you know maybe looking back in your own development like what are the things that you um ended up kind of thinking were really important as a builder to kind of like share with the community here so they you know you can basically influence a lot of people over the next couple of years and building pretty great things yeah I think the big theme of this decade for crypto is just is going to have to be build things that don't that aren't just like fascinating and equivalent Theory but that actually really work for people in practice right um so understand what people specific needs are um even if you know people's needs are just fairly stuff that seems fairly simple and boring like you know ways of holding crypto stable coins and uh you know moving safe moving stable coins around um try to you know really like I think in the last decade there was a lot of building out of theory and there was a lot of people thinking through well okay you know we could have prediction markets so we could have uh you know Dows and we could have games and nfts and we could do fancy stuff and uh a lot of us get a very theoretical analysis of What kinds of things we could do which was great and I think very appropriate for the early stage of the space but uh like now we really need is like actually build things that are going to be meaningful for um you know many millions of users right and uh I think uh India is a great place to start working on that I think basically anywhere other than existing rich countries is a great place to work on that uh because uh that's where the uh a lot of the meaningful problems are right like one of the things I've noticed is that the defy space in you know places like New York like you know it does often basically end up trying to like really focusing a lot on the needs of a fairly small number of wealthy people to try to you know gamble or like or like at least 11 instead of six percent on yield farming or whatever right and in ways that are in the long term not super sustainable um and I think uh in like for for example like in Latin America where I've spent a lot about a lot of time this year in particular um like you know you see people that have a much more kind of real attitude and you know that understand that you know hey there's serious problems that we're working on and uh that that really yeah try to build things that are useful for people for people who have these uh really serious problems and uh you know I imagine you know in the obviously has uh its own uh you know very complex environments and I think this uh this combination of a lot of challenges and a lot of very smart people that are willing to beat those challenges uh and that's in you know an opportunity for the four people uh building in a crypto to build things that's uh you know are actually going to really really matter for people's lives so yeah I guess uh you know biggest advice this decade is to focus more on the users and to like focus more on the users and like really think through what are the things that are going to be useful for people not just in the next six months of a whole cycle but you know in the next 10 years metallic that is a amazing positive note to uh to end this chat on I want to thank you so much for joining us and I hope to see you in person for the next one thank you so much definitely very much looking forward to coming in here in person amazing
