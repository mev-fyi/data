hi Aidan Aidan and CEO of Shayne safe systems I'm a free I'm working for parity technologies we are doing a short assumed 101 session like getting started running your own node connecting to apps we provider and yeah it's basically a very basic introduction to everyone or the 24 42 percent that are nutrient here so first of all i'm i'm working for parity so I'm kind of biased but I would encourage people to run their own node but not directly to rely on structure providers because it's a nice experience and it gives you a better feeling for how assume or how decentralized networks actually work so for assumes there are different implementations there's like official reference implementations let's guess to go into home client we had parity we developed the rusticity own client parity serum it comes with additional features like multi-chain support or enterprise features like private transactions differences there are many more clients available like NTR Trinity a lot of different implementations of require so if you want to develop a decentralized application on assume you can in most cases you will just start with like emulating a blockchain environment in developer mode by running like the different clients trying to like most preset and figured for a developer specially specifically that comes without networking and some kind of instant block sealing mechanism that basically watches your actions and whenever you brought castle transaction it exceeds a block but at some point you want to step up the game and want to deploy your applications may be on a public test net which is like more more close to your main net conditions and do you want to talk about distance yeah so kind of in going into the test nets we're missing morning okay so we'll just talk about Rob Stein so Robson is currently active roofer for a contestant that I'd be interacting already so the reason you know this is a problem it's because proof-of-work pest notes aren't incentivized I have actors acting in a way that's healthy for the network um so it's very very susceptible hacks spam so anyone basically bring down the network okay sorry so anyone can really bring down the network and yeah I mean for regular developers most of testing is involving smart contracts and really just deploying some kind of smart contract and just seeing how that works so the actual main it conditions of the consensus mechanism so having proof a proof of work test net isn't really necessary where that does become necessary is coordinating hard Forks so for example during the Constantinople tests that were happening a month ago [Music] previously that was kind of done on Robson because it's the only kind of like test net but again when you're just testing your smart contracts this becomes kind of a bid I'm cumbersome to developers as they're kind of reliant on this non incentivize proof of work and that doesn't provide you the ability to bility that's necessary you test smart contracts regularly and because of the like spam attacks literally oving was proposed so kovin covin is led by was first implemented in parity aetherium and led by a group of people you can read about it you just search Kovan proposal basically it is a proof of authority test net this is a completely different paradigm because it is relying on a set of validators to as offer he was talking about in the developer I'm talking about developer owed that Mon it's basically sealing the blocks with these kind of trusted validators so it's a bit different from a consensus perspective then the main net but it really provides the stability and the usability that is necessary to actually test mark contracts as opposed to testing consensus hard Forks and just different EIP deeds and stuff that would be necessary in the proof-of-work world though the really kind of cool thing about open is that it supports P wasum so right now you can deploy rest smart contracts to the coving test net um there's a really cool tutorial on deploying NERC 20 and rest but I highly recommend it's well feeling to do that and yes so because of these features that aren't available other clients this test net is siloed off and only usable within the parity theory so whereas Robson in its cross client boven only works with 30 etherium on text so this also stops us from a certain certain things and it also just stops us from having reliable and distant past net the case of its clients not able to actually run the network itself so in response to ring Pete I mean in response to kovin ring P was proposed by Peter from the guess team and basically it's as well okay so going backwards kovin runs authority round as it's privity consensus mechanism whereas Rigby runs leak so they're very similar there's a couple different nuances that are different if you're interested he's coming after asked some questions but it's small things really really what makes them super unique is the feature sets of the clients themselves Opie wasn't your one I mean so these test nets could never really come together because he wasn't support would need pantheon yes whole bunch clients though in response to that a free and I just started talking a lot and because he is very open with vision and very transparent about what he does I learned about across client testing problem up until then never really thought about it never considered it and then I see a comment that he made it hub it had been an open problem for a year that there was no cross client already test net doesn't sound very sexy but it's it's a real problem and so what we did was at East Berlin in September worked on implementing aura in together which sit so at the time we had issues with writing rust thirteen writes go so we attempted to go ago we attempted to write it yes aura and it didn't really go too well so reset it after now with the help of unity been able to implement it now in five different clients and it is live now it's been live since January 31st um we pushed a red button just started the test night at girl econ Berlin so that was super exciting thank you to the DoD for hosting that but yeah why is this why does this matter and why is across group of authority test no matter I'm an alien comes back to usability I'm in developer friendliness if you do not have system that's net up and running that is always available willing owner issue so for example when we were working on this project a teeth curl in rinkeby went down for a short period of time so this is something we don't really consider often but what happens it happens right or screwed basically so a cross line best net ensures that there's stability within that network of this kind of multi client paradigm if they are there making sure that their network is always running so yes similar to the developer presets most clients support or presets pre configurations for public tests nuts or girly for instance it's like gasps - - girly or parity early the parity poor occurs is not merged yet so it's like soon but we are getting there so yeah so now that you want to develop on any test nets you probably want to send transactions deploy contracts or just connect whatever you are developing to your no okay note you in most case want to enable a PC are peas in most cases you use HTTP or we but they're also sometimes implement web sockets or ripes API so you can just go forever whatever you want seafood rttp or RPC Porter's 8545 as you change it so [Music] sure so if you want to get started with girly test night for instance I mean you're biased because we're not sure but we would recommend you to use curly we have different blog explorers we have blocks code we have ECC and we have a status dashboard we have different forces we even have bridge so you can bridge your old legacy chestnut coins to little girlies and I yes I'm so just like you know we're not trying to say that proof-of-work test nuts don't matter they really do matter and you need to incentivize people to mind them and actually be a part of that Network and that's why we created a bridge that allows you to bridge up to a hundred eath so if you want to go in mind so with proof of authority test nets there's a pre allocation so you do not yet test nannies for validating a block so the only real way for us is to use the faucet or to bridge from any other test net so we highly recommend that you go out there you get involved in and that's net then bridge that over to early burn that robson it anyway yeah which we came out with a bridge idea in practice so if you don't if you're lazy and don't want to run your own local node you can just connect to public or the add points or public API s block Scout somatic labs and some other people are running points in through us just announced this week girly support so you can use for girly we've written tutorial how to spawn up your own notes with terraform and now we are getting interactive just walking through like connecting weight a mass to local girly note getting account to sending a transaction trusting early just a teaser so made a mass it's a project engine that allows you to manage accounts basically yeah where's I'm running a local node right now no okay so you use the public okay so show it yes so yeah I'm if you open up madam ask and so you can see already here that I'm connected to a custom RPC and you can see here at localhost so if you're running it locally so yeah you would very very conveniently yes very conveniently will do that and connect to one of these end points Oh just like that you will be oh maybe it's not yes or maybe it's just out yeah yeah it's better to run your own ode for sure yeah it seems like it's not working best thing I'm going to definitely try I mean I tried HTTP first before so it's having issues but whatever I don't really want to yeah so I already am connected to a custom RPC the open end point here and yeah I'm very quickly I can go to just any of I could go to the bridge but I'm just gonna go to a faucet because it's a little bit more convenient and just like this sorry I'm gonna use the other one because it's not social so we have two forces one is like sorted so you can just enter your address and get like a small amount of ease which is enough to cover transaction fees and we also have like a indicated forces where you can like authenticators have the social media account to get like a bigger chunk of just its to prevent spam obviously that's pretty straightforward you just fill in the CAPTCHA and the address and you'd like very small amount of or just a tease which you can use central section boy contracts interact with smart contracts bootstrap your sunglass application yeah a faucet works it's pretty simple anyone who hasn't interacted with one before if you have any questions please come up to us we'd love to help you get started and then it's as easy as sending eath going to send some to myself yeah and it really is that yeah if anyone needs to me I might know a guy so it's as simple as that Oh sent some ether to the one account from the one account to the other there no transaction but it'll come up eventually I mean it really is that simple again please if you have any questions roomed please come up to us we'd love to help you I mean getting started with deploying contracts just yeah any questions in general regarding pest nets and we like to talk about this stuff unfortunately no we show the cat picture okay thanks [Applause] oh yeah sure easiest as if you go to the github.com smash girlies nest man this links all resources it's best resource yeah oh yeah was a good a faucet that's a mess yeah but to be honest so from a core developer perspective Rob's will most likely be retired at some point maybe this year because it's like not sustainable anymore it's like a huge rock show the blockchain of Rob's not as big as an issue in classic you know I don't know what plans but I know from from Peter that also ring P is like growing to a size where you actually just want to reset it and I think Gurley now is like also forget steam a good chance to just say okay we can now like implicate it's not like we adding one more test net but we like offer like a solutions that might replace existing just nice to some degree just even the robustness of testing that has come from Gurley with things like nether mind and Pantheon has been incredible to see we're able to test things now within a proof of authority test net paradigm that otherwise you don't have done so it's super exciting from kind of the more boring kind of side of things I guess not a sexy side work you know test cases are more robust now um but just as well you know like NS just supported Gurley with all of their with everything ethers j/s just supported Gurley you're like a couple days ago so the community has an eye for wallet block Scout like yeah people have really moved towards it and we're hoping that yeah this is a way to not have to worry about having 14 different test notes thank you very much [Applause]
