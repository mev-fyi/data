good afternoon good morning good evening everybody my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of e-global and welcome to the online kickoff so a lot of you almost all of you are watching this thing on youthglobal.tv for those of you who haven't experienced this before this is the page we designed to go through all of our content and our summits good afternoon good morning good evening and after a really big update we launched a new version of it global tv today so a lot of you are gonna see uh some a few features that are brand new and uh walk through some of the things that we've put on with such as the profile but there'll also be some bugs so if some of you notice any bugs be sure to type them out in chat if they are bugs about the chat be sure to send us an email so we can debug this thing because uh we are hoping that we get to test this thing out really well with a few hundred of you in real time and a lot of these things are super tricky to uh to debug otherwise so uh sign in set up your profile and say hi to all of us also if you are going to be asking any questions to our speakers today or for the future events you can type those questions out in the chat and we'll be able to relay those questions to our speakers similarly anybody who signs in will be receiving a poep nft token for their participation so be sure to say hi to all of us and log into chat so for those of you who are joining us for the first time this event init online is organized by each global and eth global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to bring thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we primarily do that by running hackathons and summit and eat online is no different it is our biggest event of the year so let's talk about how the next few weeks are set up we're going to first cover the summits so we're going to be running six summits in total uh four of them are on the specific theme so next friday all summits are going to be on fridays next friday is our nft and creator summit on the 24th the friday after that is our summit on governance endows then we are running a special summit on developer tools in this ecosystem that's on october 8th and lastly the last summit of uh this event is going to be on october 15th which is about the merge and scalability of ethereum and that day also coincides with our finale where we'll be talking about all of our teams and the prizes for all of the participation for the hackathon in addition to these four summits we'll be running a two other summits for the ave and the compound ecosystem so we'll be sharing more details on that and the discord and also on our website now let's move over to the hackathon so this is a very unique event for us we have over a thousand hackers from 77 different countries spending 19 different times and participating here asynchronously for the next few weeks not only that we plotted out where everybody's coming in from and to this day still continues to amaze us on how wide and how diverse this audience is so there'll be a lot of chat going on on discord uh because everybody's going to be in so many different time zones it's always going to be exciting for somebody here so uh be sure to say hi to all the other people that are also participating on top of the hackers we also have 160 mentors and 54 companies and sponsors that are participating in the hackathon they'll be here to help you out with anything that you need whether it's about a specific protocol or just the space in general and to top it all off we have over 350 000 in prices being given away as part of this hackathon and you'll be able to see a lot of those details on the website as well as the price page which is linked into your info center [Music] and these are some of the amazing companies and protocols that are out there participating in this event if you have any questions about how to use any of these technologies or even how to get started on things that are not related to anything that's listed here you'll be able to do so by just asking questions to everybody in this event and will be happy to help answer and clarify anything that helps you get started in this event so let's go into the logistics a lot of you have asked us what can i build here for this hackathon is there a theme or do i can't do certain things or how would i go about participating for the next few weeks the answer is this event is entirely designed to give you the flexibility and freedom to build whatever you would like you can build anything in default nfts you can talk about building games and anything in social media a lot of a lot of you have talked about building stuff in the layer two ecosystem and using zero knowledge proofs or or just other l2 scaling solutions whether it's optimistic roll-ups or zk roll-ups and of course there's a lot of people who are also interested in building dev tools and also documenting existing things that are out there all these things are totally possible but if anything that's not listed here is something that's on your list you can totally do that you are free to choose whatever you would like as long as it's about ethereum now let's cover some key logistics uh for this hackathon so i'll go over what the next three weeks look like and just cover each of these topics and of course if you have any questions that come up as part of me covering this be sure to ask them on the chat and then we'll be able to clarify anything for you so i'll talk about what does it mean to form a team and how you can think about finding other potential teammates how you can get help if you're stuck all the prizes you can win we're going to talk about all the talks in the workshops that are happening and we'll also talk about the judging process after the hackathon ends and then we kind of will roll into the summits so the key important piece here is that because of this the scale of this event everything is happening on discord so for everybody who has rsvp'd from your dashboard you will be able to connect your discord and you should see the eat online section on discord on the left sidebar so you will just see all these channels look out for the eat online 2021 chat and that's where everything is happening uh the key piece here is that these are controlled directly from our back end so if you have not rsvp you will not be able to see these channels and if you are not seeing these channels but you have rsvp that means there's some bug here and we want to be able to help you get those channel access so ping us if you aren't able to see these things but everything that we're going to talk about for this event happens here on top of that we have created dedicated channels to get help for a specific protocol or just general mentorship so if you're ever stuck you can go into the support channel and type up your questions and there will be somebody there to answer it for you they'll be able to even hop on to a live call to help you get unboxed so be sure to use our mentors and leverage their experience to finish your project on top of that you should have already received a lot of calendar invites for the workshops that have happened this week but also are going to be happening next week and um the entire schedule for this event is on the website we want this thing to be as asynchronous as possible which means that even though everything is on your calendar if you are not able to make something real in in real time if you're not able to join the call because of time zone issues um it is not a big deal because all these things are recorded and you can find everything the talks the links to the videos and the entire schedule on online.ethglobal so let's cover how the hackathon is structured and how does everything work so hackathon officially begins now which means that as of me saying the sentence you can start working on your projects you can have up to five members on your team if you are working with a team and you have the next three and a half weeks to submit your project and the rules and the criteria are fairly straightforward what this means is that if you are with a team um actually so the first rule is everything that you're going to submit must be done during the course of this hackathon which means that all of your submissions must be projects that have started today and and end the day of the submission uh if you are using existing libraries from just open source work or other protocols sdks or boilerplates that is totally fine but if you are working on a project that has already been started by you before today um that is a issue and you should reach out to us to clarify what's going on because you will not be eligible for any prizes if you were working on something before today also missions must be related to ethereum so that's a key requirement and only rsvp hackers are eligible to win any prizes which means if your team members have not signed up and rsvp'd and are not listed on your team page they will not be counted to receive any prizes if you win so with any and that means you have to ping us really immediately to confirm that everybody on your team is also registered for the hackathon and of course there's a lot of ash cases and nuances so if you have any questions that come up that have not been clarified already be sure to ask us whether it's on discord or on email and the bigger question we get is what if i'm new to all this thing what do i do here uh don't worry if you're in that situation because there are a few hundred of you who are trying to get into this ecosystem and we want to design this event to make sure that there is help for you if uh for everybody who needs it um if you are looking for joining a project or joining a team and you're not sure what you can potentially work on or if you need someone with specific skill sets whether that's a front-end engineer or or a designer or anybody who has a key thing that you need help with because you already have an idea you want to work on you can head over to find a team channel on discord and see everybody who's also looking for a team or looking to join a team um and contact them directly and see if you'd like to work together on top of that because there's so many people from so many different parts of the world we really encourage you to say hi to everybody on the 2021 chat channel and just introduce yourself and tell us what you're working on and love to learn more about you and also if you are looking to get help outside of that financing channel we'll also be hosting a call today and also another one on monday on how to form uh for for team formation where we'll be able to get everybody on who's looking to join a team on a call and you'll be able to talk to each other in real time and learn about what everybody's interested in or working on and potentially match with a future teammate and by the way if you don't have a team um it is not the end of the world uh it is just recommended that you work with somebody because it makes your life easier but it is totally possible and okay to work on a project on your own there is no requirement that you need to have a team so if you already know what you want to do and you are good with continuing with that for the next few weeks that is totally all right so let's go over talks and workshops there's a lot of content for everybody from all different experience and skill levels whether that's a beginner or a an expert and we already started with a lot of talks uh this week in the past few days and you can see all these things on the website but also on your calendars and we'll be doing a lot more talks um next week in the weeks after around everything that's happening in this space whether that's how some protocols work to what's happening in the cutting edge of the research around your knowledge proofs there's a whole spectrum of things that you can learn and keep up with for this event there's also going to be talks and panels as part of the summits and also a lot of workshops including beginner workshops for how do you get started in solidity or just smart contracts and on top of all that we will be doing a feedback session every week so that those of you who are excited to show what you've been doing for that week for your project we're getting feedback from our sponsors or some of our judges you can just come on that call and just demo what you've been able to do so far for that given week and just get input and suggestions all this information is also on the info center which you would be able to see on each of these calendar invites but also on our discord and your dashboard and of course just to remind everybody again it is totally fine if you can attend something because of a time zone issue or some other obligation whether that's work or school everything is recorded so you'll be able to immediately watch that same talk on youtube um the minute after it ends and you can just go to youtube.com eatglobal to see everything that is happening for eat online and i'll keep saying this thing a few more times just head over to online.educable.com to see the full schedule everything about the prizes and the links to all the recorded talks so let's talk about check-ins so all thousands of you have staked need to fully rcp for this event uh the way everything is structured is that we're going to ask everybody to tell us what they're doing what you're doing once a week um over the next three weeks to really kind of make sure that we're able to help you get to where you want to be for this project and and if you are stuck with something or if you need suggestions or help with anything we can redirect our support to make that happen and unblock you as you respond to these check-ins that qualifies you to really kind of be an eligible participant to win any prizes and get your stake back so make sure that you reply to a check-in once a week and all that is going to happen on your dashboard and we'll be sending email reminders as well as discord messages confirming everything and reminding everybody that things are happening so you'll get the first check-in notification on monday um so keep in the lookout for for that and we're excited to see what everybody's going to build next up is judging so the key piece here is that because of the skill of this event judging is going to be done as a video submission which means that when you are ready to submit your project you'll have to make a four minute demo of what you built and talks about that talks about everything from your project and who you are as a team and why you chose to work on that project along with a demo of the actual project that you built and this is the only way to submit a project which means if you don't have a four minute video submissions you will not be able to qualify for any prizes because we will not be able to review your submission and we say this all the time because this happens every time but do not do this thing last minute because it will take you a few hours to really nail down how to best communicate what you've been working on in four minutes four minutes is not a lot of time when you're doing live demos so be sure to plan early for what you're going to talk about in this video and make sure that everybody can see what you've built without running out of time all these details and everything about this whether it's submission or workshops or check-ins is again going to be on your dashboard so don't worry if you can't um if i'm either going too fast or you can't remember everything from here everything will be sent to you on multiple different channels i also want to talk about the code of conduct so this is an online event but the same rule rules apply for being in our online community or our in-person community you can check out the rules and the code of conduct by heading over to eatglobal.com rules but in summary we just want everybody to be respectful and harassment and abuse in any form will not be tolerated so if you see anybody that's behaving the way they shouldn't or if you are being treated um in a non-ideal way please reach out to us on the global team and we'll be able to get back to you on this asap and take action and finally i want to remind everybody that please pace yourself as you participate over the next few weeks the reason these events are a few weeks long is because we don't want this to be exhausting for you and we want you to really have fun and take some time to understand and learn about what's happening instead of just printing and not sleeping and just getting something done for the sake of getting something done we really want you to have fun we really want this to be about learning and experimentation there's so many different new things that you can try whether these are projects or new libraries or new sdks just a new brand new concept for all of you or joining us for the first time it's designed to give everybody that buffer to understand what's happening before you jump in and we really want you to make sure that you're doing this thing in a way that benefits you and is structured for you to learn and grow for the long term all right so i'll keep an eye out for a few questions as we look at what's happening so i'll wait here for a few seconds and then see what questions people have but uh until then we will wait and then get ready for our actual talk my keynote talk for today so i see a couple of questions here and if you have not so so for the person who has not received the discord invite um you should be able to go back to your dashboard and there's a really small link at the footer of that dashboard that says reconnect discord so if you have rsvp you can just find that really tiny link at the bottom of your dashboard and rcp there and reconnect the discord thing and it should give you the right permissions this specially is an edge case if you were a participant at the hackband before and you haven't gone the new permission changes yet so be sure to just reconnect this cord by clicking the link at the bottom of your events so i see a few other questions what we'll do is we'll just take a quick five minute breather break and we'll get into our next talk which is going to be a retroactive public goods funding so for those of you who are excited to hear carl and metallic talk we'll just resume shortly and if you have any other questions about the logistics of this event be sure to type them out on the chat and i'll answer them for you here until we are ready to kick off with our keynote so enjoy that talk and we'll be resuming shortly all right so we are ready to kick off our keynote fireside chat and i'm super excited to welcome carl from optimism and metallic veteran to talk about retroactive public kids funding so call me talk we'll be talking about what this is why this is important and everything about this with each other so i'll kick this off by saying carl maybe you can start us off by giving an overview on what this is and uh we'll take it i will i'll let you two take it from here so welcome sure thank you can y'all see me or maybe i'm crazy anyway oh lovely so here we are we are talking about um retroactive public goods funding so public goods funding is a big topic in the ethereum community because a lot of ethereum software a lot of ethereum development a lot of theorem progress and culture it is the creation of public goods all of it is shared openly freely on the internet um and we got uh i i've got i okay so i confess i wrote down a bunch of questions for vitalik i'm gonna be able to i'm gonna talk uh and answer a bunch of things myself as well of course um but i just you know gotta hear gotta hear what vitalik has to say but anyway just for before we even get going though um a little background on me um i was doing you know ethereum stuff for a while worked at the ethereum foundation and then uh now i'm working at optimism pbc trying to scale ethereum with optimistic ethereum optimistic roll-up all those good things so anyway that's me and uh i guess we we we probably know who vitalik is so i'll even ask the first i'll even ask the first question v what is a public good um so a public good um is uh something that uh benefits a large and um unselective group of people so it's a yeah a thing or a project or something that someone that someone can do or create that has a benefit where that benefit gets us spread out across a very wide group of people where there is no way to decide like who's part of that group who is not right so um like for for example um you know something like scientific research it's a public good um because like once someone comes up like comes up with some results out of their research like that that gets published and that's out there and like everyone benefits from it right like there isn't some way to make that to make it only accessible to some people and not other people whereas on the other hand like with say the the the iced coffee that you're drinking for example right that is um actually a private good um created by starbucks because even though there's a benefit that said to diffuse across a large group of people um starbucks has the ability to decide on a very fine grain basis you know you're one of the iced coffee recipients but you over there who did not pay for it is not right yeah but so with private goods even private goods produce on a large scale you can do that whereas with uh with public goods you can't and the reason why public goods are such a an important and challenging category is because unlike with private goods where you can like the starbucks can earn the the resources that that they needs to generate their iced coffee because like they can just sell the kind of tickets to become part of the iced coffee i'm having club well with a public good like you you do not control whether or not any particular person is like part of the group of people who gets to benefit so like you don't have that as your business model right and like coming up with ways for people to uh for people who create public goods to actually get any of the value that they capture is that's a very hard problem wow beautiful so one one you know question there is like okay you know starbucks obviously has a business model um but i'm kind of curious are public goods incentive compatible you know like for instance you know does the invisible hand work for public goods too i think um incentive compatibility is not something that like an object has in the abstract you always have to look at the object in the context of a mechanism so like for example if we did not have uh private property rights uh and anyone could just uh you know quickly run up kind of knock down your door go up to um run up to your desk grab your iced coffee and run away with it then um iced coffee no longer be a private good it would be a well i guess common good is probably more accurate than public because the iced coffee would still be rivalrous but um like but basically like the the only reason why i like ice coffee gets to be a private good is the fact that like we have property rights and you know we have this whole kind of economic and legal system that's uh basically designed around uh kind of putting them in in that bucket so that you know lovely chaps like starbucks can't have a business model um so like the the question basically is um you know what kind of uh the institution kind of using that term extremely broadly um do we need to build in order to make more of our public goods incentive compatible wow cool well i'm we're gonna get into that soon but uh what what uh what would like the world look like if we didn't have public goods you know um chances are you'd probably be dead of some stupid disease by now because of uh yeah i guess um the scientific progress because that's yeah yeah the exact way like [Music] wow okay well real real quick i mean what what what are the like how has ethereum uh funded public goods so far like where where how did we how did we get as far as we've gone um so most funding of public goods within the ethiopian ecosystem and also within lots of ecosystems um just happens because there is some single um centralized body whose goals are uh who which has enough funding to just like personally fund a whole bunch of public goods and whose goals are aligned enough with some particular ecosystem or community or things succeeding that it's actually in their interest to do all of that funding so in the ethereum case it's uh the ethereum foundation um together with a bunch of other entities right like for example you know there's consensus there is uh uh increasingly the unit swapped out maker dow has funded some good things uh and then moloch dale has uh funding some good things um though like even there right we've already started talking about dows and so we've already started kind of talking about things that are not quite centralized um but like the the kind of the traditional model right is that you do basic yeah basically have a small group of people that like basically just makes all of the decisions and you hope that that small group of people is competent what yeah what's what's wrong with these approaches like what what could be better i think the problem with the small group of people is that any small group of people is going to be missing important things and we even i think saw some examples of this back when the bitcoin grants were starting up for the first time right gitcoin grant started supporting things like various ethereum cultural projects and it started um supporting uh just various resources online providing information about ethereum and started um supporting podcasts right it just started supporting this big like ecosystem of things that the ethereum foundation did not even like really deeply look into or consider something that's kind of that it should be supporting also the other thing is um that if you do have a centralized body um that's uh choosing all of the public goods and especially once you start talking about public goods that have to do with things like culture and intellectual output and media then that puts a huge amount of power in the hands of that one very small group group of people right and it would be nice to be able to distribute that uh power more widely nice nice okay the moment is finally here so what is retroactive public goods funding now we know what public good spending is okay so retroactive public goods funding is this idea that instead of uh having your public goods funding mechanism um you know dow what whatever it is um funds public goods ahead of time so where the dow would say hey you know this project looks good and it looks promising so i'm gonna throw a hundred thousand dollars at it and you know hope it's gonna do or do something good um instead uh you funds uh public goods after those public goods have already been shown to have an impact spread so like right now you know we already know that like bankless has for example provided a lot of value to the ethereum ecosystem and it's been great and so a retroactive dow might just say hey you know i'm going to retroactively like plunk a quarter million dollars over into uh to the bankless peeps um or speaking of plunk um you might want to give a quarter million dollars to zero knowledge cryptography thieves um so the the core um reasoning behind this is um that like basically the there there's this large category of goods that i or public goods that i call entrepreneurial public goods like these so you know like you've probably heard the as the the slogan that like if uh you know like like the way to be a successful um entrepreneur is not to build a faster horse right like like the most successful a lot of the most most successful and important private goods um in our society are things that were not even recognized as being important at the beginning until everyone was already using them and realized they kind of after the fact how and how important they are um so with public goods um it's very similar right and so if you just like make a democratic decision of uh you know hey guys we're going to vote on like you know what things we'll fund in the future then you're going to get some very conformist and middle of the road opinions and you're not you're going to get a lot of projects that kind of you know roughly line up with people's existing you know social desirability biases but you're not going to get like you know your radical you know cool experiments that are like a bit out there and eighty percent of them uh or or even ninety percent turn out to be complete failures and everyone's like well done that's a complete failure but then the other ten percent um you know end up really succeeding in making enough of an impact to really make the entire thing worth it um so retroactive public arts funding um the decentralized kind of voting based like thing makes the decisions about what to fund after the fact after the project has already shown value based on the value that it has shown um and if you want like you want to convert that into proactive uh funding then that's something that can be done outside the mechanism right so like for example uh someone could even just invest into a team that's producing a public good and their attractive public goods finding gadget could just decide that you know the person who made that investment actually yeah like was a contributor to the public good and they should get a really a really big reward as well cool and you're kind of alluding to it but you've talked about this concept of like quote project tokens what is what is that right okay so project tokens are this idea um that some like team that's working on a public good and this uh eventually potentially getting retroactive public arts funding could create a token and they could issue that token based on like who they think contributed to the public good right so they could pre-mine a large share of the token and distribute it out to different team members they could put a large share of the token on unisop and then when people buy it on uniswap um and well when they do that then like they can start end up collecting ether whatever the asset is that the token is priced against and then they can actually sell that ether then they have or just use that ether they have something with which to pay like short serve expenses for people who are not willing to accept payments and project tokens themselves um so the and then the the the purpose of these project tokens is that later on after the fact when there's the project turns out to have actually provided value the retroactive public goods funding oracle can just decide i think this project has been useful therefore i'm going to just buy up these projects tokens um and when it buys up the project tokens that rewards um everyone who holds um any quantity of these project tokens nice nice um so also what like at what scale do you see retroactive public goods funding kind of eventually you know getting to is this something like i mean ethereum how you know what kind of scale do you see ethereum getting to and then like how how big could this retroactive public goods funding mechanism go i think um the answer is like basically the same as it is with git coin which is the only limit is our ability to um actually come up with the cash to pay for these uh public arts funding pools um and like with uh git coin i think the next big leap of growth the the way that we get from uh 50 000 to 50 million is going to come from us moving beyond relying on individuals to donate these uh funds um and instead move toward like mechanisms or projects and directly donating these funds right um so like the fact that like bitcoin controls a significant portion of the akita coin supply right like akita you know it's a dog point like it's okay it's an institution um and it's like a thing that's uh fun you're gonna find some awesome public goods um or you know if there is an optimistic roll-up project and that optimistic roll-up project collects transaction fees then those are those transaction fees could be put into a public goods funding plot um so the question is just that like how like what kind of um like fee like or what money earning capacity of institution can we convince uh to um start throwing their fees into a pot um and i think at the like right now it's fairly small but i think um over time it could potentially get quite big um and like the reason why i could potentially get quite big right is because i think a lot of these like especially very network effects uh dependent things in the crypto space they really strongly depend on legitimacy right they really strongly you know just depend on this kind of social consensus that like you know we should be supporting this particular project because like this project um satisfies the community's values in a certain in some certain way or does some other thing to you know make the community feel like they should be focusing on that particular project i mean and like creating a big massive positive externality that makes the entire community really love you is like an excellent way of getting legitimacy uh so i like this is um one of those places where i think you know you have we have the opportunity to actually get a lot of leverage here right like you know basically in order to create a 100 million dollar retroactive public goods funding pod there doesn't actually need to be an individual or even a company that like experiences a hundred million dollars of suffering right like the act of contributing to the plot like and it can even like be like help kind of like cements that project's position in the uh in the community um so that ill so i guess those are reasons why i'm optimistic nice i'm optimistic too um you talked about this concept of legitimacy what is like what what is your theory of legitimacy because it's just one of it's one of my favorite blog posts of yours yeah so the way that i think about legitimacy is i think about it as this pattern of higher order acceptance so i accept a particular outcome and i even play my part in enacting an outcome because i expect that everyone else is going to do the same thing because they think on average they think in the same way um so like one simple example of this is how um like driving on one side of the road or even walking on one side of the road like is something that is kind of like legitimized in that way right and it can be different in different places like these are kind of self-sustaining equilibrium like they could they could go either way you know it could be on the left side could be on the right side and in different places it is different ways um but like there is like within each particular like region there is a kind of one way to do it and like you know there's a significant coordination benefits from the fact that there's one way to do it and it's self enforcing right like you know you don't even really need police that much because of like it's never it's in everyone's interest not to crash into other people um so like the kind of left versus right side of the road example feels really trivial because well like why does it matter which side of the road you're on but like i think it's like the exact same kind of effect that ends up deciding a lot of things that um actually matter matter much more right and even things where the choices are different enough that there's like even moral values inherent to inheritance differences and those moral values are often some of the things that we coordinate around to actually kind of like decide which option becomes legitimate um so like one example that i mentioned is nfts right like let's say you know it's the year 2035 and uh carl florsch becomes uh super famous uh and everybody really loves karl floresh um and carl florsch decides um that you know in order to [Music] raise money for um i don't know what do you want to raise money for um permanently ending all animal suffering do you like that okay in order to raise money in order to raise money in order to raise money for permanently and ending animal suffering car flourish is going to release the car for nft but then also at the same time there is uh craig wright and craig wright also releases the coral fluorescent ft and craig wright's car for ft is there you know like the the money there is there to benefit another really important cause which is credit right so you get like which one of these two against legitimate right like they're both in nft they're both a jpeg they might even be both the same jpeg uh they might even be released at the same time so like why would anyone wants to buy one over the other right and the answer basically is that like first of all if you buy coral fortress core flourish nft then like because there is this equilibrium where everyone recognizes that hey you know carlson ftf himself is legitimate and corrects nft of carl's knowledge out of it that like if you buy it you will you have a better chance of being able to resell it right that's one and then number two is that nfts are entirely built on bragging rights right like you know what he wants to actually like feel like you have this thing and you can show off this thing and like you know if you go to an ethereum party and you're like yo dog like i got satoshi's ftf credit right everyone will be like wtf mate [Music] so basically like they're these really important things right ends up kind of like so completely hinging on um a kind of social acceptance right and like these patterns of like one thing being more legitimate than others they exist everywhere right like there's uh you know even like two actively maintained um descendants of the ethereum genesis block and one has uh kind of much more legitimacy of being you know the real ethereum than the other um though of course some people in some communities disagree which is fascinating and important because it also shows how legitimacy can be kind of socially context dependent so cool so cool okay we got a good question from the audience um so do you necessarily mean public goods as in charity activities or just mean broadly as a benefit to a large group of people [Music] so charity activities i would define as like being creating benefits to other people for uh altruistic reasons like you're not being incentivized to uh to do it you're just like doing it out of the kindness of your heart or just like you know you get some feeling of passion from like being able to do something meaningful in the world and and that is um like and actually that doesn't even necessarily like that doesn't only motivate uh public goods right so like for example holding the door for someone like that's a totally private good like it's a it's a service that benefits exactly one person um but at the same time like that's an act of kindness like you could even say an act of charity that people do every day um so that but at the same time there are also public goods that get produced um incidentally um so like for example you know there's like facebook they do a whole bunch of centralized stuff but sometimes they decide that like it's important enough to create tooling for centralized stuff that they create all their their own tooling and then they open source their tooling and so you know i think what react.js got created that way right so um like basically like they do create public goods as a kind of byproduct of their like generally private good oriented activities so that's something that it happens too and then another thing that happens too is people just create public goods because they're paid to do them right like like if you are like a worker um working on building a road because the government pays you to do it right like you're not necessarily being charitable you know it's the job you're being paid um you know you could be passionate about roads and and have a kind of ethic of like the public service that you're doing or you might not be and you might be just like there to get the money but you're also creating a public good um so i guess you do need to make the distinction between like the motivate what what the motivations are of the people that are doing the thing versus kind of the privateness versus publicness of the thing that is being uh created yeah and by the way one thing that vitalik talked about a little bit earlier was that we are trying to like kind of give a business model to the public good so what that is actually doing is it is reducing the amount of charity driven public goods and increasing while maybe not reducing it but at least it's increasing the amount of non-charity driven public goods and so this is like this is clearly benefiting all of us but it is uh uh uh you know it's not about charity it's really it's it's really about paying people for the value that they're creating and and creating that really virtuous cycle um i mean i think sometimes it's a mix right so like for example there's um a lot of people who are perfectly happy to take extreme pay cuts to work on things that are in the public interest but they're not quite willing to take 100 pay cuts right like they need just enough funding that they can feel like it's a comfortable job right and so like there are totally people who like you know if there is no public goods funding at all they'll just say well you know they might work out on an open source thing for a couple of months and they'll say well screw this i mean other guys that are i'm shilling scam coins they're earning 25 million dollars off of an ico so i'm gonna go show a scam coin um but if you just crank up the public goods funding a little bit then um you know you can crank it up to the level where like these kind of not infinitely altruistic but still altruistic people you can do like act like or actually end up being empowered to and actually and have the opportunity to work on the public goods there that they were that they've always been more passionate about doing um so that's something that also exists um i think you know definitely like in an ideal world like the the like in a maximally fair world um something that uh produces um you know like a thousand units of value spread across a million people um should be renumerated exactly the same as uh something that creates a thousand units of value concentrated in one person but like in order to create that world like we just have to have like this extremely huge level of public goods funding that would just require like you know really unprecedented human coordination um so but you know while we have more limited resources like we are kind of creating second best to some extent but like you know we're still like often you know the first dollar is the dollar that counts the most right and you know like we are like you make potentially doing a huge amount of uh good by by starting by alleviating the worst parts of the problem thankfully we have a system for creating and aligning incentives anyway uh what our next our next thing so this retroactive public goods funding stuff right it still requires governance so governance is a big a big a big topic um so what would you say is like what's the high level state of the art with respect to blockchain governance hmm i would say i would say the state of the art is still not very artful um so i think there's two main kinds of blockchain governance right there's um on-chain governance and off-chain governance so off-chain governance is what uh bitcoin and ethereum used to agree on protocol changes um basically you know you have some kind of rough consensus between core developers community stakeholders and some other groups and if there's a a disagreement that's irreconcilable then like it's not a vote what happens is the system just splits in half and there's a fork i mean everyone kind of chooses their own universe um and but then on chain governance is both it's used for layer ones in cases like for example tezos and eos um and some of the other chains i think polka dot as well um i i have no idea like what like dfinity or salon or cardona or any of those do for their governance right but there are these layer ones that do on chain governance where you literally have coin voting um used in or sometimes a combination of coin voting and other kinds of mechanisms like sometimes there's indirect uh representative coin voting i mean there is like some kind of committee of delegates or whatever um and they end up like basically just voting to decide on what the protocol changes are and there's protocol changes which happen often they just happen with some delay but it's automatic right and then there are application layer projects um so things like maker dow for example that have to have on chain governance because there is just is no way to fully off chain govern um a an application layer thing if that application layer thing has what i call external capital right so what i mean by external capital is um assets that are controlled by that application that are worth real money um yeah oh sorry assets that are owned by that application are worth real money but that are not defined by that application right so like for example if someone creates a version of auger uh the the prediction market where everything happens in august in like rap tokens right so you use raptor vote on the oracle either the prediction markets are denominated in a wrap that everything is done in rep then that's something that's completely forkable because like there really is no internal capital right like the the auger defines the meaning of rep and so when you fork augur like you also you would fork rep as well right and so that basically forking doesn't mean that you're kind of leaving any assets behind whereas if you look at something like maker dell where inside of their cdp is they have actually have like eve and like i think some amount of usdc and some other assets but those are external capital because those are assets that are not defined by the baker dow protocol and so if maker dow forks um like as a result of some off-chain governance decision like that opportunity governance decision has no ability to make the if and like all the other assets contained inside of the cdps go anywhere right so that's why things like maker do need on-chain governance to the extent that they need governance at all um now in terms of what the uh kind of state of the art devon chain governance is well it could be it's usually coin voting sometimes it's going voting with a couple of extra steps but you know i've written a bunch of posts over the years about why it finds coin vote i got unimpressive so i'm also very interested in the search for alternatives what is that what's the like uh the tldr of why coin voting is like alone unimpressive um so coin voting um relies on this um a kind of concept idea that there is or that it's trying to create this kind of alignment between power and responsibility basically because every coin is a bundle of the economic interest like the the coin itself and you know what's going to happen to that points price and your ability to use that coin in the protocol um and governance rates right so you're aligning power to responsibility because you're kind of packaging together economic interests and governing rights inside of the same coin but the problem is that the financial markets and just the complex systems in general are really good at uh kind of disentangling um things that are entangled right and there's a whole bunch of ways in which governance rights and economic interests can just become completely separated from each other uh this and this can happen because of a kind of fairly explicit driving attacks but it can also happen because of like very mundane scheming and a financial market evolution um so there's a whole bunch of ways in which it can happen and once that happens then the entire link is broken right and it just becomes possible to like buy governance decisions outright and once uh that happens um then like concentrated interests just end up like totally running over um anything that's not a a concentrated interest um so it's uh like it if you kind of push the logic a couple of steps forward like it just easily falls into very not nice equilibrium nice yeah what what and and the like what is your what is the best way to like uh kind of keep the governing rights entangled or what would you do to improve that situation um i think in the long term you're going to need explicit anti-collusion technology of some kind right like so things like bc that we've been working on like basically ways to actually make it impossible for like people to credibly sell their voting rights essentially um and like this sounds difficult but with some extra assumptions it's actually cryptographically doable which is really nice um another thing that needs to be done at the same time is moving governance power into the hands of something other than coin holders but basically because like with point holders like even if you do this like even if you prevent um like vote selling at the level of like selling by the current coin holder like you can still have the exact same effect using all these financial tricks where like you just separate the coin from the economic interest in the coin right and if you move governance a away to in um so that the the resource that's like doing the governing is something non-fungible like some notion of like unique identities for example um then you end up alleviating that problem nice so uh what is we have another question from the the audience what would be the best governance model futuristic favorite the ultimate what is the ultimate governance model ai dictatorship um yes um no i think um like i am no ultimately i think the yeah like there is no like a perfect model the answer can only come through experimentation um and like experimentation is ultimately what the crypto space is all about can we learn good things from history about uh exactly like you know some government governance experiments um um so we could definitely learn from the decade of crypto history that we've had so far um so if like in one of my earlier blog posts um i had my yeah like the the criticisms of eos governance right where you actually showed how like it actually did very quickly settle into this plutocratic equilibrium where you had these really large holders that were just bribing each other to make decisions that were vote uh voting for each other to be eos delegates and like that led to this the kind of the governance collapsing pretty quickly um another example was that whole steam hive situation right where justin's son ended up like basically like talking to exchanges and using coins on it from exchanges in order to cement his control over an ecosystem um at least until that that got resolved by high forking away into being their own thing um so there's like there have definitely been historical examples of uh coin governance going wrong in various ways um even in the absence of attackers um i think uh though what we've seen things like you know low participation rates um generally low quality of uh in of decision making out but in a lot of cases just uh because i'm like you know you're spreading out the decision-making power so thinly that you get a kind of tragedy over the comments and figuring out what the right decision is um so these things have all happened in like various corners of downland and it's definitely important to keep them all in mind nice um in 2015 i kind of i i made this decision that i wanted to basically spend the rest of my life working for daos um and i think i've mostly succeeded in this depending on your interpretations um but i'm just kind of curious like what do you expect uh the role of dao's to play in our everyday lives you know maybe not everyone's everyday life but like you know it seems more and more people are being directly impacted by doubts so anyone who's ever used a dye has used a stable coin that's managed by endow um i mean anyone who's ever used rye like you you could probably could call the governance gadget for that uh or is the oracle gadget for that of dao as well um there's uh definitely an increasing number of people working for dows directly or indirectly so bitcoin is slowly gallifying for example and so but everyone who works for a uh or it gets paid out of uh quadratic funding pools um a lot of them are going to end up like ultimately being being paid by dowser of some kind um once you start like you're thinking of protocols as being dowsed then um you know lots of people are going to end up being just paid by things that are by revenue that ultimately comes from application fees of some kind um dallas are going to provide an increasing number of services um so um claros you could call that a dow and clarosa is kind of the ultimate uh dispute resolution mechanism for proof of humanity um and so anyone who is uh going to be getting a crypto ubi in the future is gonna have multiple dowels or like you know an entire supply chain of these doubts talking to each other and like serving as the economic backup for each other to thank for their um ability to get that ubi um so there is yeah i think like most things in the the crypto verse are going to like have uh you know some some portion of uh their stuff made in dallas oh man it's going to be exciting but what what uh like what would be what are the big what is the big failure mode or are there any things that you're afraid of with uh like this increasing dowification of everything um i'm definitely afraid of bad governance mechanisms becoming entrenched um so coin voting is a big example right of a a mechanism that i think right now has more legitimacy than it deserves to um i think because coin voting just is more correct like it is incredibly neutral right um so there's like there's that and like there hasn't really been any efforts to try to come up with any legitimate alternative um and one of the other problems with point voting also is that like i think the main reason why a lot of the existing coin voting based projects have not been attacked or broken yet is because their coin holdings are actually pretty centralized right and one of the ironies of bad governance mechanisms is that bad governance mechanisms tend to get more secure the more centralized they are uh because like if you go down to having a very small number of participants then like you know the facts that the participants all know each other and they're all buddy buddy with each other and you know they're not really gonna do look one of them is really not going to do anything that'll compromise their ability to like have their beer or their iced coffee or whatever with the other participants um so like the more you get into a kind of like very tiny um you know super wealthy old voice squeak world the more like the the more resistant it is to attacks for that reason but that's not a healthy equilibrium right because like we're just going right back to a small clique and often you get a clique that's uh eat like less confidence than the creek that you would get if you just explicitly install the technocracy right because like these are like like these people are not a technocracy they're a moneyocracy and they're like they've been selected into their position by their um ability to get money um so that's uh like there are definitely our failure modes that arise from that sort of thing um so how to avoid both of those well i mean that's part of like what this whole conversation is trying to be about indeed well uh extending even past this conversation so uh you know at optimism we're trying to figure out we're doing this red track to public goods funding stuff we are you know taking our sequence of profits to to pay for retroactive public goods and we're going to be doing some governance experiments um to figure out who we are actually paying um in the very near term so uh what what kinds of things would you like to see tested or if you know kind of what kinds of uh information would you like to learn about ways that we can kind of determine this retroactive public goods funding in these various governance experiments that we that we're uh going to run um i mean testing like governance mechanisms that are not coin voting is definitely something that's really important um otherwise i guess uh just like letting the governance run and seeing what decisions it makes right like one of their other nice things about retroactive funding is that they can just start making decisions immediately because like you don't have to apply for retroactive public good spending right well you can make a system where you have an application form but then you know people can just apply other people into the mechanism and like i think that's something that should happen um so like they can basically just like start going around and saying like hey here's a listed address of something that's provided um some value to the community let's just go and give them a nice surprise um so that that's so one of the things i'm excited about and you should be able to actually get some feedback fairly quickly so exciting all right well um should okay real one question should daos phoned public goods yes okay great um okay so now for some miscellaneous questions these should hopefully be fun um first uh what is the importance of quote fun in mechanism design you've said this to me a couple times um that it's you know it's actually an underrated part of mechanism design fun yeah and i think uh you know people are more likely to enthusiastically participate in these in these mechanisms and like keep coming back to participate if the mechanisms are fun to participate in right like if the mechanism some you know there's there's fun and the participation there's fun and just like seeing what the results of everyone's participation put together um certain ads turned out to be uh in kind of watching the discussion that comes to the results that are being made like the more that these things can be made into something that people actually want to follow and engage in the more that they can actually not just to do public arts funding but also like even just be a community building tool cool yeah that is uh i definitely underrated uh underrated thing um okay so now as a kind of end user i feel like we're actually always working towards like building a better internet but i'm i just kind of i'm curious like in your mind as an end user like what is the way that our interactions with the internet will change if crypto is successful [Music] so yeah it's a good question um i feel like crypto is um the way that crypto is going to succeed if it succeeds is um it's not going to kind of warm its way into existing services so much as there will be entirely new things that get created um and those new things that get created are just going to be crypto native right so like for example you know if this metaverse thing actually comes to fruition and we see some kind of you know decentralized world with objects that get to talk to that can talk to each other like that's something like that can all kind of happen on the blockchain and you know your ethereum wallet may well just be the way that you and end up interacting with that um if daos are going to be responsible for like giving everyone a crypto ubi then you know you're going to be using an ethereum wallet to kind of sign up and actually actually receive those tokens um and uh you know submit your profile and like you get it proof of humanity verified or whatever um if uh there's uh like a adele that's being used to create like you know um some like stable coin or some d5 or just any other financial thing then you know once again like an ethereum wallet or you know some what this will be something that you actually use to like interact for you and hold your coins um your identity will like instead of being you know signing on facebook and sign in with twitter it can just be like sign in with your crypto account um so like i think there will be a lot of these different kind of different little things um the differences between the crypto native things and the kind of centralized things that came before is that crypto native things will tend to emphasize interoperability much more and still like the centralized world i think really selects for building empires and the problem with building empires is that everyone wants to be the empire and so they end up really competing with each other but the crypto world i think is going like the winners will be the projects that focus on building tools how to do one thing do one thing well and build something that interacts with everything else right so like the unix philosophy except the unix philosophy is stretching out across an entire community and um you know controlling money and controlling pictures of monkeys and rocks so i mean okay fine i guess like the unix shell can technically control pictures of monkeys and rocks too but you know they're not worth 3.4 million dollars um so yeah i mean you know what whatever this uh the the fun stuff is that the yeah the brave new crypto enabled meta world uh creates the i think blockchains are going to be a huge part of it so fun so i had one of my new one of my favorite ideas recently has been that uh crypto is kind of creating a social network like what we're doing is you know crypto not just crypto and also retroactive public goods funding it's kind of like you know forming this this basis for social interaction so maybe one one bit of social interaction is like can crypto help like fight misinformation or like you know make sure that good you know valuable things get surfaced to to us as we scroll through twitter um i mean just use risk factor public goods funding for that right like you just you know like yeah you just like to give retroactive likes to like say yeah you know tweets that actually still look good a year in the future and uh yeah hopefully that like if you kind of design social media in a way that has the incentives right then um you know you should be able to hopefully um get push people so they start optimizing their behavior around that instead of optimizing around like you know immediate engagement in your ability to get like 500 outrage clicks before it turns out the thing that you retweeted is actually completely false um great retract to public goods funding solves everything this is fresh off the press um but um okay uh do you oh yeah here here's some here's some fun ones um okay so is tech is technology fundamentally empowering humans or are we like losing control hmm i definitely think that we're still far from losing control right now um i mean what what's the scenario where we always control the scenario where we lose control like the most obvious one of course is the uh unfriendly ai apocalypse right we're just creating ai and you know we tell it to cure cancer but the ai realizes that the best way to cure cancer is to just turn us all into paper clips um that's the sort of uh like that's one way in which we might lose control um another way in which we might lose control is um you know if offensive technology becomes um like it progresses much more quickly than defensive technology and you get these kind of one of these multi-polar traps where but just the number of groups that's capable of completely breaking civilization keeps on going up and up until eventually one of them does it um i think like the only fix to that sort of thing ultimately is to just like create more defensive technology right and like i i think crypto is defensive technology like crypto is a way of building infrastructure um so that you know even a high school noob can build an application that has like extremely high grade resistance against dos attacks that's just something that you fundamentally cannot do in the centralized world um so [Music] i i agree keep going i'm not sure if i have anything more like smart to say on that particular question like right well i definitely agree i do think that crypto is you know really creating our you know humanity in some ways or captivating cultivating our humanity um okay some more questions very important will we survive the heat death of the universe interesting um i would say 50 yes okay great great great um are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future of humanity um i would say optimistic um i think yay um [Music] things that we could be optimistic about and i think um there's like the kind of scientific and technology stagnation of the last couple of decades seems like it's coming to an end and we're really starting kind of the next great wish cycle of uh you know rapid advances and awesome stuff and if you just uh like think about the difference between a computer in 1950 and a computer in 2020 like that's the difference i'm expecting between um anti-aging technology in 2020 and anti-aging technology in 2090 um so that's uh ends of the difference i'm expecting you know between the tech technologies and a whole bunch of industries right um so you know if by the end of the of the century we're all just going to be you know 150 year old um immortals um hanging out on mars and making um backup copies of ourselves in these in the decentralized cloud and like everyone's in you know post-scarcity of luxury communities communism happy utopia then uh that's like yeah but you know we've done it i feel like uh i mean i think like there's definitely headwinds right like there's uh kind of short-term headwinds just in terms of like you know world politics becoming massively less cooperative than it was 10 years ago for example but like ultimately i feel like those are things that humanity can get past um so well i'm glad you're optimistic very very glad well and we also happen to be talking to a bunch of people who are about to do some great hacks and those hacks are going to all save humanity um and so what what uh what advice do you have for for these uh these these hackers and um are there any projects that you're you know particularly interested in you know the classic questions they're a hackathon yes so one very important category for me actually is a cross-layer two bridging infrastructure um so like right now is like exactly the time when the ethereum layer 2 ecosystem is really kind of coming into its own and but moving from being theory to be like something that exists in practice and and in order for the layer 2 ecosystem to work well like it has to be able to work across the different layer tubes right like you can't go from you know being ethereum to having five different silos that don't talk to each other and in order to avoid that world there need to be ways to move assets between the roll-ups um so that includes uh definitely tokens like any kind of token it also includes nfts um i made a proposal for a way to move uh nfcs between roll-ups quickly and so that would be like one example of something that someone could just implement um you actually could even use that exact proposal to implement a dex for moving tokens around interestingly enough um but that's a yeah kind of a harder challenge um but just like yeah making kind of cross-roll-up bridging infrastructure that is decentralized and that does not require the user to either wait a week or touch the base chain is the the holy grail here so whatever you come up with and whatever you biddle is uh greater what what was uh yes plus one by the way just i mean i'm i'm clearly a bit of a roll-up stan um so uh yeah plus one please please build these uh crossbow bridges um so uh what like what advice do you have for these you know hackers building their projects fulfilling their dreams like you you clearly did a bit of a hack and your hack seems to be relatively successful so you might actually have a bit of advice for people who want to create bitcoin magazine um the bitcoin magazines of the future i think good the important thing is to just um you know not give up after a weekend to just like keep going and like you know if there's a project that you're passionate about kind of start building out your community and like actually persist and keep doing it for a year keep doing it for two years um and you know if you keep on persisting long enough then eventually like your project will kind of make it into the ethereum public consciousness and like you'll have made it um it's yeah yeah persistence is important nice nice and you seem to persist and uh be ever optimistic and full of uh full of ideas how do you do it i don't know how you do it if you're gonna answer right okay if you were going to answer iced coffee then that's not really transferable because um my tea lately has all been decaf um but yeah no i know even without caffeine you can still be optimistic like you just you know look at the world and uh you know don't look at the at the the doom or voices uh kind of interpretation of the world and just like see the all the actually existing bright stuff that's that's that's beautiful okay and i will say okay the the the way that i would that i would do the uh optimistic and persistence thing is uh visualize what the future is going to be be excited be curious and not take things too seriously because really i mean you know i mean it's it all really like matters but it also like you know it doesn't matter that bad that much so just don't take two things too seriously enjoy go with the flow you know listen to what other people say because you definitely don't know the right things um you know that's that's real that's really the move to be honest with you yeah just go with the flow because you don't know and that's the way to grow i mean to move away from poe uh yes and also have many freestyle sessions uh walking around uh uh various neighborhoods so but these are all these are all great questions okay so i have one final question it's the most important question of all that we have asked so far everyone's been wondering since we started this you know you don't have to tell me you don't have to send the question i knew you had it uh the price of eth will be 30 000 but i'm not going to tell you what currency that's denominated though it's not what i meant to mention it'll be 30 000 but i don't know what currency that's the joke no did i screw up the joke no i screwed up the joke oh no no no i don't i don't know what the price of you will be it will be 30 000 something it could easily be venezuelan boulevards um okay okay well that was the other question you you already intuited how did you know um but for our final question uh what's up [Music] ceiling hey thanks y'all um good luck hacking uh and um shout out to youth global all my peeps at youth global um that was a lot of fun vitalik that was indeed a lot of fun and uh i'm sure we'll would other talk sometime about our freestyle rap session so uh can't wait for that one um thank you so much uh glad that you were able to talk about this thing and and make this work and um yeah i mean i learned a lot of cool things and uh i'm glad that we were able to cover not only just retroactive funding but also all the other things in life that are important or maybe not important so this is great thank you thank you amazing thanks perfect all right so we are ready to move on to our next piece which is me talking about all the prizes uh for this hackathon i'll quickly go back to just our slides here i hope you enjoyed the conversation with carl and vitalik uh they'll be doing a few more talks over the next few summits so uh if you're interested in keeping up with everything that's happening in that world and what's happening with ethereum and scalability you'll be able to see them again so moving on to our prizes and our sponsors i want to start off by thanking a few of our sponsors um so i want to specifically say thank you to avid grants program sublime finance balancer compound grants program scale ethercard skynet unisoft grants program superfluid finance morales and variable protocol they are some incredible sponsors that are going to be a big part of this event and to really kind of tell you about why they're excited to be part of eat online and and why they're excited to be here as a sponsor giving up prizes we asked them to record a short video to talk about who they are what they represent and what is it that they do and why they want to be helpful to all of you so we're going to play those videos for you here and then after that we'll get into all the prizes that you can win as part of the hackathon and then we'll close off the day and without further ado let's check out some of our sponsor videos from the uh other protocols uh genesis team so we are the team that built the other protocol and and gave the protocol to the community ownership and uh so excited to be here in in this hackathon participating uh and being able to judge different projects here and uh to give some context what ab is so ave is a our protocol is a decentralized interest rate market where you can come and deposit different kinds of cryptographic assets and see those assets grow in terms of interest rate in in form of balance and your deposit also uh acts as a collateral in the protocol meaning that once you deposit into the protocol you can actually borrow other assets from the protocol or you can delegate that borrowing power uh to someone else and uh as a protocol the the market consists of different kinds of assets that you can use and and the protocol is deployed on the main ethereum network and also uh test nets uh such as the common test net and also in the matic network so if you're building on automatic or or the mainnet or covan desnet this is very interesting uh proposition for you to test the cross chain operability especially if you have some sort of a hack in mind that could empower both of these communities and uh anyone who is participating uh should also mind that uh we as a team are here to support you and and the other grounds style as well and there's various prices that you can actually uh win during this hackathon and and so once the prices are for example for the best uh pack you will get 7 000 usdc and for the second price you get three thousand and thirty two thousand there's various things you can actually build on top of the protocol itself and we'll go more into detail in that or you can ask any questions uh in in the uh discord happy to be here and thank you everyone hey guys this is fernando from bouncer it's really cool to see you guys participating in youth global we're very excited with these hackathons we're a long-time partner of this global we really see lots of cool projects and protocols ideas coming out of these hackathons so what what is balancer balancer is a protocol for programmable liquidity rv1 was all about index funds so you could provide liquidity with different weights uh of different tokens instead of just two tokens 50 50 you could have 30 eth 20 die and 50 nkr for example and that was really a proof of concept we talked to a lot of teams who actually forked balance survey one like um idaho and power pool and ocean protocol and we realized that we could do a lot better and that's balance survey 2. metal server 2 allows for and it's two very interesting features i would uh stress here or that stand out one is that you can have pools with customized logic so you can create your own amm you only you have to define the swap functions and and that's it so you focus on what matters which is what type of amm you want to provide or you want to have the second nice feature is asset managers so you have full control of the underlying tokens of your pool so you can use them to vote or to do whatever you want so i'm excited to see you guys building cool stuff on top of balancer v2 please use battle survey 2 not battle survey1 and we'll be answering questions and talking to you throughout the hackathon um see you on discord or any other channels that you might prefer but yeah we'll be on discord see you soon and happy coding bye bye hi everyone i'm adam from compound i'm here to help you out with your development related projects compound grants is sponsoring eath online once again and we're really excited to see what you all build in the hackathon for those that aren't familiar compound is an interest rate protocol suppliers of crypto assets will earn interest on their tokens and also you can borrow from the protocol if you want to borrow a different crypto asset prices this year for compound grants are the best use case of supplying the most original use case of borrowing as well and also the best open source interface for compound compound grants is an awesome opportunity to upgrade the protocol and also get paid for your efforts you can apply for a grant at compoundgrants.org i'll be presenting a workshop shortly to get you started on your hackathon projects so a little bit of an introduction to compound from a developer's point of view in october we'll be doing a one day summit that is all compound-centric so you can learn about compound on that action-packed day please ask questions in discord i'll get back to you as soon as i can with answers and happy hacking and we're excited to see you again soon hello this is andres kristoff ethercards is a platform for anybody with a community to grow engage and monetize that community among the many tools that we have in order to achieve these engagements are traits traits are features and functions that make sense in the context of the given community and provide value to both the owners of the cards and the person or entity who issues those cards these are the cards that were created for the cards community as you can see these cards have a lot of dynamic features for example you can turn them around and see the layered art on the other side when you use the same platform and issue your own card you can define your own art and your own layer sets but more importantly these cards have traits for example the reforest rate enables you to reroll your layers and get a different layer set created by different artists if you have an art drop trait you it's a passive trade that lets you receive nfts from different artists that you are using the platform among other things you can have a punk battle ticket which is a ticket that enables you to enter an online gaming event and win valuable prices but different partners of ours are using the system in different ways with different trades for example dirty robot is issuing cards with the print rate which is a reading trade by burning this trade you can redeem a physical copy signed by the artist itself or mike tyson used our technology to issue traits on his nfts and one of the nft has a trait that enables you to meet mike tyson or steve aukey the the musician and artist created a trait with our platform that enables you to use a previous steven knft to redeem a new one that he created in the platform so traits can be used in many ways we have a twelve thousand dollar prize pool for you to create innovative trades that make sense for you for your project and for your community and to optimize the data storage in our smart contracts thank you good luck and have fun hey guys this is ivan from morales and i'm here to explain to you how our platform can make you a better web developer and how you can win this hackathon if you adopt this technology now for this hackathon i'm sure you have a lot of ideas maybe you want to build some kind of nfc that maybe you want to build some kind of defied up or cross-chained up whatever idea you have you need to do the following things you need to log in a user you need to fetch the balances you need to face transactions of the user you need to be able to watch blockchain for real-time alerts in smart contracts to watch events and topics and all of this you normally do by connecting to an rpc node and then building a behemoth of infrastructure around it and everyone has to do it and this is your biggest mistake because this border plate infrastructure you don't have to build from scratch we give it to you instead of you verifying the signature when the user logs in we give it to instead of you syncing user transactions from the blockchain we give it to instead of you maintaining and managing this huge infrastructure we manage it for you because you should never be building your dap like this this is very very low level programming you're speaking directly to an rpc node and rpc node will really ensure that you build slowly you cannot move fast so morales sdk and morale server gives you a crypto backend with everything figured out it can be thought of as firebase for crypto because you log in the user with one line of code and then as soon as the user logs in in your morales account you see all the information about the user like here in the database this is cross chain by the way if the user is active on any chain you have all of their tokens all of their nfts all of their smart contracts that they interact with everything everything everything you have here this database auto updates in real time so when the user moves their assets you get real-time updates real-time reflection in the database you can query the database with an easy sdk you can read the database using your own queries you can do filtering you can do aggregation you can watch smart contracts so instead of doing some kind of sap graph you can just tell morales hey watch this smart contract and morales will give you database entries whenever a new event happens in the smart contract and you get all historical smart contract events you can send assets you can receive assets with a few lines of code we have plugins which means that with one of code you can get a fiat on-ramp into your dap with one line of code you can swap any asset to any other asset using for example our inch integration we're going to add bridging between different chains we're going to add staking modules all in all opportunities are endless and most importantly you don't have to build this back end we give you the backend morales is your crypto backend think of it as firebase of crypto where you just use a simple javascript sdk everything is figured out for you hey everyone my name is eric arsenault from wearable protocol uh super pumped to be here at youth online today i'm going to talk about the protocol so the variable protocol is a set of smart contracts as well as an open source mixer currently deployed on ethereum really soon on flow and polygon applications can use these tools to get up and running really quickly there's about 20 applications currently building on a protocol and a lot more in the pipeline some of the features that we have include a decentralized exchange obviously for nfts for swapping tokens with erc20s the protocol itself has a shared order book so all the applications building on the protocol benefit from the other applications that are building on top you can list an item for sale in one app and it can sell in another app and and everybody benefits in that process there's fee splitting in the protocol to allow different apps to monetize um in that process lazy minting to allow really easy onboarding there's a royalty standard which can which works for externally minted entities as well and there's collection of factories to mint uh new collections of 1155 and 721 tokens some use cases include nft marketplaces selling nfts from basically any interface minting applications that just focus on the minting and then as well as nft discovery and analytics applications as well using the indexer as well as all sorts of new ways to use own and sell on fts in terms of prizes we have twelve thousand dollars in prizes uh we have one prize for the the best lazy minting application another prize for the best application that natively sells an nfts within the interface and takes a feast split out of that process and then another prize for gamified or game-based nft applications thanks a lot for listening and happy i'm hacking holler i'm the ceo of scl labs very very excited to be here today uh and i love these three hackathons i think this is the 10th hackathon scale has supported and we have over 100 submissions uh we love this we live for it um for those of you this is your first time hacking welcome for those of you who've done it a number of times pleasure to see you i wish you could be in person uh like it normally is but hey these only hackathons advantages too more time to build more time to plan and uh more fun so uh let's get it off here scale is an ethereum native multi-chain network what does this mean instead of cld one blockchain cl is one network with pool security as many many blockchains they're all evm watchings okay um now what scale is not is skill is not a single independent sidechain ccl is a multi-chain network where there's pool security properties a lot of the issues with sidechains are mitigated because of the fact that ethereum is supporting a multi-chain network in terms of being able to have collusion and bribery prevention by random assignments of nodes and rotation of nodes throughout the scale network throughout the different chains and that's again thanks to 400 billion dollars of value in ethereum that protects and ensures that there cannot be collision properties in terms of getting malicious nodes onto one chain so what we have then is a multi-chain network that allows for that can grow in a limitless fashion and help ethereum drive value and the other piece of the scale is not a competitive product or theorem scales actually value the creative and allows the theory to capture value every time the scale network is used so if you want to you say oh guess what your big gases are theorem this is very different than other layer one ether chains that are trying to just suck value out of ethereum and let transactions run on there on their blockchain see how you always have to pay ethereum in order to run scale and you always have to and that means staking slashing no designs node rotation chain setup etc and the token even is built on ethereum scale cannot run without ethereum and scale helps bring value back to ethereum and it pays and almost a decentralized revenue share model which is a new business model that's very exciting uh scale also can support billions of daily active users now doing that today no but at some point do are we going to need that i believe so and uh in order to get there you need economics that allow many many blockchains to keep growing while not having security issues by having smaller sets of node operators and that's the skill functions where as the network is overloaded uh the fees for chains go up and more knows kind of the network and it drives the price back down so scale allows is able to grow and handle supply and every time it's doing that it's sending money back to ethereum because you need to pay attention scale all right so our goal is to help the theory be successful and um and number one help developers be successful that are building blockchain applications and smart contract applications uh we're really excited about the scale nft net that's happening uh our nft launch so you'll be able to make entities directly on scale chain starting in october um this is due to scale file storage the uh there's a container docker container on every single skill chain and what this means is you don't need to link to another database a ipfs gateway or you know centralized storage to store images that metadata that that data gets right on the chain all right so let's type what prices uh hey we've got uh twelve thousand dollars in prices given to five projects uh also anybody who hacks will have the ability to access the scale store and get some trying all right let's have some fun all right everybody hi everyone i'm retired from sublime and we're super excited to be one of the many amazing protocols supporting the et online hackathon this year so what are sublime sublime is a decentralized protocol enabling credit by collateralizing social capital conversations around under collateralization so far have mainly focused on centralized credit scoring but credit scoring is hard it's extremely data intensive tala for example a fintech platform used in africa uses thousands of different data points with features ranging from simple ones such as your age to less intuitive ones such as the number of typing mistakes made or the amount of time spent reading terms of conditions to actually build a credit rating it's exclusionary and there simply isn't a one-size-fits-all solution different jurisdictions and in fact different categories of loans have entirely different approaches in fact 67 of the world's adult population is not even covered by a credit bureau however this does not mean that they have never borrowed money in their life they've just relied on different means of credit mainly focusing on their friends family members and trusted circles loans in such cases are majorly collateralized by reputation rather than any tangible inventory of assets with sublime we're trying to take this idea to the next step connecting users across different social graphs to enable the free flow of credit we envision a social graph to encompass different kinds of stakeholders whether it's dows their community members consumers institutions or even pseudonymous identities whenever there's need for loans we aim to provide the most capital efficient path to fulfill that loan request even from lenders the borrower might not be directly connected to so how does sublime work we rely on four flexible building blocks to achieve this providing the means for verification pools and correct lines to enable the loans and a savings account to park any idle capital architecture is open and flexible so that users can build products on top of us that suit their specific needs whether it's issuing bonds for dows credit lines for institutions or structured products like close and cdos so we lastly beginning our private alpha starting next week and we couldn't have imagined of a better way to start off than working with this amazing developer community that the event will be bringing together we've also sponsored a bunch of different prices so we really look forward to interacting with all of you over the next month thanks hello everyone my name is francesco and one of the founders of superfluid and i'm very excited to welcome you to ethonline it's going to be an amazing event now what is superfluid superfluid is a decentralized protocol for money streaming which is a crypto native way of doing recurring payments which enables things like salaries uh subscriptions but also dow rewards and it enables all of this without capital lock up and with programmability which is very important because it means you can build very cool applications so what is money streaming it's this uh it's this way of transferring funds from one account to another over time without requiring uh intermediate transactions so basically you set up a stream and then as soon as it's set up money starts flowing from your account to the counterparty without you needing to have do anything else and it doesn't have an end date so it will go on forever or until you close it or run out of funds so using money streaming and d5 you can build real-time finance so these are applications that use money every second in a completely new way so these are free examples of applications that you can build using superfluid they're all live they've all been built at hackathons just like this one and i'm showing you this to encourage you to think of this as the first step of your career in webfree if you build something amazing here we will support you afterwards until you go live just like these guys did if you want to check out superfluid you can go to our dashboard so app.superfluid.finance this is a dashboard which enables you to open streams and you'll be able to understand what money streaming really means so for the hackathon we have twelve thousand dollars in bounties these are five uh main prizes a four thousand dollar prize pool to everybody building on superfluid and on top of this we also have eight thousand dollars from maker dao for anyone using die in their hack so looking forward to see everybody at our discord and uh good luck with your hacks hello my name is david vorik ceo of skynet labs what makes web3 amazing is decentralization with web3 we can build untouchable uncorruptable user applications unfortunately this control frequently extends only as far as the blockchain users still access their smart contracts through centralized front-ends where they are exposed to malicious attackers and evil developers even where the developers are trustworthy the developers are frequently compelled by regulators to hide and block certain assets with home screen we can help eliminate this point of control and ensure that the user is the one who has the final say here's how it works you go to home screen you make a skynet account and then you install all of your favorite applications when you install an application to home screen home screen will perform a download that fetches all of the code all of the assets and all of the resources for that application and stores them in your personal decentralized cloud in the future that application loads directly from your decentralized cloud storage without any centralized middlemen and without any interaction from developers regulators or malicious attackers home screen even supports versioning there's an update for your favorite application you can have home screen perform an update by fetching all of the new assets and new code if you decide later that you don't like the update you can go into home screen and download to your favorite previous version with home screen the user is truly in control that's why we've created a ten thousand dollar prize pool that will be split between all of the applications that add support for home screen throughout the hackathon we've also added a two thousand dollar grand prize for the best home screen application supporting home screen is easy even beginners can add support with less than an hour of effort we'll be available throughout the hackathon to answer any questions about home screen and to talk about skynet in general you can find us on the eath global discord channel we're super excited to be involved in this hackathon and we can't wait to see what everyone builds hey guys boris from unisoft grand program here first off i'd like to introduce students for grant program and units for protocol units for grant program is a grant program established by the units of governance and our goal is to provide valuable resources to help grow the uniform ecosystem sponsoring hackathons is just one of the ways we aim to do so and we are very grateful to the global team for organizing this great event if you are unfamiliar with uniswap it is an amm decentralized exchange built on ethereum there are three major versions deployed on the ethereum mainnet and there are also units of v3 deployments on optimism in arbitrary which are getting a lot of traction lately in essence there are two types of users in unison protocol traders and liquidity providers liquidity providers lock up their liquidity in pools and earn fees on each trade executed by traders as for the challenges we prepared for this hackathon there are three categories in the first category we're looking for the best hack that integrates a project which is part of the units of grant program list of all such projects can be found in our hacker guide there you can find different libraries sdks and similar projects that we think will be great help in building something of your own in the second category we're looking for hacks that improve uniswop's user experience often we can see people complaining about the d5 user experience especially if they are still not used to the default space unislop at one point had over 1 million active users within a month and they want to make their experience while interacting with uniswap more enjoyable in this category you can for example fork the web app built by uni-swap core team and add more information for traders or rework the process of adding liquidity to uniswap third and final category is any hack that is uniswap related we don't want to limit your creativeness and are looking forward to see what you come up with happy hacking and if you have any questions we'll be in the eath global discord we will give our best to provide all the answers amazing well i want to thank all of our sponsors who took a few minutes to talk about who they are what they do and why they're excited to be part of eat online and with that let's get into talking about all of our prizes and thanking some of our other sponsors i want to quickly thank our pillar sponsors we have alchemy one inch 88 mph bitco enzyme chain link eat block guard fluence para swap the pocket network there's a polygon zero x file coin black peer radical maker dao the graph conjurer um there are our pillar sponsors and when i also quickly thank our provider sponsors by economy covalent ens metas nft port new cipher reflexer color textile umbrella uma urine finance dx style swivel finance zora status and polap and lastly our supporter sponsors we have aztec coin spec charge particles chain safe zk tube near protocol lemnis cap block daemon quant stamp and maple finance so let's talk about all the prizes so similar to the videos that we talked about we also compiled a video of all of our prizes uh that are going to be announced by the sponsors themselves so we'll play all the videos so you can see every sponsor prize that's listed here for this event and without further ado these are all the companies are going to be talking about the price that they're giving out for this event so three three top three projects on the uh uh other protocol side are able to win from the other grand style uh three different kinds of prices so the first main price of the winner of the uh protocol usage will get seven thousand dollars worth of uh usdse and the second one will get three thousand worth of usdc and third two thousand for the usdsc and those are there's different examples with uh imran is going from the other ground style going to elaborate more and and yeah thank you sonny uh so there are three areas of focus for ave in order for ave to grow to the next billion users the first is looking for integrations startups are looking to integrate with uh ave as a protocol and building on top of ave the second is really understanding growth and understanding what are some of the tools that users need so things like uh credit delegation dashboard or thinking about bringing real world assets into ave or ave pro and then finally it's uh bringing more analytics and tooling to to ave and its users so things like being able to uh build out ave transaction explorer is something that we're looking deeply into um and these are the the three areas of focus for us please ping any of the ave team members and we can give you more details on the types of startups we'd like to support thank you so much thank you everyone hey guys this is fernando i'm happy to announce balancers prizes to the finalists so we're going to give out two prizes one is eight thousand dollars and the second one is four thousand dollars for the first and second places and the cool thing is that this is just the beginning you can get uh you can apply for grant with the grants committee that we have which is community led you can apply for a grant and get up to 75 000 this would be a nice push for you to start a business or really take your project to the next level and make something out of it so the prizes are only the the beginning and we want you to apply for grants and make businesses out of your core ideas thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hi i'm larry and i'm the program lead for the compound grants program if you haven't heard of us compound grants program is an independent community-led program that really exists to fund development happening on top of compound we funded dozens of grants in the last few months and we plan to fund dozens if not hundreds more over the coming months and years we're really excited about partnering with ethonline and as part of that we've got four prizes we want to tell you about the first prize goes to the most innovative use of supplying assets to compound and the price there is three thousand dollars the second goes to the most innovative use of borrowing assets from compound and that's also a price of three thousand dollars the third prize goes to the most beautiful and full-featured open source interface of compound the price there is also three thousand dollars and then finally the fourth prize is a prize pool for everyone else who's building on top of compound and that's three thousand dollars we can't wait to see what you'll build good luck hey guys this is ivan from morales and i'm here to tell you about our prize pool we have one of the biggest prize posts in this hackathon so listen carefully if you use morales you can win seven thousand dollars if you build the best dap using morales if you build second best app using morales you get three thousand and third place gets two thousand and we are judging based on usability based on innovation and based on morales utilization how much of the power of moralities have you actually used and to learn that you can go to docs.morales.com once again docs.morales.com you can see it here in the url and you can go through documentation step by step we have very good documentation as you can see with code examples with images with videos we even have cookbook right here if you want to have a fiat integration you click here if you want to build token swap you build here really go through this understand what morales is and i hope that you will win good luck hey everybody i'm from future here to talk to you about the wearable protocols nfts are going mainstream if you haven't noticed so get with the picture there's a lot of cool stuff you can do the wearable protocol makes it very easy to build applications and different tools you might want to use check out wearable.org to get some ideas there's twelve thousand dollars in prizes in this hackathon best lazy minting application best application that sells nfcs within the app with a v-split and best gamified for game-based nst application social applications are a huge plus as well happy hacking and see you in the discord everybody uh we're gonna cover the the scale prizes for the hackathon so um number one we're here to support you throughout the entire event uh number two uh build something cool and we have a prize for you we love also highlighting our prize winners and pushing those out to uh the scale blog and and and twit our twitter followers uh and you know we appreciate the work you do and and we're here to support so number one we've got twelve thousand dollars in scale given to five projects we've got a denali prize kilimanjaro prize a fuji prize also an nft prize so um uh the nft prize uh as you may have heard you can mix nfts directly on a scale chain through scale file storage there's no need to link to an external ipfs gateway or centralized storage facility to hold the metadata of an nft so we'd love to see some cool stuff happening there that's obviously a booming market we also have an integration partner hack where we're giving 2 500 worth of scale to somebody who builds on ethereum scale and another partner okay every team that builds even if you don't win uh you have ability to get uh free swag so you'll you'll get a credit to the store that's linked below um you also see uh the developer portal uh linked below we and you can get all those assets through discord um all right hey let's have some fun let's build cool stuff let's change the world all right everybody good luck hi everyone i'm ritik from sublime we are super excited to be supporting the ethon and hackathon this year and working with all of you sublime is a decentralized protocol aimed at democratizing access to capital we provide the frameworks for others to build that products which we asserts by the on-chain social graph for credit fully customizable bonds or structured products like collateralized loan obligations are some other things that can be built using sublime for this event we are sponsoring the following prices our first place price will be 4000 usdc and our second and third place price will be 2 500 and 1 500 usdc respectively additionally we'll also be sponsoring a pool price of 4000 usdc to be distributed amongst all the submissions under the sublime category docs the sublime.finance is the best place to get started with us our team will also be available in a space on the ethonline discord group as well as our own channel we are looking forward to seeing what you guys spend over the next month thanks hello i am daniel helm dev evangelist of skynet labs where we believe the d web needs decentralized front ends we are putting up twelve thousand dollars in psi coins because define needs decentralized front ends join the ten thousand dollar prize pool by spending under an hour to deploy your project to skynet and use home screen to let your users store versioned copies of your front end why because web3 users need decentralized front ends you could win two thousand dollars if you have the best home screen build that shows why dapps need decentralized front ends so tack skynet and home screen onto your project scope and find me in the discord to learn more about decentralized front ends on skynet with home screen support hello everyone i'm francesco one of the founders of superfluid and i'm super excited to invite you to eat online so superfluid is a platform for money streaming we enable a way to do recurring payments in webfree without capital lockup and with full programmability which means you can build anything you want visit hack.superfluid.finance for more information and hacking materials for this hackathon we will be providing twelve thousand dollars in bounties these will be divided into five uh top prizes plus a price pool of four thousand dollars for everyone building on superfluid on top of this maker dial is putting up eight thousand dollars for anyone using die in their hacks so get hacking and join us in discord cheers everyone good luck hi guys boris from uniform grand program here for eth online we decided to split our prize pool in three different categories in each category the first price is two and a half thousand dollars in uni while the second price is one and a half thousand dollars in uni in the first category we're looking for the best hack that integrates a project which is part of the unisop grant program for instance there are a couple of very cool python libraries that were built with the support of ugp in the second category we're looking for hacks that improve uni-swap's user experience we know that ux and d5 has a long way to go and are looking for new solutions third and final category is any hack that is uni-swap related ugp team wishes you happy hacking hi everyone welcome to this year's eat online hackathon my name is megan and i'm an integrations engineer for the xerox api at xerox labs here at xerox our mission is to create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely and we're doing this by building infrastructure for the emerging crypto economy in order to enable the creation of markets such as couldn't have existed before um so why should you build on the xerox api during this hackathon well it's an easy way to source liquidity from the xerox ecosystem and it offers smart order routing that will split up transactions across different decentralized exchanges and other liquidity sources in order to return to you the best price for these transactions we're offering 8k prices during this hackathon across four categories so we'd like to see what you come up with for using the xerox api in d5 and in nfts and then also um we have a price for the best use of the xerox data api and if you have some ideas that just don't fit into any of these categories we're offering an open track so please feel free whatever ideas you have to build them we are just so excited to be sponsoring this year and to see what you will come up with and if you have any questions please reach out to us on discord either in our discord or in the eat online xerox channel and happy hacking hi everyone i'm artem from oneich for this hackathon we prepared four bounty prizes each worth of two thousand dollars in one inch token you might heard of one inch network and one inch protocols it's high efficient and secured protocols in device space for this hackathon you can think of protocol just as a set of smart contract and three of our bounties is related to one inch limit order protocol we want to see that you use it for building margin trading solution second one is to build adapter between limit order and decks we just want to see the swap on decks uh through limit order in the way that gas fees be paid by third party and the last task is trading strategy you can take two stable coins for example and they extract profit from price fluctuation of this staple coins pair we also have open track price so here if you have any creative super cool ideas in device place we'd like to see it show it to the world and we looking forward for submissions thanks hey everyone this is mcfly from 8810ph during the three weeks we will support and encourage you to build cool products with 88 mph v3 smart contracts and subgraph we will award more than 7 000 of prices to products that make it simple and easy for non-technical users to use httmph over ids include integration of aka tmphg to into existing or upcoming products and tools for example easy mass fixed interest rate lending multisig government surgery management uh improved solvency and unified primitive that could range from interest bearing derivative or structural product uh to in-game or off-bearing asset looking forward for your participation good luck everyone hey everyone this is jason shah from alchemy the leading blockchain developer platform i'm here to tell you a little bit about alchemy and what we're offering to support you here at ethonline 2021. alchemy is the leading blockchain developer platform supporting ethereum polygon arbitram optimism flow crypto.com and more alchemy powers many of the top defy nft and other decentralized applications and protocols we provide a supernode product in addition to a suite of developer tools help you go from idea to product to scale at ethonline 2021 we're offering three prizes as well as a pool prize for anybody that uses alchemy in their application happy hacking hi my name is thomas taylor here over at bitco i'm the engineering manager of the youth defy and rap bitcoin projects um for this hackathon we have a total of eight thousand dollars in prizes um the number one prize is a two thousand dollar reward followed by a fifteen hundred dollar and a thousand the remainder of the contestants um we'll get a thirty five hundred dollars split amongst them um what we're looking for in terms of project ideas are our best use of the sdk our smart contracts library or the wrapped bitcoin uh project in terms of integration um in addition uh smart contract improvements and then statics upgrades are good as well thank you and good luck hackers hello my name is patrick collins developer advocate on the chain link protocol when we're building our smart contracts we know that these run on blockchains however these blockchains have this crucial flaw they can't actually interact with the real world and get access to outside data or any external computation this is going to mean that we can't work with anything outside the chain so chain-link nodes offer a decentralized way to get data and are currently being used on some of the biggest protocols in the space you can get randomness pricing data you can do computation and do upkeeps and really anything else that you want to do in this blockchain space outside of your blockchain to empower your smart contracts at this hackathon we're giving four thousand dollars in link to first place two thousand dollars in link to second place a thousand dollars a link to third place and three thousand dollars in pool prizes for any project that uses chain link head over to docs.chain.link to get started now [Music] go [Applause] hey everyone this is mona from the enzyme council and we are very excited to be sponsoring ethonline this year for those of you who are not familiar with enzyme it is a decentralized asset management protocol which enables people to build scale and monetize investment strategies in a matter of just a few clicks today we're connected with hundreds of digital assets
