why aren't you changing your background all i got is the the police sirens in the background straight out of compton all right um i think we're all set i'm recording and the slides are incoming all right so welcome everybody again sorry for the delay uh but this is market make uh judging session eight and today we're going to be knocking out the last of the projects we haven't presented yet um so i'm going to start off with just a quick intro uh for the hackathon we had 490 hackers from 58 countries and 17 time zones which is pretty incredible i went people from all over the world and um it was really really a great experience to see you know just the variety of people we had attending this and building projects with us uh in the end result we had 120 projects um from all of these teams um again a huge diversity in lending in d5 projects and nft all over the all over the place so we were really excited to see the number and the variety in the projects that came out of it so the format for this session uh if you're not aware if you haven't come to an east global event before here's just a quick overview four minutes for the video demo which is pre-recorded some teams might um speak over it or do a live voiceover but typically they'll just be playing it and then we'll have four minutes for questions uh we'll pop in uh short breaks every two uh sorry every few projects uh just for the judges to chat to each other and catch up on on their thoughts and entering their scores and then we'll do a longer 10 minute break sometime about halfway um just to let people stretch their legs or get a drink and then generally just for hackers to be aware of the criteria that we suggest to judges is technicality originality practicality how people use it which means you know the ui ux and then the final wow factor which can be up to their discretion just something that pops out to them or something that they feel sets it apart from other projects generally we want to remind people both hackers and judges that this is not necessarily a competition while obviously some people bring a competitive mindset that's totally fine but we find that a lot of our hackers are here to learn they're um trying to sometimes just get feedback some of our projects have gone on to become businesses you know get investment but not everybody's doing that so we're just really proud of everybody who's been able to build something and present something at the end of this hackathon and finally before we start i'll just give a quick intro to our judges today we have sergey from one inch evan van ness from weekend ethereum and pete kim from coinbase we're really thankful for all of them sharing their time and expertise to give feedback to our projects today and with that we're going to jump right into the first project um unless judges need anything we're gonna we're gonna jump right into it speak now forever hold your piece yep let's do it cool uh the first project is orca protocol i will let the team uh share their screen and and give us their demo um i was just wondering if you could let stephen valerian he was having some trouble joining thank you hi we are team orca and today we will be demoing the orca protocol a flexible and adaptable dow implementation our team members are john sterlachy stephen valeri will kim daniel thompson and myself julie rosenberg it's no secret that existing dows have a usability problem most are either overly complicated or not robust enough current governance frameworks lack ways to meaningfully manage hierarchy and permissions which create voter apathy and misaligned voter incentives a protocol which allows daos to easily create flexible rules and manage permissions is critical in order for on-chain governance to reach its full potential this is why we created orca protocol a gas-efficient simple-resistant dow implementation using erc 1155 equipped with a simple ui dashboard to manage dow proposals and allow on-chain voting for on-chase assets all secured using gnosis safe orca is made up of pods organizations which consist of a fixed number of member tokens each representing a single boat each pod is linked to a multi-sig ball to securely hold shared on chain assets pods are flexible and built modularly to accommodate infinite use cases including project governance pooled investing community management and so much more the orca protocol mints and distributes the pods erc 1155 member tokens in order to claim a membership one must meet the pod member requirements and rules pod members can create proposals and vote on whether to execute a proposal could be internal defining requirements to hold membership or external performing on-chain ass actions such as deploying pod funds all proposals are executed on chain by a network of third-party users called shepard's in exchange for orca tokens the shepherds and share proposals are executed fairly and member requirements are being met now that you understand the infrastructure let's see how jane would use the orca protocol interface jane opens her orca protocol ios app on her dashboard she can see her pods and any urgent pod proposals market bank club has an active internal proposal requiring members hold sushi she votes yay to implement the proposal directly from her dashboard jane is going to try to join a new pod sofi direct club this pod has two internal rules one pod members must hold 120 ave and pod members must delegate their ave to vote to the pod jane only meets one of those requirements she now goes to ave to delegate her vote and comes back jane now complies with the pod internal requirements and claims her membership jane wants to create a new external proposal she selects the ave rule library and proposes that the pod use its delegated voting power to vote yes on ave governance prop 7. the proposal is now available to other members to vote on if the proposal passes it will automatically get executed by the orca network and that is the orca protocol we are incredibly excited and plan to finish the web app shortly bring orca to the mainnet build out a comprehensive integration library and implement pod hierarchy systems we hope orca protocol will empower all types of organizations to lean into decentralized governance here's where you can find out more and thank you so much for your time so you said the the web app was coming i take it that means you did the phone app first uh right now we just have like clickable mocks um we have the basic setup for like a create react app but we're still working on uh finishing the last little bit of it cool what what made you decide to like what was the inspiration just frustration with existing dial frameworks or yeah i mean sort of the the frustration came around like um the ability for people to collaborate and we think you know i don't know if you've ever joined a discord group and it starts out like really cool with like 10 or 15 people but once it balloons into like a couple hundred the productivity and like the ability to do meaningful things kind of goes down so we had the thought of like you know what if we create governance around these like pods which are fixed sizes and it sort of creates like these little action groups which can sort of self-manage themselves but also collaborate with other action groups i wanted to ask you about the sherpa uh model that you mentioned uh you mentioned that they execute proposals on behalf so are you thinking like you know is it kind of like you know like um like meta transactions they they you know submit transactions on ethereum uh on behalf and in return they get tokens is that is that what you're thinking like because yes prices are too high yeah um so right now we just did like a naive implementation and they um the the pods themselves store the transaction on chain and then you know if the voting thresholds are met then the shepherds are free to execute them and the shepherds pay the gas in return for the fees um future state we'd like to do something with like the gas station network to see how we can sort of distribute that gas cost more evenly to like either the entire orca network or like on a pod bipod basis but that's the setup for now i see and and uh do you like the uh participants in the pod uh have to stake the uh the tokens for orca or like uh new organs get you know minted uh to to reward those people that submit transactions so we're still working on the uh the tokenomics a little bit um we're gonna have a pod that basically manages the token distributions uh on chain um so yeah we're still trying to figure out whether we do like you know a staking mechanism or we just mint new tokens uh but that's something we're trying to uh work out currently i see by the way uh really awesome ui uh it really looked really pretty thanks so much also from my site looks very very very well uh i like that you just implemented my ios device and uh yeah it looks great what was your biggest challenge in the development of the application and the the whole architecture um i could give this to steven real quick yeah so it's probably around implementing the internal rules so we set it up in a way where you can have really generic functions for claiming membership but then you also want shepherds to be able to call those rules over time and the way you like encode some of the parameters like message.sender is not the message.sender when a shepard's calling the function so um just making things super generic for both the internal and external rules got pretty technically challenging just around managing all the call data and encoding things correctly okay great thanks very cool guys cool implementation implementation good idea thanks so much thank you yeah can't wait to see y'all launch this uh it looks really great so definitely great uh it sounds like all of our judges have had a chance to respond so um thank you orca for being the the first project to present as part of this session uh we're gonna move on to the next team which is copy trader um if you haven't been promoted yet to panelists please raise your hand in the chat and we'll get you up here um looks like we've got marcelo and merrick is there anybody else otherwise they should be able to start whenever you're ready oh yeah sure i will share my screen great hello welcome to our video for market make a catan we are mime protocol we are a team of two people marcelo barris and i am rick segal our project is called mime protocol and it enables users of ethereum to copy transaction of each other so how does it work let's start with an example so alice follows bob's address on ethereum bob makes a transaction mime protocol notices it and will replicate the transaction on behalf of alice so our future work is gonna be focused on um adding more integrations with it away as you will see in the demo and overall improve the ui in the ux as as well as doing some gas optimization in solidity so now let's go with the demo we've got metamask connected to our site first of all we're going to create a contract which copies all transactions made by different address we're gonna provide the address of the address we want to follow yeah and the second parameter is the strategy i will explain that later yeah we approve the transaction in metamask now that event should be cached by our server you can see in the in the corner yeah it was yeah we see a new contract deployed we can view it yeah so that's real i hope you like the ui it's really simple we see our contract first of all we're gonna deposit some heater and then some dye we have two different pools the first is operation pools and the second is for labels uh now we're gonna deposit to the relay pool okay as always we interact with metamask we'll wait for the transaction to be confirmed yeah now we're gonna add some dye into the operation pools okay uh we wait for this transaction to be confirmed but in the meantime we will switch to other because we'll copy a deposit on other that's it first of all we must give an approval yeah we deposit 25 die we wait for the approval and now this transaction should be catched by our server and should we trigger the its relay and yeah and the contract now should also approve as we see and in a few seconds we should see a new transaction so now we just see one transaction because basically we copied the approve and yeah we also copied yeah you see two transactions now so maybe let's open the second one because the first is just the approval so yeah uh as you saw we've got two two columns the first one is base transaction which actually refers to the transaction that we copied and the second one is the transaction that specifies how the other transaction was copied so as you see descender is the layer basically that's us that's the protocol and the recipient is the contract that we deployed and what happened through some internal transactions we deposit it on other just to make sure we'll open the locks emitted during this transaction let's scroll down and as you see the last one is deposit and who deposit the smart contract so basically yeah great thanks uh any judges want to start us off yeah looks great um i just uh have one question uh right now um you yeah you know you were showing like um like there's this thing called strategy contract and uh in your demo it was for ave uh deposits uh so for different types of protocols would like would you have to provide the strategic contract uh no basically every user can select one for now we've got just one strategy and what is this ratchet strategy we didn't manage to explain that in the demo it's a set of uh manipulators because you know like a transaction is basically through interactive smart contract you need to provide some data to the transaction so yeah basically the manipulator is just the strategy is a set of manipulators which specify how you need to manipulate the raw bytes of the data to execute the transaction on behalf on behalf of of yourself gotcha okay and uh you are i'm pretty sure you're you're um for saying that people will be creating like those strategy contracts for different types of protocols for now just other but we close to implement the uni-swap interfaces so yeah very cool very cool it seems like an obvious thing that um you know some of these uh on-chain analytics companies like nansen or whatever would uh would be interested in buying integrating whatever um i'm curious why did you did you just decide to to build this because you know you were aping into transactions off of something you saw off nansen and you thought like hey we should build that oh maybe the first inspiration was like to maybe create something totally strange and crazy but after all we realized that we building something really similar to etoro so we just focus on the yeah on uh keep going that way so so yeah we managed to do that and yeah the most crazy stuff was like to do very low low level stuff on on the evm so yeah that was really nice i have another question so if i'm copying say you know xerox b1 for example i i obviously won't be able to do it just because you know he owns so much more money than i do uh so like is it possible for it to like adjust the amounts uh that's a very good question so as i said before the strategy has a set of manipulators and into that manipulator actually we inject just the context and the context is basically the other the the contract that is coping the transaction so for now our api may operators do not implement like dynamic changing of the parameters uh but it we can easily do it but uh for the hackathon we did not focus on that because it's just like to get the balance of the of the copied trader and the balance of the of the copy trading copy trader and yeah just doing some math over it did you just about injecting context yeah sure do you uh also plan um to integrate the security layer because so if someone knows that someone follows them so they can trick them odd and that's that's the most important question so uh for instance if i if i i'm aware that someone's copying me and uh i will decide just to move all of my funds to an external account to trigger uh the same to happen or by a different account that will happen that why because as i said we have strategies and for every strategy we define which kind of transaction can be copied and how they can be copied so for instance i can define that you we will copy just the transaction transactions which represent interaction with uni swap and if you interact with uni swap you can just copy a swap token for example tokens and within that swap tokens for exact tokens you can trade just on uh maybe a liquidity pool of die and rupture so yeah that's it that's how it works okay great awesome work guys very interesting yeah i think that's time unless there's any final comments we're going to move on to the next team all right thank you copy trader next up is mattis mantis i think you are already here so i'll let you get started when you're ready hi i'll be giving you a walkthrough of minus mantis is important to leverage an rv using one range use cases the leverage asset with the wrong position let's say you're along with ethereum you expect the price to rise you can use monitors to leverage your position and increase your eph exposure like say three times and earn higher profits second is leverage assets with speed variable interest let's say link has a much higher interest and die you can leverage link against die and get a higher net interest flow the flow is as follows let's say a user wishes to increase his adh exposure over time he'll first need to approve that demand test approve delegation to borrow by on his behalf and call leverage and matters what happens then is that mantis initiates a flashlight using avi receives dye stops the dye for raptor ethereum using banish it deposits rapid uh on a lending pole and borrows die and this die ultimately pays by the flashlight the leverage factor is calculated as follows mantis uses credit delegation to borrow on behalf of the user to pay back the flash loan this removes the need to use a proxy contract unlike other current platforms so since there is no proxy involved you can view your positions on the rba dashboard as well so let's try this out so mantis is currently running on a hardhat main network this is to enable anyone to seamlessly try out the app without actually spending extra money it can also be deployed to the main net so let's copy this url this is the url to my hosted hard drive machine id is q1 td7 there we go let's go to the app let's go to the wallet and get some free tokens you can choose any token you wish to see let's go to die see the balance has increased uh let's go to the home page now choose the choose the asset you wish to leverage let's take a rapid game for now leverage against put in the amount choose interest mode and select the loan to value ratio let's keep this around 0.6 so there is no liquidity ratio or low liquidity risk you see approved mantis delegate to mindless approve delegation leverage see the position has increased uh this is a real-time position on navi so basically with just this amount of ethereum you have created a much more leveraged position on rb that is around 2.5 times thank you hi there very very cool can you compare the gas compared to some of the other um things out there that do similar things like especially after you've done three transactions as in uh compared to other platforms right yeah yeah so more than gas cost i would rather explain how this is different let's say d5 saver right so d5 save and all they use proxy contracts which are gonna cost more as well and at the top of that you cannot see your positions on the rba dashboard since i'm using credit delegation uh so there is no proxy involved right so you can you can directly interact with the platform and see your positions on the rba dashboard as well so you are you saying you haven't benchmarked the gas is that what you're saying no the thing is about one inch uh i was i tried to uh benchmark the gas cost but bunnings gives me a different route based on two different assets right based on the current best route so it's it's a bit difficult to get the maximum gas cost right it's dynamic got it i wish we had someone here who knew anything about one inch yeah um one question from my side so you you run your own magnet fork uh is it right yeah like from mainnet not on aws yeah that's because people who try out the app and one issue is currently not available on the test network yeah because of all the 43 integrations they have um yeah that sounds great and you were really able to create a leveraged position on the main network right with using well that's that's great um that's really interesting um we will get in touch with you after the hackathon thank you great i think yeah i don't really have a question right now but a really interesting project i i'd love to check it out and try it you know once it becomes available uh it's hosted on the on and anyone can check it out you'll just have to connect your metamask instance to my rpc url right okay very cool yeah thank you thank you oh just a question for me you know sometimes uh projects finish during the hackathon but sometimes they continue building on them do you have any plans to keep building on this afterwards yeah i do because i wish to make it a complete d5 portal right because i was working on other things as well to integrate into matters but i could not manage it in the time given right but i'm planning on adding liquidation protection and other things like uh like our way dashboard 2 currently doesn't give uh liquidation options right to liquidate other users positions so i'm planning to add that as well as well as protection liquidation protection board which will monitor your position on off chain and protect protect you from the liquidations so i'm planning to make it a completely different portal a leverage is just starting with it this is this is really great idea actually we built similar thing uh gh10 last year with my team uh and uh yeah this this protection just take profit and stop stop loss this is really a great thing um which what do you think what would you use as oracles to uh to protect people like you would like to use channeling as similar what other is using or did you uh thought also about uh using ship on chain oracles like union swap oracles maybe also one-inch liquid product oracles yes so uh two things about that first the monitoring will be off-chain as an lb first uh monitoring off-chain rates of prices like uh tokens as well and uh i've had some experience with uh chain links so i've been deleting chain link as well and or what what else can be done is like uh imagine trying to add other platforms as well so let's go with maker so make also has this chain price speed right so i can fetch all of them get an aggregate have different algorithms working uh to get them to get uh particularly anyone's position right before anyone can like anyone else can liquidate so option on chin both type of crisis will be gathered with my boards one last question from my side is the position to organized the leveraged position is the leverage position tokenized uh i didn't get that is it token has hasn't ever yeah is it wrapped as a as a token like a usb20 token so that it can be like transferred easily maybe there's an nfts example as well no this does not include that i don't think there's a need for that so what's happening is let's say i have 100 die and i wish to leverage ethereum right so i have a current dialect i can leverage four times so i'll have 400 uh die worth of ethereum right so uh generates a die so which can ultimately be sent or sent to anyone without the need to need to wrapping it again so let's say i leverage it i'm getting ada anyway and i can send that to anyone else right if provided you do not borrow the entire thing out if you have some like a safe margin you can send that data to some anyone else so there's no need to wrap it again all right i think we're gonna we're gonna wrap there um thanks krishna for presenting really interesting project thank you thanks krishna cool project thank you next up is not real oh jumping right into it if you're ready to go go ahead hey this is not real.ai for the market make hackathon and let me tell you about my project so not real that ai is an ai art market on ethereum and the reason i'm building this is because i believe that the intersection of generative ai and curation markets on ethereum is going to be huge some of the problems with existing nft markets is huge oversupply lack of underlying value foggy price discovery and of course high fees so let me show you what i built for the hackathon this is the auction interface so cool so uh so you see this is a 2d interpolator for the ai generated cats and what we have here is a grid of nfts that are being minted at a fixed rate so there's a fixed supply and each one is available for only 24 hours and i believe this structured method is a very good way of finding price discovery for these um otherwise hard to price uh items so this is the interface it's uh on matic so for fast fees uh fast and cheap fees and i'm also adding a network agnostic transactions soon so that people won't even know that they're on layer two so yeah so that's the interface and real quick i just wanted to show you what the some of the possibilities are so this is these are ai generated paintings these are ai generated cars and this next one is a custom model that i trained on various art that i found interesting on the internet so those are some of the possibilities and so to tell you a little bit more about it so i it's built on built on matic with network agnostic transactions i'm going to be adding uh staking on ave so that part of your purchase price is locked and also all the bids that are locked up are earning interest which gives inherent value to the nft and then also the first purchaser of an of an nft will get a two percent royalty on the item for life which means that the platform it won't be taking fees it will go to uh curators so i just want to go with you down the rabbit hole for a second what if nfts become not just collectible items but actual collectible storefronts so when you collect an nft you also acquire a whole printing business t-shirt printing poster printing and imagine one day if generative ai is used to design a new 3d model for a chair and that chair is printed for you and then shipped on demand so that's the future i imagine marrying curation markets and price discovery with generative ai so thank you very much i post daily art on twitter and instagram so make sure to follow me there and thanks very much yeah this is this is very interesting uh especially the uh the the 50 uh of the the proceeds being locked up and then you know state done uh but i'm not sure if i've seen anything like that before in nft space uh so that's that's really interesting because like what you said it uh it gives some other like inherent value to these nfts um other than just the art itself uh and you mentioned that two percent royalty um are all the art okay i'm assuming the all of the art that or the uh generative generative uh ai or ai generated images are created by you at the moment but in the future you're gonna be allowing other artists to generate these images and if so like why are you going to provide the platform to make it easy for them to maybe train a model and then generate these images themselves or are you just assuming that people figure out how to do that on their own if you're answering you're muted sorry can you hear me now uh all right so yeah one of the reasons i've invested time in that 2d interpolator is one day i want this company to be building um very easy tools for interacting with generative ai and designing generative ai so definitely like building tools is one of the things i want to do and turning it into a platform for other artists is also something i'd like to do one day you know the shopify started off by just opening their own like skiing snowboard store and then they opened it as a platform so i sort of see the path as um you know making it successful as a stand-alone store first and then making it into a platform so very cool very cool how did you build this did you like clone a marketplace and and fork a marketplace and and use that yeah so um i forked uh known origin um so they had an mit licensed uh marketplace um with uh audited contracts and uh some front end um but uh all the everything that you saw on the front end that there was uh custom and then i had to do a lot of adjustments to it so i'm very grateful for the for them as a base but i added a lot to that yeah i'm curious like what did you spend the most time on technically uh so during this hackathon uh it was all the auction interface of that grid um and then also uh basically hooking that up to the smart contracts and the the various like bid states and that that sort of thing it would be interesting to take a look at your ai uh files uh but the repository is empty uh yeah it's there's like there's a lot of code involved and i want to like yeah i want to push it all up but i have a whole bunch of like kind of junk committed and i do a lot of cleaning it might get repository but uh yeah um is there a particular part you'd like me to push up to to view just push everything let's see what you did so i can take a look okay any other questions one thing you mentioned was that there's a limited number that are auctioned off per period how did you come to that uh number auction yeah um i mean it's it's kind of an arbitrary thing but i know that uh cryptokitties when they were doing their um initial sale they were doing one every 15 minutes uh and i basically arbitrarily chose like something a little bit less than that like maybe one every 30 minutes or one every hour um and yeah there isn't really a great way to decide on on how much i just didn't want it to be like so much that it flooded the supply okay yeah i guess that makes sense and you can tweak that later on i'm guessing yeah yeah all right yeah i think that's a pretty good overview of the project any other final comments awesome thank you very much thank you appreciate it all right um so that was our fourth project and i think we had scheduled uh a break for judges if they want to i'm going to just give it as an option if you guys want to like convene in that other google me just to chat about the last four projects are you do you want to do this yes or no um judges me all right all right we can do one um towards the halfway mark just so you guys can connect on projects and just share your thoughts all right uh next up is nflend and i think they're already promoted so i'll let them get started right away all right hey everybody hi guys i am brave also have a feeling that you're going to be hearing from some lawyers very fairly quickly [Laughter] let me try like this blending hi everyone better i'm grateful to introduce you nfl non-fungible landing which is our arc with peter zero dot and adam so what is nfl basically it's a market maker non-custodial that allow borrowers to create borrower requests with their nft as a collateral which is our main innovation and in the other part lenders can lend and delegate part of their credit delegation to those a borrower so the advantage for the lender is that they can maintain exposure to their collateral benefit from additional yield paid by the borrower and they bear the risk on an nfc so we code and especially zero dots so this is the what we have done uh here you have the main functions and for instance uh nft depositor will need to add the currency wants to borrow the amount the apr is ready to pay for that and our design is quite efficient we think and to begin with the lender that delegates the credits will need to pay the apr on the every platform so the rpr that is paid to him by the nft the borrower will need to be bigger than this apr let's move to the design part which is one of our main focus you know to offer a decent user experience so when you come on the dashboard you can see what you need to pay the the threshold also of your debt for instance to make sure you pay in high frequency you can see what you have deposited so far you can also you know just see the the historic of what you have borrowed and for instance yes you can like leverage also so there you see the nfg you goat you got and the the one you can use you know to to get a load so for instance i would like to throw in this beautiful crypto pt so i estimate the value i want usdc i'm ready to pay like 15 apr i know that the also the lender will pay the apr and ave and i get my loan the threshold on the other part of the market you can see the nft that are deposits and what are the proposal the depth so yes you can see the summary and just select fixed rpr or variable whatever you prefer so as you can see we moved four we move quick on the back the front but we still need to do the connections so this is our step that we asep it was a an amazing project we will continue working on it and we'll hope you like it and we'll use it thank you uh thank you uh how were you uh determining the estimated value for the nft so i'm gonna take that question so the estimated value for the nft this is actually a problem we ran into pretty this is a pretty big headache right how do you get the app the appropriate price for an nft right because that's something that's relatively illiquid uh so we decided that instead of trying to tackle that problem the actual amount that's input as estimated value is arbitrary it's input by the borrower however the lender it's on the lender to check the nft to verify that it's a legitimate nft you've got the address you've got the open c you've got everything um so so yeah that's what we meant when we said the the lender does have to bear the risk of the nft i say gotcha and and how did you determine the differential between the uh the ave interest and and the interest on the platform yeah so we have actually gone through three designs of the smart contracts um one of them actually built up took the variable apr from ave because it was a bit more complicated to take the stable apr because that's different for each person but the variable is consistent um and actually added a fixed coupon on top of that and that was cool but the problem is um well other than being a little bit more gassy you know uh we also had uh it was a bit complicated for lenders or for borrowers because you wouldn't be able to get you wouldn't be able to know what your actual loan will be right so we decided to take it simple for now obviously we can do that but we decided to take it simple the apr is actually determined by the you know in the bar request um so it's on also the lender to check obviously you can choose to delegate stable uh if you want right we give that option um so that's that's essentially how we do it it's not actually connected in this current iteration that we're working on it's not connected to the avi apr if that makes sense so yeah say that again sorry so essentially we're not taking into consideration the apr on ave uh but lenders can delegate stable credit and get their own fixed apr and make the the difference between the borrow request apr and the loan apr or one interesting thing might be like yield protocol had this thing where you could like flash loan your thing into like the maker like your your maker cdp your fault or whatever they call now into a yield thing so you know potentially something to look at if you i do like flashlights yeah i mean it might solve some of your problem there just like making it a stable thing actually not a bad idea i think you mentioned as part of your closing slide that you still need to wire up the front and back ends um anything besides that like what you want to pursue next um well on the back end side at least we uh you know there's a bunch of new projects in the nft space like nftx for instance right and these are opening up a lot of new doors right because one of the biggest problems with this is it's more or less peer to peer right you have one bar request and one lender and defy likes pools of stuff so we want to see if we can turn it into uh into a pooled model eventually right longer term that might be really interesting um of course then there's a question of how do you determine the price oracle make sure it's not manipulable flash ones whatever everything but uh it's on the radar yeah i mean that might be possible for semi-fungible tokens uh like items and games or something you know like i still have jordan or something and there's also assets that have you know currency backing them as well like having gotchas and stuff like that too right there's a lot of options cool good stuff guys thanks great stuff right on time thank you thanks thanks guys uh next up we have the watchful eye and i think they're already here so they can start whenever they're ready everybody not sure i actually shared sound so let me reshare just add a little bit see how close you get this is the watchful eye the watchful eye allows ave debt holders to send automated stop loss based on the risk factors of their loans the watchful eye uses an oracle that monitors the prices of the debt and collateral and compares it to the user defined stop loss once the stop loss is reached the oracle calls upon the watchful eye to use an ave flash loan to repay the pre-existing debt swap the collateral for the flash loaned asset on the one inch decks and then replay the flash loan asset with the proceeds from the swap to use a watchful eye a user must first take out a loan on the ave protocol when the user comes to the dashboard they can see their total debt in eth their total collateral in eth and their loan health factor or their ave health factor just for the viewer's sake in our wallet we have tandai which we borrowed from ave and we have 10 a-link which is our collateral on ave so first the user has to specify the details of the position that they hold on ave and as we showed a minute ago the debt we have is in die the collateral we have is a link and we have 10 die in debt and let's liquidate one a-link if we cross our threshold because that's worth about 25 and that'll cover the debt and let's say uh our debt price limit for die is usually around one let's just put one and let's say that when the link goes below 28 which right now it is we want to go ahead and liquidate so let's configure the i with the information that just adds that information to the watchful eye contract confirm then we have to approve of the i's intervention which just means that the smart contract can move around the collateral asset so go ahead and confirm that transaction so after we've approved and set up the watchful eye we can actually go to the watchful eye contract and we can go and look at the watchful eye here is the watchful eye and it's not really human readable at the moment but that's just the way that it comes back from the blockchain so now that we see that the smart contract has the watchful eye that we created a second ago we can check out the price oracle the price oracle as we said before monitors the current price of the debt and asset and compares it to the watchful eyes set price limits so let's go ahead and start that oracle up so we see that the oracle pulled the watchful eye saw that the price was below the limit liquidity started to liquidate the position and then successfully liquidated the position watched by the watchful eye and now that the liquidation is finished we can verify that that debt was paid off in our wallet and would you look at that we no longer we have one less a link and 25 more die so we paid off the initial debt had a little bit of dye left over and aside from what we saw in the wallet if you check the ave user data as shown on the dashboard we can see that that loan was in fact paid off and this is the watchful eye and the watchful eye is always watching so you decided to build this to scratch your own edge i'm guessing um it was a it was actually one of the uh one of the one-inch um like ideas and and both both of us were brand new to doing any kind of development on ethereum so um it was kind of the lowest hanging fruit i guess yeah i mean one sec from my side why you didn't use our api and used uh the old one split version um so we couldn't figure out uh how to make that because the flashlight the flashlight has to be finished in one one transaction we're gonna figure out how to um and we asked around a little bit um and and and we just actually at first we we had like a mock contract that acted like uh one inch like to do the swap um but when we moved towards doing the actual swap on the fourth main net um we couldn't figure out uh how to how to do the like how to use the the the main api for one inch within our smart contract um or how that how that would happen within one transaction okay thanks so in hindsight i mean this seems like a like a very obvious idea using flash loans to self-liquidate um is there like any instance of instances of this actually like happening right now in the network like people using you know flash loans to self-liquidate i think that i'm not sure of the name of the the the protocol but i believe that there is um there is a protocol that does it right now um i i can't remember the name of it if i save you said you were new to youth development like um what were the challenges what was surprising um getting one-inch api to work of course yeah yeah that was uh both of us are like we're still like we're actually we haven't um we just started programming like a little over a year ago two years ago so um you know we we took what we've learned in the past few years uh which is like building things incrementally like the hardest part was we had no clue how do we connect all of these different uh contracts or protocols together in our own contract and that's why we started off like incrementally building it as as if or not as if we built it first as uh as we kind of set up a bunch like a couple of mock contracts that would simulate the debt repayment and then the the token swap um and then once we finished that like that that was you know hard enough as is figuring out like how do we communicate with other contracts um then we figured out you know how do we communicate with with with just one inch or how do we communicate with just uh ave um and uh we were able to do that in like a modular kind of way because of how we built the code out initially um so it was just like going step by step and figuring out how to how do we swap out the mock contract that we made with the actual thing and uh i would say that the hardest part of it was uh figuring out how how to fork mainnet um and and and we had no clue that that was a thing until you know last wednesday so yeah uh if you were to continue working on this what are some of the features that you would have in the future um well first of all we'd like to right now the oracle is is just a script that we run um it's just a centralized script uh what we would like to do is take that take that oracle and um have uh use chain link to call our call a certain function every s certain number of seconds we haven't really thought about that that much um and given that a certain field um given that that we have uh you know a position that could be liquidated um then the oracle will you know make that that flash loan call make that liquidation call um and also uh right now the watchful eye only can only hold like one one person's or one user's information um and we'd like to extend that to allow you know as many people that want to use the the application at once to use it um i also like seeing uh every time somebody uses scaffold eth i'm sure austin would be very appreciative you should let him know that uh your experience using it and any any suggestions you might have because he's always looking for he loves hearing about people using it especially during hackathons yeah definitely reach out to him uh i think that's it we're going to wrap up with this team and move on to the next one thanks again watchful eye great stuff yes your audio is a little uh shaky there evan all right so next up we have uh let's see sunny i'm not sure what the project name is but i'm gonna share the video uh and then just after this project we will take a 10 minute break this will be sort of our halfway mark for everybody sonny just let me know if you are ready to go and i can share the video say hi hey trent i can hear you oh you can play the video yep i can get that for you evan are you good looks like evan is frozen wait a second for him to come back does my internet still seem bad yeah you could just turn off your video for now um that should be maybe that'll help a little bit all right we're going to jump right into it hello hello hi i am sani radha so this is my market mac ether global submission so i developed the uh calculator for the d5 so it measures the uh past historical uh performance of the d5 platform so so user can analyze the past data and if on the platform so here currently i used the graph protocol uh so and using the graph protocol i use existing sub graph protocol of sushi initially and then i will be integrating more protocols so you know what happened in our project so user can calculate the past historical data of the of the any pair of the any platform like for unicef right so currently here you can see three months back the data so here you can see roi chart in the percentage ro hr is the dollars so okay so if user has invested ten thousand dollars three months back so now he he has uh 20 000 okay so if you have 20 uh 10 000 banks so now he has 20 000 so total roi would be 108 percent and what is the asset so currently you user initially initially uh user has invested uh so here is something mistake our w should be here upper side so so that was the minor mistake but yeah no sorry sorry so uh so what will the asset change so currently user has invested 10 e and uh and the 5 000 dollar worth of usdt okay now ascertain was so now if you withdraw the lp position from the unicef so now you will get 6e 6.3 and the 10 000 worth of the uh amount of the usdp so so this is the asset change so w assets goes minus and the usdt uh change goes plus and the total roi goes plus and what will be the total amount you will get twenty thousand ten thousand will be your profit okay so this is the roi in the percentage and the dollars okay that's it and you can also add the date for the any like like here i add uh january okay and submit so now uh data will be changed so as you can see data is the change okay yeah here you can see chart is also checked so you can also do for the uni substitution this is sushi style okay so now if you go the unisa platform and if you do if you do for like currently i add only two pairs if you want to check for any other page so you have to paste over here address okay like and then okay and currently have to set the day like one okay and that amount whatever amount you you want to invest like 10 000 submit so here it is say like if i invest 10 000 on first january 2021 then then my profit would be like 15 000 now okay i didn't invest it but it just show so what will be the impermanent loss and uh till now from the first january but what will be the asset in w and three months back and if you want to change over here so you can change the from here also for each usb okay and for this sushi strap also yeah so uh so so platform basic your motto is too if you user wants to analyze the past historical data and now from the past historically if he wants to invest so he can invest by analyzing the data so that's it thank you hi sunny uh i think it'd be so the roi does not uh uh include impermanent loss right um i'm assuming because um you know in the example that you gave uh if the user held on to eth and usd instead of supplying to unit swap they would be making five thousand dollars more uh just because the price of the youth balloon so much versus like supplying liquidity and you would be making 10 um you know uh basically 10 000 versus 15 000 uh like is that surfaced in the dashboard because i think they'll be what's uh what a lot of people are thinking about when you know when they're thinking about supplying liquidity um to amms so is that surfaced and if so if not then like is there a way to see it on your platform sorry i didn't get a question uh but sorry the the question was okay so like because i mean permanent loss uh in the example they gave about supplying uh ethan usdt into uni swap in june if you just held on to ethan usdt like you would have five thousand dollars more of of gains just because the price of each balloon so much right is that like is that included in the roi calculation today uh if not is there a way to see it in your website today yeah uh if you like uh like currently it is showing the data like if you i also show the impermanent loss like if you held the data if you hold the 10 000 uh other than invest so it will it is it is also showing the impermanent loss if you go to the unicef tab so like uh so i'm going to be uh i already implemented like uh if you didn't like it is showing impermanent loss but ah in meanwhile i will also able to implement that if i was not ever if i didn't aim or like what would say like i didn't invest it then uh this much amount of like i see okay so so the input is always in usd and you so the input is always in usd and like you can't specify uh like maybe 50 usd 50 eth as a starting point yes uh yeah currently input given usd so it will automatically break the uh percentage 50 50. i just i say okay i have one question i have one question um to you taking into account uh the amount which you entered in the in a demo uh so because if i if i put uh like 10 millions in uh in five million uh liquidity pool so the uh ap apy is is uh is getting lower yeah so are you taking into account this case yeah you are saying if i if i had the more value other than 10 000 then the api may get uh so it gets yeah when i add the while testing when i add more value instead ten thousand dollar so it's showing me very weird uh so now like uh i i didn't know that sorry my english is that okay i got it i i guess you didn't take it into account but it makes sense to to do that um i guess we did for 2019 similar thing with calculating the the apys or or apr uh it drops if you put more money into the pool because it performs then then maybe with the same performance uh but there are more people who would like to get the money from the earnings uh but the idea is great i like this uh i would like to get in touch with you if you like um just um bring me a telegram yeah sure sure i'll i i will try to connect awesome that's any final final comments questions yeah awesome yeah i read a few more tweaks i think this could be an incredibly useful tool to a lot of people so thank you i'm sorry my internet is not good and my english is not good not that good so i was not able to explain better sorry for that no worries man oh we got it you can see the potential of the project and what you submitted so good job and um looking forward to see if you keep working on it thank you yeah sure all right we're gonna move on to the next project uh actually i'm sorry uh this is when we were gonna take a quick 10 minute break sorry um for rug pulling everybody but we're going to take a quick break of 10 minutes just to reset and then back after the break we will have governor alpha vote splitter start us off so 10 minute break and then we will restart all right looks like we've got two or three judges left sergey if you're here just drop it in the chat or turn on your video and then get started yeah here i have some trouble with the camera but no that's fine that's right all right so we're going to jump back into it we're a little bit more than halfway through all the projects so thank you to everybody who's presented so far and um we're just going to keep going with the next project which is governor alpha vote and i think monet supply is gonna start us out for you all right uh well thanks for having us uh i'm gonna be presenting on behalf of the tally team let me just share my screen real quick sorry bear with me one moment sorry about this you having issues i can share hello everyone my name is dennis and burke and this is team tally and we are presenting to you today our teammates raph nate natasha and myself and our project uh boat splitting so the impetus behind the project uh compound and navi governance use checkpoints to apportion voting power based on the tokens you hold at the time the proposal is started but this prevents users from transferring or selling votes mid proposal and passive users also have no way of buying votes um if they're not interested in voting in the protocol themselves so our hackathon project is a mechanism to allow boat transfers during proposals as well as selling non-voting interests in governance tokens a diagram of how it works so the vote splitter contract uh left side takes a governance token like comp from the top right and creates a vault which is the blue box in the middle the user who created a vault locks their comp and they get back two things a non-funchable vault token and as many fungible wrapped comp tokens as they put in comp tokens the vault has the power to vote and delegate on the underlying governance until it eventually expires and the wrapped comp is used to close out the vault to get back the underlying token now i will share how you will use it um for example let's say we have some comb and we will need to deposit like let's say one comp for it to uh create a ball and then we will have the access to to the balls uh before they expire to both with with them uh using this nft that we can sell in open c or trade on other platforms then what you're gonna do is after it expires off after you decide to close it you will have to send your approved uh to send back the wrap token uh to to the box so you can get back your comp so this has been our presentation if you have any questions our github for both the front end and our uh protocol that we built on the back and is available and you can ask us any further information in our github thank you all right um any um questions happy to uh go over with you guys what what inspired it anything in specific or sorry you muted yourself yeah you're muted monet i have a something going on in the background yeah when you share your video it autoplays the next video it happens to me all the time for these sessions were you able to fix that you're muted again maybe purposely maybe not i don't know okay really sorry about that um so yeah i got the sound to turn off now i can hear you guys cool so i think eva's question was what was the inspiration um i think the inspiration was just um basically that a lot of holders prefer to to kind of take a passive interest in these protocols so they you know if you're having a small amount of comp you might not actually even have it be economical for you to vote it costs too much and this gives passive users kind of a way to have economic interest in the protocol without having voting interest basically when you put in comp and you you get the nft that votes and then you get the wrapped comp that doesn't vote the theory is that the wrapped comp you'd be able to buy it at a discount um as like a passive user and then after the expiry date you can turn it in for real comp so it's it's like a way to earn earned yield on your comp rather than voting how is this different from delegating to somebody in the compound system i mean i understand it's it's clearly different like you have a different architecture but can't smaller users just delegate to larger proxies they could um that's not incentivized per se so like they'd have to pay gas to delegate and then um you know their 10 comp or whatever it is is just going to continue to be 10 comp and perpetuity but um you know theoretically instead they could buy like the non-voting comp from somebody that they support who's gonna hold on to those votes um but for less than the price of of the amount of like wrapped comp they buy so um it um it's probably more for people who you know maybe even aren't interested in delegating um you know they just purely want economic exposure um yeah could you could you explain me again how people are incentivized to participate in the system yeah so if um if you want to get more voting power um basically you would be minting an nft and then selling the t-comp off to somebody else so you can kind of get like leverage on your voting power um presumably the the price people will be willing to pay for the non-voting comp will be less so you end up having like a a premium that you're paying to to get that extra voting power um and then that's the incentive for other people to purchase the non-voting shares um that you know if you buy wrapped comp that can't vote for a year uh for 90 cents on the dollar then you just made like a 10 yield it might be an interesting warning signal of an attack too right because you say like you expect there to be a discount but if there is not a discount then there's a sign that people are you know all of a sudden valuing it more it it could be um i think that it also kind of you know it it will make maybe governance rethink their their um strategies a little bit about preventing attacks because um i think part of the security of comp based governance is that you can't move votes around after a proposal starts but if it's in a transferable nft that has voting power um you could like list it on openc if there's like a contentious proposal and somebody could swoop them all up so yeah i think it uh it definitely raises some interesting questions makes me think of renting hash power on nice hash you can see spikes whenever there's a 51 attack or something how much is the gas i assume that's a decent bit of gas if i'm going to buy a bunch of voting power using an nft yeah i'm i'm not certain what the gas is but uh i'm sure it's considerable um it'd probably only be worthwhile for somebody to do it with like 10 10 000 or more everything is considerable these days well yeah sorry for the av issues earlier though and uh thanks for thanks for having us no worries any final comments sergey yeah it sounds some great idea so it could be maybe an additional market for the device space and yeah also a solution maybe to create attacks on governance thanks yeah combining this with flashlights may have some interesting outcome all right uh i think i think that's it for this team uh thank you guys for presenting it's always nice to see like a simple project that um i mean it's simple on the surface but the implications are a little bit larger you know so good job there it'll be interesting to see what happens in the future how people take this or hopefully not too many attacks but you know we'll see that's the way the crypto space goes yeah we're going to move on to the next project uh that would be ens analytics with cervesh yes hello everyone i'll just share my screen great is it visible yes hello everyone i have built this ens analytics dashboard so this dashboard does is it audible also i think i stopped no you were it was coming okay sonya's data set and help us track the life cycle of any instrument so going to the technical diagram so i have these three main components but for this project i'm getting the data from a sub graph from the graph i'm storing the data into postgres sql i'm running complex equal queries to build uh to generate the data set that i require for the charts and at the end i have the dashboard which runs on this postgresql database to quickly go to the dashboard feature so i have four main features on the dashboard the top level is aggregation matrix so at the top i have total number of ns domains available in the ethereum then i have two monthly trend charts so this shows number of new in a domain register uh compared to the last one similarly number of domains getting expired this month compared to the last one this is aggregation matrix uh the second chart is about funnel chart this is interesting because this chart help us understand how what is the dominance of owner uh in terms of domain ownership so let's say i as a owner in the ens system how many domains i own so final chart explains the percentage of owners actually dominate the ownership of ams domains similarly i have the chart for domain life cycle of a dns domain and we can also filter the dashboard based on domain naming or not yeah so we have couple of charts here so starting from the left side we have this we have a chart which says number of domains it exists from the ethereum blockchain uh then we have this turn it stands last month we have five one private new domain registration this month two five seven seconds that's a fifty percent decline from the last one similarly we have another trend chart which says that last month expiry was two to six two this month it's 1846 yeah uh the second chart is final analytics so it tells the percent number of domains owned by the owners so total eighteen hundred eighteen thousand six hundred thirteen owners on two plus domains in the system now out of this 47 percent which is 8885 owns the four plus domains so on the rightmost side of the chart these are the big wheels in the system so these are like 784 such owners want 64 plus domains so this chart help us see the domain distribution among the things like that these are uh so here we have pagination so we can see all the domains available right uh now we also have this filter where we can search any of the domain that we want so i know one domain that i can search so i have this tab created each domain i added a filter on that so i can see the depth period was registered in at this block number and it was again reviewed at this block number so similarly we can do filter on the owner's address so we can do zero x say any any other it also it's also not a complete yeah so here it shows all the addresses we can actually select and add them yeah so this is uh the though this address has this a certain it has this errors we also have this uh data repository where we have documented everything so all the charts that we have and also the fixed subgraph entities we are taking data from and the postgres tables try storing your time and the sql queries yeah that's it for the democratic very cool um i'm curious if you had a chance to talk with ens at all um yes actually i built this dashboard by discussing with them so they already had some sort of initial dashboard that they were using but they do not have something which can tell us tell them that what is the dominance of any owner in the uni system so identifying the big wells in the small wells in the system things like that and also they wanted to track the ens lifecycle they didn't have that feature yet so yeah that's why i built that maybe i messages but do you support um sub domains do you have any thoughts about doing that yeah so currently current dashboard just supports the top level domain but i have all the data set that is required so i need to put in them into the charts that's next steps what would you say the number one thing uh number one like interesting thing that you learned while doing this yeah the i mean uh what i learned majorly here is i so i i was thinking i was looking into multiple projects one which was one of them it was their ens was there so i was looking into those analytics metrics that i can see and those are common to all of this uh defy and the all the types across the ethereum and is there something i can build some sort of framework or platform which could be used for all of this you know of platforms and see these funnel charts or maybe like let's say for away it's a user retention chart right so how many users are coming and taking flash loan every month or every year every quarter things like that so that's that so i with this project i got that kind of ideas and that kind of learning from my side i can say it's it's great to have uh uh such tools also for ams yeah for discovery it's like the explorer right and a mocks in a dashboard yeah i like the setting thank you [Music] all right any comments from pete otherwise you think we can wrap up uh thanks for presenting starfish yeah i already made a comment but yeah oh sorry i must have missed it cool congrats thank you good job yeah all right the next project is apyn and they can start whenever they're ready um hi hello and welcome to this apy inc presentation what is ap why in you're asking basically it is a promo machine you come to the site you connect your wallet we scan it for items should i be hearing audio can't hear the sound either or how about how how about now why don't you try to reshare but uh with the sound again it's a little check box in the bottom left yeah pretty sure i did that but zoom is acting weird today let me try it again and now i can't if you're having issues i can share it for you let me try this so now i can't see i can't get it back oh okay there we go can you hear it now hello and welcome to this apy presentation is that fine it's pretty quiet yeah yeah that's fine okay hello and welcome to this apy in presentation what is apyn you're asking basically it is a formal machine you come to the site you connect your wallet we scan it for idle assets and we calculate and display how much u.s dollar you would have earned if this that we're sitting in an other landing pool instead of just sitting on your wallet why did we choose to do that so while the other side is really nice and easy to use the amount of historical data for how the different tools have performed in the past is limited so you see here there is this 30-day average that i think was recently added and you have some data for the present day over here but that's it so we knew that we wanted to do something with a historical apy and we decided to cater to the defined newcomers as a different noob you are overwhelmed with all this new terminology and different ways to make or lose money so we thought that a good first step would be to see some hard numbers that were calculated based on your wallet data and then based on that you can decide if you want to ate in or chicken out let's see what that looks like over here we got the different assets that have been idle on in your wallet here we have the apy that you would have enjoyed if these assets were on other and here we have the return in usd based on these numbers then you can click on this link and you get redirected to the other landing pool now if you click on this plus sign you will see the chart that shows the usda withholder for this certain asset and usd without other you will notice that unless you've been holding a big amount of token for a long time this chart doesn't look that impressive so in the end they stand out to be a product for ways but that's also fine um the bottom line is we had a lot of fun developing that gathered a lot of experience on how to get the data and calculate the historical api and we will definitely use that experience in new projects thank you for your time and your attention have a great day um so yeah you just we can just move to uh judge questions and the obvious one is like what what inspired it what made you decide to do this um yeah so as i said the video it was just a a good way to to show people how much money they would have made like to try to lure them in basically into yeah um getting into the the d5 world yeah like you had a friend that you wanted to convince so you figured like hey i'll make a site for them exactly exactly that's that that's a plan yeah that's a cool use case actually thanks it'll be uh interesting interesting if you also displayed you know how much it costs like in in gas to a pin to these uh uh these landing poles and also uh what was the um hardest thing like that you encounter like what was the most difficult task um when you're building this it was actually getting the data from the graph because there so the subgraph that we chose to use there were some inconsistencies so i think in march the if the usd price was changed to usd with or the other way around so that was you know figured it out but it was kind of tricky to figure out and the other ones went pretty smoothly one question from my side so you right here that uh you send notifications via sms and email did you implement sms no i don't think you is that the right project i guess yes i'm not sure uh okay okay maybe a feature for the future sms notifications okay we'll get on that actually yeah you're right i i i i opened the the the wrong yeah oh good uh so actually another uh feature that takes into account the gas prices would be the um break even so in how much time you will break even depending on today's uh gas prices but again with today's gas prices this will unless you're a whale is going to this is going to take a long time so yeah cool neat project thank you thank you thank you all right yeah thank you for presenting we're gonna move on to the next project and that would be yaka [Music] and you can start whenever you are ready to go hello hey david here i don't think you shared your sound properly sorry why don't you retry it and share your sound no yeah in the bottom left there's a check box yeah okay now everyone thank you for your time first of all let me introduce to you our small team that has been working together for the past weeks david myself as a financial product manager alex our uh lovely smart contract developer and nico as our defy innovation advisor we have been building an mvp of what we call interest as a service platform and what we think it's the first product we can offer aiming to help the masses to start using finally ave from an easy to use an app where we call no loss invested so our product can be simplified in three easy steps so we have the the user the positive into the yaka finance platform and peaks and strategy from lower to higher yields and risk of course then from the interest generated our smart contract allocates the service the user has chosen so for example the strategies can be keep compounding the interest that's the easy one but it will keep going until the user decides reinvesting the interest into indexes like dpi for example or nftx or whatever but in this case using a dollar cost average strategy so we keep buying every week for the user or even that could be very interesting we could actually be a getaway of paying subscription services for the interest generated from avid well despite of the lack of time we've been able to deploy a small part of what we aim to build let me show you oh actually alex gonna show you how it works here we have our simple front end and first of all we created an erc20 token called yakadai this token value will be equal to a dice so if the user deposits 10 dies we will give him back 10 yakadaise as you can see here we have two boxes the first one in which we can deposit our die in the system and in return we will receive the same amount in yakadays the second box is used to deposit the yakadays in order to retrieve the die the yakadaise will be minted when the user deposits the dice and will be burned when the user deposits the yakadaise into our platform and here you can see that we have 19 dice and 110 yakkadis into our wallet to do this presentation we will use the metamask and well we will provide the system with 10 dice first of all we need to to confirm the approval and then the transaction to the smart contract as you can see here the amount of our wallet refreshed and now we have 80 dice and 120 jacket eyes and the system has a 10 dice these dice that the system has will be sent every day to ave in order to earn an ap why this part is not working yet because we had some troubles with the deployment of the ave into our in our test net uh just to finish like everyone is saying one of the hardest thing to find in defy is to uh to find an easy user experience right to capture the the new commerce the masses so we aim to keep building this product believing this is the tool for these new commerce and to finally get them to the to the crypto ecosystem so thank you for your time uh we are ready for your questions thank you so i i hate to be that guy but you know paypal and credit cards on there how are you going to deal with chargebacks actually yeah that's a good question right if you win if you want the adoption it's actually taken from from taurus so and if we think that of course are they gonna uh have the banking license and we can they can be actually the on ramp so why not right i mean that option have to be from from this side i guess it's taken from turtles so so the answer is you're separating your concerns uh you're not actually doing onboarding or on-ramping right no leaving that to taurus okay yeah that makes sense of course we know that uh we we started pretty late and we it's the beginning of course we'll keep building it but the idea is actually it is right so we learned that there's a lot of innovation around here we think that the adoption has to be the the other side and we want to focus from from here from my side i can say the idea is great um once we we implemented all the learning and the the interest what we got we used for uh for paying for gas costs for transfers of the g-director so actually you can so you you have kind of like build a framework where you can just put everything behind that right yeah we said that actually like the rdi model right we would just uh send that to wherever we want even we can actually use it for payments i guess right so we focus that we have deposited 1000 and with that we get enough to pay a metric so it goes there so yeah interesting service yeah uh so in the dac you mentioned that the users can pick the strategy you know more risky or less risky uh but in the uh the actual demo i think i saw like just a way like a only one like uh like a way to convert die to yakada so how how are people choosing their strategy yeah that would be of course with the in the front uh after debusseting but um yeah it should be you choose one strategy so it's the strategy and then later you choose where you want to allocate that right so it's once it's deposited you decide in which uh smartphones are gonna be actually sent that jackalai to adai or c9 or wherever makes sense oh okay uh i see uh okay i thought the echo diet like the value of echo die you know changes uh based on the strategy that's it's uh i mean it changes traits that are that are placed as part of the ecosystem well that would be just our uh the certification that you have deposited by actually that jacket is going to be compared to adai or sedai or that the dye or ucc or whatever that's gonna get the interest related to the strategy okay yeah thank you all right i think that's that's time for this project thanks for presenting david thank you so much for your time guys thank you thank you cool idea all right so we have two projects left and i know sergey has something which may prevent him from seeing the last project but that's okay if he drops early we'll just do the last project separately but next up is jerome jerome you can start whenever you're ready you're muted jerome by the way um hello so in this project uh it's a bit continuous what are we doing from the last interior my ghetto up the volume a little he was to develop a library from scratch that is able to interact with the blockchain in c using kind of international programming language that make the possibility after 12 more simple interface for the end user to write the programming [Music] the goal is to be able to make a low-level programs that we insert in high security device slash hardware security module or like hsn key as well a key with secure element to be sure that the data and the processing that is linked to the blockchain cannot be act by anybody so last time i stopped sending transaction i was not able to sign correctly the transaction so now see that i work on this so now transactions are working and i work also on smart contract core so the idea was to be able to get the right data to be able to call smart contracts it has taken more time than expected but i make it work with a a vp smart contract so to so that's my card you can see it's more like drag and drop blocks code style when you make create a program it compiles the program with the same code and when you execute it runs the program so in this case um it's about 10 seconds which will be fine it's just running two smart contracts called from aav so when it's deposit and another one is withdrawal so here's the day of the transaction [Music] and if we go to this transaction we see that it calls the deposit method with the right quantities so it's kind of seems trivial with javascript application that's more seeker that can be embedded in low level computer it's different um you so the idea is to have uh user and if that's quite simple it's still a bit complicated but more time to simplify it so you get two smart contract calls you want you get the address of the smart contract uh the gas maximum amount of get that you want to spend the function that you are calling is the amount of room that you are sending and the different value that you first of the call that will be your wallets and so the one is not used and same for the withdrawal same address with rule and different parameter for the wallet yeah i didn't have all the time to finish what i wanted but uh i think i will need another question to make something really useful for the end user for this okay thank you you said you didn't have time to finish everything you wanted um what's next what i i assume you're gonna keep working on it at the next eighth global hackathon or at east denver or something like that like what's next yeah i will try to advance a bit on this denver the idea is to generate automatically the block uh from the smart contract api so i have already the processing and after i will make the block so you just like put different values that correspond to the smart contract call without making an more automatic way for developers to unbutler the tools quite quickly so can you also make transactions or can you only do eve calls uh and also another question that i have is uh you know you mentioned it could be useful in like you know embedded devices and things like that what are some of the use cases you think uh like this uh uh you know like what are some of the interesting use cases you've thought of that could take advantage of it okay so yes i can do anything like a transaction or contract call um the things that i want to do it's it's to be able to have the the full program running inside the secure element for example you have a ledger key and you just design your code put the code in your laser kit and everything will be run inside the laser so there is no interaction with the computer and there is no act possible between and same for the server working this more long time for my company using hsm so hardware security module the servers that are used by banks but they are quite low level and the idea is to use them to embedded some ethereum code that be able to process batches without the intervention of the user or anything external i have one question um so what i asked that you brought everything from from scratch in c right yeah i use openssl library from c and i had some um some some function to match with eta room because there is a bit of different crypto that the standard ones crypto function use and that was at the last hackathon but unless the telemarketer i didn't finish this because i have some problems signing and my signature was not good all the time so now it's stable and i added the ability to call smart contracts cool can you push your code maybe so it's possible to read it on github because there's nothing pushed i can put the end user code but the rule code uh it's thousand and thousand lines of code so i don't really know which part of the code you want to to have like this what you've wrote on hackathon okay yeah we tried kind of xml and the editor is not released publicly or maybe i can give you access to my editor that make more sense for you so you can have a look to it just yeah share what you can share i would like to take a look uh sounds great ideas like have also implementation for hsms so it runs more secure yeah yeah cool okay sorry so can i push uh how i do it i push to use the url or how how can we you have to you you you you set a repository here yeah just push what you can push like c code maybe i don't know c generated code so it won't be too funny to read but yeah i can push it yeah yeah i do it right after yeah cool thank you very cool okay thanks uh sergey are you are you going to drop or do you want to just uh push through this last project so uh we can just at least do the presentation um morgan if you want to just start cool drum okay thanks see you next one can you hear me now i hear you [Music] okay gov 10 take back attention contribute to a future homestead with others the goal is to optimize well-being in new city developments the problem is to prevent crypto attention depletion and d5 by building a credit network for builders with land developments and users with biofeedback data to align incentives towards positive nature utilization the solution is planetary government software for building new land development institutions via globally pooled credit ethereum holds a unique balance between attention or spirit and matter in the traditional world creating a type of dark matter potential that can confer new rapid development in projects to unlock and redistribute focus on embedding contacts back from the intention and living into growing land and reconnecting with nature under economic stasis like the cova pandemic possible planetary redistribution begets a possibility for people to shift to local scopes gov 10 has an embedded biofeedback put option as an attention take back mechanism to facilitate the gov10 nft warrant over a period of time a portion of escrow funds can be used to purchase an nft representing biofeedback data also called spectrum demand option by attempting to create a new medium new economies may form whereby biographic coupons represent future cognitive value for institutions and researchers it becomes possible to form new land metrics and bioregionalism projects by focusing on a cross nation alternate funding model to put another way you can consider it like staking memories in a place before you've arrived by embedding the context of bio well-being data in a gov10 loan repayment positive incentives become aligned in new ways so that we might explore a new geopolitical rotation possibility the gov10 ui uses 3js to be used as an in-home hologram possible risks include illicit data unpaid loans single project takeover which has possible prevention mechanisms using gov10 you can either go to a place as a user or build as a builder you can build for certain pools decided by the users by feedback you can then create an off chain listing by lying off a the approval of the credit amount uploading files related to the project and choosing the location for such project you are then given the option to have a portion of the repayment done via spectrum demand option which represents future cognitive biofeedback data after signing the transaction payment to the portion the funds are escrowed in the contract as a user or delegator you can first choose a buyer pool that appeals to you from your profile you can then go and choose a project you want to deposit funds into and delegate credit to as a final step you can review the loan and sign your data key saved on chain for the biofeedback data and at this point two nfts will be amended to you a bio data and another warrant for the project access once your pool in place has been decided you can then participate in data sharing rituals in virtual mindfulness rooms by revealing your swarm to the developer pool and your biofeedback data after this point the borrowers or the developers can deem the key from the blockchain and plug into the swarm pool stream they can have the data sold to research institutions and possibly those that are building such projects participants can be comfortably included by using a headset fitted to a pair of glasses or used during any other activity hi um yeah um maybe i'm i don't know i'm dumb or something but uh you know i was hearing lots of terminologies that i'm not familiar with like you know cognitive biofeedback data or like swarm revealing or biological well-being is this like uh like could you give give an elevator pitch um like of like that summarizes about it as uh like can you explain like on five please sure so you can think of it like if you're moving to a place where a land developer is building a house for you you can repay that person in the option of using biofeedback data or you can think of it like if you're extracting data from part of your let's say medical bills or something like that you can contribute that data to be sold to the developers that are building the place that you want to be living into okay go ahead yeah what is biofeedback that i mean yeah so it represents uh the data that you get from uh taking measurements from let's say your your body or um some type of portion of your biology so like my aura ring or my fitbit or my apple watch or whatever like so i'm i'm giving this but how like how am i i'm sticking it in ipfs like what's the yeah right now i'm just using that project uh but in the future i would i would probably use ipfs um right now it's just stored locally on the computer and the purpose that i think that a way to on-ramp users is to be more mindful of the community and thinking about the data being shared as a portion of you being a contributor to that data so it's not just stored globally but the only way to access that data is to be a portion of someone else's pool okay so i in the in like the developer thing uh example i'm i buy a house part of the agreement is that they get access to my data pooled with everybody else in the development for a couple years it could be a couple years uh could be just a window uh that could be set up as the portion of what's agreed upon at the start of the time um and is the idea that the developer can then sell my data and that's the remunerator part or is it that they understand how i'm using it yeah the idea is that the uh the developer is more like an institution builder or some type of research focused developer and they would be buying that at at sort of a chain link to oracle price of the nft representation so i like it would be less traditional developers and more people focusing on new types of communities or new types of institutions in certain areas i don't want to say charter city because that's that's not necessarily the focus the focus is on something a little bit in between something that uh yeah optimizes for well-being okay so it's sort of like analytics for the developers sure like in developing the community so what was the last question yeah like it's like it's analytics to measure you know how how well they did in terms of like you know providing well-being to the residents like of the development uh in the time in which they're not living in the place so um if they haven't moved there yet they want the developers want to make sure that the people moving to this place have positive well-being or are let's say folk trying to focus on that and they can provide metrics to represent that as a coupon for purchase at a later point i see okay okay cool yeah it's super futuristic yeah i was gonna my only comment is like it seems like you're overlapping uh or you're you're bringing together a lot of different domains so i'm curious what like how you got engaged with all these different areas and what inspired you to bring these all together like some personal experience or like first pass job experience um i would say that a lot of the hackathons along the way from youth global has been pretty useful um then with this project i started thinking about how aveda loans can be incorporated into new type of local economies with types of stable currency and then i couldn't solve the problem without using some type of you know advanced reputation system to align the incentives between the borrows and the uncollateralized loans of the of the lenders so i thought that it would be an interesting thing to try to tie that back into a positive feedback loop thinking about the wellness of people moving to a place so um yeah it was definitely projects along the way and then and a project that uh close to me is is like trying to match the sort of like a futuristic side with like a natural well-being side gotcha cool that's that's good to know that it's you've engaged with the hackathons and that was part of your process getting to this point so i'm happy to have played a part in that thank you very much i think we can wrap there uh thank you morgan for presenting um thank you cheers morgan so yeah that's that's it i want to thank everybody who's presented it looks like we don't really have anybody who stuck around uh besides the people who just presented but thanks to pete evan and sergey sergey had to drop for this last project but i'm sure he'll be looking into the the project profile and he'll reach out with any questions um so yeah uh this was session eight um a bunch of good projects i want to remind everybody that the finale will be thursday from 12 to 2 30 eastern so um we'll be reviewing all the projects collectively all the judging scores and then reach out to uh any of the projects that ranked in the top tier and then you'll present again to the the finalists panel that's all i've got uh thanks again to the judges uh and everybody who helped put the hackathon together all our sponsors it's been a really great month of hacking building stuff like that and that's it we'll see you in the discord or at the finale if you're joining us there see you guys
