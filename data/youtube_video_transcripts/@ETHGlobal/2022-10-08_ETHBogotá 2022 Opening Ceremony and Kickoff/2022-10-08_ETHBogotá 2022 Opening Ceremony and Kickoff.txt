how's everybody doing welcome everybody I am kartik I'm one of the co-founders of Youth Global and I am super excited to welcome all of you to eat Bogota so let's start off by making a statement but before we do that I want to welcome all of you watching this on eveglobal.tv we're going to stream everything that's happening this weekend live for those of you who couldn't join us you can catch everything immediately on YouTube by heading over to eth global.tv this applies for what I'm saying now which you'll hear in 20 seconds to all the workshops that are happening all over the building so this is not a conference for those of you who've been to our events before you'll know what Global events are all about we run hackathons the goal for all of our events is to focus on Builders these are places where you can learn you can get help and grow and get better at anything that you're excited to learn more about and most importantly we believe showing is more important than telling so everything you're going to see this weekend is going to be about seeing what you did and not talking about what you did so with that I want to welcome all of you to eat Bogota officially this is already an incredible event we have 1400 people in this building 900 of you are hackers and we have people from 62 different countries coming in all throughout this weekend making amazing things and talking to all of you especially as our partners we put everybody on a map to see where everybody's coming from and it's so amazing to see the representation we have from so many different cities and countries around the world and not only that we have 34 of you who are brand new to web3 as developers joining this and building something in webpody for the first time and 3100 of the entire audience is from Latin America so please give them a big round of applause on top of that we have 30 workshops on so many different topics and just three talks this is not a conference so we're going to focus on three things that we think are super important tomorrow we're going to talk about ZK tooling and how do you make safe and secure smart contracts so you can see all of that on the schedule I'm going to go into all more of those details soon and on top of that we have 350 people who are here from all the protocols that we love 12 people who are here just to make sure you get help from anything Technical and 43 incredible partners that are going to be giving away amazing prizes and talking about anything that you can build using their protocol and we're giving away half a million dollars in prizes this is officially one of our biggest events in terms of prizes the attendance and the energy I want to quickly thank everybody who made this event possible so the the more you collapse the faster I'll talk so I want to give a big shout out to Aztec ipfs optimism polygon scroll SSV wallet connect web through Yacht World coin AP1 Boba cartesi coinbase Cloud chain safe Cal swap ens

do that let's talk about all the things that you need to know for this hackathon I'm going to cover everything that's happening in this venue we're going to talk about how you can get help all the prizes of course all the workshops we're going to talk about the most important piece which is judging and also if you're still looking for a team what can you do to get help there and find potential teammates but before we get into all of those let's talk about security really quick as a rule everybody must have their wristband and lanyard on with them at all times this is a private event in a private venue we have security they are in charge of making sure that they don't let anybody in who does not have one of those two or if actually both of those on Durham at all times and uh they will be asking though you will be asked to leave the venue if we cannot find a wristband and your lanyard with you on top of that we recommend that you don't hang outside at night so we're just recommending a curfew which is from 9 pm to 8 AM don't wander too much outside this is a building that's open 24 7. you can absolutely be here the entire time whether it's 2 A.M or 2 p.m and security is there 24 7. so in case you need help with something you can always reach out to anybody there's always going to be multiple people on every floor on top of that please make sure that you don't leave your items unattended of course this is a a building that's secure however we still want to make sure that you're not just assuming things will be fine and just leaving it or going home and keeping your stuff there so make sure all of your valuables are with you at all times all right enough with the serious stuff let's talk about the venue there's going to be three floors that matter for this entire weekend and the third floor only comes in on Sunday you are here on the third floor which is where we are this is the main stage onto your left and every other room in this floor is a hacking space so a thousand of you can find enough space in any of these rooms and work and hack on your projects on the second floor which is where the registration was is where all the workshops and talks are happening so anytime you see a workshop or a talk you can find those five rooms downstairs on the second floor what's not here on the map is the fifth floor which only comes in on Sunday all judging will take place on the fifth floor and we'll tell you more about that over the weekend but for the rest of this weekend only these two floors matter and these venue maps are across the floors everywhere printed out large banners large printouts you can check this out and also you can find this on your dashboard and on our Twitter and on our Discord and every other place we're doing this and we also have amazing things going on so there's an nft Gallery by noun style Amigos uh you can check out the gallery there's a lot of cool fun stuff it's a mini festival carnival here uh you can play some foosball we have a photo booth you can take selfies on the second floor as well right next to the other side of the registration we're also doing a workshop on how to do traditional weaving this is a local uh experience that we want to make sure everybody has and we also do this for every city we go into so you can check this out tomorrow from 3 to 5 p.m also on the second floor and that's kind of what's going on all this is also on the website with the official schedule let's talk about communication all these things are more important for here everybody here should be on the global Discord uh not only is just you should be on the Discord but you should make sure that you have access to the right permissions on the Discord channels through your dashboard whether your partner or you are a hacker the second you log into your dashboard right just going to the website you will see all the specific channels for this event that means you can talk to anybody else who is part of the the hackathon as a hacker you can message all the teams that are out there from a protocol site and get help you can message all of our mentors and this is also where we're going to be doing an official announcement so in case something is running late or something changed or something is going really well you will see all of that on Discord so and let's not forget even everything is on Discord and you can reach a thousand plus people there you are in person so if you have any questions to one of our partners and you want to know how a specific protocol or API works just walk up to that table and ask them in person don't be afraid to uh not interact with each other since this is an in-person event on top of all that we are also giving us some uh we'll be sending some important calendar invites for some talks and of course all the judging related things so keep an eye out for for that and the official schedule and also the master copy of the schedule is on the website which means whatever the website says is what's happening so if something is running a little bit behind or early it likely won't happen you can see what's on the website because we will update it and whatever the website says is what we'll be following more stuff the website bogota.heathglobal.com if you haven't been there yet you can head over to that or you can just go to eveglobal.com click on events and head over to the eat Bogota website all right so a lot of you are first-time participants at this hackathon so how does this actually work well I'm proud to say you can officially start hacking now you can start working on your projects you can work on your projects with up to five members you can also work on your own you don't have to have a team necessarily and you have 36 hours well more like 36.5 hours from here to submit your projects and celebrations are due at 9am on Sunday we're going to all those details but before we go into how submissions and judging Works a quick note is that everything that you're going to be doing this weekend must be starting from scratch you cannot extend your previous project you cannot work on new things or you cannot work on a project you've been working from before and you cannot add new features to something you did before even if it was a neat Global hackathon we want to make sure it's fair and consistent with everybody else's experience so anything that is not submitted that is submitted that wasn't started until today will be disqualified from all prizes and also from the hackathon of course the other key thing here is that only the RSVP hackers are eligible to win prizes which means that please log into your dashboards and see that your team members show up on your team section if you submit a project and you forgot to add each other to your teams or you miss one person and you had four at the time of submissions and post submissions we will only honor the people that were on the project at that time which means if you win something we will only giving it to four people and not five and of course there's a lot of edge cases that happen a lot of you here are from so many different kind of uh not only ideas and places but so many things that change based on different contexts if you have any questions or you want any Clarity even if you want to just confirm if something is okay make sure that you can just reach out to us you can come to me you can find anybody at the registration desk you can ping us on Discord or you can just send us an email we'll be monitoring all those channels and of course lots of amazing talks this entire weekend majority of the workshops are happening in the next 24 hours we've already started about three four hours ago all that information is also on your hacker dashboard all that is also live streamed you can watch all of it on eat global.tv so if you missed something or you want to just check back or look at the code again you can go back in that video pause it and make sure you have all the contacts you need and of course everybody would give a talk is also still here at the venue so you can also just find that speaker and ask them any follow-up questions for anybody who's still looking to meet potential teammates 10 30 2 hours from now we'll be meeting on the second floor in Workshop room one and we'll be running a formation Workshop where you get to meet other people who are also looking for a team so if you are still in that position you want to either join a team or you want somebody to join your team because you need some specific skill sets you can head over to this workshop and meet others who are also in that situation not only that there's also a tool on your dashboard where you can use different filters whether it's I need somebody who's expert at solidity or react or any other language or or protocol or framework and use that to find others who are also looking for team mates and you can message them on Discord right after that all right so let's get to submissions submissions are due at 9am on Sunday and right after submission deadline we will start our judging process judging is broken down into two streams there's going to be a main judging and a partner judging all of those things happen at the same time and in parallel so what this means is that everybody who is participating in submitting their project will have to go through a main judging process and if you are trying to win some prizes from a particular partner you have to go to a second judging process with them so let's go into the main judging first each team will have four minutes to demo we recommend that you record your demo as well as a four minute video just in case something goes wrong whether it's the internet or your midnight transaction taking too long or something breaks right at the time of the demo and really don't don't do this don't don't do this last minute it will take you at least 20 minutes to get everything ready you have to really put in all the prizes that you're applying for you have to make sure you write it down you have to write a description of how it works to make sure you link your source code all these things are going to take 15 to 20 minutes at a minimum please please please start that early you will be able to start submitting your projects tomorrow morning and you'll see the form what it looks like and everything else around it so you just get to see that and just don't do this last minute all that also happens to your dashboard so when submission deadline is reached all you have to do is click on my projects page again you will be walking you'll be you'll walk through all those things you need to fill out and you get to specify all the prices that you want and you press submit and that's all you will have to do and we will take it from there next up is partner judging so one the most important piece is that if you do not list which prizes you want to go for we have no way of knowing that you wanted that so in your submission process make sure you specify that I actually want this project to be considered from this protocol or this company because there's no other way anybody else would know because all that is part of the submission process once that happens all of our partners will automatically get to know which teams are applying for their prize and from there you get to walk up to them at their boot all that is outside on the third floor and go and just demo what you built to them while the main judging is happening so you can do that right after or right before because once you go for the main judging you'll be assigned an order so you will know where you are in the queue and that means if you are a little bit later in the thing you can go to the partners and present your demo there and then come back and be part of the main judging again so we'll make sure we communicate that even more over the next uh two days and you'll be we'll be there to help you as well but make sure that you put everything in your dashboard and of course our code of conduct this is an in-person event this is an event we have so many people from so many different places and I want to make sure that we talk about what being at this building means our rules are outlined in on our website eat global.com rules uh this has our code of conduct and also what it means to be a participant at the event the gist of it is that anything that you create this weekend is solely owned by you which means that you are the only owner of that intellectual property no partner not youth Global nobody else will have claim to anything that comes out of this and in terms of how to behave in this building the gist of it is please be respectful harassment and abuse in any form will not be tolerated and we will take immediate action so if you see somebody or if you are in a position where you are being treated the way you shouldn't please come to us find us immediately and we'll be acting on that ASAP and of course if any questions about anything I've said not just this slide but anything I've just sprinted through 20 things in five minutes just come find me I'll be here I'll be here the entire time and I'll be happy to clarify anything for you all right let's go into some more interesting stuff so a lot of you know what Eve Global is but not a lot of you have been part of this and that is such a great thing because every time we do an event we see 50 to 60 percent of you who are joining us for the first time and not only that that makes it even more possible for us to do what we do which is bringing more developers into this ecosystem this photo is from our very first event this photo was taken four years and 360 days ago and we started off with a one-off event and somehow things went spiral I would say 2018 was unintentional but the rest were so we ran really really small events just to see if we can keep more people excited about ethereum and it became bigger and more wilder than what we ever could imagine we started off with our very first official one in Buenos Aires we did India we did San Francisco Singapore Waterloo Cape Town London uh Amsterdam this year New York this year Mexico just two months ago and and here we are in Bogota we we started off by doing hackathons and we found other ways to get more people interested in in web 3 and we introduced what we call Summits we got to be able to bring more people online through async format so not only if you were a hacker if you were just trying to understand what's happening in any of the topics that you care about we introduced Summits from from Linkin Park to to the merge from a few weeks ago all this became more and more amazing for us to introduce to so many people around the world and a lot of people were disappointed that we couldn't do a lot of these events with covet but we were so happy because anytime we did an event it was 10 times bigger and we couldn't be more happy to reach even more people with online events and next week it Global turns five so I want to take a second to talk about all the amazing things that have happened in the past five years we've done 38 hackathons 38 different Summits we have over 70 000 people have attended these events online and in person 4 800 projects have come out of it we've given five million dollars in prizes to people from 100 plus countries on top of that we've done 1300 talks all of which we made available on YouTube and we didn't realize people were watching that so when we looked at all the numbers we saw 1.2 million people watch these talks over the last three years alone and these are 300 Unique Individuals watching really hardcore technical workshops where they see people debug code and they're watching them intently and when we pull up all these stats 160 000 hours worth of workshops and Technical content has been consumed from 130 countries from people who've been at this event spending 23 different time zones it's incredible that we had so much amazing set of people come in and I am so proud to have the opportunity to welcome and thank all of you so not only were those stats just cool but there are so many things that we couldn't tangibly count the number of companies that have been founded number of money has been raised from these companies the ecosystem we've helped bootstrap the thousands of jobs that have been created through this all the friendships that we started the people we've met the protocols we've improved the swag that's been collected and the pull-offs that have been claimed some of these are countable but we didn't have the time to count them but all these things were just amazing side effects that make this even more and more incredible of a community and today I'm proud to talk to you about what's next we're going to be introducing using two new things as part of the youth Global portfolio of things we do for this community one of them is guys and the most requested thing we've been asked for is jobs guides is something we're going to go all in on over the next few weeks we launched this thing two weeks ago softly for our last hackathon guys it's going to be our way of making it easy for everybody to understand how different protocols work at their own pace you don't necessarily have to be at a hackathon you don't have to take out time you can learn whatever you want to learn on however every protocol Works whether it's solidity to a really complex thing you get to talk through a interactive tutorial and learn the basics and the fundamentals and build on top of that to be able to change anywhere from your career trajectory to just learn how cool things work Eve Global guides is already available on our website you can head over to youth global.com guides and this Sunday for everybody who is going to be in this building you are going to be able to apply to be part of our jobs board where you can find Opportunities to meet other people who are also hiring in web 3 whether it's our partners there's a lot more people we work with hundreds of companies we work with on a yearly basis and we want to make sure that you have the opportunity to actually change the trajectory of your career and we're going to make that possible very soon so five years in we're gonna do four things that we're going to be really proud of hackathon summits guys and jobs and I can't wait to have all of you be part of these and ultimately eat Global wants web 3 to win and before we go on to our rest of the agenda I want to thank everybody hacker Mentor partner speaker judge volunteer everybody who's ever been part of all of our events a sincere thank you for being part of this community this would not be possible without you and we're so excited to have the opportunity to be here and talking to you about all the things that you can do in the future so thank you so much and I'm excited to tell you what's next so what's left is when I talk about all the prizes that you're going to win but I have a special introduction I want to make before we get to our very first prize announcement I want to bring on harsh from epns to talk about something that they've been working on and I'll ask him to introduce himself here and uh and tell you more directly from him I'll ruin any I'll not ruin any surprises hey well thanks Karthik I don't know how I can top that speak but yeah hey hackers what's up so uh I'm hush founder and Project Lead of push protocol previously epns or ethereum push notification Service uh we are going to talk about the Journey of F3 communication over here uh people uh where we are and where we are heading a lot of nostalgia in this deck because of course we started from it Global so yeah let's get started so yeah uh you might know or you might not know but everything that we do in our virtual Life starts with a notification uh just think about it when we are talking on WhatsApp with our friends are we really talking on WhatsApp no not really we are talking on WhatsApp through notifications uh when we are doing uh crypto Twitter is are we really going on crypto Twitter not really we are just talking through crypto Twitter through notifications and you know you can expand this further uh whether we are talking on Discord whether we are talking on uh slack whether we are checking our emails venmo Paypal payment Amazon delivery uh you name it everything starts with a notification but yeah the big surprise notifications for web 3 actually started from each Global 2020 and we cannot really thank you Global for whom I mean we cannot thank enough for it so yeah moving forward uh let's look at the journey how we started so just like how you guys are starting uh we had a cool idea and we thought let's write to ethereum Foundation about our idea uh well they said that the idea is cool but go ahead and apply for hack money 2020 and build it out uh that's what we did and we are so thankful that we did it because one of the best decision that we made for our product and our protocol was to build it on uh built it through hack money the reason for that like there are several first of all ethereum Community is awesome but yeah the reason why you build it or the reason why you build your project through hackathon is because you have access to the world-class talent and the world class support uh we got to know what we are thinking right about our protocol we got to know where we need to head and we of course made a lot of friends so right over here at the last screen we are getting judged by Mariano Conti Patrick and Minto and we have the pleasure of calling them friends now so yeah that's what it Global does to you it just takes you protocol and makes it so so much beautiful uh so yeah that was the start of epns from 10 to now we have raised a seed round we have raised a series a we have launched on ethereum we have launched on polygon we have uh sent over 18 million notifications to over 60 000 subscribers uh we are empowering notifications for all our friends over here and yeah that's where we are right now but yeah one thing we knew like when we started notifications we knew where we are heading notification needs to be the basic communication primitive that needs to be built but once you build it out you can build so many cool things with it you can have so many new forms of communication you probably get I'm heading with it so yeah introducing the next evolution of pre-communication push chat uh now you're finally able to talk to your web free wallet addresses what's more it is symbolic with push notifications which means whenever you are chatting now you're getting the same experience which you get when you're chatting on a web 2 app like WhatsApp or Telegram and so forth but yeah enough chat let's do some video and here we are as soon as it buffers [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] awesome [Applause] thank you all right as he said we love all the hackers and that's why push chart is going to launch right after the hackathon ends what's more anyone who's building on push protocol gets the exclusive access to push chart instantly uh another thing we have a very limited push chat Pro app Edition like only 10 of them uh find us find me or our crew we are in Candy Bank shirts and just get your poo app the first 10 people get them all right and uh yeah push chat is not the only thing that we are doing uh we of course have bounties we have ten thousand dollars in bounties so whatever protocol you're building we would love to support just go ahead and build it out and yeah in case you want to continue further we also have a 1 million Grant uh in case you have any questions as I said cotton candy shirt we are all across each Global uh for the entire three days but you can also go ahead to our Discord and get Support over there and we also have a live Workshop so in case you want you can find everything you can do with push protocol right now awesome uh I mean I'm very excited to unveil the next step of communication from each Global just like we built notification back in 2020 and yeah I would like to thank Karthik Jacob and all the awesome friends we made over here thank you guys amazing we want to use more of our events as an opportunity to show off all the amazing things that come out of it the hackathon doesn't stop or hackathon stops on a Sunday but what you're building doesn't so uh this is going to be more of a recurring theme and with that let's go into all the prizes so you can all get started working on on your hackathon projects so first up I'd like to invite Josh from Aztec to talk about what Aztec is going to be giving away in prizes please welcome Josh hi everyone is this working cool hi everyone my name is Josh and I'm leading devrel at Aztec um it's been a while since my last Global hackathon but I'm really excited to be kicking off Devcon week with all of you so what is Aztec um Aztec is a zero knowledge zero knowledge roll up on ethereum so what I mean by that is we are a zero knowledge we're all focused on privacy um Aztec rolls up user encrypted transaction groups that reveal minimal to no information about transaction data and Aztec transfers are truly private um interactions with ethereum through Aztec connect only reveal transaction amounts not any user data so and so as a roll-up Aztec provides cheaper transactions in ethereum and we are working towards a fully private execution environment on the Aztec Network so Aztec connect um as to connect is like a VPN for ethereum it allows you to interact with ethereum smart contracts directly from the Aztec rollup hiding transactions under information this allows privacy when interacting with dial contracts nft contracts D5 protocols really any contract that lives on ethereum so as that connect also decreases transaction costs by batching user transactions and all you need to do to take advantage of this is build a bridge contract that connects the roll-up to any ethereum contract we are also offering prizes around Noir Noir is a programming language for writing zero knowledge proofs and it's an integral part of creating our future private programmable execution environment it's it makes it's how app devs will write smart contracts for Aztec when we have private execution and it's not exclusively for writing applications in a blockchain context so during this hackathon we want to explore applications Beyond just writing things for ethereum or other blockchains for prizes we have twenty thousand dollars in prizes available and we want to help you win this money so any of these things sound interesting to you come find me after this or any of my colleagues and we'll help you figure out what to build and how to build it since the merge I've been hearing people ask about what's next for crypto I'm betting that privacy is an integral part of the next wave of adoption so help us make it happen good luck and thank you thank you well I've seen so many people talk about they want to build zkp apps so this is your chance all right next up I want to call in vic to talk about ipfs and filecoin so please welcome week on stage hi everyone uh it's really great to be here at Eve Bogota how do I click this yeah yeah oh sweet okay my bad yeah it's great to be here at Eve Bogota my name is Vic I'm a research scientist at the crypto economics Lab at protocol Labs I'm excited to talk a little bit about ipfs and filecoin and uh the rapidly growing ecosystem we hope some of you will already be a part of or want to become a part of brief introduction to epfs ipfs looks to make the web more peer-to-peer so the idea is it's a hybrid media protocol where as opposed to centralized offerings via like HTTP this the ipfs leverages this idea of content addressing so you know specific nodes can interact with one another in a way that to kind of share data in this in this peer-to-peer format filecoin is an incentive layer on top of on top of ipfs in order to build a truly crypto powered storage Network our ecosystem is our strongest growing asset in growing the falcoin network and web 3. we are a rapidly experi we are rapidly expanding in storage capacity with about 4 000 storage providers with almost 20 million terabytes of capacity already committed uh to to the network and that that is growing rapidly along with uh Express explosive growth in startups as well as a wide community of diverse Developers this means that Falcon is more than just storage it's all the things that build on top of this you know kind of base layer primitive it's computation uh it's retrieval markets and decentralized content delivery uh it's fevm and smart contracts and user programmability and it's also leveraging the verifiability component of blockchain to generate sustainability sustainability initiatives like filecoin green funding the commons and and in public and public goods efforts which if you would like to there's a sustainable blockchain Summit on October 12th where many members of Falcon green will be talking about you know our vision for our regenerative future leveraging crypto we've linked some learning resources for developers and people who are looking to learn more about ipfs and Falcon one thing we'd like to highlight which will be featured in our hackathon prize challenge is facultyao which is a platform that allows distributed computation over data that is hosted on ipfs Android filecoin you can check out the hackathon link here so we are also offering twenty thousand dollars in prizes across two challenge areas the first is a storage wizard challenge area where we offer prizes for building on top of nft. storage or web3. storage the second is compute over data which is the backlier project I mentioned earlier uh so see the links for you know further details but we are really excited to see what kind of projects you all come up with uh and if you have further Tech questions feel free to ask them in the eat Global Discord the ipfs filecoin channel uh and if you're interested to learn more about ibfs and Falcon in general please join us for lab week in a couple weeks in in like two weeks end of October uh and join us for our first ever decentralized conference uh where we invite you to join us as we drive breakthroughs in Computing to push Humanity forward thank you all for your time foreign next up we have Kelvin talking about optimism so please welcome Kelvin on stage what's up green button um before I do this I want to tell my boss sorry so this less than 24 hours ago I was told I had to do this presentation I took offense to that so I had gpt3 write my slides instead those falling slides are not accurate in the slightest all right number one introduction optimism is the only serious blockchain that is actually completely accurate that is true all other blockchains are experiments [Music] [Applause] that is also completely true and optimism is the best L2 on ethereum no doubt about it all right let's see what we got next what is optimism optimism is a scalable trustless decentralized platform that enables real-time payments and smart contracts I don't know what that means that's true optimism that is not true I won't say that one I don't know what the OST token is sorry optimism is the only blockchain that supports real-time that is not true either but if it were true it would be very funny all right finally three what are the benefits of optimism optimism is scalable that's true it is trustless well okay it's decentralized you know optimism in Naples real-time payments optimism supports smart contracts that's very true that's true we do do that and it just repeated the same slide twice and so I will say optimism is the only serious blockchain and all their blockchains are experiments that's true that's the reality um and it's the best sell two on ethereum I don't know what I I think this is the end it's I [Applause] I'll just say uh optimism.io Bogota you can see everything about all the prizes we got twenty thousand dollars worth of prizes come talk to us we're right outside we'll tell you how to win them so thank you and enjoy have fun just like it's gonna be hard to top that one so next up we have Rahat from polygon please welcome her hot on stage [Applause] GM GM everyone how you doing are you ready to start building awesome so really awesome to be here today um we're talking a little bit about polygon uh especially here at eth Bogota I love being at the different youth Global events my name is hot and lead developer relations engineer over at polygon you might see my team running around everywhere doing workshops and things like that it's a little bit about polygon we started off as a solution to ethereum scaling using what's called a proof of stake side chain it was awesome amazingly fast secured centralized uh in 2017 we were medic Network and this was our primary focus first on scaling ethereum but uh because they realized that there is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all solution so we started looking into different ways that we could help all types Solutions all types of uh different uh use cases that exist so now we're aiming to be a Swiss army knife for ethereum scaling and then for development there's two major types of solutions secure chains or LT aggregators you'll see a little bit of alpha coming out in the very very soon about ZK Roll-Ups and things like that um but we've got other Solutions like Standalone side chains EK roll ups um you've still got your Matic POS plasma side chain we've got different solutions for Enterprises as well Enterprise chains and shared security chains uh building on polygon why devs love polygon completely backwards compatible if you've already been building on ethereum you know how to build on polygon solidity still works JavaScript still works all your favorite tools still work in the SQL system we've also got twenty thousand dollars in prizes here's a little bit about them how you can win them we have four thousand dollars for best use of polygon ID I'm gonna come back to this in a second four thousand dollars for the best local lat down public goods or refi project four thousand for the best metaverse or gaming project and four thousand for the best ux a little thing to note about number two and number four they have additional requirements for you to actually uh win them uh you have to add a couple of things in your readme including for the Latin public goods one how this benefits the local community as well as how you scale this globally on the best ux we're going to challenge you to really tell us how you're raising the bar for ux and web3 scaling is not the only way to get people in for Mass adoption your apps need to be usable there's also an additional four thousand dollars in the pool prizes I deploy at least one smart contract polygons test net a little bit just include all that information in your readme all this is available online as well coming back to polygon ID you can start building on piling a ID today documentation tutorials are available to help you get started my teammate Steph did a workshop earlier you can watch the recap of how do you build with polygon ID on the global YouTube and you can get support a lot of the eth globe a lot of the polygon ID core team is here developers everyone here to kind of like support you building through polygon ID for the first time so thank you really awesome to be here can't wait to see what you built [Applause] see awesome next up I want to bring on scroll so please welcome to girl hello everyone my name is togulmar I'm of I do research at scroll as did Kelvin I also found out that I'm supposed to do this presentation around 24 hours ago but unlike him I didn't bother to do anything so I decided just to YOLO so what a scroll scroll is a native ZK VM layer 2 solution for ethereum uh we're a zero knowledge roll up and our mission is to be as compatible with ethereum as possible meaning that from a user perspective you'd interacting with ethereum and scroll should be indistinguishable also for the developers sorry I forgot about you guys um so uh we uh the way we achieve it is through a z KVM implementation specifically our Z KVM implementation is a bytecode equivalent implementation built together with uh ethereum foundations privacy and scaling Explorations team and the use of this implementation in particular allows us to reuse a lot of the code that currently exists on ethereum so basically you can just use a minimally modified version of Geth extract the execution traced over transaction prove it in our approver and that's it it all works that's fine and uh talking about ethereum alignment we're completely open source from day one so you can view all our code online and we're also Community oriented meaning that you are more than welcome to join our Discord Etc and give suggestions or contribute to any of our code and Oh I thought that was the only slide okay so if you follow this link you can join uh the wait list the white list for our pre-alpha test net which is a proof of concept implementation of our protocol which with a couple of the apps works of popularity apps deployed on it and we also have a workshop later today Peter from our team is going to be doing that I'm not going to spoil on what he's going to talk about primarily because I don't know what he's going to talk about so I'll be joining you guys to find out and we're also giving away 5K in prices same as with the workshop I have no idea what you have to do so just join our booth to find out that's it from me thank you next up I want to bring on Ariel to talk about SSV he's walking Mario on stage hey everyone I have to say I feel a little bit cheated they said I have two minutes but everyone is showing like 20 slides um money's shortened to the point so it's better by default so let's begin um my name is Ariel I work at a company called blocks which is the core developer of a cool project called SSV Network for those of you who doesn't know us SSV stands for secret shared validators and it's a decentralized infrastructure for ethereum staking and it was designed to be used to build high performance secure and decentralized staking applications on ethereum now we have some amazing prizes for you today to to hack our top prize is of twelve thousand dollars for the best team to build and staking pool that uses SSV as its backend we also have eight thousand dollars for the best teams to build the SSV as a service and we had a workshop earlier so if you missed it and you want to learn more about the project I was told it's going to be live on the Eid Global YouTube and if you want to learn more about our prizes and what we really require and find all the resources you might need in order to do them please go to hackathon.ssv.network it has all the info we are here to support you you can reach out in our Discord also in our booth by the way we're having we're hosting a a Super Smash Bro tournament over the weekend so if you need to unwind just have fun come by we'll glad to have you um so yeah have fun guys can't wait to see all of your amazing submissions and remember that optimism is probably the only real blockchain thank you [Applause] well with the merge SSV is going to be more important all right next up I want to bring on wallet connects so please welcome Pedro and Vanessa on stage you got fans Lord hello thanks so hey uh we're Pedro and vaness and we're here on the behalf of wall connect wall connect for those who don't know allows you to connect wallets to dabs and we've been a project since 2018 and we have both the wall connect V1 and walconnect V2 which will allow you to build both multi-chain applications for v2 but also introduces like push chat and off and sign so we have like a modular communication stack and yeah Vanessa if you'd like to talk about the bounties and how you guys can build then yeah I'll let you take it from here all right hi everyone my name is Vanessa and I'm a developer Advocate at so let's talk about prizes we've got twenty thousand dollars to give away this weekend um we're our bounties will include V1 and V2 so our V1 track um if anyone got to stop by at our Workshop earlier today we demoed our new modal so if you're using the modal you are using V1 so you technically qualify for that bounty we also have a VT track so if you want to be using one of our newer apis like our sign API you will also qualify for that V2 bounty and yeah we didn't really prep a deck for this so this is our Workshop deck here but yeah we're wallet connect and come check out uh us at our booth today see ya [Applause] right next up we have Zen from web3 auth please welcome Zen on stage thanks Karthik hi guys sorry if I seem a bit tired it's because I am um 28 hour flights uh but when I landed I tasted these pancakes something like a repos or something amazing stuff you guys should try it out it's just fantastic um now it's green no all right fantastic okay all right so I'm one of the co-founders of web3 off and um I'm here to talk about web 3 off in particular what we do so what we do is Key Management and what we try to fix is seed phrases now seed phrases I think all of us have heard stories of people losing private keypads they're not just irritating to onboard onto but you know actually about estimate about 20 of total Bitcoin which was worth about maybe 500 billion dollars now maybe 200 um is it was a lot it's just lost you to Lost poly private Keepers and how do Enterprises fix this though so you know big Banks hedge funds vs how do they solve Key Management they actually use this thing called multi-party computation and this might sound a little bit complicated and overly complex but it's it's the go-to solution for them and what it really is is it really is just a multi-factor key so um today what we're focused on is we're focused on pushing out our multi-factor key application or SDK rather for any application or wallet to use for your users themselves so you can leverage on that same technology and that same security as well as user experience how it works is as it as as it suggests we split a user's key into multiple different parts the first part is kept on a user's social login and the second part is kept on the user's device the user can set up other factors as backup factors and ultimately what you have is a non-custodial social login where the user owns the full public private key pair but uh you can get the benefits of the social login itself so we have been a war around for a while and we're used by quite a few applications with about seven million users a month at this point and we are releasing our Early Access Alpha MPC SDK with regard to prizes prizes are for that SDK as well as if you really want to integrate other parts of a stack that's cool too uh we have three tracks with regard to prizes the best overall app will get 6K and we have 20K in total and prizes the best overall app takes 6K uh the security track the best app there takes 4K and then we have our God identity data track which will take 3K and then use case or ux track which also take 3K each of them also have 1K runner-ups as well so lots of different prizes to win and here are some ideas that you guys could do for each of these different tracks just to exemplify I'm not going to go through all of them because that will be way too long over two minutes I think I already busted that but like with the security track you could be building a smart contract wallet on top of MPC you could be delving into our security policy engine and building daily limits time locks YC AML on top of that um with identity you could be utilizing the combination of web 2 and web3 identity you could be uh using our encryption and decryption API uh to use encrypt stuff that might be private to users uh and with use cases you could do payments you could just have silky smooth UI ux and this is where you can go to learn more we also have a booth outside and we want to help you guys win those prizes come around talk to us we'd love to build with you guys and see what you guys are building thanks a lot guys awesome and welcome our last speaker Miguel from worldcoin yeah I'm Miguel and I'm here to get you all to look into the arm yes Kevin I am here to talk about uh civil attacks and why that's a thing that you should be worrying about even if it's not an error that you're making or something like that uh because this is a thing that can impact pretty much everyone that is building here we've been hearing a lot about like people that are building really cool social apps with user creation all those things um and those things are vulnerable to still attacks as well where someone can just make an account or like make thousands of accounts and build their content and then your whole system  up and so we have a solution for that we have a protocol that permissions that anonymously allows you to verify that a user has never done an action before and that is not only claiming a token but it's also minting nfts voting on governance proposals and any other thing that you would want to do this for and it's called 1av like I said it's a protocol to anonymously verify that someone is a real human being that is performing an action only once and that action could be anything including web 2 actions like during the Discord server um and yeah the way that it works is we have this art right here which will look at your iris get biometric information uh hash it so that we no one keeps the environmental information and then give issue a key that you can use to you know it's you know its proofs uh prove into any application that you're a real unique human Without Really revealing any information about you like I said it's completely Anonymous meaning that even if you use this in different apps with completely different words this time you will not dock yourself it's really the only solution to this problem that actually presets for anions anonymity and we all know how important privacy is in these things and yeah integrating it is really really easy this is pretty much all of the code that you need on your front end you get approved with this as you know it's proof which you can verify both on chain or through an API which will also call on team but it's easier to do and yeah you just have this captcha it's a JavaScript like widget powered by wallet connect that shows up on your website use a scan the QR code with their app and you're done that's it and it enables a lot of really really cool stuff a lot of stuff around governance curation uh solo and nfts like there's a lot of really really cool stuff that he enables yeah all of the resources that you want are both documentation protocol starter kit a bunch of talks that we've given including the workshops that we gave a few hours ago we'll be at that link and also we have about literally right here at the outside of the door so come talk to us we've talked the orb to speak in Spanish that is actually not a joke the Earth speaks Spanish now and some of our team members do so any questions any issues any help we also have really cool new documentation that looks amazing and yeah you have all of the resources that you may need we have 20K in prices um a bunch of best governance application best social app application most creative use case and then best overall and honorable missions a prize pool for every qualifying submissions that we get even if they don't get any other prices and yeah good luck awesome that was our last speaker to be on stage and now I'm going to go through all the prizes and we'll get all of you to get hacking so 500 000 in prizes to be one that is a lot of money so we're going to talk about all the price I'm going to summarize some of the ones they've already heard so first up is optimism optimism is giving twenty thousand dollars in prizes they have a lot of different categories so the best developer

noses chain quick note the graph ceramic Network lens protocol ripio Moonbeam chain link chain safe autonomy Network D gate and open Zeppelin giving five thousand dollars each in prizes all those details are on bogota.ed global.com prizes or if you just go to the main website you can click on the prizes button or if you're logged into your hacker dashboard you can see all the prizes there once you click on any prize you will see all their documentation you can see all the workshops whether it's live or recorded and what you need to do to qualify and win those prizes so I encourage all of you to check this out and go crazy on seeing what amazing projects and protocols you can integrate and simplify a lot of work so you don't have to start something from scratch so with that I want to close this off and really kind of tell everybody to make sure you pace yourself we really don't want this thing to be exhausting for you there's a whole weekend of learning and talking to people and understanding what everybody's excited about we really want you to make sure that you get to get better by the end of this hackathon and you get to have fun and you get to learn more than you knew today and this is very much about experimentation and learning so even if you don't get to finish what you started what you wanted to do you can still present and we encourage you to still present on Sunday and show how far you got to all of our amazing judges so with that let's get hacking and thank you so much for joining us edit Bogota foreign and then I'm the only thing okay so I think maybe I do maybe I will baby one of these days somebody says somebody pays to me I was just a game and I've been waiting so long maybe I think maybe I don't maybe I will maybe I should try to live this time um
