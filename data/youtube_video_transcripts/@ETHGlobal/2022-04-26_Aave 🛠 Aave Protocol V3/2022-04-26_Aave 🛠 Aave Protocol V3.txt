[Music] [Applause] [Music] so welcome everybody for coming to this talk we are talking about ibv3 my name is tabit this is my player michael yeah we are going to learn more about the other protocol a new features of the three yeah first of all what is basically is a decentralized protocol a liquidity market that allows uh users to supply cryptocurrency a provides liquid to the protocol and has some yield of it it is also a other reactor that is the borrowers that can can draw liquidity from the protocol ua but putting a collateral first they can use analysis of collateral in a supportive market like ether die and also there is a another actor it's the regulators that take care of the healthy of making the people healthy they basically litigate positions basically paying back the death of borrowers that have risky positions or they are near underculturalism their like a one month ago it has received a lot of well it was well decided by the other community and basically we got the average market that is now with around four billions of liquidity located at the protocol and by the using liquidity incentives by the avalanche project and also we have the outer markets that are with with a liberty around between 5 million and 40 millions with organic growth projects in six networks see different networks and yeah we also have more markets like the amen market and now miguel will talk about the the new features about of of a3 and yeah thanks david so yeah the third iteration of the ave protocol builds upon the foundational elements of the abbe protocol which are instant liquidity the a tokens different interest rate strategies and so on and so forth win with new groundbreaking uh features that expands from the increased capital efficiency to an enhanced centralization so yeah let's dig into the some of the new features of this third iteration of the protocol first in terms of capital efficiency we have portals so yeah given the fact that we live in a multi-chain and motivated world having a way to migrate tokens from one chain to another in a seamless way is more and more important these days while the previous iteration of the protocol the version 2 was deployed on multiple networks with meaningful tbl is true that there was no way to have all the supply assets flowing seamlessly from between chains so this is the point of portals portals is a new feature of the core contracts of the version 3 of the protocol that allows to allow the supply assets to flow seamlessly between chains so in high level it leverages the unique design of the a tokens so wireless that bridges are able to take a tokens from the users in one chain and being a mint those a tokens into another chain so first we will need bridges that plug into the portals this kind of bridges will be named as ports once they are kind of registered in the system they will need to to call a couple of functions new functions that are in the in the in the pull contract these functions are mint and backed and backed and backed the first one allows the bridge to mint and backed eight tokens which means that these all these a tokens don't have the underlying assets with them and then they will need to use the the other function which is called back and back which allows to back those a tokens that were already already minted so portals essentially allows these bridges to supply assets in other firm manner so when a user wants to move their ia tokens from the source network to the destination network first the bridges will take the tokens from the user in the in the source network then instantly mint brand new a tokens in the destination network and redirect it to the user and once the underlying assets the real liquidity has been moved through the bridge could be the canonical bridge of the chain or whatever breach in the in the ecosystem then they will be able to back those already fresh new minted a tokens with the underlying so at the end the destination network will have all the a tokens with the corresponding underlying assets so as you can imagine this feature is really interesting because it allows the users to move the a tokens from one chain to another without losing a penny of a dollar and without the need of and winning the position which is really really cool also the efficiency mode this tries to increase the the utilization of the capital that is sitting in the in the protocol because as you already know there is a lot of assets and capitals that are are currently sitting either in the protocol so this is mainly cause because the the risk parameters there is parameters in the system there is one of the risk parameters in the system which is called the collateral factor the collateral factor determines how much of an asset a user can borrow using an asset as collateral so having a 75 collateral factor on die means that a user can borrow up to 75 die with 100 diascolateral so if the protocol is able to increase this collateral factor they will be able to increase the borrowing power of the users and thus increase the capital efficiency of the protocol which is really good so as you can imagine it's not so deep on the the the collateral factor of uh the assets in the previous iterations of the protocol were a bit uh conservative because all the assets has its own characteristics its nature and even price different price volatility so as you can imagine it's not the same having a user borrowing usdc against if than having the user borrowing usdc against die the later position is less risky for the user and also for the protocol so this is because mainly because both assets are stable coins and also because those prices are those assets are correlated in price so that's the main point of the efficiency mode what if we are able to group the assets in categories with the same characteristics same nature or the same price volatility so is we can increase the borrowing power of the users in that cases so in the protocol v3 there are high efficiency modes categories we have the stablecoins category with usdc dye esdt or even the europars also we could have um btc variants or it is if variants and let's see what's what's coming from the community in the future it's going to be interesting so when a user enters a e-mode in one of these categories let's say for example stable coins the user will be able to enjoy a hybrid wind power using stable coins as collateral but they will only be able to borrow a stable coins so they still can supply other assets and even use them as collateral but only with a stable coins they will only be able to maximize their borrowing power so right now users in the stable e-mode they enjoys a 97 percent of collateral factor which is really good because they can borrow up to 97 die with 100 dioscollatera so these features will bring a wave of new use cases and new tools in the ecosystem like for example high yield hygiene farming strategies high leverage tokenized positions also diversify risk market risk because you now can split your assets in in categories so yeah it's going to be nice now more on the risk and security side first we have the supply and borrow caps this security measure is pretty intuitive because this creative measure allows the community to set hard caps on the supply on the amount of the supply assets and the borrowing assets so in this way the protocol can control and modulate disposer to certain assets in some way supply and borrow caps together with isolation mode is a good combination and interesting combination to modulate the exposure as i said but also to list assets in a more secure way so until now usage assets when are listed in the protocol allows the users to use that assets as collateral and borrow any kind of assets in the protocol so theoretically we could we could have a user borrowing the whole capital of the of the market using one single asset as collateral which is far from ideal because that would mean that the protocol is completely exposed to that certain asset so isolation mode which is uh inspired by the maker dial i don't know if you know it but in maker though you have different balls and you can on these bolts has some a particular asset for each and they also have the adapt ceiling so you cannot mint more than the f ceiling using that specific bolt and that is specific collateral so installation mode works in a pretty similar way users in in the the community can list assets in isolation mode and users using this asset as collateral which is isolated they only will be able to borrow up to a certain limit of assets so for example in this case we have the token 2 which is listed in isolation mode with a dev ceiling of 10 million and that will mean that users can use that that token 2 as collateral but only they will only be able to borrow up to 10 million dollars worth of assets in stable coins so as you said this is an interesting way to modulate exposure and also list assets in a in a more secure way and yeah all of you can imagine having a new asset into the protocol first listed as in installation mode then keep on going with supply and borrow caps finally maybe without any other security measures at all which is good also the price oracle sentinel yeah this oracle is uh is really specific for layer 2s because and gives increases the experience of the users in those in those networks and this price oracle sentinel allows to handle eventual downtime of of the sequencer as you may already know the sequencer are the entities that are in charge of submitting and settling transactions in the network so if the sequencer goes down then the network essentially stops working so during this downtime we could have price variations and these price variations could affect the user's positions in some way so if when the sequencer goes up and the network starts working again these users could have these positions affected since all the price variations come into play at once so in order to mitigate this scenario the protocol introduces a grease period which is a duration of time that the users are able to fix their positions in order to don't get liquidated in some way yep the centralization in the third version of the protocol there were also some improvements in terms of the centralization and in the previous iteration we already have some a permissioning system where [Music] all the roles were specified with their responsibilities but in this version this permission system is more fine-grained and more sophisticated and also there are some new roles in the system that brings new ways of doing things let's say so we have the risk admins and also the listing asset admins there is the risk admins is a specific role of the system that has the ability to change the risk parameters of the reserves without the need of a governor's boat these risk audience could be daos or any other entity or even automated agents that react to specific events or metrics and change the risk parameters accordingly they can change the risk parameters or also the the interest rate strategies of the research as well and also we could have the we have the listing admins which are which has the ability to list assets without the need of going to a governance proposal which is also interesting because we could have some new strategies of listing assets and this is a kind of a of a way of delegating the governance of the community of the protocol to some other entity out there so one of the discussions that have been in the in the community forum is the the permissionless listing so what if the a community of users are able to decide which asset which asset they want to list so they can stake some a part of this of these assets in the protocol and use this this assets as a backstop in case there is uh that something happens so yeah really cool also as you can imagine there is a bunch of new features in this third iteration of the of the protocol some of them are more uh users are facing futures some of them are more in the technical side but yeah for example it's good to mention the repayment with eight tokens so now this increases also the experience of the users as you can imagine and users now are able to repay the the their debt with eight tokens so they didn't so if a user has a debt of uh 100 usc they can provide 100 a usda to repay the debt this as i said increases the user experience but also helps the protocol just in case uh the underlying assets gets locked in the other pool contracts for for some for some reason also the there are the there is the introduction of the permit function and the eip 712 to the credit delegation function and also the introduction of a simplified version of the flashlight function with a reduction of 28 percent of gas costs this is only in the case that the user wants to to flash loan one asset instead of an of a set of assets and yeah there is many many more but in general the code was reorganized and also optimized so there has been a reduction of 10 or 15 percent of gas consumption across the world across the world so which is really nice that's pretty much all yeah um we created some tools to help you to build on top of ave the first one is the sandbox the that is tools allows you to to integrate or to fork a network that has a v3 deployed with a simple command and it spins a hard cut node to say market yeah it's also it also allows you to file set the assets that are listed in that market within an easy way and also it allows you to connect the diabetes open source front-end to this local sandbox or this local hurricane loan um yeah in this way indicators come will safely er at the top of markets in production but in also in the same time a local local house that is much faster to develop and yeah the only dependency that you need is a node.js you can find the the repo the qr code and also github.com yeah we also have some npm packages with a smart contracts and also some utilities some helper factors that help you to develop a new front-end front-end for away or a different dashboard that you need the audience contains all the helpers to interact with the protocol and also contains all the math related with the with the with the protocols so it's quite nice we didn't use to build the wheels uh well as always you can check the code the other different repositories um [Music] and yeah right now uh here at the hackathon we have the the prices uh yeah uh we are reworking for the most innovative integration um yeah you can see the list of the prices um yeah it's on some resources like the developer docs that are quite complete and it contains all the definitions all the contracts are that runs um yeah there is also the diabetes down here in that link you can request for proposals maybe you have an interesting idea to build on top of it as a community member and here you can request a grant to develop that tv and execute that idea here next sunday we have a rabbit so yeah here is a bonus code that you can use is and that's it if you have more questions feel free to ask us so that's it thanks everyone for coming as you have one question okay of course here is the code what do you mean exactly are you a priest yeah so i'm wondering if uh exploring a new version of the protocol introduces security risks yeah i mean like any other protocol if you deploy any version you need to take into account how the upgrade is going to be of course if you are using some kind of proxy pattern like avidas you need to take into account the storage layout and you know keeping things retro-compatible maybe wherever so you need to take also things into account in in that way yeah sure yeah now they are running at the same time there is also some discussions in the forum to upgrade the contracts of the b2 market to b3 and that's going to be a challenge that's going to be a real challenge because yeah exactly so it needs to be backwards compatible also take into account all the functions all the storage slide out and this kind of things so yeah any more questions okay nice guys thank you so much for coming reach us out if you want to talk about ave or any hackathon idea or just about ibb3 or what's going on on other companies thanks for coming thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
