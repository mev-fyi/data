good morning good afternoon i guess it's just moved into evening for david yep good evening are we uh ivan good to go here andrew give me one second i'm having a little tech issue with the stream i'm recording now in case for some reason the stream doesn't work but give me two seconds yep i was just checking because i couldn't find it either you know why don't we start i'm recording if i need to upload after and i'm going to try to restart the stream in the background and edit it in because it'll take a second cool sounds uh sounds good all right let's get started um hey david thanks for joining us um hey yeah welcome um so so yeah so uh you know big big welcome to david welcome to everybody else who's joining us live uh you know basically you know we're really excited to have both david and avi at the event you know ave in particular has not just been a supporter of etho online but also earlier this year big supporter of hack money um and really enabled us to run that event in a big way um and you know really supporting us you know all last year and and many many events so um you know we're particularly thankful to have ave involved at etho online um and you know they've been a really key supporter and really enable us to run these events for everybody so it's been exciting to have them here um and excited to have david here to chat about ave and to chat about his um his experience and everything and uh yeah so i mean big big thanks all around basically yeah thanks for having me and we love being part of the east global events and i think they're the best hackathons out there so you guys are doing an awesome job appreciate that um awesome okay well you know david with the uh amas basically i'll give you i'll give everybody an overview here uh if anybody has any questions or anything that they want to ask david uh please this is an interactive session so you know drop a either raise your hand on zoom or drop the question in the zoom chat or or any way indicate and you know happy to have you come on and ask the question directly um so so yeah so keep that in mind you know as you're listening in uh this conversation for everybody to be part of um so yeah so maybe kind of a good place i think i'd like to start david would just maybe chat about sort of like how you first got interested into kind of crypto right um you know kind of you know where did you have your first kind of aha moment uh where did this kind of really click for you and then where how did you basically figure out that you wanted to you know move your career into into the blockchain space yeah that's a good question so a long time ago in crippling years in 2014 i first heard about um i knew about bitcoin and i was living in san francisco at the time uh and then a friend ben longstaff who uh introduced me to the theorem he said hey it's not about bitcoin but it's programmable and i thought at that time or that would be quite interesting more interesting than bitcoin for me so then i went uh went ahead and started getting involved there and then uh since since then i've been on and off uh in the space uh i did some work for coinbase as well a few years ago um you know experimented with solidity some smart contract things and then eventually uh i was on twitter uh as as we usually are uh and stani uh had posted something about um a uh with flashlights because that was when they had just been released earlier this year about flashlights and how it could probably be used in make a dao to help make a dial users in in this certain way and i had a look at that tweet and i was like yeah that sounds good and possible and i had some positions and make a dial as well uh that was uh that i also wanted to thought that that would be useful for um so then i created it and that was called collateralswap.com it's just a you know first version it works it's still online um and and so since then uh then we met at actually east london earlier this year as well that's where the video comes from uh and then uh from that then i got talking to stani and uh yeah then we got along and i met the team some other team in london and then that's how i started with uh yeah started with awesome so i guess in a way you're sort of you know one of one of the group of people that uh went to one of the hackathons i got to actually meet the people in person and that otherwise trickled into uh now a full-time position yeah yeah exactly and i've been you know building in a space and researching it a lot um before then as well but yeah that's exactly it i came i came into the space as a like developer or builder uh not as a trader so a lot of this sort of d5 stuff is is sometimes new to me as well so i had to learn a lot about finance essentially awesome very cool um and then you know i know you work as ave you know in as it's a small company and probably a variety of different uh hats and different roles um but i know kind of primarily you're there as i think a software engineer um so i guess maybe it would be useful just to kind of get a sense of uh you know basically what are what are you working on and what does sort of a day look like um as you know a developer at a large d5 project yeah sure um it's pretty crazy so there's there's a lot going on all the time so i think i think in the company uh maybe there's a there's a few people like myself that wear a few hats or prefer to wear a few hats whereas there's other devs in the company that only want to do development work um but for me personally you know we're on a call before this which is you know more about i guess marketing bd type stuff uh you know i do some development uh both like externally facing so for example the um gnosis multisig app uh i did that and then also i do some dev work internally and then you know i'm helping out developers with discord and sometimes writing documentation it basically changes every day and it really depends on the priorities at that time uh for now we're we're like for now we're preparing for the v2 release um so i'm involved in a lot of documentation around that and getting my head around that uh previously you know we had the rv token release uh so then there was a lot of work and i guess reaching out to be done around that um so yeah the day changes and and i guess the great thing is i i most of the time i get to choose um so sometimes you know i want to do heavy dev work and then get into what there's always lots of dev stuff to do other times maybe i'm feeling a bit more social or you know i want to help out on discord or you know do some sort of workshops and then like that's available as well awesome so i guess like uh i guess kind of similar to working at a startup you know really there's infinite amount of things that need to be done um and and a finite number of people so really it's sort of pick and choose and uh yeah basically focus on the things you want to work on the most basically yeah yeah so there's always a ton of stuff also i do the um i manage the grants program as well so that's another thing that uh yeah so if anyone um after this hackathon if you want to apply for grants um yeah let me know or apply through the grants process awesome uh yeah i think we'll chat about the grant program a little bit further as well um as we dive into this um and yeah i guess kind of a question i know you you mentioned you joined the team at the beginning of the year um so you know you haven't been a part of sort of the kind of whole from start to finish um but you know when i first was talking to stani i mean i realized that you know ave is uh was one if one of the first if not the first really d5 lending platform in existence on ethereum right uh one of the really really early ones um you know this year has been crazy with like a ton of platforms popping up very suddenly becoming widely utilized and everything um like the space is moving very very quickly so it's it's i find it in a way kind of surprising that um you know one of the long-term kind of uh projects is still around and as relevant as if not more relevant than before right so i guess my question to you would be like um what do you think it is can attribute to that right like what what do you think about ave being you know like how do you feel that ave is kind of different enough that it it maintains just extreme relevance um despite sort of a super quick moving uh industry right like how do you guys keep up and stay on top of things yeah that's that's a really good really good question um so so um yeah as you mentioned uh they started in 2017 uh as as eastland uh which is a peer-to-peer lending protocol uh so it's actually it was the first and we did the first decentralized loan uh or borrowing loan on ethereum uh so that was a long time ago uh and then the start of this year was when uh ave as it is now uh was released on mainnet um so i guess and eastland is no longer you know no longer there um so so it was like a i guess a pivot um but a pivot still in the same you know decentralized loans borrowing area and i think one thing that uh we do really well as a company is um you know we're always trying to understand and understand where the market's going um you know we saw that uh yeah the peer to peer lending space that was always a little bit difficult with matching up um you know people that wanted loans at certain interest rates or depositors that wanted to earn a certain interest on on their deposits um and the lending pool model just works well the money market model works quite well um and then that's that's sort of i guess how it happened um and yeah these days it's the i think the main uh what one of the major contributors to are they growing um dramatically uh since we launched was actually where we try and be as collaborative as possible um so we uh you know our documentation we try and uh make that as best as we can we're very we participate a lot on our community discord and we try and help as many people as possible um and we really like the grants program we try and encourage others to build on us you know we're involved in these sort of hackathons um so that's that's one of the things that we put a lot of focus on in the company uh to to basically get uh a lot of people building uh on top of us and that's where actually a lot of the uh let's say the deposits or a lot of the liquidity comes into our protocol from not not just from our website but from you know people built on top of us right yeah and i mean just for you know everybody who who didn't attend all the other events that that has been a part of i mean um yet to david's point i mean there are a lot of protocols that have come out of um these hackathons themselves that like do provide a lot of liquidity to lava and a lot of kind of deposits through um using the underlying protocol right so um yeah i think it's it's been amazing to see sort of the progression of these projects and go on to become kind of big pieces of the ecosystem but you know utilizing still you know these really amazing rails that are underneath uh the hood um provided by ave and you know a number of other kind of pieces of the puzzle right so um yeah that's been very exciting um okay cool so there's like a bunch of stuff that you guys are building so i kind of want to talk about sort of all the different kind of new pieces that come out um i think most notably uh like maybe in the last kind of couple weeks was the big migration from belen token uh to the new ave token right i mean maybe just kind of generally would love to kind of know uh what that was like internally right like moving kind of from one token and moving hundreds of millions of dollars of value basically to a completely new thing um what was that like was it was it tense was it interesting was it uh exciting like what was that like uh yes it's been it's been awesome uh so so the for context the the len token it's called len because it came from eastland the original protocol and then since we have ave now you know we renamed uh the token but also we there's some new tokenomics involved where you can stake the rv and things like that um so it was quite exciting uh for us as a company to you know create this new uh arvanomics that's what we call it the tokenomics model you know how can people you know participate more in the protocol how can we decentralize governance how can we give the protocol to to the are they holders essentially um so it was a long time in planning everyone in the company could like participate in discussions on how how the ergonomics uh evolved um and and yeah it was it was a lot was happening uh because we were a decentralized protocol uh you know the users have to migrate themselves right so you know at the moment i think we've had more than 70 percent of lend users migrate uh to the new rv um shout out to jason who just commented that they migrated the first day awesome so you had a lot of people that migrated on the first day and still trying to you know get the rest of the the ecosystem migrating um but you know of course it's permissionless protocol so uh very soon we're we're starting to uh give more power to the rv holders so soon uh i think that the rv holders will have have um much more nearly full control of the protocol so then at the moment the migration doesn't have a deadline but if the rv holders decide you know through governance through governance vote to insert a deadline it may force the the stragglers who haven't migrated yet to to migrate um but yeah it's been it's been yeah pretty crazy and awesome it's been hard as well because we're a decentralized protocol but these days uh there's so many exchanges and not just the major exchanges there's small exchanges and it's integrators so getting in contact with all of them and trying to just push out the messaging as much as possible um because sometimes you know people build on us permissionlessly uh so we don't maybe not aware that they're built they use us in some way right exactly i mean the interesting there's like a big long tip right of people that you basically need to convince to migrate and exchanges and smaller things that you know you don't even know exists right so um yeah that'll be the big challenge i mean i guess having a governance proposal that um otherwise renders it required uh you would have to migrate to then say that you don't want that to happen so i think it's a pretty effective method yeah um awesome and then uh another launch that's coming up for you guys and i think you've chatted about it a little bit publicly so i mean please don't share what you can but you know i'm thinking about kind of the v2 right the the kind of future of ave and you know migrating from from what was built at the beginning of the year or launched the beginning of the year to now the next version um wondering if you could chat to some kind of you know if if there's any feature sets that are available publicly of like what you guys are building i think there was a medium article from mark recently um you know i guess what are some of the highlights for you that like what are you most excited about yeah yeah um yeah i'm really excited about v2 uh it should be out uh it will definitely be out by the end of this year um so happening uh sooner rather than later and there's some really cool features uh you know for example a lot of people uh really love flashlights in arv v1 and but they only could use in certain use cases they couldn't use it internally within the rv protocol so now on v2 you can use flash lanes within the protocol to you know do various actions which expands the the design area a lot we have native credit delegation which is really cool so basically what that means is you know i can deposit funds uh into other protocol and say that hey like jacob you're allowed to borrow from my funds right um and then so then you can you know draw a credit from from that and that's quite powerful when you start talking about contract to contract interactions um and then there's other things like um well like collateral swap there's a collateral version of collateral swap in the protocol so you know if you're holding a certain collateral price starts dumping uh you know you're able to in one transaction uh swap your collateral into a different uh asset uh that maybe you know ensures the safety of your your position a lot better and so there's a lot of a lot of things around making uh d5 safer for users and also more seamless uh so then yeah just a lot of these interactions can just happen a lot easier than you know the the hackers and developers can can build many more things on top of it um and then of course there's the other aspects that we touched on in the article about margin trading you know in inbuilt trading functionality in the protocol which is which is also really cool awesome yeah no i mean it seems like it's kind of chock full with a lot of you know both i think quality of life increases and then sort of like a ton of new functionality that i think you know it will be exciting to see what people end up using that functionality for you know if i think there's one constant and defy it's that it is basically impossible to predict how people use these primitives um or at least it's like always people will find more unique ways to use them um so yeah no i mean i think i share your excitement on on sort of you know as we give people more tools um to see what people end up building right so i think this is gonna be a big big moment for the for the industry as well um absolutely cool and and then yeah the last thing on the kind of new stuff although this one is is a little bit older i mean we'd love to talk a little bit about you know the grants program right i mean uh you know beyond the fact that of course ave has a prize for for utilization and and use during the event of course there's sort of long-term grants as well um that ave gives out so you would love to kind of hear a little bit about sort of how you guys think about your grant program and then also like if there's any kind of notable recipients yet or anything like that yeah yeah for sure uh so the grants program uh you know we want to encourage you know hackers and developers to build on top of a you know we've already um given a lot of quite quite a lot up to round two of the grants um so we've uh deployed uh quite a bit of capitals to many different teams all over the world ranging from you know a thousand a day uh up until you know close to ten thousand um a day and and the current round two grants program and you can apply for any amount up to ten thousand uh a day uh but we prefer you to apply for something below 5000 a day otherwise it will you know there will be more it's easier for us to deploy that to the capital and let's say notable grantees uh it's quite a few i mean uh it's a boardroom i think that's a company that just uh raised some money vc money you know um they got a grant from us uh very capital um other gotcha of course is probably one of the big ones they came through i think one of the east online hackathons previously uh or at least at least dan dan dakota went through it um and yeah i don't know it's sort of off the top of my head we have a list somewhere you know they're intern so look i think i think your audio uh just changed yep yep so so avogadro you know they're they're in the uh you know gaming nft space and then of course we have you know other more like hardcore defy projects uh that also you know let's say like rari capital um so so there's a whole range of things we love to fund essentially any any d5 savers well sorry d5 saver for a combo uh so those are more like you know consumer facing apps or consumer facing businesses and we love to fund or we love to give grants to anyone that helps improve the ecosystem improves the user experience um or even that if you're creating something brand new like avogadro you know you don't have to build exclusively on rv um you know like d5 saver they provide a really good service just to the ecosystem um so yeah we we love to support projects awesome great and then just a reminder for anybody in the chat if you have any questions or anything feel free to raise your hand or drop the questions and chat or just mention you want to give a question um because i'm basically wrapping up here so um i i mean you know david you you said that you know you joined the industry or the you know as a hacker first or a developer first rather than sort of a trader first um and then you know mention like collateral swap as you know something you know put together relatively quickly i assume um as a nice utility so i asked this question to you know basically anyone i do the ama with but you know if you were at uh east online and actually hacking creating something uh what would you what would you be building on what would you be trying out what would you uh like what sort of something that you've been itching to create hmm that's a good question haven't haven't done all that i'd love to be hacking actually um but yeah i don't i don't really have the time unfortunately i'm probably not allowed to um but i i mean so i guess the the obvious ones are like you know in the d5 space there's a lot of stuff like help improve your farming help improve you know make help people gain a lot of little percentage points of interest um but but those those things to me i think it's the design space for that is sort of quite crowded and and i think um a lot of the creative ideas around that have sort of been done really well um i'd love i'd love to hack on stuff that may be similar to avogadro where something totally new right combining nfts with interest bearing uh assets like a tokens um or you know playing in the governance space you know what uh also what or even just making things easier from an end user perspective um so actually with the rv token uh there's a permit function uh so that allows gasless transactions and things like that so that you know makes things a lot easier for the end user and so that's really the things that i'd love to be hacking on is you know how do you just make these things easier for other people cool i think it makes a lot of sense i mean uh i mean i i think nobody is surprised that you know user experience is you know kind of lacking a bit still in the space i think there's been a lot of movement this year especially on improving things um you know whether that's like you know l2 or xdi or permissionless or like or gasless tokens like um but yeah i think there's a long way to go until we get to kind of web to usability if you will yeah exactly um okay so it looks like there's a question from raul um you can either ask that question live or i'm happy to read it out for a little up to you um thank you you can do it okay cool um also yeah so i'll read that so um roll says just wanted to know if you guys are having any plans to try to cater to the institutional investors by providing them easy and secure access to crypto um so yeah so basically you know is ava interested in kind of entering the custodial space at any point um you know obviously it's been a historically non-custodial defy um exchange so yeah are you interested in ever doing the custodial side i guess um so so we haven't announced anything related to that and personally i don't think we're interested in that so are they as the protocol is you know decentralized permissions um we previously uh this a few months ago maybe we announced that we received an email emi license so that's like a banking license in the uk um so we will have like a of a limited company that is you know may become sort of like a neo bank type thing uh but that's more about onboarding uh the general consumer into d5 not so much about institutionals and institutional custodianship uh having said that we work we prefer to work with you know people that really specialize in that you know so we we are partners within a number of custodian services and it's more like you know they do that really well uh and you know we just help them you know earn interest on you know whatever funds they're custodian um so that's not necessarily something i'd say we're looking into at the moment yeah uh hi i had another question yeah sure yeah uh so are you guys ever like money market protocol uh limiting yourself to individual cryptocurrencies or are you planning to add financial instruments like the kind token sets you are creating like d5 index like those kind of instruments are you planning to add them to the money market protocol um so we have um so to answer your question the are they uh market we have a multi-market strategy so we have the rv main market and that's where you know the billions of dollars are currently uh stored or that they're in then also we have uh alternate markets one of our first alternate markets was the uni stock market so that allows lps to use the lp tokens as collateral and we've announced plans to have other markets sort of likely a set market so they'll be like set tokens can be used as collaterals and then now since we have the avenomics and we're decentralizing the protocol these decisions around the markets and the parameters and the assets and the things that are allowed to be used as collateral and borrowed uh in those markets will be up to the decentralized governance uh mostly right so from our perspective where we're looking to mona push towards decentralization and we'll have our risks team at least in the short term that can evaluate you know what assets should or shouldn't be but from the perspective of you know what can potentially be listed uh that's really up to the the community and the governments uh to follow up uh this question uh so what do you think the like governance tokens like which are like which started with comp uh how will they be defined legally because they are not security tokens like you know they are more like loyalty programs so what do you think the legal take can be on them uh i i know it really depends on your jurisdiction with that um you know so we have our compliance and legal team and then they look into that um yeah it really depends where you are in the world and things like that so that's not really something i can answer yeah okay yeah great work yeah awesome thanks thanks for your questions yeah awesome looks like vince also has a question so vince you want to come on and ask them hey yeah i'm sorry i'm in the co-working space uh okay so my my impression just from the beginning of uh coming across ave talking to other people about it in the space is that you guys have done just a very good job of doing a balance of not only the security and usability on the tech side but also just an excellent like user experience which honestly in the d5 ethereum blockchain space is just sticks out a lot and i'm curious to know if you have some insight on how that's been managed how you guys have been balancing out you know keeping on a strong hard security power development as well as that balance with the usability user experience and keeping it just well designed it just seems like something that's extra challenging and you guys have sort of nailed it so far and i'd like to know if there's like some insight on how yeah yeah i mean that that's thanks for your kind comments um yeah we we do we are i'm proud of our work and of course it's you know a whole team effort um the uh where in internally i'd say that you know we're very much a rapidly growing startup um so let's say on the user interface or on that side we move fast and break things on the protocol side we're really slow we get like many audits uh on any sort of smart contract changes um so there's a bit of a separation there so on the protocol side you know core dance really careful take their time a lot and and things are a triple quadruple checked um and then from the ui perspective from the the user interface perspective you know we're really active on on discord and telegram and our community channels so anytime someone has a complaint or has something that they say hey this this could be improved or you know this this information is missing here or there um you know that that quickly flows into our our design uh design team uh who includes rowan who's our lead designer and who'll just knock up some you know some quick design and they'll be implemented pretty pretty quickly and so that's that's that's how uh i've seen it happen uh internally so that's how i'd answer that question right i think did i answer the question well i mean i i know other projects do all that as well but you guys sort of it's not you know a lot of your design and usability isn't i don't think drawn from someone saying i'd really like you know the design to look this way you guys just came forward with it already yeah true yeah the core foundation was designed yeah and what you also described at the beginning there you necessarily have to set aside some pretty hard expensive resources in your backend development just means you're drawing even more resources that way and yet you're still coming out with the usability um so it doesn't seem like you have any trade-offs here i mean it's always uh i'd say that maybe there's been a um a uh a a tough balance between let's say um managing and and not managing the process uh so so you know we we do move move rather fast and i think basically everyone in the company wears multiple hats so whether it's even on the non-technical side uh you know they can do they do many different things um so you know rowan is our designer so he comes up with those foundational designs uh and and then from you know nearly every developer can do you know a bit of front end a bit of back end um so you know of course there's you know things like v2 is being worked on now um and sometimes you know it's not doesn't make sense for the core devs to work on some front-end thing um so someone else will get pulled off whatever they're working on uh to work on the front end um so so the thing i think we've internally from the perspective all our devs uh we're all generally at full stack um you know we can dip it into graphql we can do the back end bit into solidity um so that i think that helps a lot uh because you know if you have a really good designer and you can do the designs then you know nearly anyone can can implement them uh if the changes aren't that great okay so just a lot of multi-disciplinary developers that can sort of move around consistently or constantly yeah yeah i'll say that's yes that's that's my how i'd think of it um at the moment i don't know if everyone in the team would agree with me but but that's that's what i think i think that's that's how it's happened uh there's there's i guess there's a lot of um let's call it reprioritization uh that happens you know whatever's like the most highest priority right now that that can change uh you know today okay so a question on that when when you have what you just called reprioritizations is that mostly managed at an individual level or is that sort of directive top down a lot of the time specific internal questions say that um i think stanley and jordan would agree with me that the companies are quite flat so there isn't really a top down i'd say uh astani found that he's he's finnish um and and i think they're quite the finnish culture is quite collaborative um so if anything there's a lot of collaboration and discussions uh not necessarily you know this needs to happen it's more like uh everyone's a user of of the protocol as well so everyone generally understands you know what's this is obviously a big party well this isn't a big party um sounds like a big part of it yeah but like we're a reasonably small team so we can you know just talk among ourselves and be like yeah well you know i tried this and this didn't work or this works so this would really help because you know we're all users yeah yeah the fact that you're using your own products and everyone sort of sounds like on the team is doing that that actually sounds really important yeah thanks david that's right good questions thanks vince all right awesome we'll pause for a second see if there's any other questions that come through not seeing anything all right well well maybe we'll wrap it up here um you know big thank you david for for taking the time to chat with us and uh with me and you know the rest of the people here um and again you know a big thank you uh to ave for consistently being a big part of these events and you know really helping people create really amazing tech uh with your tech but you know of course just in general you know being very very helpful and um supportive of what's what's going on here so um yeah big big big thank you um and and uh yeah looking forward to uh seeing everything that's gets built on ave in the next week yeah thanks so much for having me and um yeah love can't wait to see what everyone's building uh just make sure everyone uh migrate your land to are they and participate in the governance as well if you want we have a governance forum it's pretty cool awesome and then take a look at the prices that ave has at this event as well so i mean of course there's a lot of a lot of uh reasons to take a look at aves so um awesome all right we'll wrap up here thanks again all right thanks so much and catch everybody later all right catch you later
