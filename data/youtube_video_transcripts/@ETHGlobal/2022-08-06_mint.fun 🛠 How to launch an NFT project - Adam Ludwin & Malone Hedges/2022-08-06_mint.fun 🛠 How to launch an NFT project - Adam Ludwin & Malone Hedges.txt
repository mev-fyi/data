[Applause] [Music] all right looks like the stream's already up so that's awesome so let's get started so i'm really excited to have both adam and malone here from the mint dot phone team um a lot of people this weekend i'm gonna be building nft projects so i can't wait to uh to get through this chat and have this as a resource for people to build with as they finish up this weekend um yeah i guess i'll just get out of the way honestly and and let adam and moan take over but yeah really looking forward to this one um thanks for being here thank you great uh can you see my slides and can you hear me yeah you're coming through great okay awesome my name is adam i'm joined by my teammate malone and we're from mint dot fun and uh we thought we would tell you uh why we built mn.fun and then show you the product and then give you a peek under the hood how we built it and then if there are any questions we could take them so i'll start so mndot fun is a web3 service for minting the top new nft projects and to be able to do that from a single interface so it's essentially a primary market aggregator and if you have heard that we're in a bear market in crypto that's certainly true however if you look at minting data that is the number of mints per month on ethereum over the last 10 or 11 months you would not detect a bear market minting continues to grow and grow quickly month over month so even though we've seen slowing in other parts of crypto the volume of mints every month continues to go up and up and up and um yet there are like some fundamental challenges and problems around minting still that we sought to solve with min.fun and namely there are three problems the first is figuring out what to meant so in the universe of 10 million things being minted a month which is roughly where we are now in terms of individual items uh far fewer projects but still thousands and thousands of projects discovering those that are interesting and discovering them in time to mint them is a challenge uh second determining which of those new projects is safe to mint also poses a big challenge uh especially when the volume is so high and you have to move quickly to jump into mints before they sell out there's a risk that you would be uh susceptible to maintaining a project that might be trying to fish your wallet or might be stealing someone else's artwork and then you've paid either gas or amending costs to artwork that is licensed elsewhere and there are other various attacks or risks that you have to mitigate so figuring out whether something safe to meant is is really difficult still and then finally um just knowing how to mint a project that you discover and want to make isn't always easy sometimes you have to go to etherscan and decode a contract find the instructions on twitter and put in the right kind of sequence of commands to mint the project other times you'll end up on a project website for that nft collection and no two project websites are the same so they're usually straightforward but uh oftentimes just figuring out exactly how to jump through the hoops necessary to mint could cost you the ability to min in in terms of time so uh these are like kind of three fundamental challenges and with mint dot fun uh we're trying to solve all of them in a single tool and um this is why we call bintap fun a mint aggregator and we were the first product that did this that sort of aggregated every new project every new nfc project that's minting now uh in a single service that you could mint from so number one like figuring out what submit is easy on mndot fund because we present a ranked list of the top projects that are minting now ranked by how popular they are based on how quickly they're being minted and how many people are minting them so it's like a leaderboard of live top projects that you can see at a glance two determining whether it's safe to mint is simplified because we run a set of automated safety checks on every single uh project to see whether for example the contract is verified on ether scan and a host of other things and we let our community of mentors flag projects for a variety of other issues and when we see those flags we incorporate them into our score and all of that safety data is shared back to the community in real time so you know on the interface level whether something is suspect and you should proceed with caution uh and then three when you're ready to mint if you've discovered a project that you're excited about feel safe you can mint from min.fun itself you don't have to leave mind.fond and go to etherscan or go to even the project site to mint and we do not uh this is not because we've minted a bunch and we're reselling we don't introduce any additional fees i'll leave it to malone to tell you a little bit more about how that works under the hood but suffice it to say for now that you can mint from it.fun and it's the exact same transaction as if you were on the project site or on etherscan so with that i'll just uh show you the product working live so here we are in min.fun uh this is the home page i'll re you can't see your yours okay i'll thank you let me do a new share over here can you see this right now yeah awesome so here we are on mint.fun um so this is the homepage i'll refresh it and you'll see it's like i described a really straightforward leaderboard of projects minting now uh and ranked by popularity so this is how many mints in the last hour we also incorporate some other metrics like how diverse the community is uh in terms of number of wallets and so on so uh this one mud cats it's at 274 minutes in the last hour there's also six transactions currently in the memory pool so this is like very much happening now i'll go ahead and mint one of these uh you'll notice when we when you click mint now we present to you several options these are all the options we've identified for minting the project i'll go ahead and mint one item for free i'll try that first and i'll just be paying gasier just under four dollars and while that transaction is pending i'll just go to this project page and show you a little bit more about what we do so in addition to the various options that we present we aggregate all the metadata we can find on the project so that at your fingertips you can learn as much as as possible before you met of course i um i didn't do that i just went ahead and mentioned it but there's no safety warnings if there was one you would have seen that so you can see that the first mint happened very recently a day ago so this is a new project so far 496 items minted um and 226 unique mentors you always want to check unique mentors to make sure it isn't a bot or a small number of people minting everything we also aggregate the project website so if you did want to go mint directly on the site you can do that here or learn more about them on twitter go check out their ether scan contract or openc and we also show you the velocity the speed at which it's minting which if it's a multi-day or multi-week mint you would see a sort of flatter curve but here very steep obviously because it's a very popular project and then we show you the top holders the top mentors so someone probably someone affiliated with the project already invented 200 but others meant to 10 and down the line so finally like i mentioned you can report an issue so had you been suspect of this or if you had minted and had a bad experience you could come here and say look this contract has an issue or this is someone else's artwork or i know this team and it's questionable and you could explain the issue and we review those and then automatically incorporate uh based on certain rules we have um so that is in a nutshell how men dot fund works uh you can tweet them in if you want to tell people about it i'll show you one more thing and then we'll switch gears to telling you how we built this which is a view called trading which is really neat because we provide a leaderboard of not only what's minting now but also what just minted and so unlike other leaderboards that you might find on secondary markets like openc or gem which are extremely valuable if you're buying and selling nfts this is geared toward answering questions like for example in the last 24 hours uh which projects minted out the fastest which is something called we call that mint heat so you could say okay well what meant it out really really fast in the last 24 hours and here you go so if you haven't been browsing the website you just want to see what really like popped off quickly you can see that and then you could also look across and see ah some of them have some real volume as well going on on secondary markets uh or if you wanted to see forget how fast it meant it out just tell me in the last day projects that launched in the last day which of them are actually like getting traction on the secondary market uh and you can see this one bibos i don't know if it's bibos or bibos but uh this is one we noticed yesterday or i noted yesterday and you can see almost 400 and heath traded not minted but traded so had you come to mndot fun yesterday and minted one of these for free you would be in a nice spot right now because the floor price is actually quite high uh so you could flip these now or hold on to them and there's quite a bit of volume as well so kind of just a neat view of uh of what's happening that you can you can use to look at your the performance of projects you've minted or just kind of get a retrospective of things you might have missed so um i will pause there uh and uh actually i'll say one more thing and i'm gonna turn it over to malone the last thing i'll say is i've been describing this mostly from the perspective of users figuring out what to meant what's safe to meant how to mint and how mndot fund solves all of that for users but what about for project creators like how did mudcats or mfrs 2 or free birds or tiff bits or any of these other projects end up on mntap fun right now oh and here's a i'll answer that but first i'll just point out here's a couple of warnings uh this one was reported by the community this one's not verified in etherscan so this is examples of where you might want to proceed with caution a little further down the leaderboard right now so but anyway how did these projects end up on mn.fun did they come to us and submit any information no actually all you have to do to show up on mint dot fun is be an ethereum nft contract and have a sufficient number of wallets minting your contract and if you do that we identified automatically and we build this aggregated view we build out these project pages for you automatically we identify the options for minting automatically so you don't have to do anything to get this automatic project site okay so i will stop there pause there i'll turn over to malone uh to uh tell us a little bit more about like how we do this under the hood and malone would you like me to like leave it on the site or do you want to share your screen or just talk about the site that's fine um yeah so a bit under the hood um to start i'm just gonna go over how it came to be and and how we built the initial version um so this mint dot font originally started as kind of a hacked in uh prototype on uh context and we the way it worked initially was you go to somebody who minted something an event uh on context or somebody minted a nft and then from that page you could attempt to copy their specific transaction and while it was fun to do that it was still pretty there's a lot of friction involved in getting like finding what projects meant and also finding the right like sometimes this person's meant you'd be able to copy but this other person's been you wouldn't be able to copy um so you it was a lot of like you'd have to be searching around for the right transaction to copy um so then what evolved from that was okay well fundamentally how mint.phone works is we look at transactions on ethereum that results in a minted nft an amended nft being a transfer of an erc 721 or 1155 from the xero address to a different address and if a transaction does that we then go and say this transaction is likely a mint transaction and let's try to copy it and so then the next step with mint.fun was instead of copying specific people's transactions is we aggregated them by contracts so we would see all of the different uh function calls that people were making or transactions that people were making for a given contract and then the next step on top of that was okay well how can we filter out ones that don't work and the way we do that is we would estimate the gas that it would take to complete the transaction which is basically how expensive is the transaction going to cost based on the code that they wrote for this function and if you try to mint and the mint will fail the gas estimation will also fail they'll say i can't estimate the gas because it's not going to work so we have this list of transactions for a contract then we try all of them and say do any of these work and do they meant an nft and if they all do or the ones that do then we show those on the contract page um and then separately we have like the feed aspect to it which is more of a data than a like ethereum problem necessarily um and that we have a couple different attributes in there but it's basically like what projects in the past hour are minting very quickly and can be minted by a lot of different wallets so then that's a separate issue from actually how do you copy a minute from somebody else and by depending on the transactions themselves instead of having to look up an api on ether scan and using their api for that it lets us show a lot more projects than a lot of these other mint aggregators that have come along because we don't need to the contract doesn't even necessarily need to be verified for us to let you mint if that is your prerogative although it is generally more suspicious if a contract is not verified but you are still able to because of the way that we aggregate all the mint transactions um yeah so that's how the copy meant from the transactions work and then uh as i almost said before we show if a contract isn't verified um that data we're pulling from etherscan we're seeing is it verified or not just as a signal for a contract being suspicious or less suspicious and but we don't use that data in terms of actual product that's purely a like safety thing [Music] yeah so another aspect of how did we get this data aggregated is we used a indexer that we've built in house which we plan on open sourcing and basically we just as i said before we look at all of the transactions if it resulted in a mint then we copy all the transaction data and put it into a database so i think some tips uh slash like starter uh starting point for anybody who want to do something like this or just generally a project in the space ethers is probably like i mean basically any project that you're going to do and involving ethereum is going to have ethers and i built the initial version of mint.fun or not met.fun of the prototype using purely ethers there was no back end at all i was just looking at the transaction copying it swapping out some addresses in the call data and then doing that so ethers was amazing for prototyping and we still use it for actually sending the transaction and then some other libraries that were crucial where wagnee has great hooks for react that helps us like move a lot quicker not have to worry about dealing with the wallet states and then also we use a modal library so we don't have to worry about connecting all the different types of wallets that's all abstracted for us and taken care of by rainbow kit or connect kit any of these libraries that hook into wag me are really great and saved us a lot of time in getting that first prototype out [Music] yeah i think i think that's basically my spiel yeah so that's all we have we can wrap it up here or if there are any questions we're happy to answer them amazing um let me just check i know we have about a dozen people watching on youtube actually so i just want to check the youtube chat real quick to see if there were any questions um but otherwise this is great i also love the design for this by the way just like looks like perfect like playful slash like all the utility is there at the same time so this is nice shout out our teammate jesse jp awesome job on that yeah it looks awesome all right well yeah it doesn't look like we have any questions from the youtube chat but yeah like we have a dozen people watching on youtube so hello youtube um and uh yeah thanks everybody for for joining in for this one um yeah maybe we wrap it up here great please subscribe buy our merch trying to get to 100 million subscribers so yeah yeah subscribe yeah take over the world send social social media profile passwords etc actually on a serious note if you are interested in the project uh our twitter is mint dot fun so at mint dot fun
