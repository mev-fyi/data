okay so we are live and we are able to begin now welcome everybody this is hack money defy hackathon i am kartik talwar one of the co-founders of heath global and this is our day one of hack money judging now for those of you on the live stream who are not familiar with hack money hack money is an event that's organized by eth global and for the past four weeks we've had 300 hackers from 40 different countries and 15 different time zones working on making really cool stuff in the world and realm of defy and we've had people from all these amazing countries uh we've had over 30 mentors who have helped out our hackers from things like technical things for their projects to product help to ui design help and and even how should they take it to the next level if they if they are planning on doing so and of course we've had some of these amazing sponsors uh from the dfi world who have kind of put in their time and effort and their resources to make sure that every team that's been working on their projects for the last month um are set up for success and are able to accomplish anything they wanted to on top of their platforms and kind of really take the composability to the next level so let me say this again we have had 350 hackers they kind of spent the last entire month working on projects in the space for this hackathon and as of 12 hours ago i am excited to announce that we've had 118 b5 projects that have been submitted for hack money i can comfortably say that this easily doubles the number of defect projects that exist in this ecosystem and we've seen amazing stuff from new financial instruments to arbitrage bots to tools that make it easy for others to leverage and actually extend defy and on top of all that we've had so many attempts from our projects to make it super easy for these primitives to be used by everyday audience so there's a lot of stuff that we're still processing uh in terms of the kind of projects we've seen and everything we'll we're going to see this week so uh with that i want to kick off to how today is going to work so here's the quick logistics for everybody it's on on this call we have 15 teams here that are going to be presenting and we'll be giving them four minutes to demo what they built and then they'll have three additional minutes for questions and feedback and just that kind of gives seven minutes in total and if if some if someone is uh kind of moving along a bit later or uh we're just gonna not ahead of schedule we can sort of be flexible around that seven minute in total and split this up accordingly but just to keep everything moving on on schedule we've also made one little change here which is we've pre-recorded all the the demos themselves so when the teams come on we will be actually playing a video of those teams or the teams themselves will be playing this and they will get to talk about what they've done and answer any questions live so i think of it as a a two hour movie of 15 different trailers and we should see how that goes uh for all of us uh and we're also experimenting with this format so uh there might be some hiccups but we'll walk through them so it's a quick overview of how all of this is going to go so the rules and the criteria for this this hackathon were simple um a team could have five maximum team members and uh and that doesn't mean that everybody has to have a team we have a lot of people who worked on their projects individually but they have to ensure that there's two things that were accomplished one was they must incorporate the f5 primitives that exist in the space uh whether that's stable coins or building on top of another platform uh hack money is the theme uh that we're aiming for and hacking on money and also all code for this event must be written at the hackathon which meant that every project that you will be seeing uh was started uh just about four weeks ago on the 24th of april and as the judges sort of look at all the the demos and give their feedback uh they will be scoring projects on these five different categories uh and these will be kind of how technical original or practical a project is and in addition to to all those uh how the ui in the ux of that sad project is and a general catch-all category for what we call law factor that sort of accounts for any outlier uh that may not be justified properly in any of the previous four categories and and just so i can make sure that it's clear to not only our participants but also everybody in the live stream that this is not a competition uh in in lieu of the theme of how we do all of our events at eep global the hackers are here to learn and they're here to share their excitement and actually talk about the things that they've experimented with and the judges are here to give feedback on these projects we don't expect it nor do we want or tell anybody to do this thing to become a business so that is not the general goal for any of our submissions we just want to tell you about the amazing things that developers are doing in this ecosystem and actually help boost uh the system entirely so with that i'm going to quickly get to it uh the schedule of today is that these are the 15 teams that will be going on on our zoom stage and uh i'm gonna start calling them one by one and as i call the team uh they get invited to uh to present on zoom and they'll start playing their their demo and uh the judges sort of come in and ask any questions or give the feedback that they have so last but not least i actually want to welcome all of our judges who are going to be doing all the hard work today um and uh and with this i'd like to welcome mintyo from consensus labs investments patrick mccoy from any dot and mariana conte from maker dao to come on our zoom stage and uh we're super thankful for the time that they're giving us this morning and with that uh we are ready to kick off our first demo so i'd like to invite team epns to uh kickoff hackmoney2020 please welcome epns on stage thanks karthik that was really awesome uh let's get let's get started i just need confirmation that i'm uh live and uh i can hear you okay awesome awesome so let's get started with the ethereum push notifications hey everyone this is harish from gaming dns ethereum push notification service uh you're not sharing the video let's get started uh you needed a little share button oh yeah sorry yeah hey everyone this is harish from kmbns ethereum push notification service in short let's get started so a little bit about the team uh i'm mush i'm the designer and the developer of entire ecosystem and on my left there's my forever body the job she was responsible for product management and searching for the idea and idea solution moving forward what is epns so epns is a way to connect a decentralized ecosystem to centralized services uh simply put pool together can send you a message on your iphone or on your android and you will still receive it without signing on uh together for any other app for that matter how does that help us it opens up for so many possibilities uh dabs can send clear-cut communication with users uh the user will have uh more enhanced and investor experience and so on and so forth one more thing i wanted to tell you that the push notifications are never holding in ppns which you can see in a short life so one thing which i wanted to share with you guys was that when we started the plan was to create a very simple poc because there are a lot of multiple parts in sending a push notification so we have a server which is actually linked into nine things then we have mobile app then we have the smartphone and each of them are talking the with themselves to figure out the push notification our having said that we are glad that we had some time so we started working on the dab aspect of vnss uh this is one of the first speeds which we worked on uh you can connect with this metamask so on and so forth uh not a lot you can do on the tab except for creating a channel and sending a message in the future we will have channels uh which is more or less like the youtube page that receive that let's jump to mobile and i'm very happy to say we are on android from day one yay uh i'm also mirroring the my rear device over here and which is spamming the b along with all the other simulated device so that you can see why i said push notifications are never going on indians which are registered and you can do a lot more even in that matches the blue outline means that you can click on the field and it will download for certain actions well that's about it i wanted to go for this all right guys so yeah we kind of ran out of time so uh thanks for watching and uh we are open to questions now um yep uh if i can start so i'm guessing this is uh like a two-way so the user needs to uh you know go to the website and and approve notifications but then on the other side each uh d5 project or you know a provider needs to also sign in and and be able to send out those notifications right i'm wondering how easy it is uh for each uh project to do that to interface with the major system so yeah that's that's uh when we started we had the same question so that's a great question and uh what we did was we created interface on the smart contract as well as the interface on the dab for all the channels so whatever dap is joining we call them channels and what the only thing that app has to do is create the channel provide the just free basic info which is the main url and the short message along with their icon so we can show it to the users because they are receiving uh messages from many channels and uh after that the next step is sending some amount of die as fees so the piece is dynamic they can provide us 50 die or even higher uh the reason for that is this fee goes into an interest pool and whoever subscribes to those channels they earned they on a small uh profit amount from the interest these channels are earning so that's how we are incentivizing the whole system we kind of thought that the users if they're joining or subscribing a channel on chain they're paying a very small fee and while it's uh fair because you know uh if they're joining a channel then that means they are interested in doing something but uh at the same time you know we wanted to incentivize them so that you know if they join a channel they have some interest which they are earning small enough to uh make sure that the subscribers are not spamming the the channel but uh it's balanced enough to make sure that you know they on whatever transaction fee they are paying and for the subscriber they can again uh just go to the tab join in or interface with the smart contract join in or the dab owner can also uh make a subscriber join in by just paying uh 10 cm so as a delegation fee again uh to ensure that uh it's uh spam free if the dap is sending the uh i request that this is my subscriber i would like uh uh you guys to join and then of course we want to have that uh thing to uh make sure that the bad actors are taken care of so your question is a question about this just did i get the rough idea in my mind so there's a small contract that accepts broughton there's a smart contract users register with a smart contract and they'll earn any interest in any deposits during the smart contract as a company i come along i'll sign a message i'll send it to the contract i'll pay a fee maybe it's like fifty dollars and then this message will get broadcast to everyone who subscribed so yeah uh it's it's kinda like that is only the channels uh need to uh pay the fee and this fee is used as a pool uh for the way for all the subscribers of those channels to earn interest the channels uh pool ratio uh for the subscribers uh they uh have to go and subscribe to our channel they can do that from the tab or the smart contract or even from the mobile in the future and uh in the mobile app they need to just connect their wallet and as soon as they connect their wallet uh the entire system the mobile the server and the smartphone right they talk to each other and figure out the uh anonymously what the user is what their subscriber channel is and start sending the messages and of course you know we also have secret messages so uh a channel can also send encrypted we were not able to cover that in the demo but yeah so you can get personal messages from the top owners as well thank you for your submission super interesting stuff um could you maybe talk a little bit more about how you might you know improve the project over time like maybe are there any analytics that you might want to add to it sure actually i'm glad you got that uh you bought that out so yeah the project actually we kind of see it like the ecosystem so uh we need to have analytics we have uh uh planned few of those things like you know uh the channel uh on the channel the subscriber we are already storing few anonymous data uh on the server and on the smart contract and uh the way we see it you know uh since we also have targeted the messages and those targeted messages are basically json file uh with message type so we already see uh uh us increasing the number of messages or the type of messages you can send so right now a channel can send a intended message which is called secret or a group message which is for the group but you know we all we already are thinking that we need to add a message type 3 which will be a targeted message which is non-encrypted just a targeted message type of system then the other thing which we did was you know when the owner creates uh when the owner deploys a smart contract uh we have created two channels for the owner uh one channel is uh is one channel is for all the app channel owners or all the channel owners so when they create a channel uh they are automatically added to the owner channel and that way we are also able to keep track of all the channels where what they are sending how they are coming from and we can interact with them also if you know uh let's say if we uh try to go for a subscription model or you know if they are spamming the users we can send a message from our channel to these app owners that hey uh you're spamming the users and you need to uh calm down but you know the possibilities are really endless uh if you come to think about it yeah i think i think i would use it if i mean it sounds like it's really useful for newsletters etc you know if i get auto subscribed to a newsletter at least i can earn interest off that every time they spam me um i probably use it more often if i could make money from those newsletters yeah that's awesome well we're uh we're running a bit uh behind already uh so i want to make sure that we get to move on to the next teams but uh thank you so much epns and now we'll uh move on to the next one so um with that please uh welcome the one inch kai team onto the zoom stage and uh just to uh confirm as the team joins uh please make sure that you are ensuring that the audio is coming in through uh through the zoom checkbox from the bottom of that share panel and you are also full screen so hi everyone here's team one inch and here's sergey the ceo and anton the cto of one inch so um i'm going to share my my screen my first question uh can i avoid to to play the uh pre-recorded video um because i was really tired last night after uh 48 hours hackathon um i would just uh fit uh try to to present it in in four minutes what what what would have done if it's possible for you uh yeah that sounds that sounds okay okay um here we go so um hi everyone again so my name is sergey uh here's anton and we built uh two things on on this hackathon we were a little bit late with that but anyway we built the um create two powered gas tokens so you have maybe heard that we use uh gst2 talking and we found out that we can optimize the token by using create2 and we named it qi token you know one inch is based on the one-inch punch from bruce lee we do a very efficient things on the blockchain but to do that we need power and the cheap power you know and so we have just created a nice smart contract which is optimized uh uh comparing to the gt2 original gas token so um on top on that we thought how can we improve the developer space in ethereum and we built the deployer contract which can be used to deploy smart contracts on ethereum chains and burning gas token or cheat token you can just use both we support both here and you can reduce up to um like up to 42 percentages of the gas costs so the main problem is right now is we have gas costs at 50 gray and it's a lot so just imagine we are a developer here and ethereum network we have to deploy almost every day and uh it costs a lot so we reduce it by almost a half yeah by um just using the qi token which you can already mint on a one inch exchange so we thought okay not everyone can just find out how to mean the gas stock and we just integrate in one inch and you can actually trade it i i just mint yesterday uh for like 10 bucks and salt today already on one inch for like 20 bucks um and made made 2x profits by by trading gas yeah um so the solution for for the um deployers just approve the g or gst2 token for the deploy.eth smart contract they already secretly you can find on twitter scan for example uh then tap deploy and put the hex data from your smart contract and uh that's actually it yeah and it's then um deployed with almost a half of the cost you have or you would pay um and in a normal way yeah and that's actually it if you would like to see any demo how did the mint processors work it's like a simple swap if you like i can show you otherwise i can answer your questions if you like um okay this this looks really interesting um so for the yeah i would like to see for the actual mint so um i'm imagining that you're gonna be trying just like gas token to mint when gas prices are um are cheap yeah sure uh so um the smart contracts um uh first of all uh use 12 euros not 10. we were able to to mine uh 12 zeros in the beginning it's uh it's a huge effort we use aws cloud for that and a lot of gpus and so meeting you can just use uh here on easter scan the right uh contract tab and just uh use here the main function with like 100 uh qi tokens or you can just go to a one inch exchange you can just select ether on the left side right on the right side the cheat token um select only gmenter and then just swap now and uh and that that's that's it i have to just approve in the mirror mask you don't see that and after that you uh your um some something something with the middle mask um after that you should have here the qi token in your in your wallet and you can just trade it back uh on unison v2 for example so it's listed there and just sell it and also earn money with that yeah the deployer smart contract you can use here to write uh a contract tab and just deploy here uh h2 deploy or gc2 deploy um what you want here just with data you have of course to approve the token uh to the smart contract to the so they have the right to transfer it from your wallet um can i ask one question so i mean i don't think it was very clear to me so what's the advantage of using this over gas token is it just that it's using korea 2 or are you actually getting more of a gas refund uh yeah we get we have better gas usage so we made it more efficient so how already said we use more zeros at the beginning of the address and the thing is we save one byte uh so we we deploy here this is uh this is a smart contract um data which we deployed to each uh sub smart contract which is a qi token um so you can mint it uh on on low gas uh usage and burn on on low gas price and you can burn it on a high gas price and you can save like a lot and uh we also optimized here this uh minting process we uh implemented uh a but batch meeting with uh 32 tokens if you have tried to mean more than 32 or equal to 32 and we also um used create two um to just uh avoid a huge huge uh logic logic and also using of a gas in the original g student um to just find the right smart contract address for the burning process awesome yeah i just want to make one other comment to say that i love projects like this i know the ethereum developers probably hate it but is this serious you can abuse uh part of the system that should be fixed it's uh that's incredible that you can also uh um trade it that's like not just for for for using it for burning also you can trade it like trade gas with here have you thought of doing some kind of proxy that also automatically burns uh you know cheat tokens on calls or are you leaving that you know for the community i i agree with pat i think this is i mean i love gas token and if this one's even a little bit more efficient then to build a proxy can be really difficult because uh so you you interact with um with other smart contracts which may not support such a proxy yeah uh which uh try to transfor try to transfer something from you and you have to approve this uh contract it's quite complicated so we we built support for gas stock in our smart contract for on one inch for example and other developers can do the same and then everyone can just maybe in the future approve uh um transferring gas or burning gas tokens from any contracts on wallet which can help to reduce your uh transactions like on compound and other maybe if they would integrate such a support would be if so thanks for the demo it's super cool like mariano and pat said and how do you sort of strike a balance between sort of the usage of the token and like people sort of hoarding it for trading um how do we see that so i see a great a huge opportunity to to trade that because we have uh real real uh value behind the gas talking because there are developers there are users who use defy and it's growing and the gas price jumps like up to 200 away yeah in such a case you need the gas token but um yeah you you have to get it somewhere yeah and there could be a lot of people who who mint it and set it as a limit order for example to or to to sell it or put it in a unit swap v2 pool for example and also this using yeah more and more projects starts using gas token and i guess we were like the first production team uh with a production um ready uh platform who just used gst2 token but this technology comes from arbitrary traders they are like since like last year uh working on maybe two years uh working with the gst token and uh i would also wish to to see more projects who use that yeah of course it's a heck of evm but but it's a nice hack i would say awesome well we're uh we're gonna move on to the next team so team one inch thank you so much for this demo and uh it's finally great to see arbitrages that are not entirely on the d5 realm and also on the evm stack so with that i will uh invite the next team on stage and that is the project terminal who are working on a trip delay insurance product so please welcome thank you very much bye terminal hi everyone hey guys can you hear me yeah yes let me start sharing the screen now hi everyone uh i'm a team called hybridge a startup based in the netherlands uh who tries to disrupt the traditional insurance with the power of blockchain decentralization and i'm happy to show you what i've built for a hack money hackathon so my name is kirill ivanov i'm a founder and the full stack builder and the visionary so what is terminal about well terminal is a sort of autonomous machinery for the trip delay protection where the payout happens automatically and due to the centralized nature of it it's not only for people but also with so why do we do that well the traditional insurance is boring and nobody likes it why due to variety of reasons such as too many middlemen in the value chain the insurance traditionally has got high operational costs and the policyholders are the community but it's got a low community touch so let's see how the terminal is different so how it works well people log the digital asset or it against the particular trip they're about to take then the payout is calculated on chain the buyer takes the trip and when or if the trip is delayed the payout happens automatically with no manual claim needed but there is also another use case when people can join the risk capital reserves and earn interest on it so let's hit the demo how it actually works so here the user interface and imagine i'm about to take the trip from london to paris on let's say first of june i got a ticket for morning trip and i expect to take some financial loss in case if my train is a little bit delayed so based on that i want to buy the protection for this amount of money and in case if this train got delayed for two hours or more i'll get the payment like this and if my train is cancelled then this will be my payout so yes i confirm i got a ticket and i understand that it's machinery it's not an insurance in any form i sign it in metamask a little bit faster and that's pretty much it so in case if my train got slayed i will get this payment instantly at the time of planned arrival i don't need to do anything i don't need to claim nothing so just the future is now so that's first part but uh there is another one it's my favorite actually the opportunity that terminal offers is that it allows people to join another site of the fence when traditionally it's been a possibility of only of risk carriers and reinsurance funds so they to back up the risks so let's see how this works here mimic traditional institutional reserves which are backing up risks the operational and reinsurance both these funds hold the reserves in a number of assets and their balance automatically the beauty is that in fact everyone can join the reinsurance world and earn interest coming from two sources first one is their internal fee coming from protection sales and the second one is integration with interest earned protocol such as av so what's next so here are the next things to do while we plan to add extra data sources and cover all the international trains of western europe we launch on mainnet then more decentralization and consensus needed on the data sources and we plan to expand to the flight delay protection so the app is available live it's already on robston test net and that's pretty much it thank you for your time yeah that was it thanks i um like i really liked the demo it was uh the very own point and like highlighted uh pretty much everything i guess my question yeah you mentioned chain link or oracle eyes you say that everything happens automatically but of course you are going to need the oracles for making sure that yeah for payouts or if uh trips completed correctly um how are you gonna pay for those is is that going to come out also from uh you know fees from the people using the platform um do you think there's going to be eventually maybe i don't know a way to contest the oracle results for any reason sure yeah i mean it's you know it's by nature it's quite a commercial business case you see well it's it's basically sort of insurance right so there is a business model behind and i already planned so some part of that will go to as a fee or earning model to the insurance to to share with people and well obviously i need i need decent data sources i don't want to be a tell that the 3p is there so yes well sharing some parts over there is also the priority actually in fact in fact the chain link i think offers already fly the flight schedule of flight flight stats starts it's not that advanced for trains yet but uh well that's that's deputy um i can tip in quickly i think it's really cool you just made me question what insurance is all about and i guess the point of insurance is that you have this company that's betting against the customer you know it's a two-sided market in a sense uh their plan insurance because it breaks down and now you're just opening that up to everyone um i mean i think it's really cool i just wanted to make that comment i don't really i think i know how it works i don't really have any questions about it oh um if i may i have another quick one um so this reminded me a little bit of how open um works i don't know if you've seen it it's also like an insurance and you can you can protect um you can protect your investment and somebody can take the other side the interesting thing there is that the resulting market is a a token right an o token an erc20 that can then also be plugged into the ecosystem do you plan to have something like that so that you know or so that the instruments that that come out of uh your platform can then be integrated with something else like i'm going to uh to package i don't know a month uh worth of of travel and speculate on it on another platform yeah this case look it's so it's it's this case is called parametric insurance so that's an assurance that the case happens uh how to say not some it's not the subjective case right so it's either happened or not so that's why the train or any delay or whether it's other opportunities are there if you're talking about let's say the car damage let's say or something like that well you need to decent proof or decent consensus on the fact so then you well i'm having it in mind that it might be a good way to uh go towards the crowd uh well sort of a voting or something like that when the the people you know can vouch for you that this event really happened so that's that's the way and the token wise while we have it so that's fine uh to have it there for now yeah great work on the demo and you know very very intuitive um have you spoken to any of like you know the travel operators or train operators about this and do you think they'll be excited about it or how do you think they'll sort of react yeah well yes uh there are a couple of companies that are offering uh the sort of a cashback encrypter for the uh hotel and the trip bookings so sort of a world scheme i think this might be an interesting one but the traditionally scariers are also curious actually i'm a i'm in touch with the french one there soon uh because they are well they understand that they're dinosaurs right i mean they're they're expensive and nobody likes them although everybody have that that insurance etc so they are looking for innovations like this drastically cutting costs so that's there's an option too but then well that's they're slow i don't want to get i i rather want to get along with their innovations and so pre prepare payouts maybe the the cashback is the one yeah just one quick question how would you go about setting the price i just thought about that um how do you actually set the price for buying the insurance is a market there as well or the price you mean how much you can lock while there is artificial limit on this but um well in fact uh there is another concept it's about risk so sovereign risk so that's a risk every let's say person has right in this case we are talking about we're talking about people we're talking about trains so in fact every train should supposed to get have cert some sort of risk profile whether it's or the flight whether it's often on time or it's late or quite often it's low cost and gets cancelled so this is the underwriting so using this sort of profile that i plan to build over the time it will take some time and more more data i get less risk it is but so to to to come to calculate the payout well the best way yeah awesome well thank you so much girl i think the best part about this whole demo was that uh other than like the video being super concise you were wearing the same clothes so that's great so uh awesome so with that uh thank you so much and we'll call the next team which is a btc tornado so please welcome btc tornado on the live stream hello everybody do you hear me yep can you hear me as well yeah good yes okay okay so i will start a screen sharing and play the video my name is ian banesh and i will present you a project i built with my friend during the heckman hackathon the project is called btc tornado ns and in a simple words it's a bitcoin mixer powered by ethereum my friend was responsible for the front end and the server side and i was responsible for the implementation of the contracts and the integration with opengsm the goals of the project were to extend the reach of tornado cache between the bitcoin users and to make it as simple as possible we wanted users to not even know that they are using ethereum blockchain now i will show you the demo so the website has two sections deposit and withdraw on the deposit section user can select the denomination the tornado denomination he wants to use then he will obtain the bitcoin address to which he is supposed to deposit his bitcoins and the tornado node this node makes him eligible to withdraw the pbtc from the tornado contract and the user is also asked to save the seat what they see this for i will explain in the how it works section in the on the withdrawal side the user will input his notes and the recipients bitcoin unless this is pretty much equal to how normal tornado cash front that works the only difference in the withdrawal section is that the user will input the bitcoin address instead of the ethereum address you can see that the front end is now generating a proof and sending the transaction the transaction is being sent through the relay and you see that everything was okay now i will explain how it works so the deposit section first ethereum account and tornado cache note is generated then bitcoin address is requested from the b token service and ethers is an input user sends the btc to the transaction and at the same and the front on the front end the gsn relay request is signed and sent to server now the user can go away we've pretty much separated the transaction broadcasting and signing because depositing of the pptc in our testing takes approximately half an hour so we wanted the user to just sign it and go away so that he doesn't have to wait then the server is continually checking for the erc20 deposit event on the pbtc token and once tokens are deposited he will broadcast the transaction through the relay to the ethereum blockchain withdrawal so on the weather will use a use user inputs his node and btc address front and generates the proof he will send the the front end will send the proof to the relay the relay will the relay will verify the proof and then if the proof is valid it will send it to the tornado contract and the tornadogram contract checks the proof validity as well and then calls the reading function on the pbtc token contract and then the btc gets deposited to the user's address thank you for your attention yeah it was it okay so any questions well can you hear us i think you're muted yeah i've got one question about the would you find using like the p took an api in order to do tornado costs like what was the intersection like between them okay so there is one one problem and that is that pbtc doesn't at this point support meta transactions i lost my question so for example as as you probably know die has permit function or so it's not really like in order for us to release it to the mine that we would need to be tokens to add that support so how it works is that you contract top of that like having a contract in the middle that controls the funds or well we we didn't want the user to trust us at all so we pretty much in the front end we generate new ethereum address new ethereum account and we tell him to save the seat and the note you're actually thinking about it and this was the only way to do it trustlessly if you like the the the problem there was that the b token when the pbtc is deposited to the ethereum account it's like impossible to invoke like it's impossible to build the token service to invoke a function on a contract so when the user sends the btc to the b token service the only thing p tokens allow us to do is to deposit it to some ethereum address that way we could not create some ethereum contract which would control the funds they understand it i think so so they only if they force you to send it to an externally owned account yes okay p tokens don't at this point support invoking some contract functions you're like when the btc is sent through the token bridge okay i think that's fixable um i mean you can just trick it i mean that's too technical probably as a question um well we think that like meta transactions are more and more like trendy and useful so we hope that there will be like an update of the contract yeah because i think i think i think that transaction could easily solve your problem there yeah uh yeah so once they'll do it or there will be some other btc bridge they will be able to release it to the mainnet and we will have the ux where i want to use yeah thanks for the demo guys really cool project um do you sort of see any obstacles with integrating any of the other sort of rap tokens as well any other app tokens oh sorry any of the like say wbtc or tbdc or any of the rap bitcoin tokens well for this to work for bitcoin users there has to be there has to be the bridge from bitcoins to ethereum so wherever the protester is just like a collateralized btc on ethereum blockchain so it's not useful in that that way but it would definitely be possible but like it would not require such a complex such a complex logic like through open gsm and such because our goal was to like make it simple to use for bitcoin users so if if the users already had grabbed the btc at their ethereum account it would be pretty much the same interface as tornado cache has now they will just have to support another erc20 tokens so what the goal of our project was is to use open gsm and uh pitocons to make it as simple to use for bitcoin users awesome well thank you so much i i have one tiny comment if i can you said that uh that bitcoin users could use this and not even know that they're using ethereum yes i i think that you should put it front and center that they are actually using it so that we're trying to bring them over to our side right well in the branding it is there like it is a bitcoin mixer powered by ethereum but our goal was to like not force the users to install metamask or something like that so you want them to know it but like not know how like ethereum works or something yeah awesome thank you amazing uh that was great so uh thank you so much and now we'll call the next team up which is the flashshield high frequency yieldbot arbitrage so uh with that uh please welcome them on to the zoom call and i think this is one where we may have connection issues but we'll we'll play i think we should be fine oh hi guys uh let me try to share my screen you can hear me yes let me quickly go to the video vijay and today i would like to talk about a high frequency e-bot so i'm very interested in d5 space and i was wondering if it is possible to have a series of swaps which are done and at the end of which to generate a small a very small amount of profit and if we could repeat this process several times by automating it in the form of a script we would be able to achieve a small profit which when multiplied over a large number of time would enable us to have like a significant profit so this is like a classic arbitrage strategy and this is like a token arbitrage so first of all we for this to be successful all we need is a wallet with a little bit of eth we then query uh uni swap and version 2 api to get a list of tokens find out what the ether value the exchange rate is and then once again exchange that to the next token in this list so for example it could be usdc to die or usdc to back and then exchange that again back from that final token to eth and then at the end of that if we generate a profit for example 0.024.01 then this transaction would be successful and finally with uh we would have like a small profit so this is the goal of this so for this purpose i built a small script in uni swap to just query and get all the values i've already run that and you can see for example it just generates like a list so in this case the current rate was 190 for uti 202 for usdc and so on and hex and in this case bart usdc was better so i could do that and then from add to usdc to ethe gave me 0.992162 now unfortunately this is uh less than one so therefore the transaction would not be successful anyway i will just show you how it will work if if the if it is profitable so this list would then go into this uh list of tokens to be swapped from eat to bart in this case will be each to back and then part the usdc and then usdcd so all these addresses will be loaded here then let me show you i've already deployed the contract in chain this is a deployment cost and then you have the final cost then uh all we need to do now is to run the contract so the contract is basically quite simple it's just uh built on a standard flash loan uni swap wrap trapper or the box and then you would have token one address show control address and then a list of that then you would start sorry once again i'll just quickly show you the next video it was a merging issue so as you can see i've already deployed the flash loan and after deploying it i've just called it again with the liquidity needed for eth in this case and you would see that the transaction has failed now this is due to the fact that i did not satisfy the conditions and it reverted and we could also have a look at it in robston this should give you the overview so failed with couldn't transfer eat and basically the flash loan itself was successful but uh unfortunately we did not generate enough profit to actually pay back the flash loan and so uh this fails and this means that this pipeline fails here so yeah sorry so basically it was a good learning experience for me to understand the flash loans the swap and the liquidity the problem what we have what i had is that the number of times the arbitrage was generating profit was very very rare but the advantage is that it can be completely automated as you have seen so basically you just run a script let it run in the background all the user does is he just needs to have a little bit of eath in his wallet like point one or something to pay for the gas uh or a series of time and then let it run a few hundred times over a series of days and then generate small orbit range and if it is you know slightly more than 1.001 or something like that then you know it generates profit and that is the goal of this project awesome well thank you so much vijay and um with that we'll move on to the next demo so next up we have capital eight and uh they're currently having some technical difficulties so what we'll do is we'll play the video on my end and i'll share my screen with their demo and we'll have the team answer any questions if they're able to join from the video side or the call side hi i'm sudeep and i've been working on building capital eight for the hacker so capital it allows you to invest in tokens in a smart systematic and a hassle-free way so instead of investing everything at once you can create a goal and in the small amounts which would be automatically debited from your wallet and uh invested regularly as per your plan so the main advantage of this is that you average out the buy price and you don't have to worry about timing the market so we have two actors here one is the investors dashboard and another one is the providers so investor is basically anyone who creates a plan and a provider is any user who processes those installments by paying a transaction fee and receives the processing fee in return let's connect with metamask here and let's go to the investors dashboard right now in the dashboard we can view our existing plans or create a new one so i'll just go ahead and create a new plan so for example say i would like to invest 30 every 10 days to buy the link token so i have an option to redirect the final tokens to another address but for for the time being i would just i've just pasted my same address here and i've already approved the contract to spend i so i'll just go ahead and create the plan so once the transaction is confirmed so the plan should be available on the providers dashboard and they should be able to process it so let's switch to the providers view here so i have chrome open here and let's connect using quartz this time okay so i'll switch to the providers tab here so here i can see all the plans that are available and the corresponding fee that i will receive to process them so these are the available plans so i'll just go ahead and process this one so i'll just confirm this let's check the status on ethers so right now as we can see here uh this installment was worth 100 and i would be receiving one die in this wallet for processing this transaction so let's just wait till this transaction is confirmed and uh i have my portis wallet open here so i don't have any die as of now so the transaction is confirmed now so as you can see uh 99 worth of die which is uh hundred dollars minus the processing fee has been swapped for by meter the grab data which is a token and one die has been deposited to my address as the transaction as the processing fee so if i check my purchase wallet here we can see one basically we are incentivizing the users to process transactions and uh collect fees in return thank you for your time have a nice day hey hello a everyone yeah actually i'm not sure if it was me or some other team but yeah i was here all the time that was like a small mistake on our end we ended up switching the order so i had this one as the one i had to play but uh the video still got played and you're here to answer questions so uh we should i still let the judges kind of get feedback and comments yup no issues um yeah i've i've seen a couple of projects that that been trying to do you know um automatic dollar cost averaging or you know different strategies my only worry is um i like for example the fact that that you um you give it out to the community as well to be the ones that process and escape i expect that to eventually be you know bots looking to uh to make a a quick tire um or whatever the transaction fee is um i'm wondering if there is any way to reduce uh those fees because for example somebody who may want to buy a little bit every single day yeah so actually i've been yeah so actually i've been thinking about it so uh i mean that was too much for the scope of this hackathon but i've been thinking of including an oracle which could uh literally fetch the current gas price from somewhere and based on that just uh have a fee which is a little bit more than that so that would be like enough for the i mean that would be like beneficial to both the investor as well as uh the processor and one more thing we can do is we can have open gsn included here so in case even if the invest even is the if the processor doesn't have any uh anything to pay for it he can still uh process the transaction and half of the transaction fees goes to the paymaster in opengsn and half of it he can receive in his wallet so that is one way we could do it right so the main reason yeah so the main reason i built uh capital it was because right now everyone is so much more focused on uh trading and other things no one is really paying much attention to investing right so most of the people right now invest mostly because of fomo or maybe some anonymous tips or something like that so yeah this would be uh the bitcoin company it's like a lot of bitcoin companies have this thing where they take money from your bank account and buy bitcoin every month this is the cmo just die and that was gonna be my question how does because you already have died um why does do not just convert all that to eat right away is there some argument where it's better to feed it out over a few months so the main advantage would be uh you reduce this risk of buying at a high price so once if you buy every month say every 15 days or every month so you basically average out your buy price and eventually uh by the benefit of compounding you would over a span of time be profitable so that's the main idea any other questions awesome sudeep thank you so much for making that awesome demo and uh we'll move on to the next team which is god mode for test to do local testing or letting you do anything on your local blockchain so please welcome them on zoom oh i see hello hi there hello let me share my screen and that oh oh one sec presenting my project for hack the money hi this is martinette presenting my project for hack the money god mode for test as we know millions of funds are being managed in d5 and naturally we want a secure system we want the system tested however this is challenging especially for d5 project first it is hard to replicate the mainnet structure of other projects on ganache for example just imagine deploying the whole maker dial system on your local ganache so people of course use testnet for that however it is also challenging because of the default composability on testnet because that only simulates maintenance structure within the project but not between projects and i quote this from our fellow hacker on a public channel small rant here on testnet compound and avi are using different dye marks another option which is using ganache with the fourth option could overcome this but there are other issues as well and this is mainly because like code islam you fork from a given state and you have to follow all the rules and it will be hard for example to get some tokens let alone creating different scenarios for testing again here i'm quoting one of our mentors mariano when he was answering a question on how to obtain dye you won't be able to mint directly fermenting dye you need to go through the whole open vault lock up collateral mint cycle that's why better off just using this marking in the erc20 so this makes it very difficult to set up testing environment for default projects that wants to build on other money levels thus what i built is to overcome this kodi's law issue in local blockchain god mode for test consists of three pieces a modified generic core that can ignore blockchain law and arbitrarily modifies contract storage and contract code when sending an rpc request a node.js library that integrates into truffle framework and leverages solidity contracts as api to modify the storage of the blockchain as well and a set of pre-compiled got mode contracts that works in the fork mode for example maker dial that just mint style uni swap v2 enables the fee compound meant different c tokens uh to men die in one's truffle test now the developer only needs to do this so it's pretty simple and all you need to do to become the fed is to add a for loop i also provide a generic function so that the developer can do anything he wants all he need to do is to code another celebrity contract no need to learn new stuff whatsoever now let me quickly show you how this would look like now i'm in a sample truffle project here i have a contract with privileged action and only owner can access it the owner is set during deployment and there is no way of changing the owner and this can also be seen in our tests this is the truffle test suite and we have alice and bob alice is the owner as you can see here and she can access the privileged action under normal circumstances when bob tries to access this but will not be able to do so however here with the god mode enabled the bob actually can access the privilege action and even going further we can create a new function and set bob as the owner left i have a modified genacho running and on the right i have the truffle test that utilizes the library and that's it all passed that's a wrap thank you very much right thank you that's that's it oh um that was a great presentation and um yeah so in this case um let me get this straight so you're able um yeah with the modified when you enable god mode you can um you can use any account uh and you have some presets specifically for you know uh several d5 projects so that you can in one uh in one call override any of this i think this could be useful also for example we do a lot of testing uh you know for maker votes and we need to simulate uh you know you could just take out all governance and you know send transactions one at a time to test the system um i yeah i really really like this idea thank you yeah that that is exactly um the the uh motivation behind this because i want to enable like test to make testing really easy right so yeah and so basically what i need to do right now is just to modify like current contracts and and let's say i just take maker dallas contracts and then just remove some some stuff then that's it not good how does it work with contracts that have a deterministic address so for example in our system uh some of our contracts have the same address on test out of mainnet when you use god mode will it change the contract address oh no it doesn't change the contract address because uh it's forked from the mainnet so not ganache has this forked option right so it basically uses the same thing but you have to do it like this say does it fork the blockchain itself and then yeah correct i guess yeah correct yeah so you can either work uh using the local blockchain or you can use the ganache fork then it will pull the state when you're sending the transaction awesome well if there are no more questions we'll move on to the next one martinette thank you so much for this amazing demo and uh next up we have inscript and uh this is the team with uh the technical difficulty so i'll be playing the the video while sonny from the team joins to answer any questions my project name is institute so http is used okay so let's check automatic train and like you said we do works on page so we will just choose w and w and we take thousand okay if the slippage rate is less than 0.5 percent then thread will be happening so now the transaction is done as you can see over here okay uh so so this is how the automated trade has happened in industry if the slippage rate is less than 0.5 percent then our trade will happen automatically by otherwise it will give error like this [Music] [Music] [Music] die [Music] now we will adding more w okay so as you can see over here successfully added liquidity now you can see uh you need to give us token uh [Music] it will be increased by some token as you can see before it was 7 2 over here now is nine four three so uh so the liquidity added and you will get in return unicef liquidity token okay uh so uh and if you want to if you if the liquidity provider as you can see over here the liquidity is removed if you want to check the result you can check over here yeah so so if any traders want to see a any reserve or anything before trading so you can so you can see over here and and all the water all the trading transaction we are saving in the transaction history over here so all the transactions you can check as you can see over here perfect hello hello hello can you hear me uh yes you can yeah sorry my uh i don't have wi-fi so i'm in mobilenet so any question if you um so hello if i understood correctly yep can you hear me yes yes i can hear you okay um so the audio wasn't um all that great but um is this like a like a one-stop uh dashboard for uh you know uni swap v2 like trading and adding liquidity and and that or yeah so so some so motivation motivation was that like if you want to trading using initial v2 so you need to pass minimum written value for safety and and the path of the tokens and deadline so so so in script so using inscript uh you can remove this hardware you just need you just need to choose the crypto pair and just need to add the value so automatically uh platform will calculate the slippage rate for that if the slippage rate was less than 0.5 then automate trade will happen otherwise it will otherwise it will give the error uh that slippage rate is high slippage rate is high swap will not be performed so so so so i met the automated trustless crypto trading platform okay cool i yep i don't have any more questions thank you so much sonny i'm sorry that uh you had some technical difficulties on your end but uh [Music] no worries at all thank you so much for uh for hacking and submitting the project so uh next up we have team encryption so please welcome cryption on stage okay um i'll just share my screen share computer song okay hi my name is stages and i'm from the team encryption our submission is a interest bearing dye etf this is a balancer liquidity pool with a dye c dye and diy dye we've made a dui die using smart contracts how does it work so the user sends his diet to our smart contract which is then forwarded to solo margin or dydx protocol the rate at which dui die is minted in the user's wallet is calculated by the total amount of dive deposited from our smart contract into solo margin divided by the total supply of d we created a balancer tool with a dice diy die with 33 wheat each holding this etf allows you to hedge your diet interest rate position across all three protocols so it doesn't matter if one day dui dies gaining more interest or if one day ada is gaining more interest on top of just maintaining 33 of each protocol whenever a trade is done between these three assets the liquidity providers which are the etf holders get 0.2 percent of each trade so the question that everyone liquidity providers generally have is what about impermanent loss well according to how this works there shouldn't really be any so there are many rate chasing protocols like ray idle finance y die which should eventually balance out the rate interest between these three protocols so if there is a higher interest rate at a die and a lower one at compound then um ray and why die and idle finance move their c die holdings into aid first of all rate chasing costs gas so whenever you try to move from a die to c die to d y d x when you try to get the highest interest rate this all costs gas and money secondly as usage increases all of these interest rates would generally tend to the same number especially because of idle finance wide eye and state they if you keep chasing the high street they will all eventually balance out and whenever a trader tries to get gain arbitrage um the pool becomes balanced automatically while gaining interest and without losing any gas so what we want to do in the future is add chai and add an interest bearing token like diy die for d dex to the etf right now we haven't added child because it's giving us zero percent and once it starts giving us some dsr we will add that too so let's jump into the demo right now i've connected my metamask wallet to the coven network and over here you can see the total diy die supply in circulation the total amount of die locked up in dydx and the interest rate which is given by dydx at the moment so let's convert 0.5 die [Music] and now you can see my dy die balance has increased if you scroll down i can add my 0.5 dy dive balance into the interest bearing die etf i just have to first approve my diy die confirm adding liquidity you can now see the my diy die balance has changed and if we go to ether scan you can see that i got 8.208 bpt now let's try removing some bpt balance [Music] once i remove the liquidity i'll get 0.44 d y die 17 c die and 0.42 a die and here you can see 17 c die 0.4 for the white eye 0.4 to 8 and that's basically how the interest bearing dye etf works thank you hey um can you hear me yeah yeah cool i think it was interesting i i haven't seen a lot of projects yet that uh that are using balancer and and i think this is like a really good use case um do you see like this um so you mentioned that that you could add chai eventually once it dsr starts generating interest i don't really know a lot of how balancer works but um could could you add it to that same pool or do you need to create a new pool with the with all the tokens so right now i'm not on main net so if i go to mainnet and i create a public pool i can add a chai to it um so once i add chain i can add other interest bearing die tokens to it and yeah so there's no issue with that if i do that before i go to mean that i can do it afterwards also i just have to create a private pool where there's a controller for balancer so liquidity would be routed from my smart contract basically but i can then change the weights i can change the uh swap fee i can so yeah all of that i was thinking of changing the swap fee according to like the difference in the interest rate that is given so if like some someday dui dx is giving 10 then we would increase the swap fee because that's when everyone would want to trade right i like that one that's a good idea thank you super cool demo so you know just pull on that thread a little bit what's the range that you think that swap fee will sort of uh vary between um it should be quite less because in the end they're all they're very uh stable and it's a stable coin so you they don't increase that much so i would say zero point one percent to zero point three percent would be the range maybe zero point four percent awesome thank you so much tejas this is really cool and uh with that we'll move on to our next demo which is team lucram please welcome lukram onto the presentation arena hello [Music] yes yeah thank you so uh are you guys able to see my screen yes okay thank you hey this is psy me and my teammates are here to present lucrative decentralized innovative and efficient limit order protocol so here is my team so what we have built we have built decentralized limit on this platform boosted by the marketplace so current protocol take the lead orders and keep the user's money idling the smart conference so we are trying to solve this problem by utilizing the idle number that are present in the smart contracts and lend that particular money into the different lending so that user profits from this particular order that has been placed on the lucrano contract so for building this we have used as a lending protocol network as a liquid and changing for getting the prices of each and every individual so let's actually dive into the demo and see how it actually works so we have to build this completely on the cover ethereum network so in order to place the limit order you have to enter the amount and the price at which you want to purchase this currency and the expiration dates and whether it is buy or sell and submit the transaction and that's it so this is how it actually works so you just enter the path into the leukram and lucrum just creates a new order and we just create the ether into the rv and which in turns give that gives the eight to the order contact that has been created by the user now let's confirm the transaction and see that one of the previous transactions that we have placed for so here this is this is the lucrant through which like we have sent back into the office protocol so that has been credited so there are different functionalities such as execute widow and cancer so for this academic process focus we have put the execute button but in future we will be having a background service which will execute this order whenever the price has been hit that that is been set by the user so after the execution happens you can either withdraw your money or just allow us to utilize your money again to send back your the destination amount into the protocol so that you will be benefiting again from the api that we get from the ava profile yeah this is all about the protocol so let us see how the execution process occurs so that we got from the rba we'll be sending we will again send back the to object and get back the ability so as long as we don't withdraw we will just keep on blending into the protocol so that user will get the maximum benefits let's actually go into the slides and understand more about the execution so chain link actually provides us the prices of each and every individual token to the order cross so we just give up the date and get the die and just release the die into the user volume that's it so what are the advantages so advantages are so we are providing tax prices for the limit orders given to the users and we also giving you the market making for lending protocols so that there are both way benefits for the user and for the protocols and there are some limitations so dependency on the other protocols a centralized execution surface no landing rate so in future we are planning to integrate compounding on vcx and we also want to integrate make a tab and we stop for more powerful oracles and we want to support the more token phase and deploy all these contacts to the main thanks to our advisors who consistently helped us forbidding this product these are the resources and you can contact us anytime thank you yeah so that's all about look around so let me know if you have any questions awesome i have one quick question just for my high level understanding so the idea is that i want to do a trade i want to you know sell each when it hits 290 dollars so i put in the order and while i'm waiting for the price to increase interest is being earned when it hits 290 dollars anyone can hit execute and then they'll execute my trade and getting my 290 die uh is that like a good high level overview of what's going on yes exactly so you can purchase at a low price and you can in turn get the apr from the lending protocols yeah so like with the execute button is anyone pressing that or is that the person who uh deposited the e no so for now for this hackathon buzzer we we just integrated the execute button but in future we are planning to have a ecosystem of liquidators who can like uh just liquidate this particular order for just incentives so just like the compound does with the liquidations cool yeah that's interesting i saw that that you put under limitations that it's dependent on other protocols i i don't think that's a that's a limitation i think that's that's in the spirit of uh of defy i i just wondered um you mentioned some kind of centralization um the how do you how do you expect to uh uh to you know decentralize a little bit more okay so for now uh we have execution process that is centralized so we we actually execute the orders so uh if the background services fail to execute this particular order then order would won't get executed at that particular price so for this we are planning to have a liquidations uh mechanism where we put the ecosystem so that like ecosystem will get the incentives for liquidations cool awesome thank you yeah great thank you so much sai and uh we'll move on to our next demo which is flash mint a no code build so please welcome lucas from flashmint and we also have robert looks like we have a different set of people that were promoted so let us get in sachin hello hey guys you hear me yes awesome awesome so yeah awesome so i'll just share my screen and uh here i go hey guys i'm partha from team flashmint hey you all this is sachin from team flashment hey guys this is mitra from team placement hey guys this is sanchez hi i'm vitor i'm one of the creators of flash mans flash mint is a game yep it's a d4 game playing with real money it's a game find a way to building uh with no code uh optimized transactions uh finding opportunities in the market and executing them rather players having any need to have any capital uh as we're leveling leveraging uh flash loads uh that's quite neat as you can see on the screen this flow shot represents a way for a player to exploit an arbitrage opportunity so a player defines uh or which interconnecting blocks each one representing a d5 protocol or an operation and a d5 protocol will be used to to construct this transaction and execute this opportunity when a user executes this opportunity we show him uh on the sidebar uh the corresponding amounts of each step you know the balances that he has after each step and if it has a profit we just transfer it back to them and the block end yeah but just by having this little amount just enough to cover the fees you're gonna have the user being able to execute this transaction and take advantage of this opportunity they just make this a social sharing platform so so people learn how to perform this arbitrage demystified democratizes their these opportunities uh in a way so you have this shared component where people can talk about what they are doing and if i have to look at this smaller panel have a scoring uh leaderboard type thing which actually shows the actual profits and the idea is and this eventually didn't get implemented because uh we got to this uh during the hackathon sprint uh but take this to allow sharing of these boards through the screen for example every time someone's calls actually makes a profit uh together with the link showing hey wallet xyz uh did this uh amount of profit had this call we can actually go and tap and see what was how the opportunity was made which connecting blocks were used uh so you can explore what's going on and and use the learning tool we do have a few improvements to make uh for example right now if the ux accuses on building the transaction uh one of the feedbacks from design exploration during this sprint was to actually this is not the only step needed but it didn't find the opportunity uh is actually a very strong component of of doing this so we need you to expand the ux flow to to actually permit the user to go and find these opportunities and then build on top of them so it needs to be informative term now uh as as well as a no-code platform so yeah this will be the next steps for flushment well thank you very much that's it for the product video and please let us know with the questions hello yeah hi i i i like the ui i am i'm trying to um think of a question um so uh as we saw like actually getting our opportunities are you know uh it's not that common right and here the thing that i find a little bit weird i i like the fact that you're gamifying this but uh i don't know if if i found an arbitrage opportunity and and would be able to run it over and over i i don't know if i would uh necessarily share it with with others right yeah but it's like a comment go right when our opportunities come and go really quick and we have seen in the ecosystem already arbitrage now and people are actually building up monitors and sharing them in the community so it's there and everyone wants to like uh sometimes uh like flash loans are not right now common to run because of the gas cost and stuff but once this starts democratizing and people are using it more and more then we will be able to see more transactions using flash nodes it will not be the uh attacks it will not be the flash attacks it will be the new normal attacks i have one brief question how many arbitrage moments do you find i mean are there many arbitrage moments at the moment between any of the platforms or tokens yeah so the uh build uh monitor which uh you just saw in the presentation uh it showed around four abs at that uh present moment and it gets updated every five minutes so yeah and it was just eight pairs so yeah that's pretty so no one's really exploiting that then i guess that's from the sound yeah it's it's actually right now due to the gas price it's like uh it's almost uh no profit right now but uh we hope to see that changing you know [Music] also we are gaming gamifying this so that more and more university strengths can come along like in our team also we have three university students so uh when we say university students it's like they're trading their time for money so once they uh have this motivation of money right where they are not risking any of their capital because they're using flash loans so they'll be more and more interested in exploring uh you know how to earn that and of course the technical overhead is high but if we are just focusing on a special use case that is flash zones then we will be able to uh you know uh iteratively uh show to the users that how you are uh using our monitors and how you are using dexag but other than all that we have also integrated leaderboard in our uh platform which will allow them to uh you know also uh you know follow the top profiles the top players who are performing on our board and they'll be able to understand yeah what's going on okay thanks sachin thanks vitor and thank you everyone and sanchez that's a amazing five-person team and uh we'll move on to our next demo which is project hobby hodlers with their portfolio management tool that they'll be demoing soon so with that please welcome hobby hodlers on onto the participation side hello everyone hey how's it going going awesome play my video hello fellow decentralized citizens this is trevor clark i'm the creator of hobbyhodler a decentralized finance portfolio and goal management tool so many people are using multiple cryptocurrency wallets to track their digital asset holdings i've created a tool that helps you take all of those different wallets and look at a single pane of glass to track all of those holdings this is a project that helps you take the time to invest in projects that you believe in and keep tabs on them over time so my solution is hobbyhodler it's a self-hosted application for viewing portfolio assets achieving your goals and researching your next move this is a totally made up metric but 91 of users are using more than one wallet or exchange in cryptocurrencies but i've found that it's actually kind of true if you look at the app marketplace things are focused too heavily on just one blockchain or single use case wallets so this is my concept for multiple wallets you can even track manual accounts and create goals for those different accounts or portfolios and just see the overview of your holdings over time so let's do a quick demo let's set up a new hobby huddler portfolio i'm going to use portis as this is where it's an easy single login for a user it finds my account and loads it in my hobby hodler portfolio so the wallet loaded there let's create a goal so let's use ethereum we already have ethereum wall loaded up and let's do 0.5 ether so once it's tracked that it will load up my goal you'll notice it's worth 101 at the current date now if we look in the portfolio you'll see that this is my account balance over time and here's the goal my goal versus the account balance huddler also keeps track of different assets across different feature sets so you can look at things like die and calculate how much i would earn if i had a starting balance of 250 dollars held within ave for example you can also see other rates and staking rates if you're looking into proof of stake and check just how much you would earn if you use those protocols so hobby hodler is not only just a lens to view your holdings but also a way to research different assets that you would like to get into lastly it's a decentralized governance for things that you want to research or plan for your portfolio so i've created a dow that allows users to add or vote for new features for hobby huddler to track if you'd like more information check out the repo which has a full visual walkthrough of what i just demoed it also shows the other features that are available like alerting on stake or price for assets that you fold there's lots more features and lastly i just want to say thank you very much hope you enjoy the rest of your afternoon if you'd like to learn out learn about more things about hobbyholder check out the repository and see the other cool features that i have in mind thanks a lot all right thank you any questions yep um that was that was really impressive there's a couple of things that i that i really liked um the first one is that it is self-hosted that for me is really important because yeah that that means that the data hopefully stays you know in my computer um also the the research tab that was that was really good um you know i i hadn't thought about you know uh an integration uh uh with that before but but it really makes sense so you can you know look at the different things um for them uh and i also think there's like a lot that you can do with the cost like for example every a really basic one would be you know getting 32 e thread to be able to stake once uh ethereum two comes out and i think you can do interesting things or maybe deals with other tokens so that uh you know you can earn some money from from this project by maybe showing uh you know promoted the goals i don't know i'm talking about but i i thought it was this was really good congratulations thank you yeah that's exactly what i was going for and i'm hoping that um other people can run this themselves as well and if that dow integration finishes i can actually have people buy into tranches and be part of that goal and uh income yeah um you go ahead man i'll ask her oh no it's uh just one is for a second mariano's um you know comments super cool bins are looking for something like that i think especially like doing a lot of discovery across all the defy assets like and being able to do like a discovery for the various protocols would be super powerful and you know there's a social element to it um as well um but really cool stuff great work thank you yeah i just wanted to say that the one thing people do in this space is huddles obviously that's a good target audience to go after um i think what it sort of reminded me of as well was a project called rocky but that's more to do with accountancy and you know doing your taxes and i feel like something like that could also be there's like some intertwining connection you could have there this year shows you how you make more money this is really how you deal with your accountancy and it's all self-hosted i don't see why i think people pay money for what you're doing anyway it makes them more money they can pay you for good i like that i'll look at the project thanks so much trevor and uh we've seen trevor at some of our in-person events so glad to see uh you participate in hack money too and uh with that we'll move on to our next demo which is team d5btc please welcome them here and let's check out their btc on each demo hi i'm viraj from rd5bt and i love my screen sounds great can you increase the volume i think there's some uh audio volume issues yeah in pc volume click max um i think we're still having some uh some av issues here so can i can i just make sure that when you are sharing your screen it says uh proxy audio in zoom so can you exit the screen share and then make sure you check the audio box in the video still playing but doing that again will route the audio directly to zoo unfortunately that did not fix that you have checked the share audio checkbox when you get the screen i've done that maybe you can just talk us through it yeah i think it might be easier if you can just talk through this um we're not able to hear the audio i'll just do that yeah so for this hackathon i worked on d5 btc so what different btc allows it basically brings defy capabilities to bitcoin so you can deposit bitcoin and get uh equivalent pbtc a pbtc can be redeemed for bitcoin anytime the next thing that you can do is uh you can swap pbtc to erc20 tokens say for example you can swap pbtc to erc20 tokens like wbtc die usgt etc and this is powered by unisrap v2 then what you could do is you could deposit tokens to earn interest using a tokens say for example convert pbtc to wbtc and deposit it to our way to earn interest using awbtc you earn interest for every ethereum block eight tokens can be redeemed to get tokens back any time the next cool thing that you could do is you could stream tokens using savior so easily stream tokens like pbtc wbtc die away interest buying tokens etc and you could redeem tokens from stream in a single click the final thing is you could send or receive any erc20 tokens like edi btc etc i've also created an open source project which allows merchants to process d5 payments yeah and this is the user interface so when you come in the screen you see your pbtc balance and account and say for example you can you can click over here uh btc address is generated and what you could do is you could send a btc to that address and uh corresponding pbtc tokens are minted after that you could swap pbtc to wbtc finally then you can deposit to away and you get corresponding aw btc tokens and you could also redeem them to get wbtc back and finally you could also create a tablet stream for example you could stream pbtc to some recipient you can select start time end time amount and then uh click create stream once you create a stream then a stream id is generated and the recipient can then enter the stream id withdraw on to withdraw from the stream finally you could send tokens like say pbtc wbtc to an address and also create an open source project to process erc20 payments for adai pbtc etc it's a non-custodial solution which allows you to trigger your own purchase flow on our transfer confirmation yeah any questions i'm still kind of playing your video on my end without the audio because i thought you were going to just do this thing in tandem but i can still i can still play the rest of the video or you want me to stop and we can just go on to the question you can play any video then play and i can continue so basically uh once you generate a btc address right you can scan from a wallet and send btc to that address and corresponding btc tokens are minted and you can also redeem them to get btc back any time and the next step is to conduct the video then this swap tokens feature say for example you could swap a pbtc to wbtc and if you enter the from amount and two amount is automatically filled and once you get the wbtc right then what you can do is you can deposit it to our way to earn interest using aw btc and then what you can do is you can also redeem a wbtc anytime and uh after that thing you can also create established stream say for example uh you could stream uh btc token to a recipient you just enter the amount of start time and time and the recipient address and then it would seem tokens to the recipient and what it does it at the end when the stream is created it creates a stream id so the recipient can enter the stream id to withdraw from the satellite screen that you can see over here this is a ui and then you can withdraw from the stream once that's done and uh the next step would be uh after this there's a step where you can send tokens basically like say for example you can send pbtc tokens or say or die to any recipient and what also i've done is i've created an open source project basically which is a non-customer solution to run this script and what it does is it watches for erc20 transfers to address and what you can do is you can run a script to process the purchase and for this it is perfect currency because you know it increases in balance over the time and uh this is the an example of the script here i got a payment say from this address and to address and this is the amount so here what i can do is i can write a custom script which triggers the purchase a complete non-customizable solution so you don't have to trust anybody like you can just run them on your own servers and finally the friendliness about react gifts uh that utilizes my contacts from p tokens available erc20 uh payments processor utility is powered by node shares and the future work would be immediately released and to add more features and uh into ux further and it's live on uh option on netflix as cs5 yeah can i ask one question yeah my understanding is that you've built a user interface where i can deposit in that say b p b dc i can then lock that in this how do you pronounce the sabler and then i can stream you know that btc to someone else and they can withdraw that at some point so it's sort of like a user process around it is that a fair way to describe it no yeah the perfect description [Music] yep um i'm having a little bit of trouble um with the with the connection but uh i will say one thing that i like is that uh you know you could flesh that out just as a portal for you know uh bitcoin people coming into ethereum it's like um you've got a way for them to uh to mint tokens on the blockchain and then you have like three or four different use cases right you can like you say you can you can stream uh your btc or you can uh loan it you can send it um yeah i think you can deposit to avail to earn interest and you can also using unicef v2 can convert to other tokens and also i have created a script which says that they can accept pbtc also or say balance increases so it's the multiple options so basically what it does it showcases how ethereum and d5 can be used it should define compatibility basically oh can i ask one last question at the very start of the video do i send actual bitcoin to it and then it gets converted into the pbtc okay so it's on a barcode scanner you scan it and then it gets converted to p p btc then so you can convert using unicef to wbtc then say deposit to rb to one aw btc and then save another stream token using sam yeah it basically shows the entire uh defy capabilities like awesome well thank you so much for raj and thanks so we're coming to the towards the end of this uh this judging day we have two more projects to go and uh next up i'd like to call balloon finance to uh come up and present their hack please welcome bloom and my teammate calvin lockwood worked on the design and documentation along with a lot of ideas and planning for this project we are bloom finance we created an app that allows anyone to create custom gift cards or coupons or features for their businesses or stores that when purchased earn interest on the deposit a portion of the deposit is paid to the company in advance which can help with revenues during covet 19 and the remainder is held in an nft that represents the gift card why for one it's your money and you deserve the interest on it so when you create a gift card or buy a gift card the money that goes into that gift card is still technically yours and you should be earning the interest from that from that deposit also during times of of crisis such as coding 19 it does help companies to generate a revenue and keep them afloat by being able to pay half of the gift card value to the company in advance while the other half sits in escrow earning interest for the gift card holder i'm totally ready to go to the store and spend it perhaps at a time when story opens after clove at 19. um and there's of course um nothing better than accepting advanced payments for goods and services so it can help both the customer and the businesses we have integrated with portis for management and ave for interest rate tokens and the whole thing the whole website is hosted on ipfs for decentralized hosting at this point i would love to jump into the demo unfortunately i did not have enough time to complete the entire ui and i started a new job last week uh working with school together and i just had to shift priorities uh to that for the last couple of weeks which really put a time crunch on my abilities to deliver for the hackathon but with that said i can demo what we have so far so this is the ui the main landing page where a person would come and find a company that could see all the coupons that company might have or if they already have a coupon name or gift card they can scan it to manage that coupon or gift card see the balance see the interest destroy it claim all the assets in full or if they take it to a store they can use that point of sale system to redeem items in store and if they are a company they can register companies we'd like to white list this at first to prevent uh scam companies popping up that's claimed to be a store that they're not things like that until we figure out a real solid way to prevent copycat stores and theft of funds so to begin with we'll sign in we'll connect with our poorest integration once it's connected we have a connected our wallet address to and that's pretty much as far as the ui has gotten at this point i'm going to jump over to the smart contract code uh to give a brief walkthrough of how the audience creation works um yeah a lot of things there's a controller contract more technical if you guys wanted to go through this or not uh should we just let the video play or did you want to stop there and you can let it play it manages purchases and redemption of coupons so it has a bunch of other helper functions such as being a principal interest balance the first step would be to register as a member memberships are created as an nft a specific type of nft that way memberships can be transferred as easily as an nft token and when creating new types of coupons you have to supply your membership token id to confirm that you have created a membership once you create a type of coupon you can create multiple types of coupons for your company you can specify the max supply of coupons for this type the minimum amount of deposit um home might be ten dollars but with the system we're designing we are not planning to restrict the consumer to increments of 10 25 simply 100 being a blockchain based we can allow the consumer to deposit any amount of assets into the gift cards they want provided they meet the minimum deposit and then we supply a reserve ratio which is the amount of money that's going to go to the company in advance and the amount is going to be reserved for the nft uh in order to generate interest upon it and there's a minimum reserve ratio just to make sure that we do um have a deposit in the nft that can generate interest so that your gift card does grow when someone comes to mint a coupon if they purchase a coupon they'll provide the coupon type and how much money they want to put into their coupon or their gift card uh in this case we then deposit our asset tokens into and the way that works is we've created a bridge we create really small slimline simplified smart wallets that are connected to every nft that is augmented so every gift card essentially has a really slim wouldn't call it a smart well i guess it's more of a dumb wallet um it really doesn't do much uh beyond providing access to the funds laying in it and a place for the interest to grow from audi so first when we create a coupon we'll create a token and we'll map that token id to the address of the new smart wallet that we've created and then we will deposit the assets that we collect from the user into honda's lending pool we'll convert them to a tokens through the deposit mechanism we'll receive a tokens into our contract and we'll transfer those a tokens into the token smart wallet where they'll then gain interest now the only person who has access to that smart wallet and the funds would be the nft owner since the token is owned by someone you can always drive the ownership of that token and determine if it has access to the funds and that way the gift card can be transferred uh just as easily as an nfg can be transferred on the blockchain um hey robert i think we're uh coming to the tail end of the time here but uh if there's any sort of closing pieces in this video that would be great but that's pretty much it uh yeah gift cards that grow in value uh based on interest deposited um so yeah that was the adjustment the rest of this is kind of a technical walkthrough because i didn't have time to demonstrate obvious so i was trying to film the technical integration with ave that way yeah so any questions uh feel free hey robert thanks for the demo super cool and welcome to uh you know congrats on joining pull together um you know just on you know your last comment on the transferability i mean you know with coupons like all sort of business make money on them is actually for people not redeeming them and like you know sort of maybe giving them to someone else who might actually use them um you know how do you sort of think about like being able to trade them or like reminding people to use them or do you think they will sort of just kind of sit there like you know collecting interest for uh indefinitely um so that's a good question that's the nice thing about being on a computer base a lot of the gift cards i have in my wallet i've actually literally forgotten about and i've never spent um mostly because i have a lot of cards in my wallet i don't notice them with our system we could attach a messaging system so i mean if people wanted to provide an email address associated with their coupon or their gift card then we could provide periodic emails and updates hey you've accused accrued this much interest over the last week or month or hey you still have this much money to spend at the store the store is open um you know stuff like that so there is a there the technological approach to gift cards gives us that avenue to be able to to reach the customers provided that they want to be reached even though i'm not a judge i just want to comment this is a really cool idea thank you appreciate it well thank you thank you guys awesome thanks again and congrats on on shipping and demoing so uh with that we have our last hack for the day and i'd like to call up collab.land on to zoom so welcome james hey everybody how's it going i'm uh let me get up this video demo and yeah i'll just let the the video do the talking for the first part of this and then we can go into a live demo and answer questions right after let me know if the audio is not working the team at abridged created collab land this past month of the hack money hackathon to build a simple system leveraging tokenization for community development our system takes about 10 minutes to create your own community concierge using a telegram bot an air table as a back end and a membership system that permissions access via an nft using stripe or through a role using their social tokens the tech stack that we used leverages node-red a visual development environment and abridged smart contracts all this is built and powered by ethereum we hope you enjoyed the presentation hello welcome to collab land i will be your guide in this journey collab land builds better communities by giving creatives and leaders all the tools they need to create engage and organize their people to understand where we come from let's go back to the beginning of the internet in february 1985 a community of writers journalists futurists thinkers and musicians came together to form a membership called the well the whole earth electronic link they used email in a primitive forum to discuss philosophies and ideas about the future human connection continued to evolve from online forums and email groups to more sophisticated social networking sites the innovation of the internet allowed humans to connect to each other across the world in a simple instant and powerful way with more companies working remotely since the pandemic society is rapidly transitioning to a more virtual future and the importance of community connection could never be stronger these times will set the standard for a new normal of human interaction and collab land is a perfect tool to foster online community growth in collab land you can automate processes to serve your unique community this bot or digital concierge acts as a doorman greeting members a referee rewarding participation a signpost directing traffic and facilitates decisions through a governance system [Music] land is the hub to onboard understand community goals and missions and participate in discussions wherever your community lives the key innovation for collaboration comes from aligning incentives with tokens to drive engagement reward community participation and facilitate decisions for a community bank today collab land acts as a simple subscription service for community management tools such as an exclusive chat room and telegram these tools for membership systems using an nft purchased through stripe or for the more crypto savvy through token ownership while simple today the future of collab land holds many opportunities tokens on ethereum allow for the newest and most flexible way to create aligned incentives people are actively tokenizing themselves like alex mashmas their contracts like the nba basketball players spencer denwity and their communities like reddit collab land has a three-phase roadmap the first phase will optimize the automation of personal token sales and i says the second moves our focus to community tokens and systems with a common bank in the third phase collaboland will tokenize the platform itself in order to begin the process of decentralization the feature set of the phases mentioned includes integrating more robust participation graphs like source cred as well as dao frameworks with layer 2 voting systems our team comes from around the world and we work remotely with a mixture of experience from web web3 and web2 this project would not have been possible without the amazing designers and storytellers who helped shape the vision the key features of collab land includes a tokenized membership system a participation award system as well as an account contract for each user bots and collab land automate membership onboarding user participation community information governance and ethereum accounts sign up for our waitlist today we're excited to collaborate [Music] cool um so i'm happy to field questions right now we can also jump into a live demo of kind of what the collab land looks like on the admin side as well as the user side um what do you all do you have any questions immediately i would like to see it on the user side on the user side sure that's perfect so let me pull this up so um i'm going to this is going to be a bit of a meta screen share here so james young can you all see this yes great um i wonder if i can make it bigger somehow can you see it better now uh no it's still the same size okay um so james will be pulling this up but here i can also kind of show what this is going to look like on my end um so what he's going through and i'm already a member of this group but essentially i send him the tutorial by the club land bot this is our community bot and then he hits start and the bot welcomes them hey here's our group um they have maybe some information about the group uh messages and things and then you can actually pay with stripe um and the stripe is going to meant an nft right now it's hooked up to a mentor in kovan and actually the stripe only works in mobile that's why we that's why we have james here so james can you hit there there we go so if you can see straight uh james is now playing with stripe and he's going to insert a demo credit card a test credit card cool and then the token will be minted um and i can i can pull up the the address too and show the sort of admin system but then james will be able to join the group and on my on my end the the bot greets with number go up um in this in this instance so that's a nice little thing and then um this is our community um and people can talk and then a very simple the first in uh iteration of this one piece is like both we want to we don't allow people to to use resources and tokens to align incentives the other piece though is like there's a social layer to the system um so eventually we'll integrate something like source cred at the moment we just have a leaderboard that is very simply counting messages within the group and so you can just very it's like a very simple proxy for participation it's not perfect obviously but um that's the that's what we have moving right now and all of this is set up within this little uh form system so it looks a little bit like a zapier form where you have like uh easy access to the api tokens you need to insert and then um and and then you can add your subscription options and your information on your community here um the services will include stripe um but they also you know you could think about using um different types of of tokens in here and it could be a custom token system where you're using any sort of network token to create your own permission chat room um and then the dashboard is just links for community information and then the community rewards is again what i was describing earlier right now it's just that counting system and you can see james is like testing it on this side um but then eventually we'll integrate source cred and other more more sophisticated uh community participation graphs so this is kind of what we have uh today but yeah curious if there are any questions about the system or how we built it or anything specifically um this was a super fun presentation thank you for it and one question i had was just trying to link this to the personal token element is it more from the aspect of like hey i can use like this platform as a as as a way to sort of manage my followers is that what you had in mind so um there's a number of ways we can we can use such personal tokens for this so for instance we've talked a lot to alex masmitch and uh he i mean he you can it's an easy way one to maybe offer your personal tokens is like a token sale so if people want to come and participate in your community you you know maybe they they have the personal token um integrated into the bot and then they're directed to a uni swap to purchase that or something for instance um another is that in this system within the admin of information we can integrate into like air table and it's an easy way for that personal token owner to keep track of the people there that do own those tokens um and and so it's relatively flexible you could also say you know set up a consultancy and maybe your personal token is just you know worth hours of your time and and that whenever people come to your consultancy it's automatically like siphoning off that number of tokens that are relevant for your if i may add real quick if you guys can hear me um we're also imagining experimenting so that a dao could be collateralized by personal tokens so that if you're an artist let's say a musician maybe you have a band or that then comes together as a dow where uh when you have ticket sales or get tipped when you know whenever revenue comes in that actually goes into the dow and since it's collateralized by your personal token you can have some type of rev share and then you can kind of go meta with that so you will have a dao of daos where it's like a a record label for example so there's different ways to like mix and match organizationally i won't are you going to integrate this with the gm style the james app oh yeah absolutely yeah if you need it so and like government the governance system sort of a few steps ahead right we kind of really want to make sure the token permission access and then these simpler features are solid and then integrate that governance whenever once we have that product a little more hardened but definitely keem awesome well thank you so much james and eric and both james all three of them that are on this call um this was a great presentation and a great close to uh to our day one of judging and uh we'll uh we'll try to end the live stream now and uh be ready for tomorrow so uh with that thank you everybody for uh for demoing thank you so much for everybody who was in all the different time zones that stayed out late to uh to present and hear the comments and questions from our judges and uh we can't wait for seven more days of uh more demos so thanks again and uh we'll see everybody tomorrow thank you judges thanks thank you thank you bye bye
