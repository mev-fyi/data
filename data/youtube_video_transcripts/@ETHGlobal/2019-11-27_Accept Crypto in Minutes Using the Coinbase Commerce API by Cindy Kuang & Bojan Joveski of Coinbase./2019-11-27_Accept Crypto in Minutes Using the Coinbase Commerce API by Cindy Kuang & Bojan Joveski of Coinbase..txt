spend a little bit of time today talking about what we do as a team for conferences and then most of the time I'm talking about how you can leverage RTC i3 packet on projects and then we're gonna do a little bit of a demo to show you how easy it is to like set up and work with a guy so first of all what is commerce so commerce is a product that is designed to allow merchants to easily accept crypto currency payments all you need is an email and you just make an account on our website and within minutes you can start accepting payments through our platform and you can manage your payments you can check your balances and you can withdraw your money to any address that you choose all through this user from the US and so that's what we do now we're going to talk a little bit about some highlights in our API that we think would be really useful for you as you think about what you want different projects and also remember our prize so we're sponsoring a 1,000 USD see our prize for the team with the most creative use of our API so for someone who kind of thinks out of the box and makes us like surprise in terms of like oh I didn't know like you could use our API to do that so just that's something to be thinking about kind of like some cool features that we've already built that you can maybe because out of the box hello everybody so our heated premiere is geared towards riches we can't even see no no except they're different systems so the process of accepting cryptocurrencies that we need to be trading a lot of addresses going to be the point three so if you happen to create to be building some projects where you need to have kind of like per session or per user unique item identifier you can use our API solution approach in that thing the addresses that we generate they are all be perfectly compatible but just like we should mention that our product is like manifesto Gil meaning that you get like one master in the morning to see and from then on we can arrive as a unique number of addresses we do need to reduce these we generate different addresses for Bitcoin like unique engagement I guess like the more interesting things for for for us this weekend is like a theory we use the C so that that it's like one thing that I think can be used as a building block even though it comes with anything demonstrated the other side of like once we've generated these addresses like is that we can use is that we can we can vacations whenever something happens so if somebody sends payment to it if the payment is confirmed from the blockchain we will send you a representation indicating that that particular thing happened and the way that we can use this in the builders of Rudys work is that if you need some sort of like a treasure that used to be treatment by certain defense treaties on interest we can kind of like I guess like in addition to all of these things because they're famous things like we need to convert and handle different crisis in my different amounts that where is like Kia one side here's the trick top remedial money like we can we use that essential exchange so these are kind of like the two very kind of like basic primitives that we offered that kind of like yes a product we send emails through the buyers whenever payment occurs like some circle an email notification series like it's triggered whenever somebody base something in the whole chain you're more than welcome to use us if you think that webhook notifications are the opinion you don't want to have like a server the Iranian Candace like leesneed 403b speaks we provide redirect URL that kind of be automatically triggered whenever whenever a payment episode of watching we do have integration mathematics which is kind of just like a nice user experience when whenever like fire opens our our widget we would automatically although any questions about this thing even if you kind of like I guess that variation in distance II thank you doctor using correct and they were not happy to discuss it will help if like in this this is like essentially how our settings would here we post this particular widget where the magic happens in this widget can kind of like what we show to the buyers when they interact with our platform they can we can require the an email is entered here in case you need that thing but like once you have this thing you can essentially Sharon I think is that if you don't want this thing to be justified hosted by us we can at least even better right in here all of these things kind of like another feature that we can think about using is like your cogeneration which is like pretty mean for any sort of like mobile wallets or real life interactions where we have like two devices one of them which is to show a particular information and the other one is to like in detectors basic a particular Foreman that is like standard drug leads to that before the all so that we can but a point-of-sale capability still feature that we can somehow use it you can hopefully programmatically chart API which is the products if you somehow removing something that requires this thing or something along these lines you're more than welcome to so now they go through a short demo where yeah Oh the purpose of this demo is basically to show you how easy it is to kind of get started with our API so Oregon 'litham created a new commerce account we're just going to go through the onboarding flow [Music] to go through this masters see them and now what we're gonna do is we're going to go into settings and we're going to generate an API key and so this is so we've already set up a kind of like just kind of default rails app and if we run the rails server right now I'm just going to it's just it says hello world right now so what we're gonna do is we're going to go into the controller for this page and add our API key and two as a constant and go into our gem file and basically we want to include my face homers as one of the required jobs at the same to Miami there's just some code I'm going to copy over that we're going to use to generate a QR code so back inside of welcome controller now that we have the coin base Commerce Gems we're going to basically create a new client like that and then we're going to fill out we're going to create a check-up info object and basically populate it with all of the fields that we need in order to generate a check out so when surveys and it's pricing type basically and you can either specify how much a user will pay you or you can choose in this case no price so then the user can choose like to thank you I knew about and this is good for donations if you do choose to set a fixed price you also have to fill any like and then finally we're requesting or requesting that when users pay us they still in there and that's the info for the check so what we're gonna do now is basically fine at checkout create with info and this is the checkout that we just created and each checkout is basically or like this check out object will have its own ID field and as we show you earlier all of the payment or the check out widgets are opposed to a link that we generate for you this is a really ugly way of creating it that URL but we're gonna just create it like this check out and we're gonna just create the URL like this and then finally a blank you and then finally we're just going to add a sub code again just to generate the QR code and then inside of our HTML what we want to do is basically show you guys a QR code which you guys can which hopefully of this word yes so you can scan this QR code now on your phone or you can visit the link that I just and once you scan that QR code you should be able to go to you should be able to go to the checkout widget send any amount of cryptic or any currency that you would like and will have your name and email so then come by our table later and we'll have a specialist wag for you guys yeah so that's like basically it took like five minutes to kind of like get all this set up and like to you know expose just like QR code and from here like it is possible to kind of just like you know the possibilities are endless you could just like for your hackathon project like I'm sure there are more creative ways that you can think of [Music] yeah okay yes no everybody has their own address is being generated when they scan at this jar that it's the Demerol and that's it for our presentation and [Music] we had a series right so that basically we create a wallet for you when you you know when we generate that same phrase so that's where the mic is going but we also we don't have like what Mike Palmer's doesn't have this future is a number like it's our servers [Music] yes I think I'm disappoint there's it like a same others for every customer orders can be dynamically generated but the presentation we are able to use by essentially a chief s legitimate like you address whenever whatever usually open that me show you that your situation just up for you and that's how we know would be one that's because you're the only one that has seen that address any payments and address them at the same time I as a user Wallace which utilize like always in 32 yes so like well our product our product is good like which are all features where the pots are like which point Sudha before the core space so we are able to construct the web browser but they're going to pay for all this transaction additional like mining company excuse me I gonna pay like additional chemical for all those wallets you have to pay an extra transaction fee when you're in trouble and also some type of drove almost always going to be connected together because it's kind of focus by transaction itself like if you say there are four transactions so what's the point - in generates just for accounting well I mean the point of Jared ABCD matrices so that kind of relationship can identify like right here it might be easier transaction cash but it would be impossible for you to know and especially like for people that use wallets this another but we go punish you because we can prove which address postures wear the pants region in the different but if you're eight from any people exchange because of the way the best hair in sections that's work is pretty much impossible to know how your fonts like where your fonts copy so that's why I live kind of like engineer this way we determine your interests any others like your right leg here like certain privacy considerations prudence which can we like me to get that if you try to with your decent matches but like I don't think that honestly like that at any point any point you would like to have get your fonts at a certain level if you need flight if you need to care about like privacy then like they're like different ways that you can do after after the plants are there this is not the most private solution out there but you don't it's Russian wallets and so the seats creates East like as he should be the route with all the fees click agent hierarchy and they're like various ones like before divorce like one founders that defines essentially like was what bad you should use it was used warmer less consistent therefore the control inspection if you load up the seats like Greg : or eating this beating words which like some toffee is that think you get what I get [Music] yes and all they are essentially we go home to play four levels deep and from that point onwards we just like that person and that's kind of like our standard that's how most worthless poverty services so the intermediary addresses are needed so that you can intermediary spokesperson there but they're not useful we can send you could there is no redirection envienta duty redirection Gant is that when a merchant was to feature the spots they're constantly like that different pieces and at that point would be especially in the case of interview with Crete like multiple transactions at one period there's in the final transaction from the universe to whatever this nation features so in kind of like I guess the usual flow is that our merchants usually want to fish up to here so they would when entered with some exchange of deposit exchange they will deposit address from like an exchange so then that's it's kind of like how generals while all the fonts were there certain things that you do to make you smarter is to questions which I'm like reading a man of nature first question from the sound of it it doesn't seem as though at least the smart contract addresses taichiwu like the kappa so to speak so like to kind of address that the questions about like Gucci dress being so many of the staff and or you guys have you guys considered making it so that each address that's generated it's like a sweep account service because smooth into that main amount or are there a lot of like smart contract development inspiration yeah so actually we are in the process of doing that we for us DC blaring on actually already had like done that and you talk about it tomorrow 3:00 p.m. so if you would like to learn more about that but he got the short answer is yes and now it seems like the same thing and we couldn't do that before either and you have to kinda like is possibly possible when Pia to stinking for debt is that doing this intermediary BBC community at their system services quite a lot of complexity when it comes to let me during the console and especially for years 20 tokens introduces the problem that now we have like all these accounts that they're intermediate that don't have easy paper guess so you need to somehow provide equal those addresses and thereby sending it or we've actually developed this but very likely explain contracts that serve as like our intermediary so how we don't use that it working for style derived addresses instead of like the employees like very lightweight smart contracts that automatically know how to flush anybody could be the sin that makes executives like bosses with the right forward abilities and then like sub-question within that when you guys kind of push that out in their production the ability for emergency customize the way there's a set of sweet you could do the difference they do that in theory we're not Benita and I think that we want to keep it like in my personal opinion that sort of concern should be handled by the app itself Oh chilly and especially because if you want to treat them somehow usually want to do the grouping like after and all of these kind of like every generation or released it happened before salsa so solely respect sums up here and if we there is like bunch of stuff that happen but if we decide to do business I think that that would be and the emptier kind of database layer you I rather than having like and the last question is I might a business within parameter associated with rice and you get really granular such that say the price is $100 but if you have some sort of promo for specific tokens or like incentivize people paying with one terminal or another better exchange Raiders that can you have tweaked like say like you have 10% off these are we don't offer ducting but essentially if you use kind of like a linear your own API you can customize for each person you see and the price of their sin so they're gonna be like where you can include something the price is usually hundred dollars but just for you in the next five minutes it's like 90 so that's definitely something that it's not something that you could do to kind of like the ultimate that weight and exists because then it's also possible to use our product of the greatest checkout so if you create these links only within Armitage but it only from clicking Bar Association if you go that route then we try to delete notes that we can turn we can tweak so that it's simpler for non-technical people to use it but if you want to you should we can we can hook up to words they can yeah and also they can either kick is that well I mean we have to go through more about the discard context but if you're interested or if you are using like anything your projects of how to reduce like name and forward equal x mark on Shakespeare like IDs or the reference implementation in the spring we have like a one-pager that kind of like goes to all the stuff that we talk about and the different technology that we must issue used to do that the product we were more than happy to help with any questions that you might have but it's about every generation each new world as sweeping transection buildings most management gas costs like create new addresses all of these kind of stuff we've touched or well building the product and the community you don't end up using our API we're happy to help you which SDKs for different languages also
