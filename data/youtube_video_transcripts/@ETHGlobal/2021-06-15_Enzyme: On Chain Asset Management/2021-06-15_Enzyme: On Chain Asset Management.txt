is to do your intro and presentation and if you have any questions feel free to drop it in the chat for them to answer later on yeah definitely thanks for that um so i'm a user representative of enzyme finance together with felix hartman um hey guys hi yes we're really excited to have you guys here to build on uh hack money and hopefully on enzyme um i think we'll start off with a small video from mona who is one of the founders of enzyme and then we'll head over to a demo with felix and all of the other good stuff hey everyone and welcome to hack money 2021 i'm super excited to tell you a little bit about enzyme and the prices we're going to be offering during the hackathon for those of you who don't know about enzyme enzyme is a completely decentralized asset management infrastructure built on ethereum enzyme empowers individuals and communities to build scale and monetize bulk strategies on chain that can interact with the entirety of d5 we're going to be offering three prizes during this hackathon which will be paid out in mln and we've provided some inspiration and guidelines for you which might be helpful as your teams gather our team is always happy to support and we're excited to meet you in our discord channel okay so i pass it over to felix who will fill you in on the details of what enzyme is awesome thanks much jio and thanks for having us hack money so thanks everyone for joining in um today i want to just cover really quick you know what is enzyme because some of you might be hearing about enzyme for the first time an enzyme is a really unique product because enzyme really was the first on-chain asset management protocol that allows anybody to either you know start their own trip to hedge fund their own um you know mutual fund or now we see we start seeing treasuries being launched on enzyme while you have entire protocols around the entire treasury using the enzyme infrastructure because what enzyme offers is twofold one if you're an investor that allows you to find walls or funds that you can invest with a proven track record because you know all too many times you know we see apys and we don't really know is it real same way goes in traffic you know in fratfire there's been so the history is littered with people lying on performances but the blockchain doesn't lie since enzyme is run on ethereum you could check really transparently you know how has a fund really performed you can see every single trade they ever made you can see their aum you can see who's the positive how much of the deposit are people pulling out right so it's fully transparent and unlike traffic it's available 24 7 which means those funds they trade 24 7 if you want to redeem if you want to add it's always available and on the flip side whether you are somebody who wants to start a fund or whether you are a protocol that wants to you know set up the treasury or whether you're a strategist that wants to have automated vaults and this is something that gl will talk about as well because there are automated strategies that you can set up using enzyme uh you can set up a bolt in minutes right now you know knock on wood um gas speeds are so low it costs about nine dollars to you know thirty dollars to set up an enzyme vault so if you ever thought about setting up an enzyme it probably now is a time because during the high gastric times it used to cost like a thousand dollars so right now it's perfect time to set one up uh only takes you know a minute one single transaction um and we've got all kinds of defender creations which instead of telling you about them i'll show you them in a demo in a second we've really got everything from lending into creation staking amm pools um but now you know we're getting things like with sulu things like you know wi-fi to create a curve integrated um staking uh like why we said that like you know sticking with uh mistake um so a lot of exciting things are coming and also acts to over 200 plus tokens many of them you can't even find um you know on traditional you know centralized exchanges because we're using integrations like synthetics for example where you can trade gold oil you know inverted um different tokens and so forth so here's a just a quick list of like all the decorations we have because you know some people might know enzyme from back in the day from the version one days where you know all you really had was uniswap kyber i think xerox you know just basic trading but now you know enzymes really are full-fledged i call it a d5 mega activator um where you have every single tool the d5 integrated from ave compound curve idle finance kyber parasol synthetics funeral swap 0x and then upcoming we've got everything from alpha male version 2 balancer version 2 um borrowing using things like are they unison version three coming and you're involved and you know when you look at the list of names a lot of this came um with enzyme it was called melon version one and then enzyme version two and zulu is essentially our version three so a lot of the stuff came last six to twelve months so you can only imagine what we'll be integrating the next four months and so this is this is really exciting because you know just to share historic aom i actually got involved with enzyme back in june of last year literally one year ago today and back then i think we had eight hundred thousand dollars in total value locked as of this morning because we just had unslashed finance move a lot of their vault to enzyme we moved 80 million dollars to enzyme we now have almost 110 million dollars in total value locked so that's an amazing cloth from 800 000 a year ago to 110 million dollars in a year um and it's only going to keep throwing like that especially as enzyme goes after more and more like becomes more and more the d5 mega aggregator also that perfect vehicle for treasuries for vaults to use enzamas infrastructure because we've partnered with a lot of programs like for example unslashed use enzyme aurora capital uses enzyme more and more protocols are saying hey you know what let's focus on what we do best like talk from for example create strategies do yield aggregation but let's use enzyme asset front end as a perfect vehicle where people can easily invest easily redeemed they can see performances it's heavily heavily audited super secure and that's really where enzymes carving out its niche and then also uh from eight to two you know not only has you know of course tbl has grown quite a bit because of unslashed with plus 248 in the last month but everything else is growing equally fast we've seen an increase almost 30 increase in vaults um so for quick note i think when version one was shut down in january we switched to version two we only had 300 volts so the amount of balls has literally doubled since we launched version two in those three five months and then equally the amount of deposits meaning the amount of individual people investing in these different enzyme funds has also grown 16 in the last few months alone now standing at 1528 investors using enzyme to you know allocate to vaults and funds and i think that's now a good time for me to share my screen um geology real quick i'll share mine perfect there we go perfect so we're already right there here in enzyme let me just make my screen full screen perfect and so this is the landing page right our first glance can browse and see all the different funds so clearly we have the really big you know unslashed finance fund one with 81 million we've got a number of multi-million dollar funds attacking me i think they do a long short fund rhino fund they've been with us since version one yang express from the one and only hungarian uh lots of cool and even as you see melon treasure evolved right now we're using um enzyme ourselves for our treasury right now we're just holding melon but you know if there comes a time we want to make an otc trade to perhaps create some liquidity we can um and here you can filter by everything you know so for example we go to trouser um it's loading let me see if i need to move something around there we go sort by you can sort by anything for example you know the oldest funds you can sort alchemies for example gl um you can sort it filter by everything i believe here filters um you can just filter by size built by performance filter by you know performance of this month what denomination so everything is super affordable uh beyond that much more exciting let's look into both managers so i've set up a bunch of funds over the the last few months and you can go in there for example and say hey what can i do with it right uh on one hand you've got trade swaps so we've got our own interface where it pulls you the best pricing and tells you hey where's the best price to make these trades well that's curved kyber paris swap so you know let's say i have um uh let's say sushi oh because i i don't hold that in this one right now but anyway so if i type it in it tells you the best price you can swap it off from the interface liquidity wise we have uniswap integration so we can add to curve pools unit swap calls and of course earn the rewards so you can even claim the crv awards under the rewards tab so everything is going to create a compound curve staking we've got steak eat using steak pound on yields compound i think we've got compound and ave in here and then smaller cool things if you're a fund manager you can even set rules where you say like hey for example i am not allowed maybe you say hey i'm not allowed to trade um let's say uh doge we don't know deutsche bank but like you know i'm not allowed to trade dogecoin because say hey i don't want to touch me tokens right so now investors no one trusts that you won't do that and the cool thing about it is that it's programmatically meaning even if you wanted to you can't do it the vault will not allow you to violate your policies so it's no longer you know the whole idea behind decentralization is trustlessness you no longer have to trust that the fund manager is truthful about the performance it's truthful about the area it's true about the policies the code enforces it right and that's that's really really cool and let's see if there's anything else interesting i want to show you know network uh if you ever want to keep up to date with our network statistics you see a um right here the amount of deposit amount of volts you can even see how much are the different funds holding in the different assets and perhaps let me just go to and to show the transparency one level further we can go for something to technique right it's an ebtc fund and you can see the performance historically on all the time frames since they launched and you see the average return you can even see the amount of depositors they have in fact you can see every single trade they make you can go to trades and see every single trade that they made full transparency something that stratfi has never been able to pull off um so it's super super exciting any questions on databases while i'm at it otherwise i'll give it back to the geo um somebody got game asks is enzyme planted polygon to its network currently there's no decision being made about already a question yeah we'll come back to it later in the presentation uh perfection okay so yeah and with all that you know everything's automated even from management fees performance fees um i just reckon what i would just recommend to you right now gasps the load the best way to learn is just to set one up again costs you probably believe between 10 to 30 with the current gas fees um and you'll have that vehicle forever so that i'll give it back to gl okay let me share my screen again okay so for the global hackathon uh we came up with some ideas uh that you could for instance execute win of one of the prizes of course if you have a better id or you think of something cool definitely go for it the first one that is still missing in the current interface is a notification system so everything happens on chain but for instance when a manager receives an investment it will come in one denomination asset and it can be really handy for a manager to know when it arrives so he knows okay now i have to make a trade or now i have to rebalance the portfolio so one potential um like hackathon project could be to build a notification system on top of epns so ethereum push notification service they recently launched you can sign up through their website to get developer access so it's still a better access for developers but the product is fully functional so users can even already sign up for it so it will be cool if somebody wants to play around with it to see we can make a notification system to notify managers when investments are made or when a certain asset goes up or down by a specific percentage to notify the manager he needs to keep a close eye on his funds or even to give the different investors just some updates on their current words their current holdings inside these ones so for this you can also plug into the sub graph we have with a graph network um this is like just one example another thing could be to upgrade the existing dune analytics dashboard i'll actually quickly go into it so a community member created this it's very simple it shows a number of funds as well as the melon token price but based on all the unchained data and the subgraph data you can actually do a lot more with it so you could also for instance stack all addresses that interact with enzyme create different profiles not only track price or number of funds but for instance the number of individual investors or growth of the protocol there is another dashboard made by czech from nasari where we plot a few additional things um but we noticed for instance that both of these dashboards broke in functionality when we upgraded to the latest version of enzyme which happened like about a month ago we had a big protocol upgrade as you can see here the number of funds stops at may 7th as well here also in the beginning of may when the protocol upgrade happens it stops while we're currently already at about 600 funds so it would be really cool if somebody uh could like work on these it's all open source i think you can go into like different queries um although i'm not yeah for instance here um you can find a lot more information on how to work with this in the documentation of just doing analytics itself so that's also uh one of the possibilities um to spend your time on another would be to build a dashboard for nunson ai which is also like a blockchain data analytics platform would be really cool to have enzyme represented on there there are a bit like more advanced items as well so for instance somebody asked about polygon like to be clear it's not on the main um like development roadmap of the core team but like personally myself i'm a big polygon user i think felix is also um like really uh likes their solution um to reduce guest fees for common users um so it would be really cool if somebody wants to take a step at creating like a light version of enzyme uh with all the integrations that are already live on polygon like ave curve and power swap we have this yeah the code available for it it will require a lot of adjustments though so it's not for the faint-hearted um but it could be a really interesting way it could end up in production um i personally see a lot of value in offering like a cheaper onboarding for users besides the ethereum main network there's a different oh sorry there's a whole range of different things as well you could create a brand new adapter so set up an integration with a different protocol one of uh like a developer reached out to us recently about creating an adapter for pull together he's working on that right now if you have a similar id like oh it would be really cool if for instance i could plug into x tokens or some other protocol that you love to use and you would like to see more people use feel free to start working on an adapter like we have the codes base available on github there is a mock adapter also where you can look like which structures are needed i'll provide the link at the end of the presentation you can also think of like potentially like new fee policies or new trading policies that could be implemented in enzyme another thing that you could look into is our enzyme sdk there will be a new blog post about it i think tomorrow or the day after the current one is a bit outdated but there is a javascript or typescript library if i'm not mistaking uh call to enzyme sdk which you can use to build a basic training bot on enzyme the documentation also needs a bit of work so you will have to figure it out how it works but we all love a challenge right so that's also one thing that a lot of users would love to see like the ability to add training bots to their vault so they can automate some things because currently we're using power swap or other taxes for the swapping and most of these don't support limit orders so like creating a bot that can make limit orders would be really valuable for instance um we also have the ability to create like a bit more complex yield farming strategies so for instance the curve integration already has the ability to farm crv tokens and other tokens like lido tokens convert them back into either the underlying assets in the vault similar to what heron is doing or convert them to either or another asset all in one transaction so creating this like yield generating uh farming strategy would also be quite interesting um to offer to like users of enzyme there is quite some documentation you can go through we have like the open github including this mod generic adapter code let me see if i still have it open i'll quickly [Music] got truth so here you can um read a bit more about like what the structure is like there is um there are some comments um what an adapter can do what its limitations are a bit on like the syntax that is used for all of this um so if you are interested in it i suggest to just check out the code see how the current implementation is and what it can do similarly we have these quiet advanced developer documentation where you can look into um like the architecture of the code base [Music] the different names for like we have a fun deployer which is used to create new fonts [Music] uh different type of users so that's also one of the features you can from delegated trading in a fund to specific accounts it's also something you could uh like start working on it try to devise some new schemes based on this and there's like a lot of a lot of possibilities uh maybe as well for now we use for the price fields mainly um know chain lick chain link prices there's some other ones as well [Music] yeah in here so if you could um well if you can think of another way to implement a new price feed for instance so we can add more assets into the asset universe feel free to make a suggestion we also have some um some guidelines for contributing to the code um maybe they're not in here but i think they're also in the developer documentation it's on the the main branch in the enzyme github i suggest to first read these guidelines before making for instance and pull requests etc because we have a private github repository that you can request access to sir working on the latest version of the code the current version that's public on github is the one that's live in production similarly here is a link to one of these new analytics dashboards and if that's not enough if you need more inspiration we have this website it's called kenny enzyme.kenny.io where you can go through like a whole bunch of user requests so uh here you can see what actual what users want to see for instance like leverage trading or like a small thing this is more like a ui work enabling blog posts i think that we're actually already working on that but you can have a look at like the feature requests look maybe best to look at the newest ones look at the ones that have some votes for instance we have like the epns notifications in here matic implementation adding a bunch of different assets like limit orders um and a whole bunch of different things so yeah i think that's about it for uh like the demo so definitely to stay in touch with us um i suggest to join the discord there's a developer channel in there where you can get support from the team from avagon avant-garde finance which are the lead developers as well as some of the community members definitely also check out our twitter for some blog posts where we dive deeper into the workings of enzyme you can also check out telegram so yeah maybe we can go hello yeah maybe we can go for some go over some questions with these last minutes we have here um just you know two to three questions please because we're running low on time okay so if you're anyone in audience if you have any like urgent questions please post them in the chat so we have a question from gaway who says we started a dao from davao house and wants to see if you can use super fluid in some way with enzyme that's a really good question currently we don't directly support it but it could be a nice way to incorporate it so like super fluid is a protocol where you can stream money which would be for instance a really cool way to for instance distribute a profits from a vault back to investors just uh one example we could yeah think of different things i think i think superfluid definitely could be used uh in an enzyme funds from what i understand though superfluid is built on x dye so would have yes sorry for that like it's exact it's also a polygon right now so it could be a combined there i'm not sure if they have an ethereum name that's uh deployment but yeah maybe felix more up to date yeah i answered many other questions but i i saw you know simon seems like he's simon and galway and are really ready to get going um those two that's the most questions i'll definitely look forward to you two reach out to us whether it's on telegram or discord um you know whether it's you want to build the polygon integration or whether it's the superfluid integration your ideas you know are what you know really builds these networks right these are decentralized networks and a lot of the features that you see today came from users so i highly highly encourage that and if any of you that just watched me didn't ask a question you can think of something like hey i would love to use an enzyme but this feature is missing i really don't see purpose in using until this is here then build it you know and i think you know the hackathon is just like you know the tip of the iceberg you can we also have you know enzyme funding proposals down the road if you say hey i've got this bigger idea that i want to add you could always appeal to us the council and say like hey i could build this over the span of six months this is what it would take and we can fund that so um really encourage any developers out there to come approach us yeah exactly we have a big treasury waiting to be spent and um i guess also just to make a recommendation here uh i would invite so later on this week and kind of next monday there will be team information sessions so you can bring your friends actually to also build um on enzymes so then you know the more the merrier you know the more people get involved in the technology the more people learn that's what we're kind of all going for and what we're all aiming for years definitely definitely join that and kind of you know recruit other people who would be very excited to build on enzyme as i'm sure there's a lot of people who would be um so yeah thanks thank you so much uh you know um for presenting here on enzyme today um and again if anyone has any questions please do um hop to the discord chat there is a sponsor dash enzyme channel where you can ask um the enzyme folks all the questions you want and have a nice day everyone
