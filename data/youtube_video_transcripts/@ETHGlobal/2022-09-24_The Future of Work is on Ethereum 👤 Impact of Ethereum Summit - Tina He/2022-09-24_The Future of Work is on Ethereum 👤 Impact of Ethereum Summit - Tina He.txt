foreign [Applause] [Music] moving on to another topic that I think is you know really really interesting it's been a topic that's been obviously in the news during uh over the last couple years as people are kind of adapting to new ways of working um kind of in parallel to that I think maybe you know a little bit quieter has been this kind of innovation of of kind of the future of work and and people building and doing things in a permissionless fashion on ethereum um so I wanted to invite Tina from the station team uh to come and give a chat about kind of the the work that's being done uh both at station and just kind of broader in the ecosystem and just sort of like kind of what what is happening in the space and how ethereum is impacting it so um Tina without further Ado I'd love to kind of welcome you to the stage and feel free to share your kind of share your video on mute um and yeah it'd be awesome to go from here there you go hey Tina good to have you here great to see you awesome so yeah feel free to share your screen if you have something to share and I will get out of the way and I'm excited to hear what you uh hear your presentation we're excited about this awesome can you see my screen okay yeah it looks great awesome um thank you so much for having me um I'm Tina I'm one of the co-founders of station labs and we're building a set of decentralized tooling to help um contributors and DOW members coordinate and collaborate with each other more permissionlessly um so this is a very very broad topic and I kind of put kind of air quotes future of work because we all know that it's been kind of abused as kind of this buzzword um you know throwing around both in the VC sphere and also kind of in ethereum um and kind of wanting to start off as like you know what even is the future of work and we see that um definitions have evolved over time um some people believe that the future of work is remote work it's distributed work um there's this idea about you know new models of value attribution and distribution around Creator economy um around gig economy and then you know we had this open source ecosystem that is super super close to kind of ethereums um foundation and um and Ethos and generally the larger crypto ecosystem as well um so I think that honestly It's a combination of a lot of these Concepts all in one and I think a lot of times when we look at what's happening in ethereum what's happening with Dows what's happening with this new class of Labor sometimes it's very easy to kind of see things in silos where you know these are um you know very groundbreaking things are happening in ethereum which you know oftentimes are true but also you know the same movement is also happening Beyond so I think the goal of the talk is really kind of put things more contextually and really look at the current stock of kind of global distributed work and you know the kind of existing infrastructure to support that and kind of like Envision and ideate like what the possibilities could be moving forward um so a big big move um you know around the future of work is really this idea of you know in the past we worked in offices and now we're working online um but also this idea of like relationships are now becoming much more digital in native where we meet people on Twitter we meet people on GitHub we meet people on these digital platforms and then we because of the proof of work um that you know it's it's both a you know very you know um crypto native concept but also it's it's a concept that um is prevalent in other digitally native platforms as well like GitHub where you have a provenance of the work that you've done um and because of these relationships you see this kind of reflection of you know the offline space um being reflective of these online relationships that are also very authentically built based on you know what you've done on the internet um and the reason why we're all here right now um you know at if Global um is you know because of this distributed Network ethereum um and now people are gathering in real life and on like offline and offline um kind of discussing topics that you know unite us um and really kind of one framework that I really like to think about is actually through the lens of Urban Design because why we need cities um I really love this book called or order without design by Elaine Patron um and um he kind of talks about how cities are essentially labor markets and one quote that you know resonates with both myself and also a lot of other Dao leaders and you know Founders in this space are really kind of thinking about the you know ethereum and also generally Dao's as a labor market as a city so what does the city need um so we have you know a well-functioning labor market brings together people with varied but complementary Knowledge and Skills the preconditions for Innovation um and a well-functioning labor market also makes possible every other Urban attraction like Orchestra museums and art galleries so we are already seeing that you know kind of the early glimpses of that in crypto and in ethereum ecosystem we have protocols like urine and index Co-op there are you know very very well organized and like Cooperative dials with you know a variety of different functions the same same way that we you know in a company we have all these different functions um but we also kind of see these Urban attractions that start to emerge from that Central economic activities of people producing valuable protocols um generating economic value for the ethereum ecosystem which you know kind of subsequently increases the value or demand of ethereum as a participant um just like how you know the value of kind of the U.S or the value of New York um it's kind of increasing the demand of people wanting to migrate into that City and ecosystem um so you know from Urban attraction perspective we see kind of fov which is you know a great social doubt I'm throwing events in real life and Idlewild um California um and which actually completely I think changes the the towns um perception of crypto and now I I am aware that recently they also received like a 13 000 donation um to kind of spin up another um like a more ongoing initiative on the local level to have kind of more crypto communities to gather and and meet in real life and in Idlewild which is kind of a crazy impact on the real world economy um if you think about it um and then there's you know dials like bright moments where they're hosting events exhibitions shows um inspired by their collections of nfts and really like their nfts are great and they're beautiful but it's very clear also that you know beyond our it's much more Beyond much more beyond the artwork itself where these artworks are just collections of identities where you know people who have a the same kind of artwork um from the same city could find and discover one another and then go to these events and actually see each other in person so if we look at ethereum at this new city that we already kind of saw this kind of early glimpse of you know we have complementary skill sets and we have some cultural events that are happening best we know like it's still super super early um and you know many people are complaining about how the space is generally inaccessible for most people and activities and economic kind of engine haven't really been started like before we really can onboard majority of the and more people into into the space and benefiting from this ecosystem um trying to go a little bit more philosophical and look at the dimensionality of org here um where um you know what what is actually work and what is work consists of and I will say that there's like a few Dimensions um that um that we want to kind of use as a framework to to look at where we are um you know in the digital labor space and where we are for specifically ethereum um so for work we have you know tasks we have mobilization which is a group of people completing tasks and doing things towards the same goal um and as you build this meaningful relationships with people that you work with you're developing this sense of belonging and the sense of identity um and you know as you slowly you know discover these places of belonging you also you know actualize and really find out kind of what you are called for and these are the concepts that should be familiar with anybody who has studied either Urban Design or just design in general um to understand you know these are the different um some some like you use the framework like Marcelo hierarchy of needs and others just like to kind of stay a little bit more abstract but if we actually look at the intersections of a lot of these themes we start to see different shapes of work um that is happening both within crypto and outside of it um so you know we see git economy Bounty boards as sitting in the intersection of you know mobilizing tasks and gig workers and we see in the intersection between mobilization and belonging um you know ask corporations and Global Corporation startups distributed work and also of course we're very familiar with dials um and in the intersection of belonging and actualization you know we traditionally have this perception of nation states and churches but right now we see the rise of Maxis and Rockne culture and um you know kind of believing belief systems and almost like close to kind of a religious type of state that is being formed by the formation of also token Networks and kind of on a spectrum we see kind of on the left side being you know labor that is much more mercenary like all the way to labor that is much more missionary that are driven to a shared by a share purpose um a mission and also like the value that's being created um and those values are much less monetary um but more so around you know your sense of identity and self and what it kind of means to be um a part of the network and I think in terms of ethereum like this is a more realistic look at what we where we are right now um we have you know Traders bounty hunters airdrop Farmers one token and actually players kind of representing labor that's more on the opposite like on the left side of Spectrum which are tasks um you know more fungible tasks um and and labor and we have on the right side we have you know meaningful labor that's being produced which is storytelling and actually creating moves and around you know being a Bitcoin Maxi or ethereum Maxi and LARPing which is you know an ultimate form of belief which is you know role-playing as in a nine developer or um really kind of finding this new self on the internet and then we have everything in between which is kind of the real infrastructure to make this a viable path um to connect between the tasks and skills that can be practiced in ethereum network and also the meaning behind and the vision of decentralization and permissionless um and right now the reason why like I grade out the two circles in between is like these are still being built and being constructed and they're still super early in their formation nation and what are they they're the hackers they're the product designers they're the community stewards funders Educators mean perpetuators um they're the people that are actually right like kind of starting to realize the lack of infrastructure in the space um and how it's very very difficult to actually sustain their living or actually have a full-time job just you know strictly in this token Network and taking a step back to look at you know how the global digital labor infrastructure um kind of functions this is like super bra Strokes definitely a little bit reductionist um but really right like there's a few layers here um on the foundational layer and a base layer we have we need local laws and compliances to ensure that you know like if I'm a worker I'm compliant of the labor local labor law and also I'm getting paid in my own currency um so that I can consume you know local goods and then kind of in the middle there's this network that allow me to find work in the first place and those are the toolings in marketplaces um for example upwork and um recently brain trusts that emerge as this you know flattening of the global labor market where you know if we allies like cities at labor market we are now seeing that you know we don't really have to live in New York anymore to have access to a higher paid job and that is the whole idea of you know Strife increasing the GDP of the internet as a payment Rail and I think a lot of the messages are also true here where you know with these marketplaces um now you know if you are someone like anywhere in the world you're able to find opportunities that otherwise you have not found in in your local market um and in you know in order to actually coordinate um you know people from different time zones we're now seeing you know productivity tools like GitHub notion telegram emails and you know very standard boilerplate tools now both in crypto and outside of it being that coordination rail but we look at a decentralized digital labor infrastructure versus a centralized Global digital labor infrastructure what is different and what are the possibilities here which I think is the most fun to think about like if the now the topic is the future of work on ethereum um is that right now in absence of you know local laws and compliances in the absence of nation state as this enforcer and um this forcing function of any type of viability and like legitimacy and enforceability of agreements made between individuals like in absence of that can small contracts can a lot of these crypto native Primitives actually play the role of you know providing the accountability and trustlessly trustlessness between individuals nodes individual nodes and and contributors in the network um and kind of looking being a little bit more practical here I think there's generally two approach um when it comes to constructing this base layer um the the crypto rails the payment rails um which is I think the most well understood which is you know embedded value distribution when you create some type of work so that's you know on a very practical level that is like when you perform a task when you you know finish you know a piece of work or a bounty you immediately get paid in crypto um or you know when you farm um I don't know Farm in the in a polygon based game you you get paid in in that token immediately that can be consumed later or be staked in another protocol like these are very familiar primitive for anybody who who is here um but then I think the more interesting part is really about like how can we actually start to radically think about the compatibility of smart contract and IRL law um and the um the other thing that's very interesting um but very very hard is about enforceability like in absence of legal infrastructure like can we actually enforce some type of outcome and consequences when you know agreements have been violated and this is like I think the least talked about um there are some few there are a few groups like lifestyle and worked out that have emerged um that are kind of solving that problem um but really I think we're still super early in that development of like finding the right um kind of legal Frameworks um that both work on change to create that record and trustless feature um of Love also being able to be backward compatibility so that it can still remain compliant um for local laws if that's the desire outcome which I believe it is for many crypto organizations um irregardless of their status around like um anonymization um and um sudanimity and then the more interesting and exciting part really lies in this idea of identity so you know when you are a labor and you're a contributor on ethereum and you know within this Webster ecosystem you have a wallet um you know what does that even mean as you know now you're you have a identity that's completely different um from the one that has been defined by traditional nation state and and laws um that have been constructed in the past uh we don't have no longer have a password we don't have an ID um so your ID really is kind of the activities that have been associated with the wallet um so there's some ideas here that um I think this stack was made like in the past 48 hours and really it was like a quick just very very early thinking around like the ideas around you know the possibilities I can enable my wallet-centric future um so we have protocol driven marketplaces here meaning that you know with the presence of something like uniswab or pseudo swab um the idea of having you know a set interface in a centralized platform is less attractive like in reality if you were to think about a more liquid labor Marketplace it could potentially be more decentralized and really be driven and incentives really be driven by the protocol uh with kind of players incentivized players helping verify the quality of Labor um and the referrers helping you know curate the network of talent as well um where you know it's less so about the platform but more about the individuals that are actually curating a telemarketplace which is a very exciting future um and then we have the idea of when you participate actively in the protocol and you know when you actively participate in a dow how that on-chain action actually broadcast to the entire network and that becomes your reputation that we've you know traditionally been outsourced to a lot of web tool platforms like LinkedIn or upwork um and then the other interesting things are like blurring lines between cells and groups so as an individual um and as an individual who possesses wallet like you can actually sometimes also represent a Dao um and um the idea of being wall eccentric you know kind of creates a possibility of one person creating six and seven wallets and representing different solves in different groups group identity if you also have a multi-signature wallet um and of course like it's this kind of absolute upset like kind of ownership over your work history and provenance um which is a lot of times not true right now um but the possibility of it is immense when like what does it mean philosophically when you actually have true ownership of you know a lot of the things that you've done on chain and the last piece which is very interesting is like when you know in the traditional Corporation you get onboarded you become you know a worker an employee of this company and that means that you have the permissions and access to its set of tools benefits and all the implications of someone becoming an employee but what does that mean when someone becomes a member of many dolls and many communities and how does that status translate between tools and tools as we you know are moving into this more multi-client future and with protocol kind of at the center and then of course with the coordination rails also will look different when the lines between organizations start to blur like we see you know pots as a very popular conceptually popularized by orca protocol now called um Metropolis where we see this idea of like your self-identity being represented by a pod that's registered on chain and that kind of gives you access to a bunch of different again like other tools or information otherwise um you do not have access to so looking at this whole stock we see actually a lot of fragmentation across these um across the whole stack so you know right now we kind of see this fermentation of identity and reputation and knowledge because um a lot of the work is still being performed in web 2 platforms um so that you know after you write amazing posts on this course like that post would not be associated with your identity when you move to another platform um and you know the lack of data interoperability is a part of that issue we see a lack of accountability meaning that like if a bunch of pseudonymous people are working together there's really no way to enforce that something is going to happen and the consequences you know are also it's very hard to enforce and even if we have accountability mechanism right like when there's dispute um Aragon actually did a lot of innovation here where they have a dispute Court called clairols I think um actually claro is another project but um they basically create decentralized history resolution um kind of channels but right now those channels are not properly incentivized either so that that's there's still like I think a lot to be done there and we're still super early in this future but without these very core infrastructure I think we're still pretty far um from like kind of entering to this future but with that said um some teams and some people are already living in the future um and then we have some examples here so on the base layer these are examples of escrow contract and backward compatibility compatible compatible contract um that are created by lifestyle um they're super dope like strongly recommend taking a look we have identity layer um that you know is being designed by teams like Guild and um and some other teams being mentioned here um really the idea is that you know once you are part of a doubt like then you know that identity of yours can be carried to any other applications that you interact with um on the blockchain on ethereum and then we have a coordination layer which really is about embedding incentives when you perform a piece of work and get coin it's a great example um there's already a talk on gig one um that was amazing that talked about how um you know the git coins vision is really building this open grants protocol um where you know there's the kind of number of reviewers of you know brands are kind of scaled linearly with the people that are applying for grants that are designing grants um so there's some very exciting feature there I know we have tools that are very tactical like Wonder verse which you know is building a bounty board where after you perform a task you automatically get paid as well um by the work you do with like very granular um with the very vulnerabilities you get like attributed build credit and also rewards and putting a lot of things together and kind of share a little bit towards the end of what we've been building a station really kind of how we've been thinking about this um is protocol at the center and really think about you know what are the universal data structures that can be leveraged both by us but also by others um you know to build different type of creative clients um to establish these trust trustful relationship on chain um and you know on the client side we have a very friendly app that allows anybody to propose to another person to work together um on in web3 so if I know your ens address I can send it to you and be like hey like do you want to work on this together and Define the terms of how the payment will be issued like Milestones splits vice versa and then sign it to prove that you know there's this public verifiable record on ipfs that you know people can refer to if you know we're a agreement were to be breached and then when those activities start to emerge when people work together you know in the use cases of let's say greater economy like someone wants to engage you know a community of fans or in the case of a Dao where they're looking to sponsor you know 100 developers to go on top of their protocol and also involving the community in the decision-making process we're seeing this emergent network of projects protocols contributors voters that are all participants of this network that actually built a more decentralized reputation system that ideally in the future can replace um you know kyc which crypto has a very ambiguous relationship with so that's the end um thank you so much for having me I had a blast just talking through the very philosophical ones of the future of work on ethereum um we can jump into any questions or ideas yeah sure awesome thank you thank you so much Tina I appreciate uh you jumping through everything with us and yeah that was awesome I think you know touched on so many of the different uh I think opportunities for like where like this could be headed and I think it's still very early and I think at the end they're kind of tied it up with like what is some of the current work that's being done in the space and and even that work frankly is very early like I think there's like opportunity for like new things to happen in this space um and yeah if anybody has any questions feel free to drop them in the chat and um in the meantime I'll jump into some of the ones that I had going through this um I guess like you know from my perspective when um but with Dows in particular one of the main things that I've seen as requests from Dows is basically you know for lack of a better way of putting it like Talent you know people that are smart uh that are capable joining those Dows and being able to execute things on behalf of the Dow I know you talked a little bit about like how we're kind of adding more structure into Taos which will also kind of help run those more efficiently and I think also Scott mentioned that as well as part of his presentation earlier today um on the public good side I guess like um the early it seems like to me the early experimentation there is more on that if you had that kind of four Venn diagram image that you had more on the kind of tasks and like very early piece um what would you recommend right now to Dows that are kind of like what should they basically change structurally so that they can move like up a rank on that list of of Venn diagrams that's a great question um I also touch very very briefly about um on this um in the talk where we start to see pots being a very popular structure among Dallas as like a subgroup sub-working group there's different names to it but really it's just a group of people working together within the Dow and kind of give them the autonomy to make decisions kind of more in a more centralized way without compromising on the decentralized nature of the entire organization so it's almost like there's some level of centralization on a local level but keep the global level of the organization more decentralized to ensure that you know there's diversity of thoughts and opinions and no power is actually being over concentrated it on the top but in terms of day-to-day operations we all know that like if it's truly decentralized nothing gets done and not all decisions needs consensus um so it's it's much more frequent now we see very very centralized almost like many startups that operate within the Dow um that kind of resemble this pot like um or working group like structure awesome yeah I definitely noticed that that's been sort of a a pretty like consistent theme um even just through like the work that I was doing um as being like an optimism delegate like moving from just like everybody reviews all proposals to now they have working groups as of this iteration recently um I know bitcoin's done a lot of work in here you know it's done a lot of work here too um and and yeah it's been it's been really exciting to see um I have like a bit of a prop but I'm not going to like force you to speak on it because uh but I just saw this really interesting tweet this morning um not during the presentation I swear I was paying attention um a tweet from Tres uh who uh helps ramalama um that like hundreds of people today some synonymous are earning a full-time income working for open source protocols um getting paid in open source money often getting over ownership over governance decisions in these protocols this is actually wild and underrated I think this is also very wild and underrated I agree with him um here I'm not going to ask if you agree or not I know I'm putting you on the spot there but um I I mean I think like that's you know part of the opportunity is that outcome right for everybody whether able to kind of participate in such a way and get access to permissionless money permissionless work and just be able to like be you know part of this ecosystem um you could speak to that if you want to speak to it but if not then then kind of my main question was to sort of like he said hundreds of people you know for that to be thousands of people or tens of thousands of people they need access to kind of resources and and things to kind of understand the space a lot better what are some of the kind of resources that come to mind and places to start for for people who are interested in having that outcome totally um I think back to the city analogy I feel like we first need companies to be built into cities like create the economic create jobs um to actually have kind of people migrating to the city so I think we're still so early in that process of like just not enough protocols that are profitable exist um to generate enough value for for them to employ like kind of new talent but outside of that I think a lot of the things that we mentioned in the presentations don't hold true where some of the base layer like the financial legal infrastructure um you know the financial is the easiest part in crypto um but the legal also is one of the hardest it's like how can we be bad or compatible um at the same time leveraging the power of smart contracts to automate a lot of these like traditional very like kind of costly processes that are really hindering you know a lot of these developing markets to tap into you know what America's legal system despite having a lot of flaws still enable which is a very very powerful system for for capitalism to shine um to kind of enable that economic those economic opportunities for um for more countries as well amazing very cool well thank you so much for for answering my questions there um I I didn't see any new questions come in on the chat but I did see a lot of great presentations this is interesting you know excited about this so thank you so much for for being a part of this Tina and uh for for joining us for for this chat and um yeah if anybody else wants to uh to you know chat with you uh in a different place uh feel free to drop your Twitter handle um or if you give you like the shout outs so that people know where to find you go where do we find you um you can find me on Twitter I'm fkpxls fake pixels but without the vowels so awesome okay cool thank you so much Tina really appreciate you thank you bye
