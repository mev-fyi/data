and we are live what's up everyone i'm shanghan from eath global coming at you live with stakedown uh i'm joined here you know by julian um jillian how you doing hey yeah thanks uh thanks for having me and thanks for yeah thanks for letting us take down i guess that i'm doing very great awesome you can feel free to go along with your presentation and this amazing workshop cool yeah um so let's get let's get started um so um um just let me share my screen i don't have a presentation i will just go um directly into showing you the platform and what you can do on the platform uh so first if you want to ask me questions directly this is me this uh little doggie uh some julian butler uh you can message me directly i i've been in the space for quite some times um i specialize in so my background is mathematics um and i've been contributing and helping a few different projects uh projects in a space so i start as a trader originally and then moving to d5 where i do liquidity provider market makers arbitrage indeed the first flash loan in the in the industry and so state capital was operating decentralized um like staking as a service and it was very difficult for people to join this um the world of staking and also um what happened with defy over the year where people can deposit and invest or deposit some crypto in some different strategies so we built um a stake down stake down is kind of um it's a decentralized exchange so think about finance cracker and all the different projects uh companies where they are centralized authority above uh your assets um and also whatever profits they make they uh distribute the profits to themselves well stakeout staked out is a fully decentralized exchange um and we build uh different products on the top of it i will uh go through them uh very quick so you go to um stackdown.org you can either open the app or just go through the nice landing page that we have so when you open the app you can either connect with your wallet so metamask or you can also connect to a normal email ledger wallet connect and also if you want you can do like a little uh stalker so you can watch some addresses and goes to the different uh wallets but inside this dashboard we have the overview of your entire wallet so you have a dashboard where you can see all the different crypto and what we do we also like to all of the assets that you have the different tokens we'll tell you if you can either buy them sell them and also like use them so for example this platform is like that was telling me that i have three curve tokens then i should actually stack them uh so i can actually stack them and then it tells me which percentage i will be able to uh the api if i stack those assets um and like you have like some very nice features inside um but i will come back to this in a you know in the strategy panel um and then you can see all the different uh history about your uh your wallet and this is like made very nicely uh you can also ping the api this is something that we're planning to open on the github which i will be opening a few different people for you guys to build on top of it and we also provide the best the best swapping mechanism in the in the industry this is also built on top of password and basically this this order routine will calculate the best route for your assets for example if i want to buy some stackdown token it will tell me that the best right now is using unison v3 initial v2 100 and get the quote you also get a history about the performance of this asset for the time and then uh we provide uh strategies uh so those strategies um um what we do we uh describe all of them very nicely but we also this is like build on top of curve and for example if you want to stack some east token they will tell you that for example this one is providing you like eight percent uh apy all the time uh so you can stay then we made like some like we tried instead of what we also tried is to make it like very simple so what the plan is to really be a designer tries to change so having the same user experience that you can get in the centralized exchange such as binance which is really nice uh so we believe that you should have access to the same way same mechanism and same experience on complete decentralized uh platform um so for example if you wanna invest in the euro strategy right now you get three four percent in in a direct strategy and then you can directly go to um for example like the staking those assets inside the lp farming strategy and right now the euro strategy is giving you 40 43 uh you can actually see uh exactly what it does uh so we also like incentivize using our native uh assets but that's what we get um and we're building some new uh new strategies uh that should be uh going live i actually will go live this week so some of the strategies um i mean like some some other strategies that uh some other assets but also like some um advanced strategies such as liquidation strategies um arbitrage and this is like strategies that we're building so i think like coming from uh overview history to trade and strategy and healthy farming i think there's like some really nice way of you can actually think about building some new tools on top of it like for example analytics uh you can also think about building some new strategy uh we are giving a little different uh price for that ranging from 5000 us dollars down to 2 000 i think i can probably probably have access to um the price is i will try to get them and and then we also have uh staking um staking is um we also have like east 2.0 coming inside the strategy uh this is for staking natively is uh italian tokens but it's taking a sticking page what you can do you can basically stay directly natively inside the protocol and this is very important because all those different blockchains we do provide they provide the inflation rate of the protocol so when you stake directly inside this protocol then you are given the inflation proportionally to the amount of stake that you deposit inside so for example if you want to stake inside tesos then you can go to it will bring you to the the tesla's page where you can connect your wallet and then start depositing some assets you can do the same with polygon for example so for example you go to it will bring you to the page where you can stack directly inside so maybe the idea here for people that also want to that are good in react.js for example because the entire website is building via js they can potentially work on some implementation generic implementation of being able to deposit inside natively inside the website this would be like a nice project to work on so we already mentioned analytics building some new strategies uh building some native staking features um and and also like this one the governance tab is um it's something that we build we're the first one to introduce this concept it's um nfts that will bring you some [Music] advanced uh i would say like vip access so for example if you have some of those nfts that you purchased before just either by i mean buying them on a secondary market or getting them from the the points by staking them for example we have a few different types of entities holding them and sticking sticking them into a contract will basically give you more give you access to some advanced strategies that we are building but also give you some rewards more we wants across the entire dial so for example if you're staking a time pass where you only have 10 maximum of them in the entire dial or like a unique this unique so this one is unique rare and common and you have two types two types of cards well this one will give you to some very uh nice uh features across the dial and this will be like staking inside a common uh nft contract and then from referrals to having access to more up sorry sorry oops i will turn this off okay cool um so this is like another way that you can either build some for example analytics on top of it you can also like build some um advanced uh things for for for nft uh for nft on top of stakedown um we also have like the um we can directly buy crypto um so from logging without the need of a web3 wallet because you actually don't need metamask to to log into the platform if you want to to buying assets selling assets taking different strategies and sticking inside protocols this is all done for you and we try to make it like super simple um okay cool so i just closed the door the window there was some kids outside um and then um what we have it's also like we um i've deployed something called tutorials so you can click at the bottom of the web uh the page and let me let me just go through them so if you go at the bottom uh okay oops you can see um the the governance so you could also like build something on top of the gold one and so if you want everything that we are pushing for in the dial we go through the the governance so we have like um uh a snapshot where you can find the you can downloads like some some some ideas for the dao so boom and this is like proposal that you can make for example we have built one of the most important features of the down this was early into the game was the perpetual strategy and the perpetual strategy is um a strategy where you deposit some curve token and uh this strategy is uh the dow the entire dial is is was listed inside a curve curve defiance and that was the original idea behind stakedown is to be one of the leader in the curve and ecosystem and this allows us to boost the entire strategies that we have here and that's why it's really important to um to have access to this privilege or strategy um i think i can take some questions if you guys have questions uh maybe i can also like uh yeah we also have uh the geekbook uh where you can go and you can actually learn about the different services that we're running if you have questions about the different strategies you can also like um um the the risk involved in the this is also something that we have and we just released today um the academy for stakedown so um um knowing about different aspects of defy and we provide this information on state dial so you guys can actually be up to speed with the how to build on top of stackdown i think i can go for for creation maybe i couldn't see okay now i see your question guys um yeah so yeah we build our own strategies uh we also are very focused and i mean lately on euro strategies um like in europe and also like strategies that are not necessarily attached to u.s dollars because we believe that there's a there's a there's a niche and not many people are doing them so that's what we really focus also like on some new stable coins related to euro so you guys don't necessarily have to be exposed to the inflation or the uh risk of holding us um now uh strategy apy um the question is native apy amplified by inflation of the token that's true but not entirely uh just justice basically the the dow you can actually see there and on the main page you see the inflation of of the token you see that currently we are distributing thirty four thousand u.s dollars to people that are providing value to the entire dow and what we say thirty four thousand years ago for now they only plug inside the the stake dial strategies but it will move into across i mean into it will move across all the different tools that we all the different features that we are implementing the dial so not only um strategies but for example the one that we just mentioned is taking so people's taking kyber live p polygon solana cosmos and cypher teslas will be able to also earn rewards from the dow and all and the percentage of all the fees that we making all the from validation from validating those different network will actually presenters will be redistributing with distributed to the people that are staking natively uh inside uh the sanctuaries the sanctuary is people that stake sdt inside and then they receive the entire uh um uh the entire process like like rewards from the entire dial so for example from a strategy when we take 15 percent 15 performance fee then those 15 performance fee go back inside the sanctuary and that's very important and then from the sanctuary you can take those assets without losing those hundred percent and you can stack them inside the marketplace what we call the palace and the palace will for now the palace is entitling you to receive some nfts but not only we are building some uh new tools on the top of it as mentioned before the one where you can stack those nft inside the platform and then receive advanced you can either like have advanced boost oh wait i'm actually not showing uh my screen anymore no do i oh yeah sorry sorry about that yeah so as mentioned i was mentioning that um here the dao is distributing 35 000 u.s dollars inside the the strategies for now but we are planning to plug those ones first across different chains so this is like something i didn't mention but it's very important the strategies that you're seeing here they're also on different chains so we have ethereum we have binance and we have polygon and the way that you can access them is just by changing here you want to be on binance or you want to be on polygon and you can change them you could actually build something that will facilitate this kind of like swapping different wallets and also moving from different uh different uh strategies this is also like nice if you have if you want to hack around the concept of uh moving from different chains stacking from different protocols it's different strategy that could also be very cool for now we only one strategy and polygon and a few and three on on on binance because we are deploying the asset i mean the asset from curve are just being deployed so then we'll be able to build them to integrate them inside stay down i was mentioning is when you stick inside the sanctuary you receive the entire proceeds so the entire rewards the entire things that we're making across the entire dial are distributed inside this sanctuary i mean a major party of the major percentage um so when you stack them you stack sdt inside and then you get x sdt and you receive and then on the weekly basis on like once in a while we distribute the proceeds from running the entire dial and then you can also take your x as dt so the token that you after staking in sanctuary you are given this x as dt you can then stack them inside the palace and the past is the place where you can earn points to them reading nfds and then later on those nfts very soon i think this is going this week you'll be able to stack them inside a global sticking contract to have advanced features access to advanced features across the entire project for example you could have your boost increased you can you'll be able to participate in some unique strategies for example liquidations only if you have the nft uh or some of them because those strategies will be capped and you're going to understand why liquidation doesn't they don't help you much i mean right now liquidation there was a lot of liquidation but the idea is like we cap the strategy to a maximum amount what people can deposit and then depending on the amount of liquidation that we can capture uh when there is like a dump or something then we distribute back inside this strategy and the idea is to have the strategy to have a huge ap y that's the reason why we have to cut them um let me check the questions uh okay so any plans to design strategies based on specific taxations or tax ruling uh i'm not sure i think this is like kind of like attached to where you are uh based and how you're using uh the platform but i don't know much about this to be honest um we could actually build a reporting mechanism this will wouldn't be very uh difficult to implement a taxi mechanism like like a report mechanism this is also something i know like we got some projects in the ecosystem that are doing this uh yeah zero based strategies that could also be uh this i mean the plan is like this dao is fully decentralized also like planning to move it to if possible right now it's not because it's serverless but try we could potentially move it to ipfs or like a little simple access to the entire doubt could actually be accessible there um yeah how do i use uh stackdown in my app as a developer developer well i highly encourage you to go to the gitbook where we'll be posting the new link for github access so you'll be able to build on top of it uh yes let me okay um okay the question is what is stake down versus zapper d bank or zero we not like those guys i mean we love them i love them uh it's very different uh zapper d bank or zero they give you access to the entire d5 meaning that as someone that doesn't understand defy then you have to it's basically give you a i mean they give you tools to you to play with defy but you have to understand it well stay down is it's a it's a project where we believe and we do provide you with the best strategies that we think are the best for you to uh to to generate passive income from your uh your capital and that we do this from staking on strategy but also from us taking inside different protocols we are building some advanced uh strategies that have been taking a little bit more time uh like liquidation one um and also like when you buy assets when you sell assets the proceeds i mean the the fees that we're taking also distributed back to the people inside the dial so it's a fully decentralized project and not a decentralized company like xerion or zapier d bank and not a dollar the uh limited company and you cannot access the equity of the project where in this one whatever you do inside the project what whatever action you do and also whatever fees the dao is charging or any implementation any features that are being built inside the the profits are being distributed back to the people so this is really different and we don't give access to the entire define we have a nice dashboard where you can see all the different assets and you can see uh you can go to your entire wallet but then the rest is a fully centralized like staking liquid staking we're implementing liquid staking from swapping um buying selling all different things goes back to the people that are using the dial all right well that that all sounds really great um we're kind of we happen just to be running a little bit out of time right now um so if you have any other further questions um please feel free to post them into the eves global sponsor channel under the uh sponsored stakedown channel otherwise thank you so much julian for kind of answering all of our questions thank you for having me yeah exactly i mean if you have questions don't hesitate to ping those guys in to pick us on discord in the in in a hackathon discord group or on twitter or on telegram but yeah happy to happy to answer any questions awesome thanks everyone oh wait i actually i think uh maybe if we have like 10 more seconds i think do people have access to the um uh the prices because i have the price is like uh we do give like uh the first price that we gave is four thousand oh yeah did you yeah so uh the prizes information will be posted in the channel uh shortly but you can feel free to tell everyone about it right now as well just ten seconds uh thanks again so we have like four thousand and five hundred us dollars for any new strategies from away from for example like swapping on between different strategies will it it should actually actually like swapping between curve different pools so this is like building a strategy that can do a py hunter like we have like some so we've been working on some different things but it would be great if people like want to work on them as well with us um we also have like uh so the first one is uh yeah the 4500 years ago for composability uh building new strategy maybe on polygon or binance and then we have 2500 for um tooling so like any flex flexible strategy framework that you guys think will actually increase composability or increase the generate generic way of implementing strategies or deploying strategies and stuff like that libraries like for example a new typescript library or if have like some library in solidity that could just speed up the process of deploying some new strategies like pool zaps as well like from entering the pool and exiting the pool in one one token on multiple different tokens and then we have two thousand us donors for wheel cars so just like come up with some new ideas that we haven't thought of and we'll be happy to uh to reward them and then we have a thousand us dollars for partnership that we think will provide a lot of value in a defined space which is with super fluids so we distribute like real time money like real time free or fluid of money to people and then we have two thousand us dollars for a pool price where we'll be giving and splitting the amount of those those 2000 users to people that just been working on the dial i mean we believe and believe that this is actually good value awesome thank you so much for that rundown um and yeah i think that's a lot of great uh rewards for everyone to get really excited about um yeah thanks again really appreciate it thank you guys thank you bye-bye yeah thanks everyone
