just take a couple seconds for the stream to go live onto youtube and then we'll start the workshop awesome so we're good to begin um thank you everyone for joining uh we have our special guest dane and ian from zora on the workshop make your own zora auction house in 15 minutes um super excited to have them here and super excited for you guys to all learn more about zora and with that i'm gonna pass mike off to dane and feel free to start oh sorry i'm having some um technical difficulties um just a second hello hello hey there we go very good yep okay cool hey everybody um yeah so hi i'm dane um i'm a product engineer with sora and today um i'm going to be showing off our create market create auction house template um so what is zora is the nft marketplace protocol um it's open permissionless free to use at the protocol layer we could probably think of it as a public good we want to enable creators of all kinds um to easily create their own markets and you know their own platforms we came up with this next.js template to help um individuals stand up a permissionless auction house and we've you know we've done numerous different ones with different nft contracts and it's been a lot of fun it's been a lot of fun to see people in the community build their own but we i wanted to run through this repo and yeah just show you how to set something up um we're leveraging a couple of libraries that we've authored to help display and interact with nfts so we have nft components and nft hooks which ian is going to talk about after i run through this demo um yeah so without further ado i'm going to get started let me clear out my screen and find my windows so i'm going to go here to our create auction house repo and we have this set up to simply fork as a template so i'll click this button and i'm going to call this oobk house i created a custom contract with some artwork that my kid made and made a bunch of nfts so i'm going to stand auction house up for maybe help pay for his college tuition although this isn't on linkedin so so here we go um and i'll just call this a permission list auction house and i'll make it public so we can refer to it afterwards so we're generating creating the repo and there we go so i'm gonna get going with this um i'm gonna clone it oops and i will run yarn to install my dependencies meanwhile i'm gonna come over here get my token contract and i'll open this up in my code editor yes i trust myself um so here we go now we've included a helpful script um that will just help you sort of bootstrap and get all the envelope variables set up for what you need to display and work with this template um so i go type in yarn setup and i have like a little prompt script so i'll just call this obk house um i'll leave the default description um i'm going to leave the mainnet contract we're not going to work in mainnet um we're just going to work in wrinkby and i'm going to leave that as a zorro contract and i'm going to paste in my um whoops oops sorry about that hold on but and i'm going to work with rentme as my default network for now so there we go um now i'm going to spin it up and i will go over here to localhost 3000 and voila there you have it so this in its simplest form is a uh is a auction house that we can then deploy to versailles it's our deployment platform of choice um it's the most friction list and and we can go ahead and um yeah get auctions going so i can see that there's already an auction running on this token and um yeah so if i want to list another what i can do is sign in with my wallet and it will show me all of the nfts that i own and we've included some additional components to help you manage auctions so click list here set a reserve price confirm the transaction um transactions pending as we all know things take a little bit longer um the blockchain so these changes will be reflected um within about a minute and then if i go back to my landing page i can check back and see that the auction will be running so this is all fine and dandy it's pretty cool that you can just get this up and running like super quick um but what if we want to do more with it and i really think that this is like the foundation for a lot of different possible projects so um and that was our goal with this template is that we could get people up and running operating on our pro protocol and then see what they do with it so it's kind of like the sky is the limit right um there we go we've got another auction running so um the next thing i'll do is talk about how we can customize a little bit so yeah so i'm going to go ahead and take advantage of a feature of nft components which is sort of allowing you to use all of the individual elements that you see here and compose them in different ways and also i'll be adding a custom internal bid flow into this so i'm going to jump back over to my code base and we can see that we've got our pages here and in the individual token page um right now we're using this nft full page component we're passing arguments we're using our we're using our own indexer we're passing a contract and then we're passing a token id into the component um so what i'm going to do here is do a little quick copy and paste and show you how to get a little more flexible with this so i've got a i've got a repo that i've been working in and so i'm just going to quickly copy and paste this stuff over so um just give me a second here so first thing i'm going to do is look at nft components and i am going to add um full components which will expose the individual um sort of layout elements i'm gonna then go ahead and paste in this chunk uh code um and i need to include the auction manager from our manage auction hooks which allows which will allow us to do an internal bid flow just need to update a couple of items here and bear with me for a second have a couple more components that i need to drop in and fingers crossed this will this will work um i have a little bit button that i built out and i am just going to set it up like this and what's the issue here sorry bear with me for a second i think you missed the yeah perfect yep my bad uh okay so whoops yeah we're missing a couple other things okay coding in real time um it looks like that's coming from the manage auction button yeah um sorry bear with me for a second um and anyone has questions in the meantime more than happy to answer them just working on uh rewriting dependency trees sorry yep um this is what they don't show you in the movies yeah this is this is some little copy pasta uh yeah um also um you know maybe what we could do is take a break and i can get this um get this all polished up and i don't know again i could pass it over to you if you want to talk a little bit more about these nft components and nft hooks um that sounds like a good idea yeah and then we promise you could customize the auction house in 15 minutes we promised that you could get it up and running so i think we're staying true to that um okay let me answer a question from ya what's the biggest benefit of building on zora well one of the things is we allow you to do whatever you want in terms of user interface and you own the entire website um so you're not tied to using zora specifically um and we also have like an earlier version our current version of the protocol allows for no fee transactions on auctions and we provide kind of all the tools to get you up and running so instead of saying oh you need to link to our website or use our flows you can continue using this auction house as long as you want we're not going to ever take it down we don't have the ability to take it down and these templates allow you to have full ownership of that um a hack on the protocol that's a great question so a lot of things you can do around the auction process um some things are clever forks some people have written splits or other features that they find interesting within the auction so an example of using the protocol is the nouns protocol actually modified the zora auction house to do a daily auction every single day and um that's a hack where it's taking the code of modifying a little bit or you can write contracts around it so somebody took some contracts for in from zora called nft editions and they added splits and they also made it work with the auction house where the editions created an auction right away and those have been living on the zora platform so instead of necessarily just like rewriting the zora code you can write custom code around it that kind of integrates it to your project or your idea another thing you can simply do is work with the zora znft media and kind of add extensions onto those as well which are our original version of the protocol all right i can head back off to dane sorry about that little um hiccup um okay so we've got our bid button in here fingers crossed it works and yeah we said we could help you stand it up but i just really was itching to show some customization um so here we go i'm gonna i need to disconnect my wallet and i'm gonna sign in with a different wallet to um ring be well placed yeah rink b lifestyle um i think it's pretty fun so i'm going to go ahead and connect my wallet and i'll connect to this other account and i don't own any of these nfts that's a great question um tippy so we'll go through how to use these with just react without next js but the template using next.js allows for server rendering and a bunch of easy like built-in features that uh will go through with the configuration and deployment side of things yeah so i'm going to go ahead and place a bid and i'll just spit it up pretty high and i just wanted to sort of also speak to the fact that you know seeing that this isn't we are operating in rink b um it's a it's a great environment to really test out ideas and um and i think that like that will help you know anybody sort of build some really interesting things without the pressure of operating on mainnet okay the template's a little rougher on the edges because we expect people to kind of use it as a starting plate to customize and restyle everything yeah and we've we've included some some sort of patterns and ideas to help you get started um stylizing and theming the template um but again didn't want to we didn't want to be too overly opinionated on how things look because the idea is that we really want um individuals to tell their story and represent what they're working on in a way that is closest to their brand identity um whatever so there you go um place to bid the auction i'm now the top bidder and um it's like it's as simple as that so we've gone from simply just putting cloning the repo um template starting up a like pulling it locally and then and and getting it started on your local environment now um i'm going to take a minute to deploy it on first cell so while i'm doing that i don't know ian if you want to answer questions or if you have any other things that you want to speak to i could stop sharing my screen um yeah i would love to go through a little bit of the back end of how this works and why someone might want to do this so let me just share my browser really quick um so one of the things that is a benefit of building on top of the zora protocol is that you get your auctions cross-listed on zora dot co um we're working on it very soon so you get your auctions listed on zora.com so here we have this listing that's on the main zora site but you also just saw the auction house that dane listed this on so you have a completely separate experience from zora the user doesn't even need to know what's happening on zora but your auctions also get listed on zora as a part of using our auction house we pull in all that data and show the auction experience to the you to any users on our site and how this works under the hood is it actually uses two different components so if you look in the package json the main components it includes are zora labs nft component xor labs nft hooks zoro labs manage auction hooks so it's really a wrapper around all these other packages that handle the internals of building the auction house and when dan was talking about changing the full page view so if we were to go to components options list you can see that the nft preview component is imported straight from zoro labs nft components and it's just listed as nft preview here that takes in the id of the token and the token contract address and has all these other configuration options nft components is where all these are configured and if you don't want to use next or you don't want to use this template or if you're just doing a blog and you want to embed nfts and allow people to bid or even just let people see nfts [Music] if you you can use the uh components directly and here's the full documentation on those components so you see all the stuff load and you can see the components being used in custom context so um here's an auction house list that lists all auctions created or owned by a user and then here is an audio nft that's loading from zora and we can take a look to view this on zora and then we can view this in our own site so if you want to adjust these options you can take and pick and choose the parts of the different components that was what dane was just doing now if you don't want to use react or you already have your own ui and you want to inject different components into the website you can use nft hooks directly and what nft hooks does is you can use the use nft hook to retrieve all of this information about the current auction as a json object from the nft and it handles all the fetching and data loading for you all you need to pass in is the contract address and token id and then we also have a handy hook that uses the zora indexer that allows you to query for specific that allows you to query for specific collections uh let me make the text a little bit bigger that allows you to query for specific collections you can specify a curator that's shown what a curator is and how that works is documented in the auction house documentation if the auction is approved it goes along with curator and then if you only want to show auctions or you want to show nfts that don't have current auctions for them or i could create an auction house that allows anyone to see everything i own and if there's a active auction it'll just render that auction so i could use that if i wanted to make a personal gallery and since we're in the hooks world we can use this hook to kind of find up find all those lists okay you can find the hook to get those lists and then render them with the components or even render them with the hooks with your own custom ux um i think dane might want to share in a second um are you ready um not yet okay so let me answer some questions because i've seen questions streaming in um so will will it work with an auction house smart contract i deployed myself yes and no uh there's a constant that you would you would need to set up a sub graph to index that auction house smart contract on your own and we have the sub graph open source so you'd have to deploy your own subgraph and then in the templates you would go and change the constant where the auction house is expected so in nft hooks in the source folder there's a constants file and then there's a urls and you would just change out the url for the uh the graph api by network so right now we have polygon mumbai ring b and mainnet setup you could switch that out with your own url and then the other part is the manage auction hook she would need to go and change the contract address that these hooks expect and as long as you keep the abi expected to be the same you can do that and deploy your own auction house but if you're limited on time it's not a great idea if you want to have all this work out of the box i would recommend you use the one that's currently out start testing and then once you get that working deploy whatever changes you want to make and then switch over all the different parts of the code um and it's in here you can configure the auction house address i believe there's a place to configure the auction house address you might have to search the code or just message us in the developer channel are there buy now options not yet but very soon we're gonna integrate some buy now options potentially the question's been answered uh did you show what the ui looks like on the seller side and how they uploaded the nft so the template is only for selling we kind of leave the minting and uploading up to the user and the list flow that dain showed is included so the idea is the user already has minted the nft and you can include that in your you can include the minted nfts in your list flow and you can even add a page to mint next to the list flow so that one's kind of up to you this is just a template for selling it's not for minting yet can i use my own indexer with zora i don't know uh soon so i'm working on a refactor right now of how nft hooks works it's a little bit tied to uh really specific data structures but you can go if you just want to use components with your own indexer there's a underlying tool that allows you to inject custom objects so in nft data provider you can specify a custom initial data and as long as you match the json response type that this expects for the nft you can then just use the components with the data provider and then just link in all the components and it would fetch the data and display it as desired however you do need to match that nft object that it's expecting and the code for that is in the hooks so the easiest way to make it work with a custom indexer would be to add a new fetcher right now supported indexers are open c zora the zora indexer and the zora graph indexer so you would just go through the code kind of figure out how that's written and then write in a new indexer and create a new hook that exposes that indexer all right i think we're getting close to time uh does anyone have any more questions for dane or myself we're gonna publish a link to the finalized auction house on rinky that you can play with and also we'll have a way for you to view the source code it's public yeah so the repo and a url will be post in the notes shortly any other questions pretty amazed uh without the customizations we really did get the auction house done in 15 minutes so from from template on github to uh working auction house example just gonna pull up the auction house repo on github and call it a day the nft does have to be minted already but we actually have a tool called the zdk and the zdk allows for really easy minting um so you could theoretically mint through the zdk and then sell on the auction house but you're gonna have to wire those up together the auction house is just for sales and typically minting flows are just one call like a lot of people that mint a lot of people that mint uh have like a template that fills in a bunch of custom things or has custom settings and it's really only one api call so for instance we have a bunch of auction houses like the punk's house and then we also have an apes house and these kind of work with customized examples of rug store dot exchange so these are all customized auction houses for pre-existing mint contracts so if you're creating an nft that someone can mint and you want to create a marketplace for that all you need to do is pull in the components or pull in the auction house template that creates a third party page yeah so you can mint using a third party like third web um mirror however you want to mint uh and put it on zora however zora doesn't allow for using 1155s and also we are fully on chain protocol and permissionless which means anyone can use our tools in our code however they have to commit all their changes on chain um and that means that lazy minting is just not supported with that philosophy however we're working on getting support for polygon and there's a code that i've been working on which ports the auction house onto polygon so you can get the on chainness but also you can get lower transaction fees for creating a polygon auction house and that'll be more production ready very soon and you can also just use these components to display nfts without any market and you can include custom markets or you can include however you want it's as flexible as you need it to be all of our documentation is uh shown on docs.com and if you have any other issues or questions the easiest place to reach us on the developer side is through the zora discord so i think we're pretty much at time um yeah i don't see any more questions awesome that was super interesting super cool thank you both dane and ian for taking your time to present this workshop to our hackers um and thank you for being a part of nft hack 2022. for the rest of you thank you so much for tuning in to the zora workshop we have a couple more workshops today otherwise get started on your projects and we're so excited to see them on sunday and have a great rest of your day everyone
