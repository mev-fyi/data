good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik i'm the co-founder of global and i want to welcome all of you to dow hacks so you're watching this thing on global.tv this is what we're going to use today for uh the opening ceremonies are our summit as well as the finale on sunday to kind of showcase all the amazing projects and for those of you joining us for the first time i really encourage all of you to log in and say hi to us this is how you can ask any questions to our speakers today you can engage with everybody else that's participating at this event and for everybody that logs in and engages with us we'll also be giving this nft co-app so without further ado let's get started so this event is brought to you by if global and employable is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to on import thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this by running hackathons and summit and dow hacks is no different so for the hackathon which is what we're going to kick off today we have over 475 hackers from 62 different countries participating from 16 varying time zones this is going to be an incredible uh next 48 hours we can't wait to see what everybody builds and we really hope that uh all of you figure out how to make this work with all of your time zones because we're excited to see this uh as a sparkling discord community for 24 7 for the next two days and we also kind of planned out and mapped out where everybody was coming in from so it's amazing to see representation from all five con like well six different continents and uh we can't uh wait to say hi and then meet all of you on our discord too so and in addition we also have 26 amazing ecosystem partners and 47 ecosystem mentors who are going to be here on discord helping you understand kind of how you get unblocked from your act whether it's needing technical help or understanding how something works under the hood or understanding how some ecosystem or dao is or even a protocol is set up i want to quickly point out that we'll also be doing a lot of talks and workshops some of them already had happened yesterday and some of them are today and we'll be giving over fifty thousand dollars in prizes uh the details of which i'll go into uh very soon uh i wanna quickly thank some of our amazing partners here so a lot of them are offering prizes a lot of them are kind of offering their time with giving workshops and talks and interviews so i want to quickly thank falcoin and ipfs for being an amazing partner i also want to thank superfluit the graph rabbit hole unlocked protocol skill wallet lens protocol covalent developer dao tali ling style friends with benefits llama coordinate reverie coleman refugee fund and elian stout oh sorry that's the taoist orca protocol parcel coma review fund factory dao gearbox utopia labs ens and leica so you can talk to all these amazing uh partners on our discord and that will also be here on this live stream uh shortly with some incredible talks but uh let's go into the hackathon so the goal for this is to cover uh some of the logistics on how the next 48 hours are going to work i will talk about everything that needs to happen here as well as uh all the things that you need to be mindful of for your submission so so the most common question you've gotten is what can i actually build at this event so we mapped out all the incredible uh themes and topics that you can think about building gear and by which is not exclusive so you are more than welcome to do anything else that you're interested in but for those of you who are still looking for ideas the goal here is to really help encourage interesting tooling and support and and features that help that can help not only just manage those better but also working with them in a more coordinated as well as efficient way so there's a lot of opportunity here in making tools and services for creating and administering different dials helping with the financial payments part of it what that's making something easy or more transparent or more uh streamlined there's a lot of creativity that can be done in how do we use memberships and nfts uh to enable access at a more wider scale there's a lot of stuff around managing and understanding and participating with governance proposals uh of course all these things are happening on chain so there's so much you can do with data and analytics and understanding what's happening for a given community and the second you can amplify creation administration you also get into discovery and curation so how do we actually understand what's out there how do we make that easy to understand or onboard people all that is a massive theme that can use a lot of interesting tools and ideas and services that we can all build and try out as mvps for the next 48 hours and of course the last one is compliance and legal a lot of the dials here do operate and interact with the real world so being able to understand that and make that process easier is also a very active theme that we'll be curious to see some interesting acts around so let's quickly talk about the weekend itself so the goal here is for me to cover how all these things are going to work team formation how you can get help all the prizes you can win all the talks and workshops we're doing the summit itself which will will go into about 20 minutes and the judging and submission process so the most important thing is where all things are happening uh all things are happening on the youth global discord which means that all of you who are confirmed as hackers will have access to this discord channel you can see if you have access to it by seeing and noticing a dow hacks header on your sidebar and there you will find all the channels that are relevant for this event this is where you can meet everybody else's participating talk to any partners or mentors and really get all the help that you need and these are private channels which means if you are not a confirmed hacker for this event you will not be able to see them so please make sure that from your dashboard you have connected discord and this will give you access to everybody participating at this event on top of that there's also calendar invites for all the toxic workshops that are happening a lot of you have already gotten them and attended a lot of them today as well as yesterday uh but the full schedule of everything that's gonna happen is also on the website we really want this thing to be asynchronous there's going to be definitely elements here that require everybody to be on the call for example judging but a lot of this is going to be a synchronous because we are accommodating so many different time zones and we will make sure that anybody can catch up even if they have other commitments at that given time where do we find the schedule all of that is available on now.evenglobal.com so you can go to the website see everything from prizes to the schedule to the next steps around judging as well as talks so how does the hackathon actually work officially hackathon has begun which means that you can start hacking on your projects now you can work with up to five members uh on your project which means that if you are working with a team you can have up to five people but you can also work by yourself there is no restriction on you having to not have a team you have 48 hours to hack from here which means uh well 47 hours and 10 minutes from now is when submissions are due and uh we'll kind of talk about what that looks like and how do you actually go about submitting your project as well as judging and also if you have any questions about anything i'm going to say please leave ask them on the live stream chat and i'll be able to relate those questions uh back here and answer a lot of them in real time so the most important thing here for this event is that this is a weekend hackathon which means it starts today and it ends on sunday and as part of the rules and criteria for this event everything that you're going to be submitting must be done from scratch which means that you should have started your project now and everything you're going to submit and talk about should have been finished from friday to sunday you cannot build from any pre-existing or personal projects that it is okay to use external libraries or sdks or boilerplates but you cannot extend a project that you have been working on or continue something you were doing before even if it was at any global hackathon and on top of that only rsvp hackers are eligible to win which means that if you are not a confirmed hacker on the team page that you're submitting for and at the point of submission you do not see your team member's name if you win any prizes we will not honor anybody who was not listed on the submission and of course if you have any questions about this you are more than welcome to ping us on discord or email us and reach out to anybody on the global team and we'll be able to clarify and answer your question asap and of course we understand a lot of you are trying to understand what could be possible here so if you are new to all this thing uh fear not we have a lot of stuff that's going on to help with this uh you can still go to find a team channel and look out for anybody else who's still looking to join a team but we've done a couple of workshops already for interactive and synchronous team matching but uh there's a lot of people who are interested in finding other team members whether it's for specific skill sets or they're still looking for an idea or they have an idea but they need somebody who has a complimentary uh background to help them build it finite team channel is the place to go and of course so many of you are from so many different parts of the world and we're super excited to learn more about you so we really also encourage you to say hi and introduce yourself in the topx chat channel and uh and get to meet everybody else is participating and as i mentioned before it is totally okay to pack on your own uh you don't have to work with a team so if you already have an idea or if you know what you want to do or if you want to just learn and challenge yourself please feel free to uh submit something on your own on top of that there is a lot of amazing talks in workshops and just panels that we're hosting today and have already done so earlier today as well as yesterday so um you can still learn about all these things that are happening and for those of you who are joining us uh on uh tv that are not actually hacking at the event you can still watch all this content uh for free and understand what's happening in this world on top of that there's something right after this thing so the summit starts in about 15 minutes and for the hackers all the information that i'm going to talk about here as well as uh things that you need to know whether it's about the judging the submission process or anything else all that is also on your info center which is linked on your dashboard as well as on the calendar invites and again everything that we're doing here is recorded so you can easily catch up immediately after by heading over to youtube.com global and watch any talk workshop or panel as soon as uh it ends okay so where do you find all this by heading over to dow.educable.com you'll be able to click on a talk and understand when it's happening it's normalized to your own time zone and you can see the full schedule for the next 48 hours there so the most important thing here i want to cover is the submission process submissions are due at 12 p.m eastern on sunday the 10th that is in relative time 47 hours and 45 minutes from now and everything after that is going to be synchronous which means that to be eligible to win any prize uh especially on the main event side you will have to be on a zoom call presenting your prize to our judges so let's go into how judging works you will have four minutes to demo to all of the judges or our partners if you have participated in a previously global hackathon you may remember that previous events require a video submission but for this one um it is not required but we highly recommend that you still record a four minute video of your demo this way you get to make sure there are technical difficulties live and if something goes wrong we will move on to the next team at the four-minute mark so you will be cut off if things take more time than needed we'll talk about that in a second which is you will have four minutes to demo you can come and demo anything live so you can quickly screen share and talk about everything you did and you will be timed uh for this range and if you are going to the live demo of course you have the same formulas to talk about in demo and show anything you'd like but we really prefer that you record a video this way the same video can be used for all of the prices that you're eligible for and people can ask questions and also you can do things like speed up a main net transaction if you are doing for example i mean a transaction that requires much longer uh to confirm and sort of chop that piece and still be in the time limit for your four-minute demo we know it's going to be uh very tricky to do all these things just as the submission that went in so we really encourage all of you to not do this thing last minute if you're recording a video please leave at least one hour to make this work uh and at the same time really make sure that you're able to uh spend all this time writing uh all the description for your submission process and you don't get behind on the submission deadline all these details are going to be on your dashboard and we're going to communicate them a lot today and tomorrow so don't worry if you missed something here uh we will be giving a lot of notices and just clarifying a lot of things here in terms of how judging for prices goes you'll have to specify which price you are allergic going to be eligible for in the submission form itself so when you are about to submit your project you will see a drop down that lets you say this is the price i am called one i want to qualify for and the second you put anything there that's when we'll know that we have to notify the given protocol about your submission so if you forget to do this thing there's no way for us to know that you wanted to be eligible for this prize so please make sure that you select all the prizes you're going for and you can present all these to the sponsors on the discord so we will be coordinating a lot of that live as well so that's going to be main judging and a sponsor judging parallel track and you can join a call on discord and screen share if you uh are ready to present there uh and just as a big notice sponsors will review based on the submission so we will be sending a link to your showcase to all of our sponsors for the prizes so it's okay if you can demo to all of them but a demo live to all of them but as long as they have the full information on your submission page which is a description possibly a very recommended video a link to where you've deployed the project so they can test it out and see everything live that would make it easy for them to quickly do everything on their own and then ping you directly if they have any questions or clarification and also i want to talk about quickly the code of conduct so it is an online event but we still want to adhere to our rules for this community which is in summary please be respectful uh and harassment and abuse will not be tolerated in any form so you can check out the rules and go to conduct by heading over to either dot com slash rules that's everything that we're going to be adhering to at this event including anything that comes out of it will be an intellectual property of you and no one else so please check out if you're interested in learning more about any of the rules for the code of conduct and of course it was something that we missed or if you have more questions or clarifications that you would like you can head over to our discord and message anybody on the global team or message us over email by heading over or by sending an email to helloglobal.com all right so now i want to quickly thank some of our amazing partners who are also going to talk about their uh the prizes they're giving so let's uh jump into all coin and ipfs hi i'm joe riper from protocol labs we are delighted to participate in diy hacks to show ipfs and file ipfs is a protocol designed to make the web work peer-to-peer it is a trustless protocol it ensures other actors cannot modify the data to do that it uses content-based addressing addresses are cryptographic hashes of the data ensuring the full and forever integrity we use ipld a framework to create various linked data formats files post on a social network or your own custom data ipld can do it all ipfs is first and foremost decentralized allowing anyone to join and participate in the network the core design is really simple meaning it can work on more or less all mediums imaginable making it very future pure all of these points make ipfs the best tag for all of your web free data filecoin is the decentralized storage network it allows you to pay storage providers to store your data to do that restlessly storage providers must take fail tokens ask questions for your data and post daily zero knowledge proofs that they still stores the data if they fail to do so they pay penalties it uses ipld as the same data format as ipfs that make them greatly endurable there is ongoing work on the file coin virtual machine this is a wasm-based microcontract platform and will have an evm compatibility layer the fireground network is enormous storing 65 pv bytes currently and the total committed space is around 16 xz bytes making firecoin the solution for web free data i will be doing a workshop on april 7th demonstrating a dl back journal teaching you how to use ipfs with smart contract and what content addressing can do for you looking forward to see you we have reward for your projects we will give 6 thousand three thousand and two thousand dollars in file coin to the first second and first winner in our track as well are a five thousand dollar prize pool for anyone qualifying your track if you don't want to wait the workshop to learn more you can use these links on the left you have great tutorials and on the right you have create easy services to get started awesome so we just kind of learned about what protocol lounge has excited to do here and we'll go into quickly the prizes as well so without further ado let's learn about the price you can win for collapse hi i'm joe roper from protocol labs we are delighted to participate in diy hacks to show ipfs and file ipfs is a decentralized file sharing networks as i choose constant addressing filecon is the storage network for grapefree data we have six thousand three thousand and two thousands dollars in firecoin for the first second and third place in our track and we have 5000 for anyone building on ipfs file coin nft storage or web3.storage thanks for listening and have a nice weekend hacking stuff awesome and uh just to kind of talk about their prices again so the best use of ipfs stack which is using ipfs all clean after you get storage or web device storage will qualify for a lot of prices so the first place will receive six thousand dollars for being the best integration the second place will get three thousand directors will get two thousand is also a pool prize for using the same for all projects which means that anyone who qualifies as a project will split five thousand dollars evenly and next up we have sambar superfluid talking about their prices hello everyone my name is sam from superfluid and we're really excited to be sponsoring the upcoming youth global event dao hacks this weekend we have four total prizes worth eight thousand dollars in total the first of those prizes is for the best overall project built on superfluid at the event for three thousand dollars we have a prize for the best superfluid application for dow finance worth two thousand dollars another prize for the best use of super food and nfts for dao's worth two thousand dollars and finally a prize for the best use of superfluid and another sponsor is tech for one thousand dollars so four prizes there um we think that uh this is going to be a really cool event full of doubt related technologies and we're hopeful that they're going to be plenty of streaming related applications as well so if you need any help please reach out to me in discord you'll see me sam f superfluid and our team overall is happy to give you assistance as well happy hacking awesome and to quickly repeat the prices that sam just talked about the best overall integration of superfluid will win three thousand dollars the best superfluid application for dow finance will receive two thousand dollars the best use of superfluid uh for nfts and dials will get two thousand dollars and best use of superfluous integrating with other sponsors uh price or technology will receive a thousand dollars then we have the graph so the best use of an existing sub graph will win 1500 as the prize and there are two additional prizes here as well which is the best new subgraph will win a 1500 prize and uh running up best new subgraph submission will receive 500 as well then we have prizes for lens protocol so the best use case of a dial front-end or tooling for lens that uses less protocol in an interesting way optimizing for dials will receive dollars for the first place and the runner-up will receive a thousand dollars then we have skill wallet and skill wallet is hosting a id activist track so the first place of a skill water integration prize will receive fifteen hundred dollars the second place will get a thousand and third place will receive 500. there's also a one thousand dollar pool price that's going to be split between all skill load submissions so that one thousand dollars will be split evenly between everybody who qualifies for this category then we have covalent so the pool price for four thousand dollars is what covalent is offering which means that anybody who uses covalent in a super interesting way the apis will be equally splitting uh i will not we'll just leaving the the total amount and that the criteria for how it will be slip will be based on different tiers that go and we'll be sharing soon on how they uh

remind everybody to uh please base yourself this is a weekend hackathon but we don't want this to be exhausting for you we really are doing this thing so you can learn and experiment and see what's possible so we really want you to have fun uh please don't do this thing at the cost of no sleep or something else uh just try to learn um about everything that's happening in the world of dallas so with that happy hacking and we'll see you all on discord if you are a hacker and again the discord is on eatglobal.com discord and now let's switch gears to the dow hacks summit so i want to quickly give an overview of all the things we're going to talk about and then we'll jump into our very first talk so we're going to do this for the next couple of hours we're going to talk about a lot of the interesting themes that we are hoping to get a lot of great hacks around so we're going to kick off with just talking about what's happening in the world discovery and curation then we'll jump into creation administration of these dials and there's a lot of stuff happening around managing finance and payments and anything from investments to coordinating payments at scale then we're going to have another interesting discussion on memberships and nfts uh and how we can use those two to make thousand communities more accessible then everything that's happening in the world's governance and participation especially as we look to get more and more people involved and then our last talk will be on what is um the latest on compliance and legal and how do we actually make taos operate smoothly with the real world so without further ado let's jump into our very first talk this one is about discovery duration it's going to be in a panel with reihan dennison and alicia we're going to be talking about everything that's from their respect is super interesting or things they would like to see and alicia will be the one moderating this chat so i'll bring all of them to uh to stage here and i'll ask you to turn their videos on and i'll let lisa take it from here welcome everybody all right so everybody's default uh to uh a quick mute so i'll ask everybody to and yourself and let's get started i am unmuted cool um hey everyone i'm really excited to chat to rehan from fwb and dennis and kelly i'm alicia del from ens and um yeah i wonder i feel like in terms of all three of us i wonder if just like to kick things off in terms of like what you do day to day maybe even in life in general like how much mind share does daoing take up for you a lot yeah it's it's a lot right [Laughter] i woke up at like 3 45 this morning because i had um a call like a working group call and then i didn't communicate something to someone and it like literally lifted me out of my sleep so do you feel do you feel like that yes absolutely you know i think um the interesting thing about like doing dao stuff or like dowing i like to use it kind of as a verb and then background is my baby she babbles a lot so you may hurt her um is so you know i naturally i work on it all day for work and we're trying to think about how to solve these problems and particularly and then outside of work i'm in so many different dials and i'm trying to build different dials so i'm kind of always thinking about it uh for me the thing i think that i end up like sort of consuming me is and you know i just did like a medium post kind of about this is that sense of like responsibility that you end up feeling towards these like communities sometimes you feel like kind of irrationally responsible for uh lots of independent humans out in the world who are kind of like maybe looking towards you for you know maybe this bug and they need to fix because they're trying to do x right they want to vote and the button doesn't click or uh someone's like well okay it's a dow but what does that mean how does it work are you going to do the work or what do you mean i'm doing the work in the dow i just i just thought i just like hold the token to get rich like how does that work um so it can be very stressful and and and sometimes i just like log off because i can't i can't like really let that much wash over me yeah i i think that's probably something worth touching on a bit later too dennis and i feel you want that 100 so much of my day i think is thinking about both the macro and the micro of the dows that i'm in obviously at fwb so much of it is kind of member relations making sure the general public is taken care of but also really figuring out how to message and promote our mission as adele because mission alignment is so key and so crucial to kind of escaping that trap of you know token speculators were like oh when's number going up right because those folks oftentimes may not be the best builders or contributors and then for contributors it's also kind of segmenting it into oh here's what you can do in five minutes and then here's you know how we step up right if you wish because oftentimes you know just as as it is in any voting or any community some people just want to dip their toes in the water and some people want to get in the pool yeah i wonder this is actually something i was just thinking about if you think about your community and the dao and you have kind of like at the like apex the top of the pyramid you have like maybe core contributors people who are really involved and then um say that like base layer is like just token holders um or community members that might participate in events or you know whatever it is online or in real life that you do um how do you think about kind of like where everyone the different roles that people play and like whether you have to get everyone to a certain destination or kind of like the value of each of these different components you know whether it is just like someone who's a token holder um watching the price go up someone who um i don't know how how do you think about the different roles and does it mean that someone believes in the mission or the vision less if they're less involved yeah that is a great question i i think on the first part personally i'm trying to get rid of the pyramid um you know like currently the pyramid was like companies they go to the top right so you know my day job i'm a you know ceo right so you're like there's this pyramid um and that just feels like bottlenecking everyone else is below you right that has great contributions great vision great idea uh and when we talk about like core contributors for for dows um while i think we're at a place in time when we kind of still need that uh i think long term we have to think about that still just the kind another tip of the pyramid right and that's still kind of bottleneck and then also for some gals is like kind of a danger point right because that's like a point of capture like but there's a sort of like meme of like uh will the devs do something that that comment itself is very funny but it also implies something that i was just speaking about someone a few moments ago which is who's responsible for making things happen right so if you have a community where you know we're calling it a community but communities members say hey why don't the people who run this thing do something that implies to me that actually we haven't yet fully digested the idea of a dad right because it's kind of a thing where like no it's not the devs it's it's me why don't i do something yeah and to the second part of that like is that the difference between like community members and i think that kind of actually is where people wake up and say oh this is what needs to happen i'm spearheading right versus will the devs do something right which we hear all the time right i think that i i'll disagree just a little bit dennison just in a really small nitpicky way but so much of what i feel i do day in day out is almost traffic and like people management in a way in terms of who's raising their hands and who's doing what because you also don't want the problem of like too many cooks in the kitchen too many folks kind of submitting overlapping proposals or tapping for treasury when you know you have things that are maybe 80 aligned right because that's not necessarily great so some of it's also kind of building directionality and i think that's where a core team sets the direction the precedent and if you will like the kernel of the mission if not the final mission right that if you know if you're things like oh i want price to go up or i want to sell out this 10k collection like you'll operate one way but if you want to build a lasting durable institution that is digitally coordinated a lot of it is almost almost religious in a way where it's like all right so our daily mission is to kill our ego and make sure that we suffuse our energy into the wider community and like you said allow people to contribute so much of our view at fwb is coming from like a hardcore punk like co-op scene where it's like you take the tickets you sweep the floor but you might also be on stage yeah i love that but yeah i i think you know also to sort of like add to sort of my perspective i think it's very like over time as you know organization at the beginning are absolutely right you know nobody knows what it's about in the beginning so it is helpful that there's a group of people that feel inspired that sort of set the tone i hope that they sort of like break up into little you know smaller sections or people sort of spearheaded direction um you know a point that i like to bring up often is in the dope wars community rather than there being like a leader people sort of imbibe different aspects of the project with their own vision right so it's kind of like this hip-hop uh street project but it didn't necessarily start that way like i had created it but i didn't say anything about hip-hop in particular in the beginning but people said no this is about the streets man and and it sort of like created that own vibe right where had i been the core dev to be like no it's not about the streets it's about the gulf and country um you know it's just been nonsense right so so but i i do agree with you there there is uh you know people don't show up to somebody's house day one and say oh i'll just pitch in and start cooking right because you have to sort of like instill that like no this is everybody's house kind of thing yeah i wonder just like i really like that i had this idea of like sweeping the floor and being on stage do you think that dao's at the moment just kind of because we're still very early um in this kind of new movement in paradigm do you think that um dao's at the moment attract this kind of person have you found that in you know your own experience i will say personally dao's have made me a more type a personality who like you have to raise your hand you have to step up you have to volunteer and be like i want to do this oftentimes you know like chase and i have this convo where it's like uh how do you let quiet contributors raise their hands in a dow and i think that's also been a very huge challenge not just for us on this call but the space in general and i would really behoove the audience to think about this as well that you should always create kind of onboarding tracks for people with great ideas who may not necessarily for example want to be on you know discord all day or telegram or on twitter all day right every dow needs the person who's terminally online that's me for fwb um but a lot of folks don't want to do that so how do we build these rails for folks to step in with great ideas but without being like the face yeah denison what about you do you think that have you found because i feel like we are that person um and i think it's also similar to like this you know a person this like zero to one person say in a startup uh like swiss army nice or all these kind of like descriptions um what's been your experience with that yeah so for me it's kind of interesting i am not that person in the dows that you know i participated or have created uh and i don't want to be that person i think that i am actually a little bit old school uh you know being on discord is very heavy for me even things like zoom is very like psychologically bizarre to me that i'm in a very important meaningful discussion that you know i can't touch you right like um it's also for me i feel you know when you create something there's a special kind of responsibility you have where you can say things and people take them to be truth right so especially when you create communities and you know uh you know there is that religious aspect to it and people do have this like sort of like you know clicky following aspect to it it's very easy to say something that people just take to be like oh that's what we're doing now oh you know dennison said he likes green change all the headers to green right and then people will be like well maybe he didn't really say that and they'll be like our leader said green and and like it's weird but like when you create something that's supposed to be a community and you you have to really lead by example and you know for me the thing that i'm particularly really passionate or interested in is can we create leaderless organizations right and maybe i'm totally wrong maybe none of these are ever going to really work but it's very important to like step back from that leadership role so there's truly space for others to take leadership and in dope wars very early on i took a step back really quickly and said hey okay set the mechanics this is the idea let's go and people filled in all those roles on their own right they made a documentary a hip-hop album they have a newspaper different websites people are building on different networks these kinds of things but if i were there day in day out people would filter things through me right so um communities do need community like stewards absolutely uh for me i can't be that person maybe it's also i'm just not good at that uh right and you know like you know alicia you'd mention like i'll wake up in the middle of the night and i will have some internalized grief over like maybe i wasn't polite enough in some response or like maybe got tired answering the same question for the tenth time and i was a bit snappy um and that's very hard on me uh but also it's i feel like it's very important to leave that space for other people to leave because when you can show that other people can lead other people go oh i can lead too right and i feel like that's very important because otherwise and maybe i'm wrong in this in some cases otherwise um you know people who step up to lead might really actually just be following yeah i wonder in terms of thinking about how to um especially like on board and how people show up especially when they're kind of like trying to figure out what a community feels like to be in day-to-day um the tools like i personally think that the tools that we use and like the stack that we have influences so much of the experience that people have so i wonder and i do find it like personally quite difficult to you know take a lot of time to be really intentional and thoughtful and then kind of like resort to the tech stack that we do so a really basic example is just like a written governance forum um so i basically like try to get on calls with as many people as i can because i think that there is so much nuance that's lost in the written word and it's just like it's kind of like being an extrovert or an introvert um it's like you know uh it's almost like the shape rotator words i think but it's not it's not that but it's like you know some people feel comfortable um communicating with the written word other people they don't but they're kind of forced into these different platforms and um so how do you think about creating these spaces where i don't know we can just be like as inclusive and um make communities as accessible as possible for you know the different ways that people shine i have a controversial answer which is um build selfishly right you build for your own community oh my gosh i always talk about being selfish okay there we go you know you know um because if you build what feels good for you and then kind of fine-tune it out and make it applicable for like someone else like in our case who's maybe not as culturally aligned or someone who's not as much of a you know discord geek or whatever then you can end up finding tools that make sense and then you bring other people into the fold and build out accordingly like one very specific example probably like snapshot i think that's a pain point for so many folks where if we think about just voting in the civic system right like you have punch card ballots and you have touchscreen and all this other stuff right like just the technology itself is such a barrier and we have a really big chance to automate that make it feel kind of lived in and comfortable almost like consumer tech as opposed to civic tech which i think is so fascinating and interesting and that's a space i'd want to see more people kind of deal with at fwb i think to the credit of like dexter and mike barge on our team a lot of what we've built feels native to our system and our community and we've expanded it outwards as we collaborate with more dallas yeah yeah i i think the tooling is obviously you know tally builds a lot of dow tooling so this is something we think about a lot and you know sometimes we wonder if you know dows such as fwb have the resources to build their own tooling and their own internal mechanisms and then you have daos that don't and kind of need like a manual and they need help and how to get there uh you know you started talking about like the sort of governance forum and like the writing and this is such a problem right you know one of the things like we use discord because it is such like a liquid idea layer right like everything just flows but it also trains participants to to kind of behave badly right and it really puts a lot more work on the contributors shoulders than is really fair i think you know it would be reasonable to say please read the docs but in uh environment like discord nobody reads the docs and they hold you responsible for somehow having not communicated all the information in the docs to them in some medium that they would have already had a chance to go through even when that's already there right so there's this really weird thing where you'll you can you can have something you'll have an announcement channel or a welcome channel they'll say hey welcome here be nice everyone just look sure yeah i'll be nice and then they go and be mean uh and then like please read the doc to understand what's happening here and then they come in the first question they say is like what's happening here right um so discord is and you know i feel like i'm ending up on this little like campaign against discord which is not what it is but there's something about those platforms where if we didn't need the sort of like fomo mimetic liquid communication that discord provides us participants might also have the opportunity to be more thoughtful right like the ability to like slowly peruse information right the idea that in discord someone comes with a great idea and then eight hours later somebody else wakes up in their time zone and that idea is like just like scrolled infinitely up um it's a bad experience so so we spend a lot of time like you know trying to manage communities and essentially trying to control you know remember that game telephone that you play like in school where like the children pass a message around and by the end the message is totally nonsense right that's discord right and in many ways a lot of the work of community managers is like trying to intercept every time that message gets passed from one user to another to clarify no no no that's not what was said hey hey hey that's not what's happening oh be nice right um so i think we're still at a loss of like what the sort of ideal tool is there um i personally am advocating navigating things like you know office hours where you just like turn it off and like it's just not available but some sort of medium where you can have that liquid communication and that sense of community that brings it right because a lot of people are in that discord because you know the doubt brings them a sense of purpose and being there is a community that they're a part of but then also having an environment where you know that people are going to go and read what it's about you know that people are going to take the work and time to be like be a part of it and and frankly some of this is just going to come down to resources long term like when some doubts get large enough where they can have a conference right they'll say okay you know um let's go out to the desert and all the true participants will all come out here and we'll like workshop what it is that we are about and we will all get it and everyone will know unfortunately not all the dows can do that but i think we're gonna see that more and more um you know creator cabins is doing is doing dow camp really where it's just like hey you know what we got to take people out of this environment put in some human forum and do the discussion but it's a very very difficult problem opportunity slash place to live your life in the metaverse yeah i wonder just like thinking about taking people off line into the real world and just like the impact of that in terms of building community um especially kind of as the world starts to open up again how important is it for or has it been in your own experiences to kind of feel within a community because like i guess it's been really interesting for me because i've kind of just been like sitting in a room in new zealand for the last year um which was like both geographically very far away and also like very isolated because i i kind of didn't really leave my room and um and just to you know be able to see and share a meal with people um it's something so new i know i know that there are lots of online communities um that have been built you know for decades and it's not new to them but for a lot of people coming into web 3 um coming into the dow space building like 99 of this relationship with others with the community with a mission completely online like what is your hope with in real life and kind of just like other things outside of the miniverse oh it's a good bandwidth thing oh yeah like real life bandwidth is so different than online like even right here we're still seeing each other's faces voices and everything but there's something really special about seeing someone in person and connecting and i also think that even in the way that people have have manners and talk on like zoom or discord is so different than you know in person i think you know alicia between you and i you would have cut me off like eight times by now and i would have done the same if we were in person right like it's so back and forth right and it's almost closer to like jazz and freestyling than it is like something programmatic and that's kind of how i think the culture gets built for a lot of orgs i know in our case so many people have joined fwb and kind of understood what we're about after they go to an event or a party in person and like have experienced the community and what there is to to offer it's not like uh you know job fair it's closer to like a rave a dance a really good lunch you know and that's the kind of stuff that you know even creator cabins for example does extraordinarily well in terms of linking people up and saying this is kind of what we're about and this is where we're gonna go yeah um i really agree with that and you know it's kind of interesting to talk about how in real life would be interrupting one another and zoom you're kind of like forced to take turns like it's like kind of forced around robin because otherwise nobody hears anything uh and like all the social cues get mixed up um and then discord is just like nobody waits for you to finish  right like whatever you're in the middle of talking something gm it's gone right um i kind of remember in like the late 90s early 2000s uh there's like this t-shirt and there's like this kind of like phrase that said like um for like young sort of like musicians there's like this whole scene of like early electronic indie music and they would get really popular in japan and so there's this kind of like meme of like yeah i'm really big in japan and i always liked that idea how it sort of like applies like the metaverse you know because you know as you mentioned you're like in new zealand you're like a room what is it like and like can people really wrap their mind around what it is to say you know to be you be in your room and like walk outside and go get a coffee and someone's just like oh hi you're like oh and they're like what are you doing you're like i chat on the internet but really you're like oh i'm a leader of a transnational global organization that's revolutionizing the the you know core way that humans interact with each other but people are like sure you know so it's like that big in japan thing so it's like being in real life is very important to like on a subconscious level would be like no you're not crazy they really do love you in japan you know you really need to go there for your concert and really see like oh wow they really love me here right like there's other people are into what i'm doing i'm not alone so um yeah and you know actually i'm going to see if i have the book right here um so the guy who founded like cmx the community management conference and he like talks about how his is he talks about how the first time they did the community management conference all these community managers came together and they're like oh my god it's real i knew what i was doing was real and important i knew it um so you know it's kind of like that sort of see if i have it lying here yeah i think maybe this kind of flows on to just like the in real life stuff and almost it's kind of like um just like taking a breath and playing the long game i think especially in terms of like the divisions that of you know the dows and the communities that we're involved in um it's definitely a marathon but i know that in web 3 it can just feel like continuous sprinting so especially kind of in the dow space what are the things that you do as individuals to just like keep playing the infinite game essentially for me it's logging off and being polite to people and saying no right people you know you'll create something and people are like no you have to keep building it right now always and and this is what you have to build and this is how you should do it and everything you've done is wrong you kind of have to just be like not internalize that very politely be like no i'm going on vacation or no i'm going to sleep or if you want that thing so much please go build it and then when people say i don't know how to it's like well you know ask other people in the community and like gain support right like their communities can turn toxic for contributors especially builders you know i've spoken to a lot of builders who who join a community and start building something because they're just passionate about it and and suddenly they feel this responsibility for like owning it and they have to maintain it and people make demands of it and you know why doesn't it work as good as something else that somebody else built uh you know and and that really burns people out and the there's this kind of silent dismissal in communities where people who who are really passionate contributors i'm sure we've all seen this passionate contributor is always in there always mediating things and then suddenly you just don't hear from them anymore right where where they hit that burnout where this is is something that can be really intense i think you have to tell yourself that you do care about this group of anonymous internet people inside of discord but you do care about yourself and your well-being and that you need to be like interested and up and excited and doing this thing again tomorrow and you're just gonna have to take space for yourself for that totally i'm gonna add on to that it's almost like a in in some ways that a community is almost like a tornado you have the highest velocity on the outside you have the most churn on the outside you have people whipping around you know houses and cows and cars on the outside and as you get closer to the center it gets more calm and it's like as someone who is managing and building you have to be as still as you can and do what it takes to to do that um and also recognize the various tiers of of the chaos and the stillness as it moves inwards that for for people on the most outside denison to your point it's like all right cool that if you want to contribute to community like here's our town hall for our actually no if you want to contribute to product or software here's the stage we're giving you to do that here's where we can triage good ideas versus bad for community same thing and i think some idea of functional units or squads within adele are very helpful in that regard because then all of a sudden the stuff that we thought were blockers or less so and of course the way to do that is to take care of ourselves because if you don't you know a dow is like always on weaponry never sleeps as someone says you know enough screenshots of your sleep ads to know that you also literally never sleep um oh yeah you know yeah yeah i'm too scared to get one of those um but i kind of think of it uh this is like kind of parenting advice i feel like so much parenting advice like flows over into dow advice but um something that's like really basic is fill your own cup it's like put your own oxygen mask on first before you help others um i think just like really really internalizing like what it means to for you know like you personally me personally to be at my best like physically is a big one i like really take you know like my whole being shifts um based on kind of like my physical activity and it's like really easy to sit in a chair for like you know 18 hours a day in the space um but yeah i think also just like having people that will um i guess like you see a denison like lead by example and um i think in terms of that culture setting it's really important but i know we are coming up on time thank you both so much this has been so much fun and i hope that everyone watching um you know learned a few things and found yeah found this valuable and he got it well ryan dennison thank you thank you so much for being on the panel and alicia thank you so much for moderating i think it's uh everyone it's really good to see the human side of this ecosystem kind of being brought to to light and uh there's a lot of perils here on how you can not just contribute to dials but just also how you work overall in this space and uh really appreciate the amazing chat thank you everyone thanks everybody and with that we are ready for our second talk which is going to cover everything that's happening with creation and administration of doubts this is a panel i'm currently particularly super excited about because there's so many things that are happening at so many different scales so um i won't spoil anything we're going to cover but i want to welcome imran from alliance style stefan from taoist was going to be moderating this uh moshe from coordinate and dr nick from factory dial so i'll let them introduce themselves and the stage is yours welcome hey everyone um so i guess i'll start quickly uh my name is stephan delavo i guess i'm involved in a lot of different areas in the space i'm mainly running the i'm the president of the caribbean watching alliance um in the dial space i am one of the students of the taoist um also contributing to a number of other doubts everyone else i guess we could start with uh yeah so one of the co-founders of alliance which is a web3 accelerator program we work with some of the best founders in industry uh all the way ranging from nft marketplaces all the way to daoz and and defy um yeah so that's a quick background myself pass it over to moshe hi my name is moshe i work with quarter nape where i lead research studies under the dao landscape and understanding the dalverse and coordinate is a tool for supporting decentralized compensation and culture at the house um it's down to me so um yeah my name's nick um i've been building dow tools in the space for the last 18 months or so alongside some prediction market and defy stuff um and we are launching a dow called factory dao which is a dow that makes dows um and it's our it's our goal to build a kind of decentralized home for for dao infrastructure and um we kind of we're aiming to specialize in decentralized decision making tools we do a lot of quadratic voting um and um build sort of mechanisms for fair launching of tokens and doing decentralized governance in new and interesting ways with nfts that's awesome uh we'll just jump right into the questions so this is always one of the favorite questions i have in space what does everyone think about dallas as a philosophy in terms of what do you think about the philosophy of dallas and why are you even doing this in the first place um so for me personally everyone talks about the core aspects of dallas which are decentralization and autonomy but even that means different things to different people right so how do you think about those words in particular and why were you in here in the first place um dao's what dao's enable um you know you can always talk about you know organization or self-coordinate social coordination as a tool uh but if you're thinking about like the evolution of organizations generally you have you know traditional organizations uh and all the other organizations brought out of it but now what can you do with people all across the globe that are able to coordinate for a mission and vision together uh biology said this really well which is that was what dao's enable is the the ultimate social coordination to it that could uh rival nation states which i think is a very true statement and the reason for that is because right now like if you look at traditional organizations today they're primarily predicated on jurisdictions and governments and so for people in fact if you know about this like the history of corporations you know that like uh like corporations even in the united states you couldn't actually do business outside of a state uh and now thinking about doing business outside of the united states has is like something that's not left out anymore because that's something where we live in a truly global organizat uh what dials i think enables taking it for a step further which is allowing anyone to coordinate with anyone doesn't matter where they reside what the mission vision is and they're able to do this holistically with other organizations so i'll jump in here and i'll say that i have a little bit of a bias well my perspective comes from having a phd in organizational behavior and having spent decades reading literature on like the history of organizations corporations nonprofits and how they've evolved so in many ways i'll say like there's not that much new about daos there are groups of people trying to get together and coordinate towards shared goals like cavemen have done trying to hunt a woolly mammoth for a long time right um what and so and i say that as a bit of because as i watch the evolution of the space i i watch people come in with like philosophical ideas around autonomy empowerment collaboration flattening hierarchies and then when it starts to get hard we've we all almost all of us have previous work experiences or we grew up in schools and hierarchies and bureaucracies right and we import those mental maps and i can see this tendency to just replicate in a distributed disseminated web threes to an anonymous space um what's what you know why i left the web 2 world right and so what excites me about those at the same time is that we hold this ethos of wanting to create a sense of ownership belonging and autonomy empowerment but also collaboration coordination and like there's some heart and soul and like we don't give a fuckness um that's kind of like um really inspiring to me like it's like this like we're gonna this iconoclasmic idealist and what kind of idealism like this like little edge to the space that holds that keeps us from just defaulting from a previous model particularly as as we scale and have to develop and have ways of funding ourselves and things like that um and then i guess the other thing that excites me is you have groups that are truly more socially oriented around arts and social spaces that we've seen as a void in much of at least western culture for decades now um yeah i i really like the point that i think you're right there isn't thousand radically new in the sense that we i i was working on decentralized organizations before the dao was around and that that notion of of decentralized organization has been around for a long time it's a it's not a new paradigm in itself but i do see dows as the facilitator of these things so they're difficult to scale um without these without web3 tooling and and i you can think of organizations traditional organizations almost like pyramids of power and daos are almost like the opposite the goal is to to decentralize power so the goal is to give power away um and the the i think that's that for me is like a philosophical shift that's happening and downs are almost like the inflection point between centralization and decentralization and they can collapse back to these centralized notions in fact they all kind of start fairly centralized but the goal is to distribute power out to us as many participants as possible and that's that's for me is a kind of root of the dow philosophy for me yeah i really like these points about you know this long history of decentralized governance the fact that this isn't really anything new it's just a slightly different form using different technology um i think that kind of goes into the next question especially moshe how you mentioned that a lot of times people start off you know really being passionate about dallas or wanting to explore and then they kind of revert back to what what they're already doing before in a more centralized direction uh so especially when we talk about things like that how do we make sure we actually build and contribute to the evolving of a healthy uh dow culture or healthy doubt ecosystem yeah i think that's a great question and i i really liked uh nick's point around power has a tendency there's a tendency for power to coalesce and centralize um i'll say even like the first dow i worked at like in 2018 which was a cooperative like was flat and had no titles and no hierarchies and what it meant was like all the power informally got coalesced around the founder who had a really hard time giving it away and now and that had a pretty direct correlation to the demise of that organization um and so i think there's like that um there are a couple ways you can support such a culture right one is um i've seen some really great admins like who are not necessarily the founders with the vision who people look to there's like a disaggregation between the founder the visionary who has all this tacit power and the admin is really holding and sustaining like the ethos the values of the place and maintaining safety right i think another way i've also seen culture be sustained which is a little counter-intuitive is um yes dallas and theoretic theory are inclusive porous boundary have inclusive porous boundaries but you got to know who you are your essence is and so i think of as like concentric circles of trust intimacy and commitment and proven capability and contribution to the dao and so being clear about what those circles are and like what we're at at our core and who's who's sustaining that but also they may not be porous more people can come in and sustain hold the view of the dao and that's different from the folks in the discord channel who are saying we're trying to micro regulate the price of the token right so also having that sense of here's our like we're working really hard to coordinate about our mission our values what we're about um and then um and then we're also and we're defining that and we have a whole community that we engage with as well right as part of that process but there's delineations and the last thing i'd say is um is remembering that we're all about humans working with humans and because of web 3 and no video and disaggregation like making time for the human relational conversation so we're connecting person to person when we see like bad actors arise in a coordinate circle it's often i ask when i probe into it it's like well we haven't even heard each other's voices and we worked together for months right so there's no feedback there's no relationship building that are like critical in any organization or any group of people so the things i think about the the way we think about it within alliance line style is we actually don't open up our you know we think ourselves as a traditional company in the sense where we don't allow the community to be involved in what we do we actually go through an interview process for those that want to be a part of our community and we look for ways where they can support us in different types of areas of support so there's like four right like product engineering marketing uh and then like collaborations or partnerships and marketing and and so once we interview these individuals we figure out like how much time they can actually commit to the doubt and if they're committing to other doubts the problem that we have today is that we have too many people that are involved in too many different dials and then they ultimately you know they don't have any time to actually do real work and so we look for time and how much they can support us uh because over time what you're doing is like part-time work as moshe mentioned right like you know these are real organizations that are going to need actual support from the community so um what we call them is like frontline contributors and we uh they're relatively speaking they'll have about 20 hours of time that they can spend uh and that's kind of like the first like foundation of what our dow is then we have like core contributors and we have work stream contributors and they actually spend full time working for the dao um but you know that's kind of how we think about from a hierarchy perspective it's just like you know how do we get real work done and how do we make sure that this organization moves its milestones so that it can continue be to be to be around in the next five to ten years um yeah i think in terms of the next stage of dow designs that build us up healthier community i think i'm really interested in governance systems that arise from sort of non-financial power so we've you've got nf we look at nft governance and use a kind of combination of nfts and quadratic voting to assign voting budgets or voting allowances to individual nfts and then those individual nfts can have elevated voting power that can be generated from contribution so contribution driven governance power and influence in dallas is probably where i think the healthiest and strongest communities come from and rather than just being disempowered people the where there's four or five people that genuinely control the token supply and consequently all the decision making um so i think that's that's probably where the that direction is going to move to i think yeah i mean when we look at these communities that all of your rates at some points especially in terms of you know how do we actually manage these communities how we make sure work is actually being done people don't get overburdened everyone falls for the same you know problems sometimes about oh this is cool this is cool and then you end up with you know a million servers on your discord and then you get caught up with a lot of people get caught up with you know jumping from thing that thing without being able to focus um and what i like about this is that all of your kind of focus in different areas especially like for example is more deeply focused um what do you all think of i guess what is no one what do you all think no one is really talking about or is not talking about enough in this space in terms of like potential issues or challenges or even just more of the good things um i i think token economics isn't discussed as much as potentially um it could do um i think there's there's a huge amount of engineering to be done around a healthy token ecosystem around it um where it just kind of all doesn't descend so distribution of tokens on uh initial um spin-up of a dow um if all those tokens end up too centralized around early contributors for example then you're going to find it very difficult to find people coming late to the to the dow and and being properly incentivized with it but also thinking in a sort of sustainable way it's it's a really easy way to burn out a dow very quickly um by sort of either issuing tokens too quickly or not thinking long-term enough with them um so i think that's a real um a really interesting dynamic of better treasury management uh better incentive alignment that lasts for longer terms um so i think that's a really interesting place that i don't think it's talked about quite as much as it should be i agree with that oh sorry good oh i was just saying i want to build on that and say i think more broadly it's like thinking long term and understanding a world of constraints and then the mere image of like the ethos which we're starting with dallas with and it mirrors like the general life cycle of startup early stage startups which are all about like try a million things spend money yes come help us we'll desperate for anyone and then with scaling it's like how do you really manage constraints finite budgets creating hierarchy and deciding we have five awesome people doing design which of them kind of leads or initiates the group in some way because we need some coordination points as we move from 15 to 150 folks so like and how do you do that without undermining and like the treasury management without undermining the ethos of what we're here to do which is like decentralize and empower people but it gets exponentially harder with with uh with scale um i i completely agree like token economics has been one of the lacking like focuses in crypto in fact you know if you look at like token economics with the ve standard that curve came out with you've noticed like a a i would say a portion of protocols that pivoted to that model that shows you kind of the naive space that we're in uh i still think the v model hasn't been tested yet to its extent uh but speaking about daos and tokenomics that's also a very interesting topic which is like do we airdrop everyone in the community token do we allow everyone to uh do we distribute our tokens based on activity i mean those are types of conversations i'm hearing about one area that i think could be super interesting is um rewarding contributors based on the work that they've done for the dow so instead of opening up the race to everyone in the community um find the people that are going to be most relevant for for the dao get them to commit time to the dao give them the token sale and then have other options that reward based on kpis of the dao uma protocol has a a pro a product it's called the dao kpi product and it essentially allows token sale investors to get an additional call option on the token cell if the dow kpis are hit which i think is very very relevant to to how we now push dow progression forward with the community in mind yeah i totally agree as well in the token economic side i mean it's interesting because now it's extremely easy to spin up a dow very easy to create a new token which obviously is a good thing but also kind of takes away or has the potential to take away a lot of the intentionality behind you know what you're trying to create because people sometimes don't realize like when you're starting when you're creating a token you're actually creating an actual economy and which means you also have to kind of manage or at the very least facilitate this economy so all these points are excellent especially in terms of all right so we have this what do we what do we do next how do we make sure the right people are being paid or the right people are at least being incentivized so that that's extremely important um i do want to ask a fun question what are you most excited about in terms of this dow ecosystem um especially in terms of what's coming next so for example i'm really excited about uh more dows popping up from the global south um obviously much of the space is still very much us uk based i really want to see what happens when more people in smaller communities and more diverse communities get ahold of these tools and i think that's going to cause this space to look very different too in terms of like what other people are doing so what are you guys most excited about um so i'll quickly go so i think i'm really excited about this um the moment when the idea starts to captivate everyone i think there's going to be a moment where dolls go the way of nfts and then everyone's getting super excited about it and then we just get a whole load of new people getting very excited about krypton but via dabs i actually think they have a huge mass adoption potential um and i just was really excited about that moment where we'll have something some doubt somewhere or something will captivate the public's memory imagination it sort of happened with constitution dao very fleetingly um but there's go there's going to be some other events where dallas start to hit mainstream culture and and um where collective creativity um examples start to happen in in in full view of the public and it's going to be very exciting um i i think it's gonna be too far ahead but like i'll throw it out there because i think it's pretty cool um the ability for dials to collaborate with other dials could be very interesting um so as long as they're shared incentives for both dows right the question and this is where i think a lot of hard work is going to go into is like aligning um you know mission and vision and goals of both dials and being able to have kpis that can solve the problems for both kind of like a traditional jv um and the reason why i say this is important because like if we're going to start to see more and more dials on based on collective missions and visions and products then you could also say that they're ultimately like money legos similar to d5 right and if that's the case then i think a lot of cool uh collaborations could take place where it didn't before because today we're kind of constrained based on jurisdiction monopoly types businesses and you know power given to certain types of individuals now being given that to the community and the people with the strongest like you know nature of like how they're building out those products i think there could be some very interesting collaborations that come out of it yeah and so i'm going to build on those points and say i think there's a way in which dows are going from just defy to take having an influence in more and more parts of the economy and eventually also can start to be used as governance structures and systems to displace things that are even more based on harder solid things right so eventually looking towards the toilet paper factory you know that has kind of a dao system over archer management or the collective of of people who have some like i like friends with benefits has some in real life and virtual components right and so that's what excites me and what also excites me about that vision is like there are a lot of people to teach how to doubt and i'm excited about the conversion process to be like what are the mindsets how do you kind of de-program that old way of relating in an organizational system have it feel more like relating to family and friends and a more community-oriented mindset than a transaction a hierarchical mindset and like that conversion process of how do we take these structures from like d5 and other parts of web 3 into not even necessarily web 2 right like the ecosystem of humans and teach people how to get there easily is is super exciting to me yeah that's awesome also airmen totally right in my mind because i was gonna ask next what do you guys think about doubted out and how the future of dow collaboration is gonna going to evolve but i mean excellent point that i think that's so important because we need even even now we still see a lot of doubts kind of acting in silos but when we actually start to connect them together it's gonna like blow everything up because we're gonna see more and more just communities interact with each other growing together d5 protocols working together uh social communities building with each other creating new causes and all these things together so that's gonna be amazing to see um i guess is there anything else that you're excited about oh what are you thinking about in terms of the future of how your own dial or group of dials are going to operate or you know motion for example how to coordinate or how specific tools are going to evolve what do you see as your specific features yeah absolutely so we're still like um honing in on that but i would say like uh i'm here in uh in berkeley california on an offsite with my team we're working through all these questions i will say like when we're designing we're looking within the dao and thinking about members and member members incentives and and and how do you create an amazing experience for them as individuals and have them add up to something for the dao but we are thinking as much around the dao da dao ecosystem and the metaverse of daos and how they collaborate share information and also like there's we're thinking a lot about um privacy versus like transparency as an ethos right but what should be transparent and what should be private and learning a lot about that um and then but if i'm a member looking to join a dao like there's a dating process if you think this whole ecosystem there's a dating process like like okay cupid wise like me and his dad want to get to know each other can you give me some signals around fit for the dao and what are the signals you're looking for that can be also verified um with through various ways to get to know me my experience and my fit in the dao so that's one thing i'm thinking about and then like what are the data you want to collect to understand culturally my contributions to the dao and then what the data i want to track to understand my experience across like the eight hours i've been involved with in the past two years and how i learn and evolve and signal that to the world so those different levels of individual are definitely things we're thinking about and how do you how do you use those data to support everyone in the ecosystem um what we're thinking about a lot is um uh is hierarchy within the dow right um it's it's it's actually it's pretty hard um because uh before we had a ceo and you have like you know ceo and all of the other hierarchies that kind of roll down from there uh how do you build a community first organization right an organization that ultimately plugs into the community and how do we do this right because you only have one shot at building a strong organization that's long-lasting and so we're taking a very you know a very tight-knit approach which is we'll start off as like a core team that looks very similar to like a traditional company and then slowly over time you slowly bring in the community in certain aspects where you could where the community can help you scale and you do that through like vetting and understanding who are the types of community members that you can actually allow into your doubt um and so we've we've been thinking a lot about that and the way we scale out to the community um this idea of hierarchy is really interesting it's actually one of the things that um yeah i i think we mentioned it earlier but if you presume a totally fi organization it can descend into this kind of tyranny of structurelessness problem where they're just the most powerful people dominate um and actually one of the things we're super excited about is um what we call a method down structure which is um sub-dials which can almost like build these kind of fractal organizational structures where you can use nfts to create dynamic membership within a dow that's domain specific and possibly even built with reputation systems out of who's who tracked contribution in those domains and then weight decision making based on who's performed in certain disciplines and and so i think there's i'm really excited about that dynamic of where governance uh where governance tools are going um and building out pseudo-hierarchies where these different communities within a dow might become more important for some things more than others but they're kind of fluid and open um so yeah i think that's um that that kind of new era of decentralized governance is about to begin i think yeah it's awesome i'm also excited about new dao tooling that's going to be coming out to help support all of what we're talking about uh there's so much that's out there but i think there are few that could be very very important for how that was operating in the landscape today so i'm pretty excited about that and i'll just say that yeah everything you all just said i'm just excited because that is the direction we're around hierarchies and all that is and nested parts of these organisms that kind of self-replicate but stay in a their own bubble is part of how we're envisioning coordinate and we're really clear that like there's a bunch of things that dao is need tooling around and someone else is doing that super well and so we will be figuring out how to integrate and collaborate with those tools as seamlessly as possible um in support of that vision and so it's really fun to be in our own side of dow tooling and i'm like yes to everything you said and recognizing parts of what you just you shared will be addressed by other tools that we're we're watching and and uh collaborating with which is a very different ethos than um at least when i was working in the prior web 2 world yeah i like that a lot i mean it kind of expands on the doubted out collaboration down to the tower tools collaboration which is a whole other category that's awesome i think we'll come up on time i think we have time for one more quick question but actually nick i wanted to expand on something you mentioned earlier in terms of dallas actually being you know where a lot of the mass adoption of crypto comes from i was wondering if you and the other guys can expand on that before we close um yeah just so that the reason why i think that might happen is because the if you look at just the way that we we've evolved into using the internet it's it's largely around the the really striking things that have happened around community formation so the things we're already doing we're in chat groups we're in you know subreddits we're in forums we're in discords we're already doing this kind of it's something that most people do on the internet already and i just feel like there's there's this potential hop out of um of those practices into dow's that can happen that really people will just experience one almost peripherally see the power of it and uh potentially do some wild stuff that like wouldn't normally have happened without if the dow idea wasn't there and i think it could really like captivate humanity of like oh wow there's a whole new possibility space for how we can use these communities we're in and everyone will look at that whatsapp group a little bit differently for a bit and it'll be super exciting yeah if i could share one more thing building on that like if i talk to my teammates they're like this is the most awesome work work experience i've ever had and we're making really cool and i hear that pretty consistently from a lot of people in the space and to me that is the proof not only we're doing interesting things but people are the happiest they've ever been collaborating to make stuff happen in the world and i think that's that's necessary for the vision that nick and imran have been articulating to to come to provision well i want to say that yeah so this has been an amazing chat i i'm particularly interested in uh maybe bringing you guys back um in the future to kind of cover more about the hierarchy i think this is uh something that can i constantly go back and forth whether it's culturally or just from an ideological standpoint so a lot of interesting thoughts there i personally agree with what you said iran but uh uh i think these things also have to be uh variable based on the scale of the community too so i'm curious to see if there's more thoughts that we can share and go into this topic specifically in the future so i want to thank all of you again stefan thank you so much for moderating and uh really appreciate the time thank you thanks for having some room thank you and with that we are ready for our next talk so next up is we want to cover the category of finance and payments of course uh dows are fundamentally managing payments and companies to scale uh whether they're on chain or off and uh there's so much room for not only just improvement but automation rethinking and just coming up with brand new ways to understand and solve these problems so to kind of bring on this uh behemoth of the topic uh i don't want to invite an improv jason and monsie on on stage and uh monty will be the one moderating this panel so i'll let her kick this off and uh welcome everybody great to see all of you here again thank you karthik for having us always excited to be at an eat global event um hey everyone i am right now in miami at the bitcoin miami conference but joining in just for this amazing panel um quick introduction on myself before i will i let um both jason and anibal introduce themselves um i've co-founded komorebi tao which is an investment now focused on investing in female founders and non-binary founders in the crypto space um outside of that my day job is at standard labs where we are building the decentralized storage an application hosting layer for all of web3 so i'm excited to dive into the finance and payments conversation today that's my background before crypto i worked in the traditional finance industry so exciting to see what we are doing in the dallas space with that but with um without further ado jason you want to go next just quick introduction and then i would love to hear your background too absolutely thanks modesty uh hi everybody i'm jason i'm the cto of utopia labs utopia lab started about seven months ago we handle all the payroll and expense management for dows pretty much we want to tackle the entire financial stack for dows and handle all the back office tasks and make sure that creating a doubt and operating now is just really simple um yeah and i think we'll dive into that today i'm really really excited to chat with both modesty and uh anubhav here i think parcel and uh komorobi are fantastic companies so thanks for having me on this panel thank you and about yeah um so um i'm onboard i founded parcel about a year ago and as a background i was working with a few victory companies um like instead app and by economy before starting parcel um and it grew out of a need uh that a previous company like bi economy faced and um yeah it's been a year now i mean we've been working with a lot of towers including bankless index and olympus to sort out their payments and we're kind of building the payment os four thousand contributors thank you vote um before we dive in i'm just very curious what problem did you notice in the dao space that made you start your respective company what was the challenge that you you know set out to solve yeah i can go first um yeah uh it's funny when we uh when we started utopia lab so to give some context on our co-founders we're four co-founders and uh we actually all met on discord beforehand so we we never met in person when we started the company and we did a lot of random hackathons and we're trying to start something together i never thought we would end up in dow tooling for that matter a lot of stuff we were doing in the beginning was stuff like nft marketplaces so ending up endowed such a niche like dow tooling at the time was uh pretty surprising and the kind of how we arose to that was that we talked to a lot of dows we thought um dallas was an interesting uh problem space to explore and what we just found out was that the operations of the house were just so primitive they're just on a bunch of google sheets a bunch of manual processes dows are supposed to be quite transparent right none of them had single sources of truth um some contributors know what's going on most contributors don't and maybe a few set of operators uh know what's going on and they're spending like weeks on payroll when um in the traditional world payroll is supposed to be payroll's supposed to be something that's relatively easy and when you think about crypto as a payments infrastructure it's a clear 100 000x improvement over the current state so when you have a payment infrastructure that's just supposed to be um late years better than traditional i guess web 2 world but the operations make it so you're spending more time on payroll it just didn't really make sense to us so that's when we decided hey maybe we should dive into this space and see what problems we can explore um that's kind of why utopia is tackling payroll and expense management but really we're just we're just trying to see what interesting problem spaces there are um and find the gaps that are stopping dows from being able to scale into huge organizations or just huge groups in general um yeah that's that's how we started utopia yeah that makes sense and you're bringing the autonomous part of d.a.o which is interesting um i never is it kind of a similar story there with um you know the challenges that you saw kind of actually we actually started back in late 2020 and and i was not a rage back then right so uh we're working with uh you know by economy and fun fact that they're down now but we started because my economy was facing a problem and i was working at bi economy as a blockchain developer so um yeah we were a small team of eight people and even then you know doing um the payments from gnosis safe which is kind of the standard even back then um and then run your payroll and then you know do accounting all of that stuff first was a mess so i built a small hack um at a hackathon back then it all started back then um but we quickly realized we were actually willing for dows uh you know when uniform grants launched and one you you saw um you know com token launch uh with their lm program and then um you saw a bunch of taos explode and we realize we're building a self-custodial solution which is not just for web 3 companies but it's actually folding for dows and since then the product has evolved to meet the needs of taos and that's that's how we started yeah and i guess you know to set context what are some different models of compensation structures that you've seen across styles is it you know looks pretty much similar to traditional models um there are new things new and exciting things that daws are experimenting with of course there's the fiat plus token compensation uh model i'm just curious what have you seen so far i can i can go first um yeah i think right now we're at that stage where um we're trying to build um the first layer which is kind of get the salaries out first right so do a fair compensation um for all the operator for all the contributors in the tower and you know we've seen few ways to to do that i mean um most of it is happening um like a top 10 top-down structure that usually a traditional company might follow uh we've seen few tools like coordinate where it's actually extremely decentralized and um that's kind of other way of achieving this but largely in terms of compensation structure we're kind of uh we kind of lack the tools for incentives you know something like bonuses even bonuses and um you know other benefits that traditional corporation might be able to provide so that's precisely i think uh what um the dow tooling is trying to do with uh with you know utopia and barcelona and all the other that are buildings yeah absolutely i think underboss what on the bob said was absolutely was very correct uh dao compensation models are very top down right now um very traditional yeah your core contributors yeah maybe a set of um contractors all the decisions kind of happen um generally from the top uh which is kind of counterintuitive when you think about governance in a dow where you really want um spread out decision making especially something when it comes to conversation and yeah they're i think it depends on kind of where you are as a dow right dows are a huge spectrum um both from there's two spectrums really that i think of there's a regulatory spectrum spectrum whether you're compliant or not compliant and and you go along that path and then more importantly it's how decentralized you are right um there's lots of dows that are less d are very decentralized and um i would say there's not too many dowels that are ready to centralize and most dials are kind of somewhere in the middle and that's why the structure is still very top down um so some of the problems is how can we build tools to one allow more of these decentralization and autonomy i think coordinates is a fantastic tool for that for payments that and bob brought up um but the kind of thinking about these tools that we can help push dows into decentralization decentralizing more or um operating their operations in a more autonomous way can kind of help us alleviate these problems and come to an end state of dowse that really we dreamed of when everyone wanted to create one yeah but i think it's pretty accurate representation of where we are right now uh as an industry yeah so what i'm hearing is most styles it's essentially not not crowd-sourced in terms of how to structure these compensation models the benefits models it's essentially core contributors deciding how to do it um are they even putting out you know governance proposals do you approve it or just like behind the scenes this is the structure this is what we can offer and then contributors have to kind of go around different doubts choose what works for them what doesn't work for them is there some kind of feedback loop that you've seen or it's pretty much set and done yeah there's definitely feedback loop for sure uh i mean operators have been kind of very considerate of which structure they want to put in place um as jason mentioned there are a handful of mature dolls right so the kind of you know uh doing more of more of the experimentation within um how to allocate to different contributors um you know and and we see that uh you know some dollars uh actually do it better than the others because of their experimentation and the previous results that they've gotten out of it um and just just on that front you know there's not enough experimentation in terms of tower tooling so we kind of talk about there are more dow tools than taos right it's it's all over or all over twitter as we see it but there's definitely not enough experimentation in this regard where you have you know the whole spectrum of uh allocating um compensation but it's either you know extremely decentralized which might or might not work for all taos or it's uh you know top down hierarchical uh that you would see in a traditional corporation yeah hopefully that changes um i guess you know if someone in the audience is considering launching a dao what are some key considerations that they should think about when they are thinking about their payments you know just uh even compensation structures what are maybe to solidify the question are there certain thresholds that you've seen for contributors to get compensated versus you know it's voluntary compensation uh voluntary contribution just how should someone launching a dial think about compensation though the way i i i see it um well when i when it comes to conversation for dows right we i think i think it depends kind of how you um want to operate from the get get-go so we kind of we have this thesis that utopia that [Music] centralization in the beginning sometimes isn't a bad thing because it leads to operational efficiency uh you can make decisions faster especially if you're building something um that is less ambiguous and you kind of need to you know exactly what you need to do and you kind of just need to get it done right you don't really want to have that bottleneck of decentralized decision making and then you can decentralize later right there's a lot there's a lot of products in the crypto space i've done this right for example uniswap was very much so that openc seemed like it was supposed to do that but it hasn't done that um but lots of products kind of start out in this way and decentralize later on um and that's kind of the the thesis that we're trying to do here at utopia as well which i think allows us to kind of build faster versus decentralized autonomous making well on the flip side when you're working on relatively new innovative products and protocols that you kind of want community involvement right so a lot of um there's some products like ohm that starts fully decentralized right from the get go with individual contributions i think you kind of have to weigh that trade-off of where you are what you're trying to build and kind of what works for you do you want to build a community that kind of allows that voluntary contribution um both models have been proven out pretty well i would say the fully decentralized from the get-go model is a bit more ambiguous though it is very closely aligned with the ethos of what your end state is going to be what decentralized autonomous organizations are going to be versus if you go to centralized route sure you might be able to [Music] might be able to get more done if efficiency is your issue um but then you have that ambiguous overlooming question of how the heck do we decentralize later on right um yeah so i apologize for not giving a definitive answer i wish it was that simple where you kind of like the slot um but i think but from what we've seen uh here with talking to the dials we know nothing just fits in a template um in downland right every almost every dow is different in some aspect with regards to each other um i think it's a question that um as we mature as an industry we'll learn more about and be able to answer better uh but right now uh that that's kind of the where where i where my head's at yeah i i would mostly agree with what jason said there is there is no template right so that's kind of the beauty also that you're free to experiment with what you feel like um but at the same time i think um first of all i think it a lot depends on what kind of a dao you are you know investment house are very different from from what you find out versus nft tao um and i think we will start to see specific tower tooling is with kind of types attached to all of these dowels as well um but yeah largely i think i would uh i would be in the section where if there's a decision to be made around compensation and payments in a doubt just aim for operational uh efficiency at the beginning um you know you don't want to you know compromise the product that you might have built uh for the sake of uh you know going decentralized at first there's always room for progressive decentralization yeah so those are valid point and i think operational efficiency is so important given you know that's not necessarily the key focus of a dial right like you want to make sure those processes don't take much of your time and you can focus on the mission of the product that you're building um so in that way you know what are the toolings that are that exist right now to make these things easy what are you building specifically with utopia and parcel to make all of this seamless i guess i'll go first um yeah so at utopia kind of what we're building or what we have right now is primarily we're payroll and expense managing tool what that means is that um any dow or any gnosis safe multisig really can sign up to our platform um manage contributor lists um and create recurring payouts that they set as a time frequency and send out a request link to their communities where the contributors can request for x amount of money from the dow so really just simplifying the payments layer for dows as much as possible to kind of allow them to execute we also do some interesting things on the execution layer mostly around we're trying to make it as easy as possible to execute in a way that's gasless right so you don't have to have gas in your wallet which i think is a poor experience though we're still experimenting with that and also just creating a signing page that just makes more intuitive sense i think one one issue is that signing is a big bottleneck in in dallas right now though it kind of makes sense for decentralization right you got to have multiple people sign off off stuff um though it makes the experience better so we're trying to build tools to kind of like augment and abstract the experience of uh multi-safe multi-stick complexities so that there's a smooth payroll over the next or the short term though really the areas that we're really trying to tackle are around the bookkeeping accounting and sub-dial space so really how do you manage your data organizations how do you tag your transactions and um do proper accounting and then from the accounting how do you create budget so that you can make sure that you're on track uh you can offset autonomy um to smaller groups right like if you can have your marketing team have a hundred dollar budget and make a marketing decision for that hundred dollars or a thousand dollars without having to sign off from the actual multi-safe owner right like you should be able to do that and assign autonomy and sign privileges um and or even create small subtitles or team leads so we're really trying to explore that space really what that means is that the core problem we're tackling is around the coordination layer right the big challenges is um like i said the beginning dials are supposed to be transparent um there needs to be a single source of truth for all the information of a dao and we're trying to kind of be that layer where as a source of truth but also um the more data that we're able to allow dao's to get and allowed and help dao's create the better decisions you can make especially around payroll and um and payments so that you're you're making the right payment decisions and coordination decisions um for doubt operations um but that's kind of our short-term roadmap is really around this coordination layer uh yeah that's utopia yeah and i think you know one thing that komodi that we faced as a challenge is expense management especially because most dollars have treasuries in crypto versus your expenses are in fiat um and there is you know till we reach a world where crypto is accepted most places i think that's still going to be a challenge and each time you make that conversion there's tax liability um so that's definitely been a big pain point just in terms of how do you interact with real world when your treasury is on chain um yeah any thoughts there or yeah an above good timer yeah um yeah i i think so just to just to uh answer what you said i think uh this definitely um you know some friction or you know a lot of friction uh because uh taos are unregulated like there's no playbook for registering a dow right now so that's kind of the biggest bottleneck while you're interacting with um the the other world um yeah i think it's i think some it's something utopia is also trying to solve so kudos to that um i think they're looking to solve for compliance um i think so on on the other front where where we are working at parcel is uh building trying to build more native tooling which is kind of primitive uh from here on so kind of build uh you know on top of gnosis safe uh it's been over nine months since our launch and uh we're aiming to build the payment os for the contributor economy so it's not just dao we're also kind of looking to empower taos um right now um i'm sorry contributors as well so um right now you see um you know taos are the only ones who are kind of looking to scale their operations but on the other side there are contributors who are kind of also struggling to um you know contribute to multiple taos and how they handle um you know incoming payments from each one of them how they are after the off-ramp all of that payments if they wanted to um and we see you know uh the multiple struggles around um you know you receive compensation in native tokens and then it's volatile and we've heard stories of a huge draw down in the native token like 80 percent and uh you realize after six months of contributing to other doubt that you just have ten percent of what what you were actually promised and and that's kind of a problem right you you're not actually um encouraging anybody from the outside to come and come and contribute in a dow which is kind of you know not the promised land so we want to build a more fair and equitable um you know opportunity for all the contributors um and you know decide on the on the product so far that we have built is is around that so we'll be building more primitive tooling to justify a fair and equitable compensation yeah and that's super interesting we've seen a lot of like dueling that has come around for dallas but you know thinking about the contributors that essentially make the style how can we better provide tooling for them and i think it becomes a challenge when you are contributing not you know when you're contributing to a single doubt that's still manageable i think you can still figure out what your payments look like and what work you're doing but the minute you start contributing to multiple doubts that's when it doesn't really scale managing all of that on your own with spreadsheets um and that's where you know tooling like this is super valuable um i think one last question when i asked before i don't know if you have any audience questions that we want to take but um i think generally speaking compensation in the traditional sense goes beyond just salary and payroll there's a lot of other things that aren't you know considered when we talk about compensation benefits specifically to you know health um our retirement funds 401k um but also like equity and investing of equity and investing of tokens in the crypto um have you seen you know tooling around these like other benefits um in in the dow space or we are still too early go ahead on above okay uh cool um yeah so we have not seen much uh we have a few uh primitive tooling that might have come out you know uh but it's it's not really uh adopted like there's no incentive mechanisms right now for contributors right largely like 99 percent of the taos don't have any any kind of incentive mechanisms for for any contributor speed core contributors um and that's kind of a problem right um what that does essentially is is that um you um kind of discourage a lot of people coming from web 2 to contribute to web 3 because it's not really desirable to have uh you know to not have all the benefits that that you're usually very uh you know um able to get very easily right um and and so you know we at parcels are very excited about building primitive tooling on chain uh as opposed to you know doing health benefits uh and and all of this you know building building like x for y in in terms of health uh you know benefits that could be offered i think there could be a lot more built um in the primitive tooling um so westing is you know just one one of the primitive tooling right so there could be multiple types of uh westing in fact that we could offer right so there's a lot of chatters about what kind of investing is is kind of correct for contributors and that could only happen in web 3 right so you you can actually make a different kind of autonomous trustless vesting uh which is which can't be done in in the traditional sense so that's what we're excited about yeah i think oh sorry um i i think investing is definitely a problem that uh can be solved uh much easier than the rest in the web 3 world and in a way that is much better than web 2. um it's interesting i think the way i think about it benefits 401ks and and whatnot there's not many tools out there to help you do that right now it's a bit complicated depending on whether you're a compliant now or not like you have llc right and even then there's not really any one provider that a tool like utopia can integrate or or we can even build we've explored ways to kind of help dao's potentially have benefits um but it's still very early on in that space um and it's really just a problem space that everyone's really exploring right now um i think what anubhav said about incentive mechanisms is quite interesting the way i see it is that there's a there's a there's a demand for talent for a lot of crypto companies right it's incredibly hard to hire people right now um you're really trying to compete um as each individual company to find the best talent i don't see that kind of um race when it comes to taos like i don't doubts don't seem like they're competing against each other for talent right um and maybe because it's still quite early industry maybe they're maybe they're not having any problems at all but when it comes but benefits and 401ks are um an incentive for dows to push to their contributors to get you to work for them right to work for this style um no one does it yet and doesn't seem like it's a competitive landscape but really once those incentive mechanisms are in place um i think we'll see a lot more innovation at that front and it will be tremendous value for any doubt to um to adopt it at um as it will be a great way to get talent but um i i think it's an interesting observation um that i don't really know the uh the reason why so it might be worth digging into if you're looking for uh building your next company or looking into a problem yeah i mean that's scary advice i think this is a hackathon where builders and hackers are listening so um i'm just curious you know one thing you mentioned and we only have a couple minutes here um is this concept that does are not struggling to attract talent and a lot of people are kind of wanting to rather contribute to does regardless of you know these compensation structures being uh primitive um yeah what do you think why why do you think that that is uh even if it's hypothesis um and i think there's a distinction here between contribution for like a couple hours versus working even part-time or full-time um but yeah curious if both of you have any thoughts on why this is this and you can yeah um i mean it's purely a hypothesis um i i don't even know if that statement is true um it's yeah i think it's i i observe that it could be um and and i think there's a couple reasons um [Music] i think the novelty working for dao is um i think not a lot of people first of all know what a doubt is and know how to work for one right so there's a huge education problem first like it's not easy to just put up something on angelus and say work for like olympus dow because how does that really make sense or work ferrari um it's a bit confusing generally the people that are going to work for these dials already know that they want to work for them right so they already have doubts in mind they kind of are deep in the crypto rabbit hole and they um already know kind of what companies they want to work for um then really it's just about how cool is your product right so i think daos are really good at attracting the people that they want to attract their niche right and early on as they're building um they it doesn't seem like there's competition between um multiple doubts because they kind of get different subsets of their demographic right they get people that are really enter into their unique products i think when we have a lot of competing dials downs that are very similar right then then things will change right because we have a lot of companies that are quite similar and yeah then you're competing for talent just broadly like engineers want to work on lots of technical problems so you there's so many when you're trying to hire engineers it becomes an increase um a a huge challenge and shout out shout out to price one of my co-founders that he deals with this challenge all the time um but dao's they're very unique across each other and so they're without those similarities um competition isn't there yet um i think yeah that that's how i see it sorry yeah maybe my two cents there one is uh with daos we are really trying to find you're building these communities that are mission aligned right you really believe in what the dao is building and you want to contribute to it regardless of whether you know how the compensation looks like so that's one and i think what i've seen across the spectrum is they are really great on boarding tools for new people to crypto like to start you know getting your hands dirty by contributing to a dao is is a thing and i think that's why you know when we are seeing this like huge wave of adoption and new folks coming into the space we are seeing a lot of people excited to start contributing to us but i think it's beyond you know the cinema show on boarding stage when we reach maturity it's about how can we retain that talent and how can we keep them further engaged and what incentive structures can we build to really get the doubt to the next level um but yeah thank you boys i think that's that's a great note to end and karthik's here to let us know that our time is over today uh well i came here first to say this was an amazing chat but it just happens to be that we're also at time um so well thank you so much jason and for those amazing answers in muncie for moderating um this was a really good discussion i feel like we need to have another one where we just talk about all the complaints we get for working at daos and how do we solve them from all the tools that all of us are building so uh thanks again for having us for our next panel so the next one is a talk i'm super excited about we want to talk about everything that's happening with memberships and nfts and how we can make working with dallas or just make memberships more collaborative open and just rethink a lot of that so for this talk we have brian flynn from rabbit hole mike dude is from ling style and moderating this will be julian from online protocol and i'll just welcome all of them here on stage and uh without further ado i'll let you all take it from here great to see all of you hello friends hello everyone hey everyone um nice to meet you my name is julian i'm the cn founder at unlock protocol a protocol for membership that uses nft so that panel is pretty much on topic for me uh maybe we'll start with a quick intro as well from mike and brian which one of you two guys want to take it first uh mike you got it first welcome after all right hey mike dudas um so i do two things professionally right now i'm in early stage web 3 investor but you know investing in you know plato and gaming metaverse companies web 3 networks taos and then tooling and infrastructure to support them and in addition uh was a co-founder i'm working on a project called lynx dow which is a membership created golf and leisure club that i'm sure we'll talk about on today's panel so investing and building at the same time brian your turn i'm brian i'm the ceo and founder of rabbit hole um we do web3 onboarding so how people learn across d5000 and nfgs with applied learnings um and right now we're working on on-chain credentials which is kind of real for this conversation so how can we actually use credential gating as opposed to token gating um based on things that you've done on chain so excited to kind of talk about this deeper in the panel absolutely uh well thank you guys for for being here today uh maybe let's start with a pretty pretty i mean we all know what an nfc is right it's a profile picture on twitter correct usually a monkey yes yeah usually right but so so why why are we using nfts for something else what what's the why are you using nfgs for credential brain yeah i think is the most of the way is that nfts are sort of a standard across the space right so um you know famously uh nfts first started as you know blockchain game assets versus the cryptokitties use case and then as it became more standardized across space you start seeing ems names becoming ears 721 you started seeing you know tickets becoming yours into one of course access keys is the 21s um so there's all these different use cases sort of emerging at the same time and so because it's sort of interoperable in many different protocols it's easy to become sterilized as these different use cases emerge so nfts sort of represent these digital assets in a way that can be programmed in many different ways that make sense yeah and they can hold you know obviously richer data than a you know fungible token and so obviously in the context of of dowse and other web 3 projects uh you know an nft gives you more sort of flexibility and power in terms of how it can be used by the holders uh versus a fungible token 100 uh one thing that i would add also is that the idea that an nft is non-fungible is actually more natural like even a lot of the fungible things that we can think of like currencies eventually turn to be sometimes non-fungible like bitcoin painted coins the one that i use for scams for example are very much non-fungible you can try to bring them back on coinbase and you're gonna see how how fungible they are or non-fungible they are uh so i do think that in practice when we think about nfts as just monkeys we're we're seeing the the tip of the iceberg or or the tip of the monkey i guess uh which is which is not the best part of it um but anyway cool so um mike what's uh other examples so you mentioned the linx dao uh obviously golf courses in nature club do you want to tell us a bit more about that yeah so i'll just so basically the concept so yeah basically the the preamble would be that so the term or the acronym dao by definition stands for decentralized autonomous organization uh the reality of what you know including links dow the majority of um organizations that use the the word dao in their name or or brand as such are not you know truly decentralized from the get-go uh nor you know are they autonomous um and you know another organized not very organized either yeah i would say probably more chaotically organized than a traditional organization um but i would argue that that's okay and and that the that it's more about the air quotes dow and i'd love i can't wait to actually debate this with brian but you know the air quotes dow aspect of of what uh again you know nfts and so so basically links down what links dow is and i'll use this as an example to describe what an air quote style is so basically we are a um global community project uh where the promise is we are going to buy a golf course and that goal that's the first objective and then it will be community governed anybody can join from anywhere in the world we would love by the way for it to be community owned but because we did a fundraise of nfts you know without kyc we cannot give folks ownership of the ultimate asset or it would be an unregistered security sale so effectively what we've done um via links dow is we were able to raise money from folks anywhere in the world for a common objective similar to constitution now where you know which was an inspiration and then um via ownership of the nft folks have the ability to govern so in other words they can vote on proposals about what this golf and leisure cub should look like membership rules location you know architect how the money in the treasury that we raise should be spent things of that nature so they have some power now they don't have a legal right however they they're basically an advisory board that um a separate entity link style corporation listens to so it's effectively like having an advisory board and by the way if we don't listen to them and this is very similar to how board api club worked the entire thing falls apart okay because they don't have trust in us as you know the team behind the project to deliver what they want so you know there's sort of this symbiotic relationship between the two and the nfts give people the ability to vote and then the ability to purchase a membership in this club so it's kind of halfway between web two and web three but it's not truly a dow is it basically one nft one vote is that what you're describing yeah there's two classes of nfts one has one nft four votes and this is the beauty of nfts they can hold metadata and they're you know basically more robust than a fungible token um the others have one one vote you know per per holder okay um so you know the goal of what we're doing is we're saying hey true dows are imperfect today and and frankly not realistic for achieving very complex things that require great organization particularly when there's a real world component we're going to sort of straddle the web 2 world and the web 3 world and you know there's valid criticisms of that but that's kind of the approach we've taken to bring sort of new people into space try to educate them and get them involved vote on chain and do exciting stuff like that okay that makes sense brian i want you give it a little bit of description as well as what you call uh credentials as nfts can you tell us more about that yeah sure so very simply there's there are kind of two types of hunting credentials they're sold bound nft sexually non-transport entities and there's verifiable credentials which are about using divs or decentralized identity uh to have cross-chain credentials that could potentially be their off chain or on chain so in our specific case we're using sold down to nfts um and really what that does is saying um it takes a bunch of input data so in our case bunch of on-chain transactions i'm saying hey you've done these three different defy interactions whether it's you know swap on uniswap um lyndon alve um it maybe create a urinary strategy um and say our output is this launching credential that represents that you have sufficient knowledge of d5 um and so that g5 credential then gives you access to either different um you know treasury dials they're looking to try and turn treasury managers or different smart contracts that are looking to see if you have an understanding of risk in some capacity um and so that's a lot of what we do is issuing these credentials from people getting into the space and then working with partners to find these integrations so let me ask you a question if it's on chain why even print i mean create the nft right i guess if it's on chain i could just verify that you indeed you know purchase the thing uh swapped on uni swap or credit strategy why do you have to create another layer uh in the nfc format i guess yeah so it's good for a standardization perspective right saying this is the understanding context of what it means to be certified that you have this understanding of knowledge that is then common throughout all the different web through space that makes a ton of sense and that also means that you could later easily add more criteria uh whatever is like you've bored on compound and you add this uh and so without actually changing certification process let's actually go one further you say it's all bound that in my mind that means that they're not transferable is that correct yep so uh mike what's your take on that like uh are the links that membership transferable uh what happens like for credentialing it makes pretty obvious that transferring it wouldn't make sense because like there's no guarantee that the person on the other side actually did go through a certification but for the links though are these nft transferable yeah so it's um so i love what brian's doing we're small investors and rabbit hole and very very fortunate to be so and to your question i mean it's obviously genius and people identify you know with the nft and the credential and the badge it's just easier we need to be able to translate what's happening on jane into a form that people understand and rabbit hole is doing that brilliantly um with the uh nfts that we have sold and that members own um the idea is that they have to be transferable um because ultimately the uh people this is a club you know people so we believe for for you know the club and and then sort of this you know anyone in the world can join um concept you know people may want to freely leave freely join um you know if they're not transferable and there's you know no market or ability for people to leave and come and leave as they wish um it's extremely limiting um and you know so i'll give an example like we think this is an improvement on existing membership models if you want to join a golf club you know in many uh places today the initiation fees are literally in the 50 000 plus range some into the hundreds of thousands of dollars not accessible people and you lose the money it's money out the door we believe this is an improvement where hey i may want to you know purchase the nfp that's my initiation fee then i join the club for a year or two when i'm done i can then you know sell that to somebody else so there's enduring value uh and yeah that's a novel model that really hasn't existed before um and so you know we believe that tran if you don't have those transfer rights um one it makes it you know certainly a less attractive model to folks and uh and frankly you know we think less valuable in the long run uh for me mike i have a quick question for you on that is there a secondary market right now for memberships or how does liquidity look like yeah so we don't encourage it in other words like our goal here um and people ask us for example the price of you know link style nfts like you'll never see me talking about this you know publicly the goal here is not you know price appreciation through talking about it so yes there's a secondary market we don't link to it from our um you know twitter from our website our goal is not to have people resell these and frankly we have i think fewer than 200 out of now 9090 listed and we're delighted and we have 5 300 unique holders we actually want that to raise we want it to be as close to one to one as possible um that's the mission you know you mean um this isn't like uh you know a pfp project where we want people flipping and you make tons of money on secondary royalties i think that's where the membership model moves and as we start to get things you know like this pool suite club and these different membership clubs but the onus is on us to deliver value and our members don't yeah they're they're on us every day if we try to do things that are non-core that don't tie to delivering a golf course these people aren't here this is what's cool about these membership and utility-based nfcs you know they're not here for the flashy stuff and if you're in our discord they complain like heck if we're spending money that's not targeted on what they believe that they purchased so what's interesting here uh just to rephrase what you both said is like basically nfts as you said like if you think about the profile picture on twitter kind of pointless but here you have two types of nfcs one that are transferable the one that mike does for the dow for the links dial and then some that are not transferable some that are purchasable i assume the nfcs from the links that were purchasable the credentials i hope they're not purchasable i cannot show up with a ton of money and say hey give me the credential even though i've never done these things so we already have a distinction here there's another kind of interesting aspect some nfts have expiration dates and that's specifically the case for unlocked is that one of these two i mean and the purpose here is obviously say a certification might be just time limited if you're thinking about like you know a doctor you need to uh you know get re-licensed every two years or every five years or even a driving driver license like it's a certification that they can drive the car you have to renew every five years is that something that you guys are doing brian i'll go quick because i think brian's answer will be longer so in our case what we will offer to folks is a very low-priced highly accessible perks pass that will expire i believe there's a new ethereum token standard that will allow for sort of expiring tokens on a certain time duration so we'll offer those for sale they'll expire after 12 months you can then repurchase um and that perks pass gives you those benefits for that period of time yeah okay and then i think because because the rent the one now that you have in the exam are forever it's like it's a so exactly they're the genesis passes that give you membership golden key okay cool brian uh time bound yeah so in our case um you know similar to how a lawyer needs to upkeep their credential every single number of years uh we need to upkeep or d5 13 dial credentials every few months right so the the content underneath the credential is going to change periodically and that is then voted upon by the community so say a protocol gets upgrade from v2 to v3 which just happened with ave or say there's a new protocol that teaches some underlying skill better um there is a need to kind of rotate out the underlying content or on-chain tasks that are associated with the credential and so every so often you'll need to get a new credential represents that you know the latest knowledge um sort of what's happening a new one can i lose my old one is it technically like is it taken from my wallet if i basically don't have the it's a new one okay okay so basically i have the first certification and then okay now you've got the v2 certification that includes ib3 okay that's very good let's talk about blockchains uh obviously most nfts are inside of the let's say ethereum ecosystem or evma custom even though most of them are on on mainnet is that the case for both of your stuff or are you guys considering other blockchain other avm ecosystems yeah uh yeah ours is just ethereum because we believe that for credits to be valuable they need to be on the most decentralized change theory okay what about the links though yeah and so ours it was much more more of a capitalistic okay we need the funds to actually achieve what we're going after and the money is on ethereum we didn't feel like we could raise the money necessary to accomplish our objective if we had done it on a different chain in january of this year it just we didn't think the money was there on solana and avalanche and others to do a raise that was as successful as ours was okay but i guess thinking about the future when you said you're you're going to have this uh kind of perfect is that is that something that you would consider at that point like okay cool we would so if if the fees are in the rate like so let's just say that the perks pass is a hundred hundred and fifty dollar um you know chain you the the uh sorry purchase and the the consumer base who's purchasing it perhaps you know they're not concerned like these aren't because you're doing on-chain activities and things of that nature if the past let's just say is 150 bucks and it would cost you know 15 to 30 dollars to mint it on ethereum that would be a difficult decision we'd have to look for polygon um but other you know other than that you know my my preference would be to continue to keep all these issues you know ethereum that makes sense cool maybe another question which i think is uh a fun one uh around privacy so i guess in the context of credentials there's no such thing as privacy like i mean i i want people to know that i'm certified what are you thinking about this in the in the links dao like do i really want everyone uh to know that i'm a member of the links down i mean or yeah it's a great question so uh the it's pretty challenging and so one thing i actually joke tweeted about it you know the other day was i did the michael jordan meme where i was like you know somebody voted against my dad proposal and i took it personally but the point is like you can basically see the addresses and how they're voting on different proposals um yeah i don't think that's an ideal situation so we're obviously gonna have to move to like zk roll ups for how these votes are conducted so that people can't i don't think in the long run it's really good to see how individuals voted on um you know very very personal issues that relate to money and participation um so yeah the other option is hey you look to an entirely different chain you have something like secret that is privacy by default nfts um you know but but for now i think uh it's a problem that you know how people vote on every single thing is visible to everybody by default absolutely that makes a ton of sense uh brian appointment privacy yeah in our case um it's definitely an issue that you can see holdings and assets of a user along with their credentials in an ideal case you would just see credentials and not just kind of shield wall balances so uh i think definitely in the future we're looking towards moving towards more of a zero knowledge system where you can just um show up to stations that you've done specific things on chain without revealing uh your address your private keys yeah exactly um so i think the technology is still sort of evolving um on that front um there's also it's sort of interesting how dids can solve something very similar we could just have it did reveal certain um private information around certain user without also reeling that the address is itself so i guess there will be a few limitations but we'll get to see how that kind of evolves that makes sense maybe another opening question like thinking about uh the nfc space so uh i i don't know about you guys but i still use metamask in my in my my web browser i think 30 million of us do metamask still doesn't have like native support for nfgs on on on the extension what are we missing in the space to make nfc is much easier to use uh by you know normals normies as they say one of you want to take that on maybe brian oh yeah okay um yeah i think in terms of like making nfts easier to use i don't think it comes down to the wall itself i think it actually comes down to utility use cases themselves that's right like i don't think it's up to the wallets to decide like how these empties become used i've seen some different um i've seen some projects working on sort of being able to aggregate action items of nfd so if there's you know there's like eight different use cases of one specific nft whether it's you know nouns or board apes or something because they're infinitely programmable be able to aggregate those all in one place um it sort of remains to be seen how easy it is to kind of curate and create information to kind of create those different user experiences but i think once we have something like that it would be as simple as you know based off the nfts you have in your wallet here's the 15 different things you can start doing with it um and it might take a while to get there but i think that ends up being the end state yeah two things that i would say one would be uh you know sort of delegation to your own wallets of the capabilities of the nfts that you don't want to have interacting with smart contracts on a regular basis you know i don't want like my you know i don't want to have to every time i do a link style vote basically you know put my entire wallet at risk so that makes it complex and you have to put your assets in different places we need to solve that um just to clarify for people you would own technically own the nfc on a hardworking or something very highly secure and yet have delegated the rights associated with the owning that nft to some hot wallet that allows you to vote or do things like this exactly exactly i will have signed and delegated to that wallet that you know theoretically i own or if i want to know okay and then another would be you know just getting it getting it to a point where it's easy enough to get from centralized exchanges to metamask or other wallets in less than five days so people can actually purchase and interact with the things that the cryptocurrencies more than dnf itself like allow people to easily go on board okay so one thing that we do at unlock i'm gonna i'm gonna shield unlock here a little bit obviously is that we have credit card support so we allow people to purchase uh nft memberships with great cards we did this actually for icc in paris the conference that's selling their tickets to unlock as as tickets and one of the cool things that we did also do you think is actually a good question to for you guys as well is like there's been a bunch of people that are trying to buy tickets uh and we sell them on security markets and we mentioned security markets earlier we had to build in into to build uh so in the contract to build in the uh concept of the cap chat to make sure that bots are not able to buy uh tickets at in scale and then we sell them which is kind of a painful thing in some some of the stuff that we're pretty proud of cool and then i think two other things would just be more easily readable signature messages yeah and you know it's really even challenging for me and then messaging i love what like other scans starting to do disclosure it's a portfolio company but you know with wall-to-wall messaging as xmtp like there's some interesting things happening in terms of wallet messaging that will make it easier and more fluid for people to uh use their nfts and communicate with one another absolutely that makes a ton of sense uh so these are all very good points about nfts what are memberships or is there any membership in the you know in the in the physical world i say or in the pre-nft world that shouldn't be an nft is there one at least you think i was like no no this would be a bad idea to get in and if you can you think of one or no they shouldn't be in it yeah i mean for membership specifically when it comes down to um the individuals of individuals talent or ability uh those are the things that shouldn't be nfts because it doesn't matter about you know sort of their their net worth it's the case but more so them as an individual um mike actually you might have some thoughts on this but i'd be curious how you know in some uh membership clubs they do a bunch of interviews you know to figure out what type of person you are if you kind of just exclusively especially very exclusive ones yeah so like how would in ling style case you just buy a membership to be part of it like is there usually that kind of bypasses the interview process so yes yes so um i think we've punted like down the road some of the complexity of what you're talking about with real world memberships like you know in a utopian world and the way that we've presented it anybody has access but clearly before you join uh a link style physical club there has to be an element of doxing of to some extent and and safety is is is paramount we can't have like you know criminals like walking around the golf course so we definitely have some dicey things that we're going to be working through over the next nine months before the club opens so um yeah i would think that you know things that involve to your point like background checks are essential you know like uh but couldn't these be nfcs as well like in some way i mean i know there's a ton of companies i know for sure we're just not there yet yeah yeah yeah i love like the you know clean background check credential and that should be easily done and you know the great credit score credential yeah that completely done but yeah it just hasn't happened and the benefit of this is like now it becomes composable you can actually easily say hey my legs down nfg is only working if i am you know uh wearing a tux and wearing a tux is an nfc itself uh in some world yeah and so anyway like i would say you know there's no rush like to the original question to turn traditional membership clubs into nft clubs like let's be honest like even us like we haven't bought the golf course yet like nobody's actually delivered on the utility that we're promising i feel like there's some really i mean i would say fwb's has they've been around longer they've had great events they're ultimately sorry yeah if cc has using i mean tickets as nfcs as memberships that's the thing right like you at some point you could unlock for even harder like some of these nft tickets like i couldn't even figure out how to get into the damn thing so yeah it's a lot of stuff doesn't work yet yeah but i mean it doesn't work for everyone for sure but it does work in practice like that's been delivered like it's not you know when you say the golf courses and bought like yes but the tickets to the conference the conference did happen and was that right right right right right there have been bad executions it's still nice it's still it's still uh it's still tricky and and not as clean as it could be but yes for sure it's it's some of them actually already exist and i mean brian's credentials are real like it's not like there's no you know um it's not it's it's real i guess can we uh touch on the token gating element of fwb uh so i think there's an interesting um debate to be had whether the token gating aspect of fundable tokens versus nft gating identities make more sense um you probably have thoughts on this yeah so i mean the token gating one is really so a couple things one token governance is difficult because it separates the actual nft holder from the you know token holder could just be a trader or a whale um the challenge with fungible token gating to events is that you know the price is really volatile and rise like it just it's not perfect you know what you mean so there's a lot of problems that haven't been solved with um you know event-based and membership-based fungible token gating um so you know i i that's why we chose not to do it at this point frankly yeah and i mean these problems actually existing in people's like if you go to a very popular concert the tickets are all being sold in five minutes whether they're nfc or not uh you have the same private scalpers that are you know buying them and selling them at the door it's it's these problems are are not what you're we're not invented by nfcs i think one of the things that a lot of criticisms that happened in the lt space right now our program that existed before that are just obvious with nfts uh and maybe actually have a better way of being solved in that scenario it feels like uh this calpers issue on tickets is something that has existed for like you know as long as tickets have existed at this point uh and with nfts we actually have ways to say hey using linking credentials like hey okay you want to buy the ticket to uh you know uh uh whoever is the latest singer of the moment uh you can only do that if you have their nft to their to unlock their music over the last six months and so that's a way to ensure that only fans are actually buying the tickets and not just uh rendo's pcp so i think the big things that shouldn't exist like a traditional fan club where i'm just putting a little bit like so so the problem with selling nfts for memberships is that they're forever right and i just think you're going to see a lot of people in most cases today the promise is you're buying the thing it's forever some your you've paid x and someday somebody else is transferable to we talked about the fact that we'll have you know subscription-based and mentioned yeah but like today i think there's a lot of people issuing nfts for their metaverse world and they're this and that who do not realize the obligation of like look i'm gonna have this fan base that you know in this community put money in that's going to just expect literal that they're owners and not just customers but like owners that expect delivery of some service forever a lot of people are going to run into trouble with that in my mind over the next couple years 100 i think that's one of the big challenges around nfc there's like a lot of the misconception and kind of the the implicit lies i'd say of stuff that was hey this is the way it works like in practice i mean i'm sure these things 10 years from now most of them will actually not honor any of the things that they said they would do or any of these road maps in that scenario yeah and i think it will be interesting to see how do you how do you basically delineate a rug from something that just sort of ran its course and people got the value and i don't think people's minds are aligned against the thing that these are you know maybe some of them are depreciating out you have depressed absolutely things yeah yes absolutely so we have a few minutes left uh brian one uh oh maybe not even that i see kartik one of the car takes is coming uh i think arctic wants hot takes here i mean i would have loved to get more hotter takes um well i guess my only question would just be obviously there's a couple of themes here which is uh i think this topic here itself is covering in a way that the blend of webtoon what three side of experiences like we know how memberships work we know like what my credit card parks look like and i know i have different tiers based on what access i can get so i guess i'm what i'm curious about is um from all the anywhere from comments or feedback you've gone from your members or just things that you see have the potential of kind of getting better is is kind of the output here like a better way to think about memberships or is the output here that now we can just make it more free and open and make it more composable like i'd love to be able to say if you're part of these other memberships you can now get access to this or priority access to something else is that how you think about how you feel like memberships will evolve or um i definitely agree with that i think the free and openness and the programmability in some way i think both of you alluded to this earlier is the idea that hey if i know that a membership exists i can leverage it even if i have nothing to do with it basically so yes i can give access to some content to my on my site because they are certified by by rabbit hole without actually asking rabbit holes permission to do that or i can give access to my ski club to the people of the links dial without any agreement with the links dial people and so to me that's actually a very powerful thing that uh we're going to be able to see more and more of that actually exists in the real world i think the triple a membership i i recently learned that most restaurant that offered aaa discounts actually have nothing to do with triple a really poor version of that would like you get to transfer air miles with a massive hit on the actual output but yes absolutely absolutely right yeah exactly so it's kind of interesting that permission lesson that decentralization in in in that world enables a lot of different new patterns and use cases that i think we're going to see emerge uh i mean we've already started to see emerge uh to mike's point in a in a say a rough ray i'd say but um that's coming and that's pretty exciting to see yeah i would just say tradition like typical like partnerships you're working they're harder to execute in a dow environment for us because like how do you coordinate all these people who approves this stuff like it's really freaking hard um and you're so focused on just reining in and managing and making decisions together so i think right now we're not that composable phase so you know i think to julian's point it's like you know if somebody wants to airdrop stuff to our holders or do partnerships and offer them you know go do it it's just we're not going to say no but it's hard for us to keep involved and do it practically you can't say no that's actually the best part of it exactly exactly i want to give a final little shout to all of these people here uh at the bottom of my screen these are my members i've got my own little membership uh if you join my blog it's five dollar a year don't need to buy you can just go on the blog and see how you can earn it uh but i actually bring them with me on every single of my calls and so they were here these are all of the little icons that are there i think one of you might be in there i don't know what i don't tell you yeah amazing all right well thank you all really appreciate the time thanks for the insight ryan thank you so much thanks everyone bye-bye all right with that we are ready for our next talk and this one is all about governance and participation of course this is a whole event around how do we make it easy for us to uh contribute to and manage dials at different scales so there's a lot of people working on tooling for the hackathon but there's a lot of other aspects to this thing whether they're social or purely technical and we're gonna have an amazing chat about all these things here so with that i want to welcome evan will kylo and dan to kind of take over here and dan will be the one moderating this thing so i'll let dan introduce himself and then um get us started with the rest of our speakers so welcome hello welcome welcome all right um excited for the chat today can everyone hear me mic check good we're all good so quick intros um we've got a great panel today we've got kaido who is he does research he researches incentive design at llama um he does a bunch of things i mean tokenomics with video and lab dow redelegation at interchain which i actually don't know what that means but it sounds interesting um and just like a generally like a gigabrain writer so welcome kaido we've got ivan who's um he works at gearbox protocol composable leverage protocol welcome ivan nice to have you and then will who's a founding member at developer dao um and i am dan i'm a product manager at orca protocol so welcome gents thank you here awesome so the conversation today is governance and participation we're going to chat about governance we're going to chat about participation um i would love to just start off with defining governance super quick so i'll actually start with will um you know what what does governance mean to you and maybe a little more tactically and contextually like given your experience and developer down like what what does it mean yeah absolutely um yeah appreciate being here thanks for eat global and everything um everybody that's put this on so yeah governance man what a topic right it's like if you search like defined governance it says like the act of governing and you're like okay cool this is this is awesome but no you know the way i think about it is um you know establishing and enforcing rules um for protocols and or social groups to um follow and so really you know at the end of the day it's an attempt to coordinate whether it's efforts or financial assets or whatever it is um you know that's that's really how i think about governance and um yes a question about developer dow so little context developer dow is a social service dow where our goals our mission is really to enable a new wave of web 3 developers and to build public goods and so um you know really for us right now as we're beginning to build out public goods so much of our activity is social activity and so um with that our you know the the the issues and governance we're having right now is how to enable activity from participation get people involved build reward mechanisms and incentive mechanisms that incentivize the correct behavior and so um really kind of that's what we're focused on today and i'm excited to talk more about that and then also talk more about uh governance of existing protocols and in kind of the d5 space and some of the other topics we have on the agenda today nice i love that um so speaking of incentives kaido i know you do a lot of research here so like where do you even begin when you think about how to incentivize contributors within daos to kind of drive governance forward like what's a framework that folks can use to kind of think about how to incentivize who to incentivize what types of actions to incentivize like where do you start with that kaido yeah i think that's a great question and first of all is you know hello everybody hideo yeah i'll give my honest answer i don't think there's a framework uh we're all i think crossing the river while trying to find where the next lending step is but i think there are a few questions on incentive which is like we talk a lot about like incentivizing contributors i think what what is going on on top of will's point i think it's also responsibility it's also very important as in so that means if something goes wrong someone has to answer for it and i think this uh lack of responsibility it's it's it's also a problem i would say it's also sort of in the incentive design you cannot just have positive incentive design you also need some kind of like slashing mechanism per se so i think uh generally you can start with you know those two buckets i think when somebody does something good and that's based on the protocol you're thinking about something happens right that's not a positive incentive a negative incentive if something goes wrong you know who's there to answer you know something about like no matter slashing it or it's like do you resign these different mechanisms so i think once you start there then you can optimize protocol by protocol but for example for a default protocol then there's a lot of a positive incentive for example like you have to write proposals you had to do uh risk parameter adjustments you had to study the protocols that you know being proposed et cetera et cetera and on the negative side as well i think that's uh currently not really thought of at this point and for a social token project right it's it's completely different another dynamic sometimes you know these people come and go so do you want to incentivize long-term behavior or do you want to incentivize short-term behavior how do you reflect in your payment or even messaging to the community and those are very also very different and just to give a quick example there's a very interesting organizational design or incentive structure called the orbit model this is more on the open source side it's not strictly to blockchain i think basically i think community or community development in a linear fashion but in this linear fashion the size of community grew and drops and therefore your incentive shouldn't stay flat right so you should adjust accordingly to this kind of outside forces and how do we think about that and implement that into the into the real world would be will be very interesting i'll leave it there i can't go on too long on this no we'll get more spicy takes um so speaking of like incentivizing people ivan i know gearbox protocol you guys have just gone through a process of like the whole claim and delegation process for um i guess the dow that you're starting so could you talk a little bit about like the stage of where gearbox protocol is and kind of why why delegation why now and what kind of you hope to see from your delegates yeah so the current delegation is just the thing that was actually from the past when the dao basically started during christmas and there were a few different stages so the way we approached is with different user bases essentially some of the testers some were active participants back when there was nothing promised uh of course filtering for bots and a few other stages and it simply happened that a couple of those while we were basically doing other actual protocol work we didn't do it so it's let's say this is just why it happened now is because we didn't do it then so it's not like it's not part of the design per se part of the design was making a token non-transferable that ribbon has done before that element will have now and other protocols so making token non-transferable basically allows you to already give incentives to contributors and those who work without creating the those early discussions which are sometimes damaging to the community whereas some of the when listening when other kind of chats they're not wrong to ask it's just that when you're starting out you don't want to have that much pollution because the more noise you have the more quality contributors will be kind of not willing to participate in that discourse right so that you could call part of design that one we've been happy with so far um nice um what do you hope to see from the delegates for gearbox protocol and is the delegate are there other roles that'll play um they'll kind of be active in your governance besides delegates good point so our governance is for now just snapshot so it's off chain nothing too fancy uh let's say it's not governed alpha yet with a few groups or committees so it's very like mellowed down for now because protocol is early enough and that's what most protocols do it's a fine thing seems to be nowadays especially in d5 um for now the delegates suggest that we have like a two percent total supply quarrel whereas of course the dow usually has 50 right so if you're talking about circulation that's like 25 or so so the quorum is not too low and in case you want to push some things let's say apathy and governance is a thing that probably will never go away anywhere you can try to manage incentives but it will always be like it won't go like this right it will likely stay like flat and go down so uh it's i don't consider it cool that if you push like for small proposals every week or so it just governs the illusion people constantly like okay what are we gonna wear today what are we gonna eat for lunch you know this kind of thing completely kills the attention of people uh so delegates are there to just make pushing quorum easier uh and of course those delegates are the only ones working and if we are talking about more broadly about governance and inclusion and making everybody participate uh once you really look at how many people in a given dow whatever its sizes are working you will always be like let's say a small dial within 10 right a bigger dial maybe 50 at best right the others are just discussing and talking so it's not that you have to optimize the words really making those people vote it's just that the system should be open for them to enter for them to participate there has to be accountability but you shouldn't like make the system i think where you're cramped essentially for moving forward so it still has to be pretty let's say standard and uh movable basically instead of having too many complexities yeah i'm going to keep digging with you a little more because i want to i want to get some sp we'll get some spice here so for your delegates what sort of participation do you expect from them right if they are supposed to represent the average token holder and kind of amplify the voices of individuals like how do you make sure that they're incentivized how do you hold them accountable what sort of participation participation do you expect because we've seen in the past that delegating in itself is not the solution like there's other mechanisms right to kind of make delegation work so curious how you think about like making sure delegation works for you guys great point so i always try to stick to a rule that in any community or let's say and you work for there is always 90 percent of people just doing kind of jack sorry for the war just doing nothing and just saying blah blah nine percent are like involved but they're like not 24 7 right they do things they're cool they're around they want incentives perfectly fine and the one percent at the devs and people who really work and don't sleep and like work on weekends it's a fine split you if you try to change it i don't think you will really change the numbers that much but it is important that every every group is felt let's say their own place in a community right you don't want to alleviate any one alienate sorry any one of them so for the 90 they just have fun posting stickers means discussing something and just being genuine community that i think applies everywhere in gearbox as well um nine percent uh and the one percent that's where the split is so that's why the difference is between actually a working contributor member and the one that jumps in and out sometimes so i would say delegates in any community in most communities i'm very much generalized so happy to hear some fighting back you know uh but let's say the nine percent are the ones who would perfect the role for delegates because they don't do 24 7 work that they are yet they are on top of things so that's a great group and the one percent i would say the devs and people who actually work so our delegation so far showed that because that one percent is the most active in communities and delivers the most people actually get delegate to them the most right uh in which case without even forcing some form of a committee being responsible people delegated to a committee so without like putting boundaries in place that ended up being centralized in that way which it would have been anyway if we made like synthetic style committees which are like rolling or with element structure it it's more or less the same of course broadly speaking um yeah so delegates we thought of doing some incentives for them and then we looked at how many possible delegates do it could be and as soon as you announce some incentives for delegates even if you make it as such that they have to make some forum posts what you're going to get air drop hunters are going to make dummy posts saying i'm all for the great future and things like that so not a good idea um if you say you have to participate in at least 80 percent of the votes well people are just going to be dummy clicking on snapshot which doesn't really result in much so probably when incentivizing like this social positive behavior honestly i think the best one i've seen work so far is where a poor team or dao or structure they have like good intentions and good faith essentially and it's a retroactive distribution after some time so you can do periodic retroactive distribution like for example optimism does and that way you're less likely to be gained at least that's the one i've seen work the most so far in other doubts as well again very much generalized happy to hear what you guys disagree with well yeah i was going to say i don't think i'm going to disagree with much um because like you said you know you kind of described the power law distribution right of activities where most people aren't going to contribute and so um the thing i would say is especially for somebody who's listening that might be participating in the hackathon or something like that is build tools that like let us continue to experiment with these things because um you know it gets back to the incentive problem just like you said it's difficult to incentivize exactly what we want right it's like it's it's tough to say you know we want good delegates that act in good faith for the doubt but then it's like if you get pressed to define that it gets it gets harder to define it and so you can't put it in rules that lead to that action being incentivized um in a objective way and so um at the end of the day we've got to continue to experiment with different things and um one of the things too that i think about a lot is from a dao standpoint dao is such a generic term and i think it's the right term to be using right now and i think all of the things we're doing in the ecosystem to kind of start at that base level is um that's that's where the activity should be but um did their a conflict arises between um a like an open standard that a dow could you know kind of tweak to their needs and like turn key solutions that are very rigid and so um i've i've just felt that as well where when we've been starting the social service down um it you know we can't really copy and paste from a financial protocol doubt right because then we end up with these incident mechanisms that don't make any sense for a social doubt and so um i just i'm really excited about tool sets out there that let experimentation happen or um like vertical focus dial tooling that's either you know for this vertical or for that vertical i think that's going to help the space a lot nicer so that's the question yeah go for it why am i interrupting uh speaking of the tooling uh what are the things actually you would recommend i feel free to shield if you invested in many if that's allowed i'm just curious like what to lean you guys since you've been in dallas for a long time and you summoned a few what tuning have you been comfortable with i'm just like personally not a fan of learning new platforms so even if it helps let's say down the line just feel like vendor locking into something is a very big thing but maybe i'm just being boomer about it you know so here is like what dow julian you have found to be helpful apart from a discord board deleting gm messages somebody want to take that first yeah i'll i'll take a i'll spice it up so i think dow tooling it's should start incremental stuff is stand up instead of thinking about grand grand things i think it's you you build incrementally and then you reach a point of infect inflection and then you you be a lot of people start using it uh just a quick example like one of the most important tools right now i think a lot of dallas is funny enough if we forget about discord it's actually collab land um i would say that's the most important dow tooling thing out there right but but it's such a small thing but if without it right all the token gated communities all the things you you want to uh essentially have membership it's is all out of the window so i think i think for hackathons and also for like founders thinking about it i think is start incrementally and build these really seemingly basic ideas and the other thing i want to point out on dell tooling which i personally believe it's it's not it's less of a technical challenge but more of a product challenge or design challenge because like like we use twitter slack discord telegram signal messenger imessage to chat with crypto people it's very cumbersome in this way so we already our mental share of like understanding new apps is probably already maxed out so how do you build easy to understand designs to incorporate different people and right we would talk about the power lab distribution is there a way in the future where you could build something as simple as a discord plug-in even right so you can you know allow people to participate much easier and even understand the pro protocol much easier or even understand the proposals much easier understand the background of different delegates uh easier i mean those are incremental steps i think it's really worth the exploring in the in the tooling space yeah i like that yeah and back to your question just real quick um you know like quarter nape is an obvious one um but even then it goes to highlights highlight the um example of like you you need to understand how a tool is designed to be used because one of the areas that developer dao has messed up in the beginning is running the biggest two-day coordinate circle that's ever existed and that's not like an achievement that we're like thrilled about because there's lots of issues with that and so um so yeah i think i think like we said just really finding ways to to um solve those basic problems like like i was mentioning in without adding a ton of um technical debt or user experience debt into your dow is something that um is is where you're like okay this is a win-win like collab land easy to set up easy to understand massive value delivered to your dow members um as they get access into this token gated community awesome um we are actually coming up on time believe it or not so i i want to ask a question for the group and whoever has the spiciest take can go first but what is the future of token voting within dows and protocols what is the future there is one or not you try since you go yeah do it go first of the mind um it probably it could go away but it depends on where the money will end up so the token voting is there if you strip away talking voting into some uh i don't know uh committee enfts right or some other thing you that means that people won't be buying the tokens since the value if you're talking value mostly is governance then it's essentially stripped away and now token is also used as inflation to make the positive feedback loop right in many protocols uh even within the t1 so you need to add back from the supply from the demand side so you can't really strip that away if you find a way to make the value appear somewhere else well if you go back to equity and then equity goes into nfts you go back to the old model but could be fine as well um so it depends on how the money will flow really uh for now uh people complain a lot about the uh decentralization sort of centralization of token voting right but i don't think in any semi-democratic systems it was ever really different if you split it not into token voting or something else there will be just other ways to essentially control larger groups of people even if you make it like most civil resistance somehow so i don't see much need in it it's more so that what is lacking is really quality participation and producing some good products good tech and other things um rather than splitting it away from the control there because you it's a so far let's say at least the ethos we took maybe slightly cynical i'm slightly cynical you might have thought that a bit uh it's more so that i feel the system should be open and you can go to discord chat 7 and you can make many of them they should be open but it doesn't mean you have to open the chats into everybody in the contributed chats right but save developers are chatting in there everybody can see what's happening everybody can voice an opinion or say something is bad or something like that but it doesn't mean they will be jumping into the same chat and sharing like i don't know gives them there to like completely disturb the workforce the same way with governance like you can engage in token voting like that a bit more um and yeah end of the day even if you split the governance really well it's based on the ethos of the ex-corps members or the current co-members because if they don't mean well they'll probably push for some proposals which are not even that good uh and sorry and that's not a discussion where large is essentially being used for uh pain retainers right when the protocol gets to a stage when it's large enough what's the best incentive there nobody knows how to go to nx anymore after that so they secure a nice x1 monthly payment but that's another thing sorry for jumping into that no all right oh good good kaido i want to hear from you on this yeah i i think one thing i thought a lot about it's i think go back goes back to evan's point which is it's somewhat similar to the current system with token voting but i think with one major issue so uh the main major issue is let's say if a protocol becomes big enough in the future which we hope it will that it's become sort of like a public good kind of thing where like infrastructure level stuff that means if someone has less money than another person that you know the person who has less money will never be able to voice his opinion if they like if they're they're on the other the two sides of the same coin and that's not the case in in the traditional world per se so if you because right now um i think we're trying to use the the governance model for companies to use on these like really infrastructure layered protocols such as you know curve compound ave right if you want to digitize the entire world right those are very fundamental um stuff so i think that's the worry i have on that and you can see that sort of playing out in the in the current landscape where you know just three projects can get together and kind of dictate a large chunk of like you know base layer projects in uh emission going where and you know achieving their own agenda in some way i think when this is a kind of model i think when it's going good it's going great right but but if some disagreement happens or someone um even maybe not like trying to do malicious things just like their their their idea may not be you know really well thought off then it has you can have like really catastrophic failure mode introduce the entire system yeah so that's kind of my thinking on token is uh token gated i actually on voting i think probably the most thing i like the most is probably some sort of token voting and also you have the optimistic approval um this shout out to dan's orca design like the different pods and with uh with veto power across i think those are it's a lot more interesting where goes back to ivan's point right you don't let your token voters vote on a project like every two days on proposal that's just like not possible you do it in optimistic way that you let it pass but if there's some major disagreement you can't people can still shut it down thanks yeah yeah and thanks for the shell um i'll just kill this kaido's not an investor in orca but we appreciate that um will curious because i don't think developer dao you guys don't have a token you have nfts so like we're working on how you're managing that yeah yeah absolutely we're working on a uh non-financial governance token and so that's going to be coming out in the the next kind of 60 days and one of the things you know we always think about is um you know like how separating incentive from uh governing power and fi uh financial compensation like are there are we developing protocols that generate revenues that we can then distribute out to contributors um in addition to um governing power inside of the dow is that something we can do how can we closer sync the activity that's happening to um the incentive reward so like retroactive um incentives are safe but they um basically it's like hey come and work with us you don't have a boss and we have a plan to have five thousand people vote to reward you in 60 to 180 days isn't like the best pitch to get a ton of activity and so how do we shorten that time period and better sync activity together um and so those are things that we're thinking about to your original question i'm optimistic that um we're going to continue to find ways to um use things like the the the pods and smaller groups of um like decentralized smaller groups that build up into the larger dow whether it's subdials or whatever whatever we want to call it pods yes we'll use bots and so that is like that's something that i am um like i said super optimistic about it because i think the reality is um the the other side of that coin is a world in where um you know we get centralized meta governance happening that instead of a centralized web 2 company controlling power it's in the hands of of um pretty massive um kind of meta governance plays and so and the the last thing i'll say there is i always ask myself and try to ask other people too is um you know like what are my assumptions here as far as um the the questions i'm asking so like is that a bad thing on the financial protocols and um is total total um tokens used in in government governance proposals is that really the metric we should be shooting for um and so those are just questions that i hope other people continue to ask um and i'll probably jump in and have the spiciest uh thing it's i really like bayc's uh governance world map i think you start with mt you have more nft and then you have a token i think thinking from like a community dilution standpoint branding and also like just retaining talent i think that's something even more than you know um uh more than you know just ft projects could use yeah if you tell me six months ago i would be liking the osc's governance yeah damn i wasn't ready for that i think that's more food for thought for everybody as well must have been a fat air drop sir yeah exactly um we're getting close on time so just to recap you know we've talked about what is governance incentive design dow tooling token voting um kaido shilling board apes to us and yeah maybe we just end with like with everyone like what's what are you excited about with your specific kind of protocol or dow or projects you're working on maybe start with ivan um finally raising the limits on the accounts and the tbo that's probably how those went into votes and now thanks delegates for pushing forward like two hours or something so it is working uh well let's see how it works in a few weeks but yeah and then after that probably looking forward to it global actually in amsterdam so very much looking forward to it uh and after that v2 so essentially a lot of things to do a lot of products to build and hope uh you guys if you use them you won't be liquidated direct too soon we will yeah um excited for our governor's token launch and pretty aggressively um trying new things and sharing that with the community and and kind of seeing what happens nice kaido yeah yeah i'm interested in uh decentralized science science funding so like bitcoin i think their governance model how it relates into the entire ethos and how do we spread that ethos and incorporate into different other projects i think would be really really interesting very sweet i'll i'll uh i'll do the honors and ask dan um what about you dan what are you looking forward to oh thanks i'm gonna chill show so worker protocols and private beta and we are hoping to get to a public beta in the next two to three months so basically opening up access to more dows get them on boarded and get the pods going sub-dials working groups appreciate it i think uh by the way this was a this is an amazing discussion i think the uh the one thing i'm just sort of as an observer is hearing all of you say is but i'm kind of understanding is that looks like we're in a position where we're basically saying that we want to just experiment with the same primitives that exist with the abstractions rather uh which is proxy voting delegation doing things at scale and hierarchy that's what comes with it but i think there's like a better solution with the technologies we have now to be able to do that faster or just more efficiently or measure that in a smaller feedback loop so um i don't know what the answers are i think all of us are figuring this out in real time but at least there's a lot of hope and excitement that that what i look forward to so we'll get to see a version of all these things that we already understand just done more efficiently or openly so i'm excited for that and really appreciate all of you uh making time to be part of this panel great thank you thanks everyone thank you thanks dan you're organizing this amazing thank you thank you bye bye all right and with that we are ready for our last talk for the summit so without further ado i'd like to welcome jonathan larry and connor on stage to talk about all the fun stuff about doing compliance and legal working with dallas and for this chat honor will be the one moderating and uh i'll let you talk about all the other fun things thanks appreciate it man yeah it's i don't know about illegal in compliance being the end of the day situation because it's a it's it can be very um mind-bending and painful but we'll try to make it as exciting and engaging as possible to like send people off into their weekend so i'm conor spellsie um i was formerly a lawyer and then got into crypto helping crypto companies raise and do a number of things about four and a half years ago i started in the space then realized that we need some advocacy so co-founded the blockchain association so over the last kind of four years been working primarily on the advocacy side but then also working directly with our teams and run an organization called the dow research collective which is funded by the ethereum foundation and others which helps procure and then open source research related to foundational doubt issues like legals and governance and a number of different things and then we also have with us we're very fortunate to have both larry and jonathan so we're going to get the operator perspective here today from larry who has has had to spend a ton of time with lawyers and is a pro himself now essentially a lawyer but then also jonathan who is literally a lawyer so maybe actually larry and then jonathan if you guys give a little intro that'd be great yeah i'm the only non-lawyer on this panel so everything i say should be should be discarded for sure when it comes to legal um i'm the co-founder of reverie you know what we are is governance activists so we work with dows very closely and help them scale help them grow and help them operationalize a little bit in a in a little bit more of a mature way than than they are used to and then prior to that me and my co-founder were both venture investors i was a digital currency group he was at blockchain capital cool so i'm jonathan i am the founder of iterative law so i unlike conor i'm still a lawyer and i still practice and i i i'm also probably mostly and almost completely degen as well but i tend to work with a lot of crypto and blockchain companies in uh helping them figure out how to get to the market get their projects running and also doing things in a compliant manner and part of fun and working in this space is um how just how quickly things change and how quickly you have to sort of think through issues and try to do things you know in the um the best way you can given the knowledge in front of you so constantly changing landscape and lots of fun thanks guys um and so of course yeah nothing here is legal advice but starting uh starting with jonathan and then moving to larry i would love to hear this can be a broad question but what are the most pressing issues legal issues facing dows today um i'd say from my perspective um the the pressing legal issues just figure out how exactly uh is a dow sort of put together how does it work from a legal perspective and how does it interact with the meat space right like because everyone talks about using governance tokens and and providing community the opportunity to vote and to provide direction for see the network of the project but how does that exactly connect with um you know the real world how does it work with state banking how does it work with um hiring people and and delegating authority to people and so i think those are kind of questions that um we're all sort of struggling with we're trying to take existing frameworks and trying to mash them in we've got some innovations around trying to build new frameworks but sometimes the new frameworks just look like old frameworks and so i think there's a lot of lot that still needs to be done here and a lot that we can sort things larry what do you think i i totally agree with what jonathan i said i guess i'll try to cover this from a non-lawyer operator perspective but you know at a really high level right a lot of the structure a lot of teams use is is they put their whole treasury into this smart contract which is controlled by the circulating supply and that smart contract has no legal wrapper around it and so whenever you want to do stuff with the real world with the meat space like maybe you know sign a contract or hire someone or maybe acquire a company you're not really able to do that because there is no legal entity to interface with against the dow and and that really is a huge challenge now i think a lot of teams technical teams when they start the dow stuff they're like we'll figure this out later and then when the later comes that's when um that's when you know hits the fan and things need to get operationalized and challenges and problems really begin um the other the other um weird um thorny problem i would say is is actually it's not sexy at all but it's tax related it's just figuring out how to um manage the treasury in a way where you're clear on what taxes you're due or not have to don't have to pay and a lot of teams do have a lot of trouble with that yeah those are interesting ones um and it's is when i'm finding two is with with teams that i chat with um and i did a bit of i did a survey related to an event that we ran last summer with with bankless and with the help of youth global uh and stanford and others uh where larry spoke at too but um the idea of the event was focused around like the the issues that dao's face on the governance and legal side and treasury management side as well but um afterwards did a survey figured out that um what hit dowse i mean legal was one of the biggest issues for dows generally but almost um the the things that were not yet being addressed properly or at all in the ecosystem were the things that were like the real plumbing that the real background infrastructure the structuring that is often the most painful stuff to do so larry you talked about taxes and i know that's a huge sticking point for a lot of dows and dow treasury is like when they're thinking about how they distribute funding is that a taxable event and if it's a taxable event is there tax regulator to which they have to provide funding and if they don't are they going to be dinged for that right or are they going to kind of gain the ire of the regulators in a way that they really don't want to i'd go you know even a step back on that is um you know the token sales right um so if if the tokens are not securities and they're not sort of capital uh products then they're commodities if they're the products that should you be paying sales tax on that is there income tax involved it depends on where you're selling it to from and where who you're selling it to and sometimes you don't even know who you're selling it to because it's uh it's all on chain you know it can be anonymous and so um some of the the challenges around that is um how do you how do you sort of structure or figure out a way to you know put the dow into connected to the real world in a way that you can kind of confidently say yep we don't pay tax in this situation or we pay taxes in these situations only uh so those are those are some of the the challenges yeah and then thinking about what some jurisdictions are doing to address that you know we're seeing some particularly smaller jurisdictions that are quickly providing clarification right like the bigger the bigger eu's and uh the us are they're doing their own thing um but they're not going to be providing the very detailed regulations that for instance maybe came in or other jurisdictions can provide so with this question i'd love to get larry's thoughts first and then jonathan but larry from your perspective as an operator um what are some of those doubt the most common dow legal structures that you're you're seeing founders tend towards and why do you think they're being favored um the first thing i will say is for any founders listening is um you know the the in vogue um structure that's recommended by lawyers like it's it's um often uh what's invoked today may not be invoked five years from now ten years from now you saw a lot of um uh various structures used in in 2017 2016 that today lawyers would tell you do not use run away from it like um like the enemy and so um you know it's it's good to generally um have a state of mind i approach you know the structure with a state of mind that hey this may change this is just the thing that's invoked today and it may or may not stick around in the long term because frankly no one really knows and a lot of it is an emergent thing based on you know what the policy makers in the jurisdiction where you're structured uh think about the structure um you know but with that said you know most of the most of the um structures we see it's it's you know a lot of offshore entities and i think a lot of people get scared whenever they hear offshore like they have you know panama papers that sort of stuff um in their head but you know a lot of it is is um you know it's it's stuff like cayman entities dvi there's a new um guernsey trust that we can chat about later that people are using but there's um generally tax friendly jurisdictions that people use that have really good counsel so whenever you want to structure stuff you know you can rely on very competent lawyers to help you do that and i'm sure jonathan can speak way more about it than i can but those are the entity types that we see most most often yeah uh that that's basically um yeah sort of the the flavors that um are pretty popular these days so yep came in bvi um it's funny you mentioned panama papers i think um you know panma foundations are also kind of looked at as some a quick and um sort of way of sort of getting a structure in place um and i think they'll have interesting benefits though so the big one that you're talking about the tax deficiencies or the fact that they're in zero tax jurisdictions is actually helpful with that tax question because you don't have to pay capital gains tax or income tax on it or sales tax anything you do then you're good right like you assuming that you can actually you know kind of say you are actually operating in that jurisdiction and everything um but i think some of the benefits around and i think maybe the reason why some people also gravitate towards particular structures like this is um is uh you know are they sort of conceptually philosophically aligned with what you think a dao should be doing um so like for example like some of these foundations uh structures you don't have to have owners right you just have you can have a board directors or counselors and then you've got you know you so who sort of function as maybe your multi-stakeholders or as as the people in the real world that operate for your entity but because it does it's not owned by anybody on shareholders you have members it feels like it's owned by the community it's not like you know some other company or person actually controls the dow it is the the dow token holders and so i think there's a philosophical bent towards some of these structures as well um but uh that that is sort of where where we look i think the main one is you know trying to solve some of those tax issues and then providing some kind of entity or structure that can actually interact like injury to contracts and do things like that that's super helpful um and larry i know that you've done a lot of innovative work recently on the guernsey trust structure which has become popular and um dydx did something very impressive there mark boyron their general counsel wrote a great piece on it i highly recommend people read and i know tara did made some big moves there too so i mean you don't have to get too into the weeds and i don't mean to put you on the spot but we'd love to hear um you know what you've seen from that structure and what might draw founders into using it yeah so the first thing i say is um we'll say is is you know credit really goes to mark here it really that structure is his brainchild and he can um he can talk more about it than i can but what i what i can share about it in particular is you know what we tried to do is we tried to create a grants program for dydx and are you know running a grants program for dydx and we had a problem which is how do we pay contributors that are in the united states and then how do we sell ui dx without paying capital gains or if we have to pay capital gains uh not making token holders pay capital gains right because there's a lot of um lack of clarity on who pays taxes when it comes to dows and over time we'll figure this out but today it's a little bit of a murky area and so those were the business problems we were dealing with and and mark created an awesome help us create an awesome structure which is guernsey uh in guernsey and it's a guernsey trust and uh and for those who are listening never heard of guernsey it's not new jersey it's not a state it's a it's a it's a small island uh it's like one of those financial islands but in europe so if you've heard of cayman bvi you know it's the equivalent um for i guess europeans that's how i think of it and um and it was very quick to set up it had um you know very favorable tax treatment for the dydx that's contributed to it um you know in terms of just the corporate policies it's pretty well understood the trust structure is not this new thing that no one's ever operated before and so when you actually hire council to help you form it and operate it people are very clear on what you have to do to run that structure and so that's why we went with it and um you know it's still very new we've not been operating it for over a month yet and so we'll see how it sticks in the long term but so far it's been an excellent structure for um you know very quickly spinning up um uh you know tax friendly entities for doubts to use right no i think i think it's such a it's nice for you to demystify that and remark to have written that piece because a lot of founders come into this and just end up having to have calls with five different counsel from five different like kind of obscure jurisdictions and it's hard to wrap your mind around what it is you're actually doing so kudos to you guys into mark of course writing that piece and hopefully we see more from the community like it that can demystify and save people time um jonathan flipping to you uh this is going to be one that i'm sure a lot of founders are interested in but what are the biggest legal mistakes that dow founders typically make like when someone comes to you as a client what mistakes have they already made before they show up to start talking to you um i think one of the biggest mistakes that i've seen before is um going off and doing your uh basically doing your token offering before you even thought about the structure so you're you know oh i can i can get i'll take that smart contract i'll rework it and i'll raise some funds and uh and away we go uh and then coming back afterwards and saying okay so we we did this we have a community now um so now we now what do we do um because the cats out of the bag in that sense is that it's very difficult for you to um you know sort of hide the risk off of um you know doing token issuances doing entering into contracts and things like that when uh you don't have a legal structure to begin with and so you know maybe taking a step further back from that is not talking to um to a lawyer first and um i mean frankly most lawyers are more than happy to have an initial conversation just to understand what you're doing and you know see if there's a way to to help you like they're not going to charge you up front i i i definitely don't i love talking to projects to see what they're doing and if it works out and it sounds like it's um you know they're in the right place to start working together then great and if not you know you know then that that's okay they they maybe they still got some billing to do but i think it's always important to just particularly in this space when there's so many um you know complications the biggest complication is that the technology is global in nature but the laws are jurisdiction so you might think you're doing things perfectly fine in one country but you might get in trouble in another country uh and you might be in a greater in the third country and so just being thoughtful about that or at least talking to someone who understands that there's you know you should think about some of these things and the other part would probably be the tax part as well that we talked about not realizing that you know what you've done may have actually caused you to um you know create a massive tax bill for yourself or for your your token holders yeah that's no that's great i think to talking to making sure that when you talk to that lawyer that is a crypto native lawyer who has experience in the space and is not just some corporate lawyer who's like yeah i'll set up c corp we'll do the thing and you'll be good because i've chatted with a bunch of founders and experienced with organizations that i work for previously that have been told to set up the wrong structure and then it's an insanely complicated process to go from maybe a u.s structure to an offshore structure and it also just it doesn't make a lot of sense so the i think the the people we're going to have almost this founders who are doing their second crypto company i think who are going to do it better because they're going to appreciate that oh i need to do a lot up front to save myself an insane headache later on that might actually jeopardize my own company but it's worth it because i've now laid the infrastructure that allows for me to make a great case potentially from a tax perspective liability perspective you know a number of different different places i i'd also add conor like you know the difference between say you know three years ago and now like there are a lot more lawyers that actually sort of really understand the space and maybe not all of them focus on it you know 100 of the time but um it's you should definitely to your point do talk to somebody that has an understanding of you know crypto blockchain and just some of the issues around it and and get that initial conversation right it's yeah just just so you don't accidentally walk into something that you you can't do yourself out of yeah just to add on to that it's um i think a lot of founders they um they they almost treat law as you know some some rocket science that they can't wrap their head around and they'll you know whatever advice they'll take they get from a lawyer they'll just take it without actually questioning it and understanding it at a really high level and i think it's really important if even if you're a technical founder and if you have no background in law you actually have to understand at a high level what advice you're getting you don't have to understand all the uh the legal documents uh point by point but having a high level mental model of what you are doing um what risks you are taking versus not taking is very important and i feel like a lot of founders don't don't get as involved in the legal as they probably should yeah i think that's a great point and actually uh i would highly recommend the founders that they're looking for a lawyer to listen to a podcast that larry and derek sue his partner did um i pledge allegiance where they were talking about jake trevinsky and mark boyron who are two of the leading lawyers in crypto about almost in part what to think about when you're finding a crypto lawyer and it'll save you a lot of time and a lot of money so i would i'm showing that here on larry's behalf he won't do it himself but i listen to the pod it's incredible um taking you know taking a slightly like different direction and thinking about the interaction of law and some of the other issues we're dealing with in you know with daos larry um we'd love to get your thoughts on how you're seeing founders and operators endows think about the interaction between issues related to things like governance and treasury management and then how they connect that with law or the extent to which they think about law when they're implementing decisions about those other features or you know critical components of doubts i feel like if you try to do any sort of legal work in 2020 or 2021 you would get like a lot of uh dirty looks like people would say wait we're doing this dow thing why would you you know loop lawyers in right that's the enemy right or any sort of like off-chain stop that's the enemy and you know at this point i think people are realizing that hey these are things that we actually have to do if we want to grow these dowels and scale these organizations in very big ways um you know at a really high level um the biggest change i would say between um you know maybe late 2020s early 2021 and today is um the entity types are pretty clear people know which entities to use which outside counsel to engage in right so who are the actual people who i can turn to to help me set this stuff up in the past to jonathan's point there were not really that many lawyers who were comfortable to take on the risk or of a token project and say today there's just many many more people who know what they're doing and are providing pretty good advice um and um and you know as a result what you have is many different types of uh legal structures uh that essentially hold tokens that were previously held in no legal structure are now held in some sort of legal structure and that really allows dallas to do all this sort of stuff things and and um activities they wanted to do previously that they couldn't do and so it opens up a world of opportunity that you could just couldn't do in the past and how do you think about like given that there's like so much nascent development i mean that you're totally totally right it's great that you have more lawyers who are having a better sense and are more comfortable but given all of the the changes that are happening so quickly on the governance and the treasury management side like how can you keep your lawyer or how do you see teams try to keep lawyers engaged such that they can also opine on the decisions being made about things that are like quite technical or or you know also very dynamic while also thinking about the legal side like is that happening very much um i would say it's it's really difficult to um be be a lawyer on the cutting edge because not only do you have to follow policy developments in the world but you also have to follow the technology and like fundamental improvements in the technology and for any one person to be able to follow these two very emergent industries is difficult and so you know every now and then you do find people who are able to you know play in in both categories but it is hard and i think the technology is always going to move faster than the law and so you're always going to if you're doing something that's pretty wonky on the technology side you're always going to have some degree of legal risk and and some uncertainty and they think that is just the cost of doing business as a founder operating in a in a very emergent space and um taking a little bit of a different direction here this is something that i personally become interested in and would love your guys's thoughts on and it's it's consistent with i mean there are buckets of things that i think that those who found and run dows now know they need to think about like they need to think about legal structure for instance that is pretty commonly known right but there are many other things like voting policies for instance which are new to dow founders maybe that's something you think about if you're involved with public companies and you you know you understand how that works or you work a lot from whatever but there are more nuanced parts of the law that founders are starting to have a better appreciated appreciation for or um maybe should have a better appreciation for so have you guys seen anything um as it relates to dows starting to engage with like conflicts policies as it relates to voting or the way that they delegate certain votes or the way that their investors delegate certain votes i mean i can sort of speak a little bit about this um i i think uh there there i've seen projects that i've been working with um starting to think about some of these things and um i think it's probably because uh you learned from uh you learn from your own mistakes we also learn from other people's mistakes and so seeing how say some dabs have um and the uh their sort of management structure may have blown up because of inter-personal issues and you know personal um interests over the interests of the collective and so on so which is funny because as much as um [Music] you sort of want to ignore you know the corporate space and in some ways um you know the the the genesis of um of this industry was a complete you know really a a an aversion to the the centralized um you know corporate world and the way things are operated there's a there's actually a lot you can learn from corporate governance and and you know conflict um management and things are encoded in corporate law frankly right if you you know you should not be voting on something that you have a personal interest in if you are part of of a management committee or a subcommittee right like that that's actually entrenched in corporate law and so um those are like small things that if we sort of take some of the the learnings from that or um at least some of the the reasonings behind it i think it'd be very interesting to kind of pull that back and put it back into uh that the dials or governance structures and it's not to say we can't innovate on top of that but let's learn from what we have and and continue to build on that that's great no i think that's a that's a really fair answer i mean i think that's generally something that that that we need to think through more critically is how can we look to existing protestants like we can help build a new revolutionary system but there are some truisms about the human condition and the way that people are incentivized that have not changed over the last 500 years and we can look to research on that front to help inform us as to how we can build the right systems now yeah and and you know what what's really cool actually i think is that the systems that we can build actually can provide more interaction more direct um control and and uh power to people who are participating in doubts right um you know so like the voting mechanisms like snapshot is really cool i would love to actually see that used in uh in the corporate world because because in the corporate world shareholder turnout for votes is like 30 whereas using something um you know as sophisticated as you know it's really just technology to allow people more access so we can kind of take it from both sides and and actually be better for it my senses for stuff like this while around that topic of you know conflicts of interest and more more accountability is you know generally um you know when there's a boom and bust cycle it's during the bus that a lot of the the policy and the internal controls get created right you look at pretty much any industry that's just how stuff works but what you can do when you're in a boom period is just self-policing and self-regulation and they'd say like some daos have this culture where they're not gonna know sue if you have any sort of conflict of interest but there's this policy and it's almost like a cultural principle that hey by default we will disclose conflicts we don't have any responsibility to do so but it's important to us and so that's the honor code we're going to follow and and that i think gets you 95 of the way there the bad apples will still you know break the rules but for the most part i think stuff like that while we're still in in a period of really high growth um uh self-accountability and enforcement is is really important and it does get a lot of doubts to um to a good place pretty quickly yeah i think i think it's a i mean it was a really good point it's also hard it's very hard in this space given that so many people work for so many projects it presents a new um challenge that hasn't usually existed in in the corporate world or at least not at the same extent right right but what's funny is that we we have policies now about um you know board members being on too many public boards because of that issue you know you're a director on five or six or more companies you cannot possibly be able to focus on all them at once and so again these are things that we can take from the corporate world and kind of go back and say do we need to have a formal policy for this or should we just sort of put something in place for a particular data saying that you know we want you to be involved but if you're involved in too many projects maybe you should step back from one or two of them right away and when you have like you you you know i've been in a bunch of board meetings that have these formal policies but the board members are asleep at the wheel right and so you know just because you have rules doesn't mean people actually follow them good absolutely you're right that's absolutely true and last question um really appreciate the time guys on the friday afternoon last question here which could be legal or probably is not legal related but what are some of the things you're most excited about in the dow ecosystem i think i alluded a little bit to this but i i it's the technology right the ability to um to provide more access and more control to uh to token holders so um you know right now i think most dows still have um you know multi-sig wallets that you need uh you know amongst multi-stakeholders to actually go and interact with the wallet once a snapshot has been taken you know the the proposal's been passed love to see you know some of that the more direct interactions with them uh with the systems right where you don't need that personal intermediary um really cool to see it you know to see i think as a token holder to see that my vote and passing of a proposal directly uh results in an action yeah i would just add that um unlike traditional companies i think you can have a really effective dow with very very few people they're very lean organizations um it's structured that way and for you as one individual or five individuals to be able to move the needle on the product in such a way that you actually see that the stuff i did you know contributed to this level of growth that's a really fulfilling feeling that a lot of people have who work for dallas and having more of that is very exciting to me and i know people who work for dallas field very similarly amazing well thank you so much for your time guys and thanks keith global for putting this on so i'll pass it back over to you cardik what i was going to say when i also make sure conor you get a chance to answer the same question um i'd love to hear your thoughts too what am i most excited for the dow ecosystem um what i'm most excited for honestly is the opportunity to collectively work on improving the dow ecosystem i think that crypto enables us to do much more cooperation and collaboration as it relates to building out the industry in a way that we would never see in like traditional private companies obviously the tooling it enables but also the spirit and the mission of the people who are working in crypto and such that i'm excited to see this community scale at a faster rate than any other sort of similar organizational structure we've ever seen this is awesome i think this is a pretty good way to summarize kind of what 500 people are going to be acting on in the next 48 hours so uh we'll we'll keep you posted everything comes out well dawson connor thank you so much for uh that amazing talk and uh looking forward to having you join us again in the future sounds great good luck in the hack everyone peace thank you thanks everyone good luck all right well that brings us to the end of our summit and i want to thank everybody who uh watched everything engaged with us asked amazing questions and honestly is uh still participating in the hackathon and working on interesting projects we're gonna still resume my handful of workshops right after this but in the meantime i want to wish everybody happy hacking and we'll all see you on the discord and we'll see you all here again on the live stream this sunday to showcase all the amazing projects that came out of it in about 48 hours so with that enjoy some low five beats and we'll see you all soon take care everybody you
