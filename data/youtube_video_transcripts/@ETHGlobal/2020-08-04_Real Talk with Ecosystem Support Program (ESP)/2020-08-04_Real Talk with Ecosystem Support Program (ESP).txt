and we'll get started with this presentation okay we're good all right welcome everybody to this pack fest event uh this is week five the final week submissions are in a few days hopefully everybody is wrapping up their projects and if not wrapping up your sprinting like mad to get them done before the deadline um we know that all your submissions are going to be awesome so today we have a presentation from emily and ken well emily will be presenting and ken will be supporting they are from the ecosystem support program which is a group at the ef the ethereum foundation that runs an extension of the previous grants program that looks to provide support for projects individuals in many different ways throughout the ecosystem and we're very excited to have them today to intro what esp is and what they do and how you can be helped by them so i will turn it over to emily and candy say hi tell us about themselves for a couple seconds and then we'll have the presentation and then at the end will be just some time for q a so either write your question in the chat and we'll get to it or hold it until the end and emily ken wants you on you and tell us about yourselves yeah hey thank you for the intro um my name is emily ken do you want to give yourself a quick intro just like before i jump into it hi i'm ken um i helped with the extra support program um i have been a part of the biggest program since it was the ef grants program so we've been at this for about two and a half years or so uh and it's been awesome to kind of see the growth from um you know what we could do best with the grants program to now with the esp and kind of taking each uh inquiry as a holistic kind of submission to find support um our team has grown a huge amount just so that we can kind of figure out where and how we can help best and so i'd like the narrative to be switched a little bit and um instead of kind of coming to us and asking us for help it's actually the other way around where an inquiry is submitted we'd want to figure out how we can help you so think of us as a resource and how we can be best leveraged to help your projects thanks kevin yeah kenza ken's an old hat at this he's been around a while all right um i'm gonna go ahead and share my screen and start this presentation let's see one second all right we good you can can you try to make it full screen yeah it's not too screaming for me oh okay one second let me i messed up my screen share sorry guys one second try it again how's that good okay cool that's good got it all right so hey like i said my name is emily and i'm here to talk to you about the ecosystem support program and sort of teach you about these port tools that will be available for your project once the hackathon is over my image is missing i'm sorry things happen um but esp it um stands for ecosystem support program i know we're really into acronyms and we like to throw them around a lot so i just like to be extra clear this is what esp means um and um through this talk i'm going to bring you through you know who we are what we do why we do it and how we do it before i continue speaking about esp i really want to zoom out and talk about just the ethereum foundation um just on the whole so the ethereum foundation's mission um we want to do what is best for ethereum's long-term success simple easy right in a nutshell that's what it is um and to accomplish this we take on a couple different roles so we try to allocate resources to critical projects we strive to be a valued voice within the ethereum ecosystem and we also advocate for ethereum to the outside world and so esp comes in on that first first role that the ef has on the allocation role so esp is the resource allocation arm of the ethereum foundation we are one of the ways that the ef pursues the first goal of you know allocating resources to critical projects so specifically we connect individuals and teams at any stage of development with a broad range of support whether that means grants tactical feedback introductions free access to tools and platforms or even just like starting the conversation um just having chat about things so as you can tell we we take support to mean a lot of different things like ken mentioned before the old ef grant program really focused only on allocating traditional grants but we've expanded this definition of support to really include like all sorts of different things different resources that we try to supply so you know when i say support i can mean a traditional financial grant a project idea validation we can gather community feedback on behalf of your project we can help with project coordination hook you up with introductions um we've given applicable credits like aws credits or software credits and then we also direct people towards alternative funding sources um say like malachow or something like that um this by no means is an exhaustive list like at all we're constantly trying to find new ways to figure out how we can support projects in the ecosystem so who is eligible for support that's a question we get a lot obviously anyone who is involved with ethereum is eligible for support but more specifically if you are receiving a traditional grant we do have some baseline requirements that i just want to bring to everyone's attention um your project needs to be open source it needs to benefit ethereum and it needs to focus on either universal tools infrastructure resource research or common resources and again that's just for like receiving a traditional grant if you don't check all those boxes you're still eligible for alternative forms of support so what don't we like to see major knows we will not pump or help sell your token like straight up we will not invest in your new quant fund and we're not going to fund your totally unrelated to ethereum business and this is across the board for like any form of support like we're not going to entertain these inquiries um and i i think you kind of get the idea of what i'm trying to say here but i do want to point out that there is nuance for example we are likely not going to fund your dap straight up but if in the process of making your dap you create a free and open deaf open source dev tool that would really be like a boon to the ecosystem that's the conversation we're interested in having that's the thing that we're interested in funding um so to further uh elaborate on this i gathered some examples of past support that i just want to talk about a little bit so the first project i want to highlight is called alice alice is a decentralized platform for the social finance sector sector they help impact investors governments and non-profits to cut transaction costs and share verified impact data that's who they are but why why did we want to try to support them um they're a veteran team in the ecosystem they're very values align and normally they wouldn't qualify for traditional grant um but since they were such valued members of community we really wanted to acknowledge the work that they had put forth and we wanted to find a way to help them um so how do we help them we actually connected them with alex vandesam who provided really good ux and ui feedback on the alistat um the team was really excited really pleased with this they even tweeted us like a thanks so this is a situation that generally everyone left happy and we're really proud of this one and the next team i want to highlight is concho who they are they're a gofundme style marketplace for social good missions on ethereum um again in our former grants program that really only focused on the traditional monetary grants this type of application would have likely been rejected it wasn't protocol layer or infrastructure or research you know it's just an example of something really good really interesting that can be built on ethereum so why did we support them um they were also like prove that they were like values aligned and they're also a team of web 2 devs trying to break into ethereum um so this sort of tied into like the advocation idea we're trying to get those conversions from web 2 onto ethereum we wanted to really encourage this type of conversion so again that's like why we felt moved to help them and how did we help them well we saw this project was really similar to the alice project so we connected them with the alice ceo who um got on a call really provided this team with one-on-one guidance and gave them some tips you know this type of support is super valuable for um entrepreneurs it's really not something you can find on twitter on reddit um and we also pointed this team um towards some useful tutorials and developer resources to really help them get started um working on ethereum and learn best practices and lastly since we wouldn't be directly funding this project once it was built out we direct them towards various other tech incubators and startup funding resources and the last project that we supported that i want to highlight is clear fund so clear fund is a community effort geared towards building an open and less trustful quadratic funding protocol for the ethereum ecosystem using macy um why do we fund them so funding public goods um is a big thing we do at the ef you know it's our mission at esp and funding public hoods is a huge undertaking it requires um a lot of community effort cooperation support funding um and funding public goods on ethereum we believe just shouldn't be under the strict purview of the ef um it should be shared among all community members um so that's why we're really interested in funding this another reason is because um clear fun brought together um a collective of pro of um entities to fund the fund so um how do we help them we granted them 21k in matching funds to go towards the first two production rounds of clr they also received matching funds from malik um from gnosis and colony and a couple others um and seeing this like group effort these like opportunities for matching and coming together to fund something really excites us and it's something we're super interested in um and the first two rounds of clr are likely happening this fall so stay tuned so now that i've sort of described a couple of examples of the teams that we've helped how we've helped them um i wanted to show you guys some stats and kind of tell you like what we've been working on um just since 2020 has started all right so in this chart i've um outlined a couple of categories of support so how i got this chart i gathered all the instances of support so either traditional grants or alternative support each instance that we've given and provided in 2020 and i sorted them by the general category that this that their project is geared towards and the reason i did this is just to really highlight uh one the diversity of of categories that we support and just show you just like you know what we're generally spending our time talking to and working on so community and education is the biggest piece of the pie devx and tooling we've got user experience layer one layer two indirect funding and cryptography and zkp with a small little slice of bits and bobs that don't quite fit nicely into these categories let's see let me go back i got click happy all right so here's some more statistics we have supported 68 projects since the start of 2020. um we're very happy with this number this is something we've been working really hard towards um one of our big goals is to always be you know constantly trying to find more ways we can provide alternative support and really trying to say yes we can help you to everyone who knocks on our door um so yeah that's just one of the things we're constantly striving for um and of those 68 uh 57 of them were were teams that received alternative funding supports and 42 percent of them received a traditional grant so now that i've talked about like the who what when except who what how who what why um i'm gonna talk about the how so how do you apply um so first off you go to our website it's esp.etherium.foundation um you scroll to the bottom of the page you'll find two buttons one specific project and one for exploring possibilities um so for it for specific project this is if you know what you're working on you're working on a project you just need help moving it forward maybe you need advice maybe you need funding we don't really know you need to click submit on a specific project button so we can find out more for exploring possibilities this is really if you just you really want to contribute to ethereum um you maybe have a skill that you think could be useful but you just aren't sure where to go where to start in which case again you'd use the exploring possibilities button um for both of those forms um we make the questions really vague and the forum is short this is on purpose don't feel compelled to spend weeks working on it you know when you're reading these just try to frame it as what can esp do for you if you need something specific ask for something specific you know just come out and say it um if you don't know what you need that's fine just you know let us know everything you know and the better the more information you can give us the better we can help you so once you submit an inquiry form to our website you will be getting an email confirmation and then the next stage is striking out the conversation so we will get in touch with you and try to figure out you know like what does success look like for your project what are your goals what are desired outcomes what is the intended impact here um and that usually entails a one-on-one call with a member of the esp team so we can really get to know you um and then from there once we've gathered that information we really try to move to identifying support opportunities um you know try to find the things that can help you get you where you need to be so if you're still kicking your own ideas or you need a little more inspiration please head over to our website we've got a wish list up here which is a non-exhaustive list of just some of the areas where we're actively seeking applications just general topics of interest to us right now don't feel limited by this you know follow your heart we all love surprises so you know submit anything you got another area you can find on our website is our pin board um these are interesting problems for you to tackle this was created in collaboration with the eth2 research team so definitely give that a look if you're looking for some sticky problems so yeah um get in touch sign up on our website you can email us too at esp ethereum.org you can also tweet us at ef underscore esp um or just you know check our twitter to see just like what we're up to you can also go to our website we have a blog running for more updates on our team and information just on the various people and teams we've been able to support we also have a new newsletter up and running so you will never miss an update if you sign up for our newsletter that's on the bottom of our website as well actually i think do we have time for a quick q a we most definitely do sweet ken would you like to join me for the question and answer portion yes i would okay i'm here so yeah anybody feel free to unmute and ask the question i guess we could probably start with josh if you want to unmute and share what you're thinking about yeah i posted it in the chat but um so my project is building on top of three box and orbit db and metamask and a lot of these other tools that the you know they may have a direct connection to ethereum but they make available something that may not even be necessarily on the ethereum blockchain and we maybe our apps may be building on top of those tools um so it's kind of an indirect connection to ethereum how does that impact the possibility of funding i mean if you're looking for direct funding um you'll have to go back to that first slide where you talk about you know the three prerequisites i mean is what you're building is it a public tool is it open source you know is it is it a community resource so i think those are the first questions you need to ask but i i would say i wouldn't preclude you for other types of support there still might be connections we can try to make for you or um resources we can point you towards it just depends really on like what specifically um you think that we could help you with yeah okay cool any other questions i think that i think that might be it okay yeah i can't see the chat so oh yeah no there was just uh looks like there was just the one question let me quickly double check the youtube stream just to be sure but uh we could probably wrap up here in a moment yep looks like we're all clear okay cool all right yeah and next we're gonna be moving into the one-on-one sessions that the ecosystem support program team members have set up so if you've signed up for one of those sessions they'll be reaching out to you with a separate session to join and you'll be talking to them but this is the end of this current presentation so thank you everybody for joining and uh listening to emily thank you emily and ken for being here and uh you know sharing a little bit about what you guys do with the hackafest participants if there are no final questions we will wrap up for today and have everybody have a good day if you're in the sessions after this hopefully they're useful thanks bye guys thank you
