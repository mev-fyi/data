okay the stream is up great um hello and welcome to everybody joining us on the call today we are really excited to have gabriel from tachyon team to chat a little bit about how you can take your hackathon project to the next level after submitting your project for hackyface gabriel is going to do a quick presentation and there'll be questions um at the end that you can ask feel free to unmute yourself or drop questions in the chat if you prefer a few notes just before we officially kick this session off submissions are due this thursday the 6th of august please remember to have a look through the judging and submissions guidelines before you submit your project you will have also noticed that we have just opened up the judging slots on your hacker dashboard so please sign up for your slot this week and lastly trains and andrew have put together another demo session scheduled for today at around 1 30 pm pacific and this is just a really great opportunity to get some feedback on your videos before submissions closed um so with that i will pass a call on to gabriel who can give a quick introduction to himself and kick the session off awesome thank you guys thank you emily thank you trent um excited to uh to be here to talk to all of you um been taking a look at a couple of the projects that are starting to come through really really impressed with um with all of the projects at this year's hackathon so we're excited to talk to all of you um i'm gonna share my screen so i can get into the presentation um and um maybe emily or trent if i can just get a thumbs up can you guys see my screen okay are we good yep awesome cool uh awesome well yeah i'm gabriel i'll introduce um myself real quick i'm the managing director of tachyon tachyon is a web 3 accelerator is a part of consensus i'll talk a little bit about that uh more here in a second um but excited to talk to you guys about uh the follow coin launch pad accelerator which is coming soon um uh oh let me click my screen here okay there we go um so i thought how we would spend our time today is first um yeah uh i want to share with you guys a little bit more about the upcoming file coin launchpad accelerator it's in partnership with us in protocol labs um talk a little bit more about dumb tachyon for those of you that are looking to take your project and move it into a full-time startup um and then um you know we've seen a lot of hackathon projects over the years tachyon's you know been around since 2017 um we've invested we've been the first check-in to a lot of early web 3 startups um over 29 projects i think uh to date we've seen a lot of um both successful and unsuccessful projects try to make the pivot from project into sustainable um full-time startup and so i thought what would be helpful as part of this session is to talk a little bit about some of the patterns that we see that that successful teams or successful projects have made as they make that transition um and then we'll talk we'll go right into q a you know if you guys have any questions i you know would love to uh to meet some of you and talk to you about for those of you interested in tachyon or um you know any advice that we can give on on any of your projects be happy to do that um cool so just a little bit about tachyon uh tachyon is a part of consensus labs it's part of our tier venture business um we've incubated and invested as a part of consensus labs more than a hundred projects and companies including some of the key pillars of the ethereum ecosystem so these are companies like infura metamask truffle pegasus three box tachyon as i mentioned is our accelerator we've run three programs for early stage web 3 startups since 2017 we have 29 active alumni including companies such as nuo which is the same team as the juno team um quiddly tranzact um outlet.finance paidow uh and just some other really amazing companies um our our last cohort was a d5 specific cohort and so we've got a number of d5 projects that are starting to become some of the pillars within the the d5 ethereum ecosystem um i i guess a little bit about our team you know really tachyon was built by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs uh i'm a three-time startup founder myself i've built companies in the prop tech and fintech space um two-time intrapreneur so that's you know basically being an entrepreneur inside of a larger holding company um in that role i built a media publishing business up to 100 million mau but i've spent a lot of time uh both in my own startups advising setups working with startups uh i've you know i've got a lot of startups that have not succeeded on my track record um and and a number of that have and so again you know it's all about pattern recognition really trying to understand um you know how um how starps can make that successful pivot um brian dall who who's one of our program directors one of my partners um used to head innovation strategy at quartz he's also a multi multi entrepreneur and monty prakash uh who's one of our associates um actually founded a social enterprise uh while in nyu so just a little bit about our team again like we love working with early stage companies especially in the web 3 the blooming web 3 space i think there's just so much activity happening in the space and we really love you know getting close to entrepreneurs and helping them try to make those really fast turns as they grow um grow their project um so the filecoin launchpad accelerator uh we've partnered with protocol labs to launch our fourth cohort um and so uh you're really excited about this upcoming cohort again like i've seen some amazing amazing projects already as a part of hack fs so really really would encourage you know any of you that are looking to make kind of that transition into uh you know looking for funding and trying to turn your project into a full-time startup we'd love to talk to you i'd love to meet you we're looking for early stage teams that are building open interoperable and programmable tools for the distributed web through ipf and ipfs and filecoin um you know we're not limiting applicants to people that are just building ipfs and filecoin if you have a project and your ipfs or filecoin curious you know we would love to to meet you and talk to you um applications are currently open um we can talk a little bit more about this during q a uh but they uh they're open until august 21st and then the program is going to kick off in september uh it ends in december culminating in the demo day at the end of january the program will be fully remote um that allowed us to do two things number one get a lot more scale work with more teams and more projects and and one not be so u.s centric you know you know i think this is a global technology ethereum is a global technology so we're really excited about seeing teams from around the world um you know as they try to scale up their startups um and obviously i guess you know the third point would be uh you know just acknowledging the existence of living in the covid 19 world would be really hard to ask teams to uh to come into into new york which is where the the tachyon headquarters is um so cool the the opportunity i think you know really trying to help teams think about an assassin is this a project or is this a company um you know there are a couple of i think key questions but which i'm going to go into detail here in a second on um but what market are you playing in what's the size of the of the market who are your users are you able to build a community and and what does that look like what are you building what's the technology solution that you're building what's your team composition i think you know is really important um what are some of the major blockers and challenges and then and then what's your time commitment so as you start thinking about you know is this um is this a a project that you want to continue tinkering on is this something maybe that you want to extend some runway via grants or if you want to turn this into you know a venture size or scalable product or project you know these are some of the questions that you want to ask yourself as far as what to expect from tachyon you know accelerators are really about helping entrepreneurs speed up their process um to keep becoming sustainable skillable venture backable companies and so um you know we really give companies all the tools that they need as a as a part of tachyon uh to scale quickly and and move really really fast um so first is obviously capital we we're investing eighty thousand dollars into your company we we are usually the first checks into a company um you know at a pre-seat or seed stage however you wanna think about it um but really you know we wanna give you the capital so that you can make this a full-time endeavor and really focus on this as you as you know building a startup is is an all-encompassing endeavor and so um you know we want to make sure teams have enough capital enough runway as as they launch their their business um the global networks that we have access to you know both the protocol labs networks in addition to the consensus networks whether they be technical subject matter experts just a range of mentors and advisors you can go to our website labs.consensus to see the list of mentors and advisors as a part of this program um you know early stage investors we work with a lot of investors you know that are looking at early stage companies as they come out of tachyon in some cases you know we're able to help you with your initial customers um and then fellow alumni again we've got 29 alumni um you know that that are actively building in the what three space and you know having that network is is really about opening doors uh you know helping you you know uh gain access um you know and uh and and having that network can really really help you move quickly as as you build uh you know your your company um as a part of the program we give you access to tools you know obviously you know if you're familiar with consensus you know we literally built the web3 stack and so whether it's giving you direct access to tools or credits through our um our program services stack called tachyonos you know things like infuria like metamask like codify if you're in the d5 space and then finally experienced entrepreneurs you know our programming officers are held by you know myself brian monte and a range of mentors and advisors who are startup veterans you know and can help you think about some of those trap doors as as you um as you build and scale your startup um cool so let's talk a little bit about uh you know turning your hackathon project into a sustainable product into a sustainable business again we've seen just so many hackathon projects apply over the years to tachyon um you know the the transition from you know hackathon project or project to building a company can sometimes feel like a little bit like a daunting process there are just so many things that you have to think about that you have to get right the sequence of events that you have to get right you know um you know what things do you focus on when really having um you know having support as you start to make that transition and knowing what to focus on and when to focus on on what i think is really a key differentiator and the the project succeed versus the ones that don't i think this is the biggest single um one of the most important things that i really want to touch on um you know i i we've just seen again so many projects try to make the transition when you go from um you know from from a project to a startup i think the biggest transition that you are going to encounter the biggest transition that you're going to have to make is going from building what you want to build like building from your instincts to really starting to focus more on users on customers on your community and understanding you know what is it that your users want um you know i during this presentation i might use the word customers or users or community i'm using those three interchangeably um but again we've just seen so many hackathon projects that were just really really good projects but when they tried to transition from a project to a sustainable product or successful startup um they failed and um and so i think this combination of really being user centric user focused while also being able to build a community and build in public it's one of the best ways to figure out what your users want uh you know this this ability to to build a community and build a public and really understand what your users pain points are um and and being able to build what they want is one of the biggest biggest differentiators um that we've seen from the from the projects that make that successful transition um compared to the ones that don't so i would screenshot this slide again it's very simple uh in in in description i think it's very sometimes difficult in in execution uh but again i i think this is kind of the the 80 20 of of making that successful transition um cool so let's touch on some of the key focus areas i think i think as you think about the key focus here is as you make this transition there there are some things that i think are the ones that stick out to us certainly are um you know team are you the right founders um what have you built before do you have complementary skill sets um market you know what is needed in the market um and and will your product matter in this in this market what are the pain points of your users in this market do you understand the market that you're building this product in um technical you know can you execute can you build um can you get traction and build a community who are you building for um you know will anybody care can you build in public openly and can you can you use your community uh to bring people along uh on you know on on on this road that you're on um mo can you can you build a sustainable note can you figure out an unfair competitive advantage um and and really protect your idea or or you know whether that's ip or technical talent or um or you know a unique business model and they're just so many interesting unique business models that we can apply to um to startups within the web 3 space and then lastly funding how do you fund sustain your project um and what types of funding are best needed for your project so let's touch on these um individually um first team as as you transition from project to startup i think the founding team is a crucial key to success um you know you can have a perfect product in a perfect market and can still fail with an imperfect team i think team is really really one of the one of the big components that you want to get right um you know a great team can really overcome fits and starts and make multiple pivots um even when the first idea doesn't quite work so does the founding team include all the critical skills that your business is going to need if not how do you go about getting them we get a lot of questions also about solo founders versus teams i think you know as we've kind of analyzed um you know successful um teams in the past single founders may not cover all the critical skills um and and subjects that a full team uh you know can so you know can you go it alone um you can most likely it's not gonna work and so you know are you the type of founder that can build a team um and and and build a comp a team that has complementary skill sets now you know i think the other really important thing with um you know with team and for those of you who have you know built startups in the past you know this founding teams are subject to interpersonal problems and require effective governance you know so um you know i think that's why i think you know things like hack fs you know hackathons are really really great because it allows teams to kind of get in the trenches um get into stressful environments and really become battle tested and you know have those relationships really um you know kind of kind of stand uh the test of time i i think you know when when you're building a startup you're essentially um saying that you're going to build with um with these people with these individuals over the next you know seven five seven eight years um and so your ability to you know to have battle tested relationship relationships i think is really really critical um this for us is just kind of the anatomy of a rock star founder right you know there's you know what we would call founder market fit you've got the relevant experience and unique insights you've got a unique insight around the space that you are building in um that um that others just don't or you know that's very hard to copy um second is is leadership you know you're you have the ability to inspire others to kind of follow along um with your view of the world or your vision of what you're trying to build and then lastly hustle i mean building a startup as you make the transition from from you know hackathon project to you know startup endeavor um it's hard i mean you know there's just no there's no other way to to put it and your ability to hustle and build like crazy and make really fast turns learn from your customers really fast and then execute or or build um you know what based on what you learn i think is is just really really important um cool let's talk a little bit about the market um as you start to think about the transition from you know hackathon project to whether this is a sustainable business you want to better understand your market and the users in that market what are their key pain points so a lot of times you know when when you start off um with a with a hackathon project and there are there are a number of really great projects that have successfully made that transition um you know i mean there are a number that i can think of over the years um but eventually every founder or every team needs to start thinking about um you know not what that initial instinct was um or that idea was um that they had when it was a hackathon project but like so what are the customers within this market um clamoring for what do they need what are their pain points you know what assumptions are you making about the user's users in this market and how can you quickly validate them you know how big is this market uh you know the the size of this market i think really matters as you as you start thinking about um you know um understanding whether this is going to be a project that you just tinker on because you enjoy it and you really like the technology and it's just really interesting to you or maybe this is a nice lifestyle business um or you know whether you should start thinking seriously about raising money for your idea because this is a really big market with a lot of potential users who have um have some real pain points so these are just some of the questions that you want to start asking yourself as you start addressing um the market um technical i i would venture to guess that um especially within um the eth global community this is not not a problem in fact this is usually the problem that um uh this is usually not a problem as founders come through through the attacking door we spend a lot more time focusing on the other aspects of a startup but you know the fact of the world the matter is that the world is just full of smart motivate motivated people who just can't execute and build and so your ability to do so i think is is really important you know depending on your audience and your objective and the level of complexity of your idea your mvp your minimum viable product will range from low fidelity builds um you know you could implement things like uh no code bubble solutions or dynamic ux uh designs at least on the front end if you're using something like figma um you know and just kind of sweep all the blockchain stuff under the carpet um all the way up to you know high fidelity mvps that really require you to write a lot more code i think a lot of the projects that we see that come out of hackathons you can and should be writing code um if you can um but once you start transitioning from project to startup and especially startups that raise money precede my money or seed money um you know you need to have a strong understanding of the users and your market before you start writing code and so a lot of the times we'll have very technical founders that'll come through the door and um as a part of tachyon and they immediately want to start writing code and and you know we really want to pause them and go you know what do you really understand about the customers in this market what do you really understand about the market let's let's launch some low fidelity solutions so that we can really tease out some of those assumptions before we start incurring all this dev debt and i think that's really important especially in the web 3 space especially if you're doing something like around d5 where you start needing things like security audits with which are both you know lengthy um and expensive processes you could you could burn through a lot of time and a lot of capital unless you have a really strong understanding of your market and the users in your market so really important um traction and community you know i think it's especially in the web free space you know being able to build a community and build out in public again i touched on this already so i'm not going to belabor this point but um i will just say the the difference between a project and a startup is a customer literally everything you do from building a team to executing a product roadmap to raising money to you know going through the legal loopholes of having to or not loopholes excuse me the the legal um uh you know transition you need to make to setting up the delaware c corp it is all in the name of serving users and serving your community and the best founders in web3 that we've found are ones that build in public openly and harness their community as they validate ideas and then bring those users and bring that community along for the ride um we've got some great mentors as a as a part of tachyon who have done a lot within the open source space and being able to transition from open source to you know understanding where the value accrues and where startups can can capture some of that value if you're building within the open source space so uh but i think really being able to build a community and harness that community it is really just a massive massive differentiator and and i would just encourage all of you to to openly build in public you know so obviously you know you've got your github repositories and so people can see your code but um you know building communities within you know whether it's telegram or discord or twitter or um you know really good founders are are ones i in my opinion that are also good writers they can take their ideas and and write publicly um so you know medium is a great platform for i think for startups who are building out in public um who want to build their communities but whatever your thing is you know figuring out what your medium is um i would just please strongly encourage you as you start making this transition um you know to to think about how you build out in the out on the open how you building the public and and build a community it'll really be you know a valuable asset for your startups um cool i'm gonna skip this slide uh because i want to save uh enough time for q a um no it's all about you know whether or not you can sustain your competitive advantage um you know how many people in the world can copy what you're doing uh none a few thousands um do you as as a founder or as a founding team have a unique insight in the space that you're building around um you know have you have you not only tapped the subject matter experts in your space but do you have a unique insight that gives you an unfair competitive advance advantage and the question i i always ask our companies when we start kind of poking around the sustainability of their moat is if i give you a six month head start and then spend millions of dollars to come after you with a stronger better faster cheaper alternative how is it that you're going to fend me off and and so starting to think about the moat that you can build for your idea for your project and the defensibility of that mode i think is just really important um cool and then lastly funding you know um i'm sure all of you are very passionate about what you're building you know uh i and i totally get it and so you know as you come out of something like hack fs the question becomes how do i sustain this i want to keep building this you know um so how do you sustain your project and what types of funding are really best suited for your project i think that there's just a lot of options a lot of funding options um you know for for startups especially about three startups um you know there are just a number of grants programs out there so starting to think about you know is this something that we can sustain via grants and is that the best um next step for for what we're building and for our team um you know if you're building in the d5 space obviously there are things like token economic models that you can start thinking about um you know i would strongly encourage you to think about the distribution model i think that's really important if you're thinking about going down that track uh but that's something that's available to you you know again and and again i'm gonna harp on it again i promised i wouldn't but if you've got a strong community um you know that that becomes a lot easier uh you know third option is can you generate revenue um from the project day one and get to what we might call roman profitability um you know it's funny i feel like i have this debate with with founders you know every um uh it was some of our alumni every couple of months um there's almost this uh uh you know um hesitation to talk about the word revenue within this i think i think within the startup community but especially the web 3 community and and i think that's the wrong approach right you know i think if if you have a project if if you can figure out how to accrue value and capture some of that value and be a revenue generating project from day one it just gives you more optionality um and so again like you know what we really want to see founders continue on with their projects um and so i i think it's a viable option and i think it's one that more web three startup founders should think about and then lastly obviously if if your project is a venture size scale startup there are a number of options uh you know a number of routes that you can go there are angels there are accelerators there are incubators there are microc funds their precede funds you know all the way up to seed and and series a uh funds you know most projects i think within this stage um will probably you know you know their friends and family didn't you know i didn't bring that up you know but that um that's another option i think most most project projects at this stage are probably great candidates for angels accelerators incubators maybe micro um microseed funds and so that's definitely an option especially as you start answering some of the questions that we just went through um within uh you know whether or not this is a a scalable project for you um oh cool so uh yeah you know if if you are looking to make the jump over to um you know turning this project of yours as a part of hack fs into a full-time startup um we'd love to meet you we'd love to talk to you we're actually doing virtual office hours over the next couple weeks um you can go to um in fact i should uh just bring up my uh i'll i'll share this in the chat um and i don't know if uh if trent or or emily if you guys can share the website it's um labs.consensus.net tachyon you can find out more information about the program again applications are currently live and close on august 21st um you know there's an option to book 15 minute virtual office hours with us we'd love to meet you we'd love to talk to you um and then um and then as a as a sponsor of hack fs um hackathon winning teams are guaranteed an interview is a part of their application to file coin launch pad accelerator so um i was talking with jacob yesterday taking a look at some of the projects that that that are uh uh that have already been submitted and just really really impressed with what all of you are building and what you're up to and we're all really really excited i think um you know i get excited thinking about you know what's next for the web3 ecosystem uh and um and distributed storage is just something that um you know i think is really really important that i think the ethereum community and the and the the ipfs filecoin community i just i start getting really excited about um you know thinking about the possibilities and you know when you start thinking about things like distributed storage communicating directly with smart contracts and what kind of new business models that opens up um you know it's it's uh it's the wild west right now it's an early frontier but but i'm really really excited to see um what everybody's building uh and so with that i think um yeah i really want to leave enough time for um for q a so i'm going to stop sharing my screen for one second uh there we go can you guys see me okay yep awesome great cool gabriel that was that was great um i i know one or two questions came in on the chat channel from mustafa um i don't know if you can see the questions um or if you'd like me to read it out quickly oh i think he muted gabriel there you go how's this [Laughter] uh mustafa can you i'm going through chat and i'm not seeing mustafa's question uh it's do you take equity in the companies you invest in and do you accept solo funded founders um yes you uh we will work with solo founders and then um yes we do take equity we are uh again we are usually the first check into a company um so it's 80k for seven percent um the the good thing about this program is because of the the consensus and protocol ops partnership is you actually get both companies on your cap table for the same seven percent um and so again for those of you that have built startups before as you start thinking about um raising money coming out of an accelerator pro program having two really strong companies on your cap table like that i think really strengthens your fundraising so yes to answer the question uh we make an investment in your company eighty thousand dollars um for seven percent between the the two companies okay great mustafa i hope that answered your question you welcome to unmute yourself and um okay crazy says thanks cool does anyone um want to mute themselves and ask gabriel some questions please feel free don't be shy while we wait i'm just going to drop in we have an faq on the website as well but i'm just going to drop it in here um there's a lot of we've gotten a ton of questions obviously over the years so um if you're if you're shy uh i can probably guess what some of your questions would be um i'd be surprised if we didn't address at least some of them within within this faq doc but uh yeah i would love to if i can answer any questions or if you want to talk about your project a little bit uh yeah i'm i'm here to uh to help out in any way that makes the most sense yep uh i had a question um for the the timeline it's gonna be basically this entire fall until january right and it's expected that your project would be full time throughout that period is that right yeah that's exactly right yeah so like how do we like if we have jobs or other obligations how do we how are we enabled to put those on hold i mean i mean i could potentially do that but at the same time then bills still get need to get paid how does that work yeah completely understand so obviously we're making an investment of 80k um you know and and so you can use that capital for a number of purposes including your living expenses um but i think attacking an accelerator is really for uh people who are who are trying to like want this to be their full-time project and so yes you would go through the fall it culminates in a demo day as a part of that demo day we bring investors who will listen to your pitch listen you know take a look at your project a number of our companies raise their follow on round usually a seed size round um and somebody stopped me if i'm like talking if i'm getting too much into like vc lingo but um but a number of our of our teams end up raising their next round as a part of their demo day uh or coming out of their demo day so really this is this is for projects making the transition into full-time like this is the this is their startup this is their baby this is the thing they want to be committed to for the next five six seven eight years um and so that that initial investment yep so that 80k is for this program that lasts through it's not for after potentially it's for yeah no no no yeah yeah it's it's we we are making an investment in your company we fully expect that you know this will take care of portion of your living expenses any operating expenses as as you you know obviously you want to be very um frugal with your with your burn so that you can extend your runway uh but yeah this adk is an investment for for teams that includes you know portion of your living expenses as as you like really start hacking on this and trying to turn this into you know a really venture sized um startup i have one more so i have never had a startup but what is the difference between a regular startup and a venture-sized startup that's a great question um i think the the biggest differentiator so i'm an entrepreneur and i think the word startup gets thrown out thrown around quite a bit you know i've built all kinds of businesses i've built consulting businesses i've built fintech uh you know technology companies i've built prop tech companies which are just basically you know real estate software companies um i've built media companies i've built consulting companies um i think the the biggest differentiator between like a venture backed or venture-sized startup versus um just any old like you know me and a couple buddies you're gonna go start a consulting business is um is you're really competing in a market where you can get significant size and scale um you know where where where you think your your project can grow to you know affect or or get users in you know tens of thousands you know really we start thinking about in the web 3 space you know what's the potential market size within blockchain within web3 so you know tens of thousands of users and or a very sizable market um you know that that you're building in um that can hit a lot of scale a lot of growth um cool yeah that answers my questions thanks cool great to meet you um veronica asked a question it sounds like you're targeting protocol level projects that are tools for other projects you sponsor projects that are more customer facing yeah that's a great question so if you go to the website labs.consensus.net slash tachyon we actually have three verticals um we actually want to see the way that we thought about this program is is again uh whether you're building on top of ipfs and filecoin uh or you think that you can build on top of ipf as a synthetic coin i think veronica what we're really looking for is we've thought about you know in verticals we've thought about the infrastructure layer we've thought about the middleware layer and then we thought about the application layer and we want to see teams and projects in all three so that core infrastructure layer is really about developer tools you know that support encryption file management retrieval basic onboarding things like that for us the middle middleware layer are you know platforms that really shoot the integration and usage of ipfs into other applications so things that are more like plug-and-play uh with daps or defy toolkits or data analytics um tools on top of ipfs and filecoin and then that third layer the third uh layer of the onion if you will is kind of that application layer which is i think what you're referring to and we would love to see tools that are utilizing ipfs or or filecoin as part of their core tech stack um for end user applications so things like file sharing or archival tools or various dapps um we've even heard about a couple of companies that are doing some really interesting stuff with them with d5 and ipfs integrations which i think is really interesting and really cool um so yeah i'm really glad you asked that question um i would love to see companies that are building at all three because i think all three are really really important especially within within this you know really early mason community you're welcome good good to meet you as well um i'm just going through here uh what do you think is most needed in the decentralized lab great question jay um i don't know if this is the answer that you're looking for um but i think a lot more focus on users and traction and growth i think um you know in in web 3 we we tend to think that we're just very different than web 2 and i think there are a lot of great principles that we can pull from from web to but i think one of the most important ones is starting with focusing on users um you know a lot of times we you know we'll see a team of just like really really smart technical people or engineers um but but they haven't done the really difficult work of understanding users and what are those pain points and how can how can we use technology to to alleviate some of those pain points um which is i think a key and crucial to to growth um so probably probably more of a 30 000 foot view answer to your question than maybe what you're looking for um i think if we want to get more into like key components of the stack um i think onboarding and user friction especially on on on the the ui side ux ui side as far as onboarding into web3 is still very very difficult we have a great company that came out of 3 called transact which i think is really making us a strong push into that space but um i want to see more users in in this ecosystem probably just like you um and that's still you know a big need i think within within the web 3d ecosystem um cool just looking through comments here emily help me if i miss some of these but i see one from satoshi here uh what if my project competes with one of consensus's core products uh product offerings like in fura benefit the water if you're in file coin blockchain ecosystem so josie i would love to know what you're building um and yeah 100 we we would still um you know if if what you're building is is needed if it's a good idea if you have the ability to execute i don't care if you're competing against against consensus uh yeah that's completely fine with us josh uh yeah here let me drop them in i'll drop them in um chat here uh transact uh right there thank you you're welcome uh gravin hopefully i pronounce your name correctly uh let me see if i can as an investor how do you think about the tension of building a business model versus maintaining trust of the community if a company is trying to build public good infrastructure that is a great question um i think both are needed uh you know and and um i really challenge teams to um to not think of it as either or again like um robert droust uh who's a part of consensus heads up our r d um and and john purcell is actually another one within the consensus ecosystem um i've had a number of conversations with them around companies that have made the pivot from open source to figuring out how they can add additional features or benefits um you know to to the core product to figure out where that value is going to accrue as they start thinking about the the transition to business model i know that's not a direct answer to your question um but it's definitely it's definitely a attention and i think it's it's an important tension um but i i really do try to challenge companies to think about um how do you sustain yourself right and so having a you know having a business model where you can capture a portion of the value i think it's important to leave a lot of the value on the table for the community um especially if you're utilizing that community especially if you're open source right but especially if you're utilizing that community to to um to assist you in in growing and and getting size and scale um you can and should use or leave a good amount of that value on the table for the community um but you've got to sustain yourself and i think especially if you're building something that is key or important for the ecosystem uh you know it it would be unfortunate if you were no longer around if your project was no longer around and that community really depended on it so figuring out how you sustain yourself i think is really really important um that really depends on what you're building um and what the potential business model is but i i think web 3 is starting to open up some really really interesting and unique business models that just didn't exist before you know i mean um you know i was reading uh reading an article this morning um from dragonfly research on you know the the uniqueness of uniswap uh you know we've had many conversations with hayden and that team but like thinking about how that company came about um and really changed you know that the you know morphed into this decentralized exchange i think their first product was like 300 lines of code um and how they built that incentive mechanism for lps who want to be liquidity providers and add to those pools um you know they've figured out a business model in order to sustain themselves um and i think that's really important you know what three companies need to think about that um again especially if you're building something that is it that is important that the community relies on um yeah how does he just make money uh uh [Music] we could i we can touch on that i think maybe a little later i want to i want to keep our q a focused uh for right now alex but if you want to email me happy to have that have that conversation with you uh yeah gabriel i think there was a message from nazarina oh nazarino yeah did i talk to you yesterday uh as a part of the kernel community yeah okay uh good to see you again good to talk to you again [Laughter] uh me and christian we're building rap file coin and if i play minimus like wallet do you think this is good i i love the pitch in the chat uh i love the hustle um uh i would have to know a little bit more about the project um but at first blush yeah i think it would be super interesting i'd love to um i'd love to hear more i'd love to see an application from you guys and learn a little bit more about the project and what you're building uh oh veronica there are a few of us in both colonel and hack fest all right well i love it [Laughter] [Music] well you guys have already seen this presentation then but welcome back um let me just go through the chats bitcoin 2.0 satoshi i think i answered this question yeah i don't think you've missed any so far um awesome but uh if anyone would like to unmute and ask a question that's also a possibility cool oh alex alex oh i think i looked at your uh your project uh this morning uh yeah the team from from ukraine uh i know this isn't a question but um since since you guys are from ukraine uh obviously filecoin launchpad accelerator is is global in nature so we would love to see teams from all over the world apply uh yeah i'm really excited to see you know what various teams come up with x consensus employees are welcome to tachyon uh yeah sure 100 we do not discriminate we we are supporters of the ecosystem we are supporters of um of really amazing projects uh so if you if you have something that you're building satoshi uh that's really interesting um that we really believe in and and think is important that we'd love to put skin in the game uh and by investing in your company um i don't care who you used to work for i'd love to talk to you and i'd love to see your project um i would like to ask about business models for dubs for blockchains etc so far i cannot see that there are any successful business models except like uh you're building a blockchain and you're actually tokens and uh yeah you can buy our tokens and then you make even x2 and and everyone is happy even extreme but other business models like convenient business models um like where you cut the percentage of transactions transaction fee and uh advertisements i cannot imagine that it works if because if there is a successful project i mean from i don't know technical point of view yeah and anybody can launch a special launch especially if there are uh companies with uh huge markets if you have huge amounts of money they can take this successfully working technical product and yeah you can buy a very good team of experts and they will learn everything in three months and like yeah easily and they can put in advertisement huge amount of money how we can compete with this i mean how can you put this uh transaction fee cut in transactions it doesn't it will not work so even today g5 projects started to take zero fee so just use our product and we will be happy for this no problem just we don't take anything don't need it yeah why is it mine is that's it yeah yeah so you raised a really good point um trent thank you by the way for dropping this in i i haven't seen this github repo in probably a year and a half this is an awake a ko classic uh the the various business models around web 3. um i think um alex you're raising a good point um i would say you know as somebody who's built a number of startups within the web 2 space um you know who who now um is very passionate about seeing you know web 3 um you know evolve and grow and grow up a little bit i don't think we've explored all the various business models and in fact i i think there are even more business models available to us like i have so i've been having this conversation with um with more and more people over the last couple months um it really started with um with jesse walden who um you know for those who don't know he launched um a16z crypto startup school and uh and now has a small fun as he's starting to um you know invest in early stage web 3 companies and he and i both are really really passionate around what's kind of been dubbed the passion economy um you know so the in the last company that i built it was a is a digital media business we've scaled it up to um hundreds of millions of maus monthly active users and um and we did a lot within the influencer marketing space and you know and so this is a perfect example as you start thinking about you know these platforms that get built you have influencer marketers that start coming along who can incentivize their community via things like micro payments to participate in their success as they start to grow and scale you know we haven't really tapped into and these are things that just become available via you know things not not just d5 protocols um but where code is is really kind of managing the transactions as opposed to human interactions and we we really haven't explored all of these business models i think what we're going to see is just this cambrian explosion especially as 2.0 starts to come online just this cambrian explosion of new business models i think a lot of them will will be derivatives from the web 2 ecosystem that we will start to take and repurpose and plug into some some of the code um i would agree with you there there has not been a massive explosion of you know new business models um yet uh but but uh but i think they're coming um you know i'm very bullish on this um and uh trent thank you again for for dropping in this github repo um you know i think you know a number of people got it def was it was this devcon like two years ago or something like that where where uh the the um the business model rings group got together and started like archetyping all these really cool potential business models that web3 could adapt yeah i like i i just think that there there are so many new and interesting business models that can and will come online um we're just going to have to keep building and be a little patient because they they are on their way but but i think we're getting really really close i know that wasn't a direct answer to your question i apologize i apologize i kind of sidestepped it really i saw the supposter and read through it and it's it's interesting but the biggest issue here right now is that dubs and blockchains they appreciate open source and the one solution is open source and especially if license uh allows to have a private um modifications et cetera how can you protect especially in some crazy countries like yeah eastern europe [Laughter] cool um yeah so making the transition from open source to you know um value capture um is a uh is an artness and a science in and of itself um again we've got a couple people within the consensus network that have done a lot within within that that space um i'm i'm definitely not an expert in how open source projects um start to make that transition um you know i would probably introduce you to a couple people within the consensus network who have done it and spent a lot of time thinking about it um you know it's especially as you start thinking about the the various um you know open source licenses that exist i think there there's a way to navigate it uh but but there is there is a way to navigate it um and i'm trying to think of a of a really good example um of a project that came out that was open source that came out of a hackathon and made the pivot into one of the teams that we we funded um god i'm drawing a blink on um on who would be a a good example actually um here i'll give you a project right now um so in our last batch idol started out as an open source project um they're an interest rate optimization uh d5 company um they were if if i'm not mistaken they were one of the winners of one of the eighth global hackathon events um god maybe a year ago was not it was not east denver i can't remember which one it was but they started out as an open source project um before they turned idle into their full-time startup um they changed the business model a little bit they changed the product a little bit and made that transition so it's definitely doable um you know i'm certainly not an expert in that arena and again um you know depending on the nature of of your company um you know there are a number of ways that you need to make that pivot especially depending on the the open source license that you begin with um but but i would definitely steer you into something like a robert droust with that who heads up r d within consensus or somebody like that who has a lot of expertise uh around the the um the open source to value capture uh transition um satoshi great point um tyrone let me get to your question what parameters do you think to consider to understand the timing of your product is right or not uh that's a great question tyrone hopefully i'm pronouncing your name correctly i apologize um if i'm not um um the the most important parameter i i think is whether or not you're getting traction um and there's a lot of there's a lot of ways that you can get that signal um you know again when you're in a um when you're in an environment like hack fs you're doing a lot of hacking you're doing a lot of building you know you a lot of heads down maybe you're writing code um and so you really focus on product but as you start to pop your head up a little bit i think you want to spend a little bit more time within um who are you building this product for and if you can get any any signal around what you've built as far as demand from users and there's a lot of ways that you can go about doing that um we spend a lot of time with projects within tachyon thinking about that but again that goes back to like can you build a community can you build an open um you know there's a number of different platforms that you can use to try to get market signal uh but i think that's probably the most important one uh great point trent yeah thank you for that um uh from satoshi on the open source point is there a license requirement like only except apache 2.0 uh no no no license requirements uh satoshi scrolling through here um i should actually find idles original github repo so you can get you guys could see um because they started out as an open source project uh great team there's another one actually that we looked at that we didn't it didn't end up investing in called affigato um there i think they were building a stable coin around coffee beans to help protect coffee bean farmers uh in la dam um they i know they started out as a uh as an open source project before they made the pivot to um trying to build a business model which i believe is a is a transaction fee if i remember correctly uh but that was a really interesting team they were very passionate about coffee and protecting coffee farmers um several members of the team uh you know came out of that industry um so that's another one um that probably point you guys too i know they were they were at if denver um uh this year because i was there and i saw them um cool trent emily how we doing on time i think we've got one more minute right maybe maybe one more question if somebody has one i'm not sure if anybody wants to have the last question gabriel [Music] that was a shout out thank you uh all of us if i if i pronounce that correctly if if not uh maybe i just got digged and i don't know it um awesome uh well i would just say i'm super super excited about um you know the projects that i've been seeing um within the hack fest community uh you know we've obviously been um partners and big supporters of the youth global uh team for a while and and i just know you know they always bring out the best projects and the best hackers and the best builders and i'm really excited about thinking about the possibilities um between the ethereum and ipfs fog coin communities um and so again if you're interested in learning more about tachyon i'll just drop it in the chat here one more time you can visit us at labs.consensus.net slash tachyon um you can learn a little bit more about the program uh there's an faq on there um we are doing virtual office hours as well so if you want to book a 15-minute slot with the team with a member of the team and just talk a little bit more maybe learn a little bit more about the program or talk about your project

copy link address um there's a link on the website where you can uh where'd my chat window go there's a link on the website where you can book a 15-minute slot um with a member of our team oh thank you josh yeah okay um yeah we would love to meet you and um again like you know even if you're you're not quite sure but you you really are passionate about your project you want to try to try to make that transition from from a hackathon project to having this be your full-time endeavor we'd love to see you apply i'd love to meet your team um you know we'll be going through applications over the next couple of weeks we'll we'll be setting up interviews with teams that we want to progress through the process working closely with the protocol labs team um you'll have access to the consensus network you'll have access to the protocol labs network um and so we would just love to learn more about you and your startup and what you're building uh i'm i i think uh uh yeah we're just really excited so i appreciate the opportunity to talk to you guys today um if i if i can answer anything for you uh definitely book a virtual office hours with us and uh and we'll spend 15 minutes with you
