[Music] you all right let's uh let's get started hey everybody uh my name is kartik one of the co-founders of the global and uh welcome to hack fs uh hacketfest is a hackathon organized by global in partnership with protocol labs and we're super excited for everybody here today and also who's gonna be watching this video after uh to uh to see what our projects have done so today is day two of judging and uh as a quick summary of uh how this event has been so far over the past month we've had 470 hackers from 50 different countries and working across 19 different times to participate at this hackathon and uh they've worked super hard over the past four weeks uh on their projects and as of two days ago uh we got them to submit what they were working on and we're kicking off a whole week of demo and judging where we'll see a handful of projects showcase what they've done to everybody and on this this live stream but also across the the whole ecosystem and on social media and we're excited to sort of see what everybody has built and uh and go from uh there so on top of all this thing we were super impressed by what everybody had done and i'm super excited to announce that we got 132 projects uh for this event and we're taking today to uh see about 13 of them uh in giving everybody here a peak of what our developers and hackers we're working on so before we kick off to our demos i want to go over some quick logistics about how the event itself was set up and how json is going to work and uh the quick highlight here is that there's going to be 13 teams today and each team will be getting four minutes for a demo and uh four minutes for a q a and to minimize any av issues uh we've asked all the teams to pre-record their demos which they will be playing uh as they come on and after their demos and uh we'll be moving into a live q a with the teams directly in terms of how the event itself was set up uh the rules were simple uh every project can be worked on uh with a a group uh and a few teammates if you were working on a with a team you could have up to five members on your team uh it was also totally all right for you to work individually for your project and as a rule everything that you see here uh was written over the course of the last month so everything you've seen here was built here in the hackathon and the only qualifier for uh them being eligible for hackathons was that their project must incorporate the tools and technologies from the protocol as an ethereum ecosystem so a lot of cool things we're going to see today are really interesting mashups of what decentralized storage and smart contracts can't enable more supervised edit or for everybody else to see that as well so in terms of how the judging itself is going to work uh we have five categories that our judges will be creating more projects on and they'll be looking at a project on how technical original and how practical the idea and the submission is and on top of all that how easy it is to use from a from the end user's perspective whether it's a developer tool which is on the developer experience side or if it's a web or mobile app on visibility of how uh how easy it is to grasp uh the ideas and then we also have a category we've let you call the bio factory which helps us incorporate any catch-alls that we may have missed uh from the four categories before or above so uh before we kind of really go into the demos when i really emphasize that this is not a competition uh this event itself will structure to be a place for hackers to learn uh what is possible uh with both the fall coin and with their ecosystem and the hackers really here to share their sideline and showcase what they've done over the past four weeks and moreover the edges that are here with us today are on uh for the purpose of giving more feedback and learning more about what they think this can be if they the teams continue to work on these projects and just to be really clear not everybody here is trying to become a business so while you'll see some projects that are totally going to continue working on and go become something more than just a hack uh the goal for us is to really encourage experimentation and and have everybody play with what's actually possible with the world of web 3. so the quick schedule for today is these are the projects that are going to be demoing today and uh doing the hard job are three judges uh so we have david mahal who was an independent engineer with their meca system we have ant mcguire from the protocol lab side and we have brett gibson who's the investor at visualize capital uh these three judges will be with us for the next two hours uh talking to all of our teams and projects and giving their feedback and asking them questions and uh with all that i want to welcome all three of our judges and also our very first project for for today uh for day two of judging and uh i'd like to call up hoya protocol to come and kick off with our first demo so please welcome leah onto the webinar hey everybody we're team oya we're demoing the product listings and affiliate programs for oya are the centralized e-commerce protocol our team members are ibu fanucha jancha and joshupek centralize e-commerce platform try to maximize profit and power for themselves at the expense of their users by decentralizing product listing we remove a key lever of control for big marketplaces we all know the current system is broken but let's look more closely at how it fells denise had the jury business and sells online she has to release her whole inventory to join a new marketplace creating platform lock-in she also has to reveal sensitive business data pay his fees and lose direct interaction with customers with kovit 19 her brick-and-mortar partners were forced to close and she is more reliant than ever on centralized online markets three is an instagram influencer and affiliate marketer she gets paid by affiliate programs at you trackers that invade her fan privacy her business took a big hit when amazon slots affiliate fees during the covid19 crisis when other companies sit between brie and her sellers she gives a ball control thomas likes to support small businesses unfortunately when shopping online he has few options outside of a handful of big companies with covid19 closing physical retail stores he has fewer choices than ever sellers buyers and affiliates funnel money into big companies and more importantly they funnel huge amounts of valuable and sensitive data accumulating money and data centralized marketplaces grow into tech monopolies product listing sells history inventory marketing data traffic flow consumer interest reviews and more and this data accumulates and benefits the tech monopoly but only the tech monopoly the growing profits have to come from somewhere as competitors die or get consumed it has to come from the users centralized marketplaces that value growth above all else inevitably work against a public interest oya is different it's an open source e-commerce protocol owned and run by the community denise join oya to take advantage of the low feeds which allow her to lower prices for customers she also loves oya's decentralized product listing which let her list her products once and sell them anywhere affiliates can easily market and sell her products for her berry loves zoya because she deals with sellers directly and doesn't need to install trackers smart contracts handle orders so bri gets paid automatically when the order is complete thomas loves the lower prices he gets from sellers on oia he also likes supporting sellers and affiliates directly and the security of knowing his payments are held securely in smart contracts until the orders are complete let's see how the oya affiliate program works three asked denise to add her as an affiliate denise approves brie as an affiliate in the affiliate registry smart contract free guest product details from one of denise's decentralized listings on ipfs and creates a buy button for her site thomas discovers denise's necklace on bree's site he buys the necklace creating an order smart contract that holds the money in escrow denise receives an ordered notification and ships a necklace thomas accepts the delivery denise and brie are paid automatically denise brie and thomas all earn oya tokens that give them greater control over the protocol let's watch denise create a product listing the oya product listing tool is hosted on fleek using textile buckets and ipfs denise connects with metamath so we know her ethereum address she enters her product details and photos this creates a decentralized product listing on ipfs and the listing lives in a textile bucket with a persistent url and the product version has a unique cid if she edits the listing the url stays the same but the cid changes she can pin the cid with pinata or back it up with filecoin in case there's a dispute later and the arbitrator has to review the old product listing affiliates like brie can use a product listing and buy button to sell the product literally anywhere the buy button creates an order smart contract on ethereum you can try the tool at oya dot market slash hack fs our smart contracts are on test net and we're building out governance and community join us at oya dot market awesome that was a really cool demo and uh thanks for continuing to work on this thing from from hack money so with that i want to kick off our very first q a session so i want to just invite all three of our judges to ask any questions that they have for uh for this team i can jump in this uh four weeks ago um cool yeah great great presentation i love the uh i love the graphics and just kind of the whole presentation of everything um i guess one of the big questions uh that seems like you kind of hinted at was how does uh dispute resolution work and of course in the sense of like someone doesn't get the product or something yeah and that's something um we actually started this on the last hackathon so we didn't go into too much detail about the arbitration process but basically there's an arbitrator that's decided in advance that if there's a dispute between the buyer and seller the arbitrator decides um who gets paid and we're thinking through how to do that in a decentralized way um but uh it could be fleshed out a little bit right now it's just kind of a placeholder ethereum address that both the buyer and seller agreed this is the person who arbitrates cool thanks awesome i really really enjoyed your presentation as well um talk us through this the the tech stack like what were what were the biggest challenges that you can have faced um obviously you've put a lot of different things together so what was the kin of the hardest part of that for you i think josh could probably talk to this um i think just kind of figuring out which tools to use for the different pieces um and for me at the beginning i didn't i mean i didn't even know about ipfs before this um so just like learning about it and then i kind of had this realization i was like oh like we could use the cid as a unique marker for a product listing like as a container for it and so that had some benefits of like then we know like the text and the images haven't changed like that this you know token represents um the actual um product listing that the person bought and if something changes in the future like it's gonna change that token and so um that was a cool thing to realize but yeah just kind of understanding the space and how the pieces fit together awesome like how far how far along were you in terms of like being able to get all the pieces come together like what what parts would you be hacking on at um yeah there's a lot of a lot of stuff to do um and we're still the like actually we had some issues hooking up the actual like order smart contract like to actually make that connection like we built the two pieces and we haven't like got them exactly talking to each other um but and also the other thing that's really interesting for me is um like how can how can you make it searchable because right now like you just it's up there and like i can send you a link to it but like how people are gonna find it um so that's another piece that we're looking at so you don't need to look into some other like decentralized data store um i guess when you would store the listings yeah and there's something called oip it's the open index project i think um and they're listing it's more for like um digital content um but it's a blockchain where you can list stuff and then then they have like searches on the blockchain um so that was something we were looking at integrating into in the future so many uh final questions from our judges if not want to congratulate this team and we can uh move on to our second project thanks thanks yeah that's super cool congrats on demoing so uh with that i'd like to call up uh nonce in uh project knots you can uh kick off your uh screenshot okay um we're team nuns um and i'm gonna play the video hello my name is elton park and i'm going to introduce you to nuns which is a decentralized web indexer i hope you like it we've been consuming the information on the internet thanks to gigantic mappings that were maintained by big agents such as google in the decentralized space however it's rather complicated to keep track of all the information because the system is designed not to have superior authorities but that doesn't mean that we cannot crawl the decentralized web and in fact we have to make it happen since otherwise it will be impossible to harness the full potential of it let's think about torrent for a moment it uses torrent files to help locate the resources on the peer-to-peer network and those torrent files are being distributed from communities such as pirate bay my project initially drew inspiration from this non-cis designed to walk on either a main service which has human readable names for long hash values some of those hash values refer to the addresses of resources on ipfs so that's how non scrapes and analyzes data on ipfs furthermore the task of crawling is also intended to be done in a collaborative fashion for that we propose rand which is a subsystem composed of a smart contract and an off-chain module to help delegate work to peer nodes rand randomly selects a peer node in order to avoid collusion architecture looks like this at the moment nuns is using infira to access decentralized web let me show you the demo so it by far has collected around 10 000 records on ens in the web application you can see a list of entries if you click it you'll move to the web document and also you can check the transaction history of the resolver crawling is now done based on the predefined english keywords which will be re-engineered pretty soon as you can see all the crawled data is being stored on the aws dynamodb i've also come up with a simulation of work delegation three worker notes and one delegator node launch when the beating starts the smart contract generates a random value based on the collected pledges from all the participants and one of the worker nodes is notified that he is chosen so he does the task for the demo i defined a dummy test that simply writes data to the database nonce is an ongoing project and there are still many things i couldn't have done during this hackathon among others i plan to re-engineer the crawling mechanism and release it to public in the latter half of this year so that is what i have thank you for your time and i'll be happy to answer your questions great thank you for that demo i'll let our judges jump in yeah i mean that was super super interesting it makes sense that um you're gonna have to tap into like all the a bunch of extra mechanisms to to index the decentralized web i i'm not sure i understood the starting part is um were you also talking about storing the index in a decentralized manner and like could you could you like review that oh yeah so the well the idea is to create an indexer like a search engine for the decentralized web but my question at the beginning was uh will i be able to execute it with my peer notes not just me because if i if i were to be the one that is exclusively collecting the information about the data in the decentralized web um i i may not be able to consider that as a decentralized way of collecting the information of the decentralized web so yeah so that's why i devised a little mechanism to work together with the other volunteering peers to crawl the data on the decentralized web so it's like a collaborative crawling process yeah so the so the the whole point here is not to become google is to become decentralized google in a way um so can you clarify what are the um the on-chain transactions what are those doing the are you talking about the rent the smart contract thing or i think you showed in sorry my internet kind of a little bit so i might have missed this but it looked like there were transactions being sent as part of this indexing yeah oh so yeah that's uh yeah so that's a work delegation um part of this project um so what it does internally is it um it allows some participating notes or volunteering knows to become part of this whole crawling task so they can um they can actually send the transaction to this smart contract called rend and when um when it has a certain threshold a certain number of volunteering node it'll start the selecting round like randomly selecting the node and when a node is picked he can he can be notified about the information of the work in this case uh it's crawling and you can start um the crawling task yeah cool thank you i don't have any questions more like i think this is just like a huge project to take on especially as one person so like i have a huge amount of admiration for like the kind of ambition there um yeah and it's just really exciting to see a lot of the new stuff like d-rand is obviously something that we're working on internally at pro school labs so like to speak in early use cases appreciate your feedback did you um so did you i mean i guess i assume you focus mostly on the integration parts and did you like grab like off-the-shelf crawling libraries or you know like what what is the actual stack here um it's pretty much simple i've used web3 ipfs infura and that's about it yeah i didn't get to use textile or pinata or other some fancy cool text tech i wish i had more time no it's uh it's great the um the best thing about this demo is that uh it immediately solves the problem the demo before this highlighted so uh so i'm just glad that this worked out and this was totally an accident i'm not playing in any form and uh i'm glad to hear that uh yeah you can continue working on this thing so congrats again on uh on this demo and we're going to move on to our third demo for today and that is team ipfs scholar so i'll let uh ipfscaller start with their with their demo video thank you or for that thanks thanks i see um eric and newly on uh the webinar are you able to start your screen share yeah hi hello so uh we begin to show our video first that sounds perfect uh i just realized that this is actually on me for uh i i misread one of the notes so i actually have to play this video and i'll do that in one second uh oh i realized that i messed up my own advice on sound there we go okay let me enter our project ipfs scholar here is our vision about how it works first the order will acknowledge the paper and store it in every phase and the fair query network second the reader views the paper by category and or by keyword third readers who download the papers must appear a certain amount of affair coin to their contributors let's jump to family the home page is mainly composed of our search box under certain subject classification there are two ways to retrieve papers certain first class disciplines classified the academic papers of each subject entering each spring you can retrieve the corresponding academic papers you can search through the search box for academic materials contained in the entire ipfs and the faircoin network after clicking search icon the page will display the title and object of the paper related to keywords with the paper is what you need the reader can be filtered and click on the people of interest to download then the system will according to the people in merchandise the id ffs and the fair coin network will travel retrieves the fair returns this may take some time now you get the film you can download it the user can choose to download the file path and the orders can be rewarded with file coin this can encourage more users to upload academic papers to ffs and the fair coin network another faction of the platform is to upload files as a shown page for other users can retrieve the paper easily and quickly use up notes needed to choose which subject ever the paper belongs to in addition in order to let the downloaders understand the general content of the people so as to attract users to download a separate summary needs to be uploaded after uploading the paper will be permanently and securely stored in the ipfs and the fair coin network and then there are some other functions you can see our word and you can create a worries address now you are create a what is what is addressed successfully and you can say download request and upload the records saying something that's our demo about our future work thanks cool i guess that's that's that's really cool i think i'm kind of struck by that um you know it's not really limited just to academic papers like there's anything where you need the kind of access model where someone can pay for something through file coin um you know what i guess what what kind of features were you thinking you'd be adding next [Music] yeah yeah what else would you would you build onto that where would you go from here yeah actually the the main problem we want to solve is that now for the scientific papers or other scientific data they are using uh centralized publishing ways so the author they need to pay a lot of work and money to publish their paper and also the reader they need to pay to download or read their paper read the papers and the scientific data so uh we think it's quite expensive ways to share the scientific paper and the data what we are going to do is that we want to do it in a decentralized way use ipfs and file coin network so all the authors can easily publish their scientific data and scientific paper in the decentralized storage like ipfs and the file filecoin network under other readers they also can download it with only pay very little money so uh in this way we think we can make more people will to share the scientific research results and the data in the board so that's what we we want to do in the future with ipfs score cool definitely a really important area i think there's a lot of issues with the current way academic research is is published in that whole system uh the question i had was about in the beginning you showed like a search engine for searching through these papers uh can you tell me about how that search engine works and how maybe these are indexed yeah that's uh uh one usually we need to solve in the future because right now we also use uh a kind of a centralized way for for the essential energy so all the information is stored in a kind of database and users search with keywords so uh but i mean for the hackathon it's difficult for us to do a better century in such a short time so what we are going to improve is how to make a more powerful search engine in a decentralized network for the scientific data so we also want to get some supports from you if we we we kind so that's that's what we need to do in the future great thank you oh that's great i think uh that's right go ahead i think we're out of time but that's okay uh we think of a few seconds left i was going to say i think this is a really interesting theme because we've seen uh kind of just the use of people relying on sci hub and archive for a lot of these papers anyway and having a a way that people can access these files if some of them get banned by your ip or isp is a really interesting uh concept and definitely a pretty big theme in the normal community without them realizing that this has anything to do with decentralized storage but uh censorship resistance on these academic papers is already a big day today yeah thank you great so if there's uh no more questions i want to thank ipfscaller4 for this great demo and we'll move on to our next demo and that is team stuff social so i believe alex is already here and alex if you'd like to kick off with the video um that'd be great okay uh hello i just uh start uh safe words before videos so subsocial is a protocol for decentralized social media built on ipfs this monetization on ethereum we use such technologies like orbit db to store uh content on user site textile buckets to store images and videos i've uploaded and ethereum to pay-per-view for encrypted posts it's optional feature and unstoppable domains to uh authorize through uh dot crypto domain so this is the video hello guys it's a social uh project and uh the goal of social is to let users on their own content and uh create content local first using ipfs technology and uh get paid for their content using ethereum so uh let's see what functionality over here you can sign in using unstoppable domains we check that crypto domain belongs to your ethereum address you can see it over here and then uh we can show you how to how we can preload already i just want to say that this is one user this is another user so just showing interaction in real time data containing posts and images and videos we upload this info information to upload images and videos to uh textile buckets and here we prepared some data for you so you're not bored looking at empty screens so we already created the three spaces spaces uh uh so spaces are here spaces are similar to what you can have like a private uh live private blog or uh subreddit or imagine publication you can post any content and like text or images or videos you can do this in our case and also you can comment on it so um you can see that you can watch the video here so now we will show you how to create a space um so you specify title description then you select some avatar fade uh you provided some social avatar and updates get uploaded to text styles and you can post to the space you can choose between different types of post status article image video so here we will try to upload them a video post okay so we uploaded preview and the video itself and then we have four living spaces so we can build our private personal feed and here we just send creation of space video was uploaded to textile buckets and here you can see that it's plain everything is called and then we go to another window we see that our space appeared and thanks to signal in server and we can synchronize between two different users so you can see that in one screen the uh writing comment from one uh crypto domain account and here we are refreshing page so to see that we have this comment from the guy from the left side and here on the right side we're using right to write comment from another account and refresh on the left side to see that the new comment appeared so comments are working synchronization working and let's go to another post that is a video um okay so okay yeah it's working let's check out the current text style and we can go to style folder um okay so we just stopped the video and yeah so you can see that we have folders this images and videos over here this is content we upload to text style and uh here this user also has its own content in text style and um yeah so we cannot follow and follow spaces and when when fall we have empty space and we can uh lock it uh out on the screen i will show you how you can encrypt content um using knuckle and set the price in ethereum for readers so they can pay for the content and then decrypt it using our supporter servers so when you go to edit post form you can specify title and price for post if it's encrypted to encrypt or not encrypt post you just need to click the shame box and once clicked uh you can copy paste the content over here and when we click create um this encrypts as opposed to this knuckle secret box and uh secret isn't called for somebody service for the public address and then if you're going to view this post you will you will not see the original content you'll see this post is encrypted and you need to pay and for example let's switch to another account so we can sign in with uh um crypto encrypted domains and let's use last domain okay so we successfully signed in and so we already paid for this user so let's click here and when they click on paper to decrypt if your page was disposed uh the current user requests uh the data the secret key from the software service separate service degrades encrypted security and encrypts again for public key of the reader and readers and can decrypt the post content itself by using the secret key so that's it all these functionalities that we've worked on we really tried to touch a lot of stuff in one in one project awesome so there's actually not there's no back end that's all the all all the states being loaded on the client from ipfs so um yes and no because you can run without backhand um but you need service that will hold your secret encrypted encrypted secrets so um i can imagine that uh authors that want to use this encryption feature and to sell access to content they can run on their site it's no problem but uh yeah it could be completely peer-to-peer cool that was a that was definitely a lot of very impressive demo though um in the beginning we just upload preloaded some data set because uh took this to so just to see uh how it looks with different content so i just uploaded it yeah and it looked really good um the thing i was curious about was the i really like this idea of um you know kind of having encrypted content that people can pay to decrypt i think we can you can imagine that's used for music or yeah any kind of creative content and a way to sell it the process of paying to decrypt that is that an interactive process as in it sounded like maybe you pay and then the server sends you like the private key like it encrypts the private key and sends that to you and you can decrypt it is that correct so currently we've implemented in this way that there is third-party service that the author can run and uh once author encrypted content the secret key is encrypted and put into the service and then when gender paid for content it triggers us sort of the service reporter service checks ethereum contract and if this user paid it sends them re-encrypted secrets so user can decrypt it transparently using its own private key so we didn't ask for this private key because they use the center and use this using tweet knuckle library so it's cool so that is that is one server that would be like running basically yeah that should be somebody who keeps secrets it could be centralized service it could be a service per every out or it's uh up to community could be cool that could be like a business model as you have this kind of decentralized social network but um kind of the service providers provide that like they're kind of the ones that are selling information selling the contents that's really cool and alex what's the next steps for the project so i'm sure like you've already tackled a lot um but like what would you like to be able to do next yeah so the bigger vision is that uh well there is a main project it's also called subsocial but um it's uh it's a blockchain on a substrate blockchain framework and we also have webgi for it and just yesterday we launched betternet so it uses blockchain plus ipfs but on this hackathon we created this app from scratch what you seen and here we just tried to use only ipfs so we would like to integrate them so people can use between eventual consistency and uh higher security plus monetization so we have to climb your team what how many people were on your team three people me and two more guys great we're uh we're at time and uh thanks alex and uh if any of you judges have more questions we can send over more details on how to contact any of the teams here and you can ask them uh more details and with that we'll move on to our next demo and that is team building blocks tech so i know both of you are here but feel free to kick off with your demo all right thank you hi i'm parole and my partner is kushiwadwa and we're participating in hack fest 2020 as part of the building blocks technology summer internship program and our project is a task management tool d app and it could also be considered a blockchain using version of kanban so over here we have it running on the localhost environment and i can go ahead and log in and as you can see it uses the metamask wallet so i can go ahead and unlock that and so we're using metamask as our key provider such that we can interact with ipfs as well as using textiles hubs threaddb or database tool for persisting user data and so once it's created the key pair for this session we will be able to access the user dashboard as well as the super supervisor dashboard in order to first see the tasks that i would i am acting on and i'm hoping to complete as well as those that i am overseeing and will give you check off on so if i go to the user dashboard i can see that my tasks are divided up into three sections one that is backlogged in progress and an awaiting approval the backlog tasks are those that i have just created and that i have sent to my supervisor and i'm waiting in terms of whether or not they'll approve it as an acceptable task and in progress it is once my supervisor has accepted that task and awaiting approval is when i've determined that task is actually completed and i would like my supervisor to check off on that so in order to for example add a task i can go here and i can give it a title i could say something very simple like doing homework and i could then give a description of let's see completing english books completing english book report a supervisor could be a teacher and the date well i could try to put in a date that is obviously not valid which would be less than the date today but i'll have to be putting in a date that is after the date so i can put it for the 21st of this month and then i can go ahead and submit it and once i've submitted it i it's i see that it has shown up in my backlog data and it would have went to my supervisor who identify as teacher and in my supervisor dashboard i can see the tasks that i'm that are requesting my approval that i'm currently actively overseeing and those that are requesting a check off and would like me to sign off on that and going back to the technologies used we have the react and node.js framework as mentioned the textiles hub to access ipfs and threaddb for consistent user data as well as the metamask user authentication with the web3 backend solutions three blocks in order to generate a compatible textile identity from the metamask keypair manager that we are using in terms of reflection and future plans this is definitely a great learning experience for exploring blockchain oriented development tools and we're hoping for more documentation and examples with ipfs and filemaking tools we're also waiting on a file coin wallet integration with ipfs or more specifically the project right now in development for using metamask as a file coin wallet also and we're really excited about the future of ipfs and how these technologies can be made more accessible to users whether involved or not in blockchain to reap the benefits of added security and decentralization in the apps and features we'd like to add to uh what we've worked on so far are interaction with the load node lotus node api where users aren't just required to be running a lotus node on their system and this could then be used to create multi-sig wallets where supervisors would reward completed assignments with file coin and that would be awesome so i'll stop it right there because you want to fit over time but any questions yeah oh sorry go ahead go ahead um so this you said this is the first time that you'd really worked with a lot of these tools um what what were the biggest challenges like kind of approaching this this particular stack and how did you find yeah so this there were definitely some challenges presented because before this i had worked on um in the beginning of the summer with smart contracts on the ethereum test nets and using remix so when we joined default or joins attacks on we didn't actually know much about filecoin um and it's only through the taxpayer we figured out so much about it and it was definitely a chat it was exciting it was pretty fun to learn about all the tools that were being developed around fall coin and you know how it's still on test net and we definitely i think the biggest thing going in that we had not expected was how little documentation there was um things were actually even that we had used for in our project these examples were coming in like end of june beginning of july there's definitely a lot of new stuff out there and i'd rather look forward to seeing more documentation and more you know github repos to look through for guidance all that cool nice guys um i really love trellos it was cool kind of seeing this like decentralized trello that's really exciting to see i guess one question i had was kind of how do you see obviously user experience in all these um these new decentralized technologies is always difficult and kind of what are the the challenges of user experience of something like this compared to trello and how do you think those can maybe be addressed yeah based on what means cushy had envisioned in the beginning we really even though we didn't fully plan out we really wanted to create something that wouldn't be specifically limited to users very heavily invested in blockchain because honestly before this year i didn't have much of an idea myself as to what blockchain was outside of cryptocurrency and all the hype surrounding that so when we made this and what we've envisioned the future final project product to look like it should be something that's really easily accessible for us currently that would be metamask because it's one of the easiest i say wallets out there to set up which is why we really look forward to having that completed project you know allowing us to access file coin and lotus node apis through metamask and also um one thing i didn't i wasn't able to cover on because of the video we had to end it but we do plan on adding an additional feature of not only would the with the user receive filecoin by completing a task but that they would be we would be able to calculate a reputation or a reliability score for the user based on their completion of tasks and whether they're meeting the deadlines and this reputation and reliability score would be across for both the users as well as supervisors such that we could then use this to better pair individuals versus on the blockchain and this is a part of their public profile their reputation score then it could be something that you know you could see on a linkedin profile or be used in job applications because this would not only would the amount of file coin received be proportionate to you know the size of the tasks that they're doing but we'd be able to tell okay this person how are they in executing tasks and meeting you know meeting guidelines set by both the supervisors and themselves that reputation thing would be really cool love to see that yeah yeah it's all this is all super interesting it's cool it's really uh cool how you've kind of carved out what like what would what to to uh david's usability point like what parts are actually usable right now and making something um well thank you for your time yeah thanks for uh for demoing and uh really great to hear that this was your first time doing this thing and this is uh still a pretty big milestone in your own development of making this work so well congrats and i hope you continue working on this thing and so with that i'd like to call our next team so uh um i think the team's already here but i'd like to welcome daikons to uh sharon kickoff with their demo hi guys yes correct we are from team daikins and we are going to start with our video straight away welcome dear hack fs judges we are going to present here our hack what did we do we created a decentralized registry for icons which you can connect with your smart contract so what did we do here is a brief overview on our solution so that you can have a look on our looks and then later we are going to show you our web page and how you're able to register an icon for your smart contract what do we have what components do we have so we have a web app where the user is able to interact with our registry contract and it's reachable through an unstoppable domain which i'm going to show you later how it works and what is the user able to do he's going to store an icon for a smart contract in our um or rather register an icon for one of its smart contracts in our contract and the icon is stored on ipfs so the registry contract stores information about which smart contract has which icon and where do you find it on ipfs so as you see down there there are a lot of different smart contracts for example an rc20 contract which wants to have an icon and the unique weapon here with the dotted line you see for example a wallet which can interact with our registry contract and from there load icons for smart contracts to show to the users let's move over to our website so we have here daikins as you can see it is store fleek to show you that our unstoppable domain is working here we have daikons dot registry dot crypto if i go on this i'm using the um which resolves the domain here we have already uh a registry entry where we have a test owner contract and here this is the address of the smart contract on the gurley test network and here you see the path to the icon which is this cue doc over here on ipfs this information here the path and the address are stored in the solidity contract and this icon over here is stored in ipfs so what can we do i'm going to show you how to register one what we can do here is that we connect with metamask so now it's connected through the girli network i'm going to use a smart contract which we already deployed on girly so or you just type in here the address a smart contract name for something here is an example we currently have maker inside i can call it heck yes registry contract uh what kind kind of type of smart contract is it is an rc 20 721 whatever i'm going to call it registry and here you can input a file we are going to use now the ipfs logo and we're going to upload it and all what we have to do is just go on register so what it's doing here currently it's uploading it to ipfs here you see successfully uploaded and it's already pinned by pinata i have to confirm here the transaction and it has been registered in our smart contract reloading the web page you see that here the contract with the icon is registered and visible on the web page so now everyone is able to access this icon and show it for example in their wallet or some other ones thank you all right that was the video awesome this is cool i like um i mean it's definitely a uh it was a narrow scope but i think sometimes neroscope projects are like the most uh the most like realistic the ones that like like this would have a lot of use today this kind of reminded me of unstoppable domains or ens but but for icons so that was obviously something that would be super useful today i don't think i have any questions so cool likewise yeah sorry sorry um what i tried to do to this kind of particular problem um you know of all the things that you could have decided to do like why why was this the the issue that you went after just curious why we went after this one um well we had a little like a brainstorming session on what exactly we want to do during this hackathon and taking into account that we have also full-time jobs and everything so we had to think about what kind of solution can we build you know after after work um that we could not spend all day long on it and then we were thinking okay one problem was actually that you have a lot of different like wallets or something where they are store you can store different coins but they don't have an icon or it's a process you have to go and tell them hey this is the icon for example for the maker contract or different ones and that was like okay this could be a solution where people can register it and all different kind of apps wallets or different ones can go to this registry and just load than the icon so yeah a project we we could accomplish in a fair amount of time next to our full-time jobs cool makes sense awesome thank you yeah it's cool i mean i like the the the technology sort of fit naturally together so it made sense um like david said the picking picking of the scope made you made it able to be looks like it's pretty functional maybe one question from my end is kind of sure what uh what's kind of the steps for you as a team now um given that a lot of constraints haven't changed in terms of you have other responsibilities but are you going to work on this thing and can i improve it or or does it like what just what are your plans as a team well we were discussing about it if we would like to continue with that uh it's still an ongoing discussion if we want to uh yeah i mean there is still there's still room to improve and definitely to make it bigger and better um there's still yeah we just have to discuss it and see what we can do about it and how big the interest is actually nope that makes a little sense that uh i'd encourage you to uh still keep building but uh all right thank you questions from our judges we'll uh we'll move on to our next group so thanks to all three of you and uh thank you let's uh bring up the next team so i think we're just in the process of promoting the next one and uh here he is so i'll all uh let so make sure you talk about kazan hi everyone so i'll be playing the video sorry i forgot to share the computer sound so hi this is uh sumikshan and today i'll be presenting a demo on kazan which was developed during a hackathon 2020. i was the sole hacker for uh this project and um in the future i'm looking forward to more collaboration um from others on uh kazan as well um kazan is basically a decentralized collaborative music platform where musicians should be able to discover tracks jam on them and republish for further collaborations so an example would be that a guitarist uploads a guitar track on kazan and a drummer who's looking for drumless tracks uh would like find this guitar track and then would like to add some drums on that and um then republish it for further collaboration like a basis could come in and add some bass on top of that so and this goes on our basic prototype for this flow was uh was implemented during hack office and i'll be presenting that in the demo in the in the background basically i use textile buckets for the audio storage and i have a centralized uh mediator server that that that stores the metadata for the tracks and helps with basically searching the tracks and uh for for users uh i use hedgehog for the identity management uh and web audio uh apis for mixing the tracks on the on the browser so let's go to the demo right now um so i already have uh um two accounts set up here and in one of them i have already uploaded uh like i've recorded a guitar track and i'm going to publish this here so once i publish this i should be able to see this on if i refresh this page i should be able to see this guitar track so that uh fonte can uh jam on this so i think it will take some time to populate so let's actually jam on this one and uh if i start now um so uh once this happens i can stop this and uh once i stop this i basically have a new track that i can now play if i start jamming now so basically i'm just vocals and this has gets added to the um so uh this gets mixed and now i can add text to this so i can say that this has some vocals and this has some drums or and then i can publish it so once i do that um this gets published on um on on for for fonte and this would be available for other users um for further mixing so uh uh so what are the future plans with kaza kazan uh like there are a lot of plans first is to have a prototype and then go live uh get more feedback and uh need to basically uh polish the user experience for um for users um we need to also to store like track information for on ethereum and uh uh have support for mobile devices um and also have like uh support for more content that are related to music industry like uh like if a lyricist wants to upload lyrics or uh someone who wants to create a music video so uh or for an audio track and also incentivization for content creators uh for be in the future pipeline um once this project matures over time so yeah thank you so yeah that was the demo as well as the some slides so if there are any questions i have to ask about the name is is kazan a reference to kazaa at all no so uh i was looking for um a name that actually suits what the idea uh for the project was so basically i was thinking of uh like the imagery is that of a cauldron um that we have in uh like these like uh like you put a lot of portions inside the cauldron and you get something magical out of it so the whole idea is that you put in a lot of different kinds of like um so i i put in some guitar tracks uh someone else puts in some drums um then like this can go on it can like branch into different directions and um you could you can have something concrete or you can have something totally uh like which is useless but anyway you still have that whole thing uh going and uh the thing is that if any one of those branches actually turned out to be very useful you could have the whole uh like the the uh the list of collaborators that have collaborated on the track and then kind of think about working on some kind of uh incentivization for these collaborators in the future so uh so basically uh this cauldron in turkish is kazan so that is why i came with the that that particular name very cool very interesting backstory on the um i guess one other question is um like uh it's really cool seeing like uh you did a really good job like i was impressed with all the different recording features and stuff what do you think would be some of the benefits of uh like obviously there's already a lot of music recording software out there what do you think is the benefit of this being a decentralized system yeah uh the whole uh so basically what i wanted to have through this is that users should be the content creators should be able to have direct control over their their data so they should be able to like own those their data audio files basically and um right now i basically have a centralized metadata server but the plan is to actually have that also decentralized because um and we can we could use textile threads for that i wasn't able to uh use that during hackaphase but that was the whole plan um so um yeah so that that's kind of one of the major uh uh like major reasons why i decided to go uh with a decentralized storage model for this particular application and also in the future like uh if if this project actually goes on to become something that people use then you could actually have more kind of like very very very could have uh like i i mentioned about that the the the track the ownership of tracks information so if you could have that kind of uh like uh in a decentralized manner as well um the idea is to make sure that um like your the the content you created is not basically uh used by someone else and then uh and then you could basically like claim ownership of that particular uh track or the particular contents so all of these those things are also like in the pipeline uh for the future basically um yeah so did you did you have background in like you know doing like the audio part on on in the browser on the client side or did you is that something you had to learn for this project i had absolutely no uh experience with uh even like basic user interface front-end design and uh no experience with uh web audio engineering so i basically had to learn this during the hackathon and implemented that there are some issues with respect to using web audio apis on chrome as i think you could kind of notice a slight latency that needs needs to be fixed like going forward another option is to have a totally desktop application um that could reduce the latency by a large amount as well so yeah awesome well thank you so much for demoing and i'll check out the live thing after this i think ends so uh thank you with that i want to call up our next team and i think hugo's already here and uh he'll be talking about bradbury yep hello um so just to keep a quick warning my video doesn't have an audio so it will be myself um explaining the thing as it as it goes um so what i've built is a very simple way for people to store and share collections of pictures that they care about um there's going to be two users in the demo and we are here signing in the very first user we're using magic link because this way we can map an email address to an ethereum address once the first user is logged in they gets into the dashboard he has like four collections and now we are creating a fifth one which is called iceland we can um upload pictures um into it um we're we're going to to skip thread but basically yeah you can select as many as you like and then you have a collection um once you have that you decide with whom you want to share it uh so this would be like second user uh we're sending an invite link so this is an invite-only thing and now the second user is like validating his address and joining the collection iceland which behind the scenes is a threat by rbdb and now now that this has happened the very first user which is now signing in again has received a confirmation email um to finish like the whole loop the moment he confirms the user the second user this second user will be added as a member to the thread and that's it that's how both of them are sharing um the pictures and and in a peer-to-peer fashion so now the second user is signing in for the last time just to show that he can access um iceland collection um [Music] yeah as you can see yes iceland is there for the second user and the pictures are also visible for for him and that's basically it hello that's awesome you go um it's really beautiful design wise um i'm like captivated by how pretty it is as well um what were your kind of biggest technical challenges uh with this particular this project one of the challenges i've i've faced it was um like support from for different browsers because the way some browsers work with cookies um don't really allow to like magic link to work properly and that's an issue but just in general i must say that building these um i'm a fairly junior software developer it was super easy um so using um sdk such as the one um three box has makes it very very easy technically wise so there wasn't like major challenges there it's back but i just said beautiful design definitely thanks are you have any design background or no i don't um one of the things that i'm trying is to make it like work a lot on the ux and ui because i would like this to be something that my friends can use and they don't know anything about those these technologies um and this is a design that i made very quick for the hack but i'm actually working on a better one nice well can't wait to see it thanks that's super cool so you're gonna keep working on this is it yes this is a side project that i started um so this is that what you have seen is just for the hackathon but actually bradbury is a side project that i started a few months ago and for the moment um this project is just like an editor where you can like type and make some entries like in a diary and i want to add these pictures to it and like the collections and stuff um so this is something i want to keep working on yes but as a side project for the moment i mean i think i mean that highlights a lot about like where the the sort of ecosystem and tooling is going um was it was it easy for you to to pick the stack that you wanted to go with or do you have to play around with a few things no it was pretty um easy um so it's it's mostly um three bucks uh which is like making it very easy for people like me to interface with ipfs and stuff and also it has like the profiles which in this hack you cannot see i'm not using it but it makes sense in the future to make it a bit more social so to speak awesome i'm just excited about uh a google photos alternative that's actually unlimited storage so uh that should be fun um no this is this is great yeah i think everybody can already set it but uh really beautiful ui so um please please continue working on it and i'd love to uh actually back up some of my photos on this and uh i thought with that i think i just want to make sure that the judges themselves are doing all right i know we're we're kind of sprinting to a lot of these things so if uh if uh you just want to take a five minute break we can just quickly do that we have about four or five projects to go so um let me know if that's that works for you or you want to just push through but we can just kind of resume in a couple minutes i'll give you a minute or two scratch or get some coffee or anything else you want to do does that work perfect so uh yeah so uh i think the next team is detox or and we'll just wait have you wait for five minutes and we'll just resume this thing in uh in a few minutes i'll uh just come back and turn your videos down when you're ready and i'll coordinate everything else [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] all right looks like everybody's back uh so thank you so much for uh being patient with us and uh i think we have a few more projects to go so we have about five or four and uh we already have the next team up here on this call so i'll let naga talk about detox hello that was the best audio which you play well let me show this okay so i think if you're uh playing the video we don't have the audio would you mind making sure the audio is checked creating groups following unfollowing them like commenting hello i am nagasa vishnu and i'm presenting an alternate decentralized social media platform detox to overcome the drawbacks of centralized social media platform it has all the cool features of any social media platform like creating a post creating groups following and following them like commenting sharing post groups or profile let's look at a demo now so both the user ent along with an authenticated our apps is every user will have a profile thread and its name is same as address all the posts he uploaded are stored here we can also edit our profile here no posts are uploaded so let's add our first post now it can attach audio video image or text content to our post the media content is uploaded and the written url along with the text content is stored both in the user profile and the home thread this is a fully blown video player with options like picture in picture and the users can directly download the video we can like comment or share any posts the lines are stored in the user's public space we can even upload or download any comment now user p also subscribes to the whole thread and the posts are displayed every course will have a unique id generated by hashing its content and this is how sharing any post work let's copy the url and paste it in user b so based on the source diary the complete host is displayed now let's look at how groups work every group will have a unique name and we can add a description to the group and attach a group logo as soon as we create a group a new thread is created and its name is same as the group name we can even follow or unfollow any clue let's add the first host in our group similarly we can attach audio video text or image content to the post so as soon as we post any media content the media content is uploaded and a new folder is created the folder name is exactly the same as the metamask address so this is how users content or media is differentiated now let's look at it from the ssd's perspective let's add a new audio post to l group so the post default automatically upgraded the group we can share the first in a group now let's copy the hosting url now let's look at our profile so all the posts that we added are updated in our profile the thing with dedop is we can even share our profiles with anyone let's copy the url and paste it in user 8 vsp so all the posts are uploaded or displayed as user b is not a owner he can't edit through the sales profile as there are two users two folders are created in click so future work like detox tokens for creating private groups and for user engagement check it out live here thank you oh looks like a lot of functionality uh nice nice sort of um how what what uh look like you're using a few different services there like how did you um how did you pick how easy did you find them to come together so this was the first time i've worked on anything like anything related to ikea so the the core is powered by like three box sets like every post that we upload is stored in three boxes like three box persistent so like there is a two thread side one is the home thread and one is like the profile tray so whatever we upload will be stored in the stored in both in home thread and in our profile so that's how i differentiate one profile from one profile uh course from another and every group has this as its own like persistent uh thread so like uh like whatever uh whichever group we follow like whatever post you like that is all stored in the user's problems public space like it's a key value pair so like uh the post has its own id right so uh that id i will just keep it like if i like a post that will be certified so that's how i implemented the like functionality reason something was it actually updating real time between the two um between the two like what i thought of like what i thought of initially like like showing number of like a number of people who liked the echoes so like i then then they came to know that instagram itself is removing the number of uh people who like the post so whichever posts are like uh are stored in my own public space so like the i i don't uh increment the counter like how many how many likes a post got oh i agree with brett it's really feature-rich for like such a short amount of time and especially because you haven't had a ton of experience with the stack so it's really really impressive um what features are are next i know you talked about a couple of things that you would you'd like to add but what's the kind of the next thing that you're gonna um [Music] so i'm open to everything like uh so what i'm planning to do is like implement a detox token for uh creating private groups or private posts now everything which you upload is public so if you want something private like you need to have certain amount of detox tokens to create something private and and i'm open to pretty much any ideas sounds great if there are no more questions we uh can move on to our next demo so thank you so much for uh showing us that cool soldier network design and we hope that you continue working on it perfect so uh next up we have uh matt we'll be talking about the mlb champion subgraph matt take it away now it looks like we're having some microfinishes we can't hear you properly but uh we can see you once in here to demo my hack i created for the hack fs hackathon my hack uses the graph protocol to create a sub graph of the mlb champions erc token mlbcb mlb champions is a game that allows users to create collectible non-fungible items based on their favorite mlb baseball players being a baseball fan i was interested in which players were the most popular in the game in this demo i'll show you the queries to answer these three questions which player has the most collectibles associated with them which collectible has been traded the most and the player who had the most ether spent on his collectibles but before we dive into the queries let's take a look at the schema so here the most uh basically at the heart of it is a collectible entity um this is what tracks each um basically token that's created by a user it also tracks the sales history and which player this token goes with the sales history is just one for one with the ethereum blockchain transaction event when it was when a token was traded the player entity does a lot of the counting as far as how many collectibles one player has and how much volume of ether was spent on the collectibles for that player and then this trade entity is uh what tracks one all the trades for any one token one other thing i'll show you before i show you the queries this is the mapping file this shows you that each event handle handle created handle asset updated and handle transfer all these events are what's used to create each entity and the relationships all right without further ado let's take a look at these queries so the first question was which player has the most collectibles associated with them so basically the most popular what this query does is it shows um a player entity it shows the first basically the top five player entities and it's ordered by the total number of collectibles for that player and it's ordered descending so the top five that's what you have here of course the top player is a pitcher um the second question was which collectible has been traded the most so this looks at the trade entities it takes the top five orders them by the total trades counter and it does that descending as well and the last question was who which player has the most ether spent on his collectibles i don't think you'll be surprised to know that it's a red sox right fielder there's also a red sox pitcher here um a center fielder for the angels i'm not sure why that's on the list but then you have a new york yankee and another red sox here so that's all i have to show you today this was a super fun project i'm very new to ethereum and it pushed me to learn a lot about the ethereum ecosystem and graphql thanks for watching all right i changed my microphone i i don't know if it's better if you can hear me a little better okay see i'll just kick up the question i guess what made you uh pick this um as the thing you wanted to work on um you know i originally i wanted to do something else and i was kind of down a rabbit hole and um you know i thought it was something that i could do in the amount of time that i had um i'm also you know a baseball fan i was i was interested in in these tokens and how they work you know i think everybody's heard of crypto kitties and so it really kind of took me to you know dive into it and just really kind of like figure out how these things work and um you know i think maybe i would want to sink some time into maybe making one myself well i mean it's great to see you're kind of able to get to the bottom of the questions you set out to to answer um did you so independent of the you know ethereum or the graph protocol did you have experience with graphql now this is my first um i mean i've heard it uh in i'm a mobile developer i've heard you know people throw it around um i didn't know what it was all about and i was kind of surprised by some things that weren't present for me like that i had to actually do the counting myself and that graphql didn't really give me a way to just say give me the count of all the players on this team or something like that like i kind of had to track everything myself so it's that's cool do you have ideas of where you'd want to take this i mean it seems like it might lend itself well to some sort of visualization layer yeah you know i if i had more time i really wanted um so there's open c if you guys know what that is okay so um they have an api that basically you can take one of those token ids and pull all the off chain assets you can in my demo you can tell there's no um there's no player names because it was all off chain and there was nowhere for me to get that information so it really kind of you kind of need a mashup of um maybe open c and this graphql to kind of put it together and then show it in in i mean i wanted to do a react or react native kind of thing cool i would just say uh who's your uh who's your team it's the rockies i'm fr i'm from colorado uh i live in maine now but um yeah nolan aronado's got a bunch of tokens out there very cool yeah graphql is awesome projects great to see uh get to see more people playing around with that and building cool stuff fun yeah and the graph the grammatical not the graphql they're both great but yeah they really set up you know i would say that they have it you know as someone who's just diving in and making a bunch of mistakes they've really kind of protected you with the way they've set it up where you will get some compile errors with some information so you're not just like throwing this thing out there and then getting a bunch of errors like it's really being caught up front and um i was i was definitely impressed with what they have put together and and how it held my hand that's super exciting to hear yeah i mean i'd love to see like a whole dashboard that anybody can go to after this to get a whole summary of this and maybe other other games that are out there so it's a really great start and especially when you're trying to learn new technologies you get to push yourself to uh doing a lot more and playing with a bunch of other frameworks that uh are beyond what you're comfortable with on the mobile side so i'm super excited for this thank you and uh congrats so um with that we have uh two more teams to go and uh so i want to just kind of make sure that we're we're all ready and excited about that so let's bring up the second last team and that is project pnlp to kick off with their demo oh looks like we're uh we don't have the audio feed in this screen share so would you mind just doing that one more time looks like it's still still not working um i think it's if you stop the screen share and then you check the box under the zoom screen setting that's when we'll get the audio feed yeah i have that box checked let me see here um hi everyone my name is dan i'm one of the members of the pulp network team our accomplishments over the last five weeks are two-fold we formulated a protocol for the publication and subscription of blog content and we built a proof-of-concept reference client for that protocol pulp network is a web3 blogging platform the actors and artifacts in our system are relatively simple but the pulp network is just an abstraction on top of existing distributed technologies the pulp protocol is composed of six procedures each describes an interaction between the pulp client the ethereum network and the ipfs and filecoin networks our reference client is an angular browser app it's deployed by fleeq so the app itself is served in a decentralized manner we're using textile buckets on textile hub to integrate with ipfs and with ethers.js we're asking metamask to sign and broadcast all transactions let's get to the demo we'll start by going to pulp dot network from here we can sign in this prompts metamask to sign a challenge and using the signature we actually generate a new lib p2p identity by which we can update ipns records as such as an author i can act as this ethereum address and also update ipns records so let's do that now so i'm going to create a fake blog we'll call it the pulp network dev blog and note that i am reserving the slug pulp dash development it's going to ask ask us to broadcast a transaction to the ethereum blockchain this transaction will will register this slug and map it to the ipns address that this user controls after waiting for the ethereum transaction we can see that our new blog has been registered uh however we don't have any articles yet so we're gonna remedy that we add some test content i'm attaching our readme we can preview it but more importantly we can publish it again meta masks prompts us to sign a transaction this transaction will guarantee the ipfs hash that transaction published the ipfs address of this article on the ethereum blockchain as a proof of existence and an endorsement by the author so now if we return to our blog we can see our first article here i've added a little easter egg here so that we can actually see what's going on under the hood a little bit we can see that our publication is really just an ips address that we can examine in any given ips resolver thank you textile we can see that this ipns address points to this current ipfs directory in it is a metadata file which describes our publication it also has a second file now which is our blog post we'd like to format this as rss compliant xml in the future instead of json if we return to our app we can see the author on any ethereum blockchain explorer we can see the location of the article on any ipfs explorer and we can see the proof of existence of the article in any ethereum blockchain explorer and we can see in the contract data the ipfs address that matches this one that's all for our demo we hope you enjoyed it and lastly we just wanted to thank the sponsors and hosts and other open source providers who made this entire thing possible we had a blast and we learned a lot so thank you all right happy to answer any questions so it's cool okay go ahead yeah really really cool um tell me a little bit about your experience with this stack um just as a team [Music] sure um i'll speak for myself and um i've played around with ethereum contracts in the past i've i've run ipfs an ipfs host locally just kind of in experimenting but i hadn't dug a whole a whole lot more into into any of this stack and that was one of our my personal goals in this i'll let mason and roland speak for themselves yeah i also had uh some experience with ethereum before um uh with ether's gs uh but uh i hadn't really had a lot of experience with metamask so uh connecting it to metamask and uh using lib p2p was new to me but it was really interesting it's great really impressive a really wonderful kind of technology so you should be really proud of yourselves awesome thank you thank you yes it's cool to see it i mean we've seen a lot of things that um that are built out on service providers but it's cool to see something that's kind of um sort of well thought through protocol um that leverages the technologies directly and then the reference implementation that then you know brings in the sort of like orchestrates how to show us how to use those service providers relative to this to that technology it felt like a very uh like kind of feature complete uh protocol so that's cool um do you guys have any plans to kind of uh continue developing this i could i could definitely see this project being uh used by a lot of especially like decentralized teams and projects i mean we'd love to if if the independent or if any of you have have blogs that you that you write we'd love to get you get you over on onto this it would be cool to live in a world where decentralized companies are writing and publishing blog content on decentralized applications so yes absolutely awesome super cool well thank you so much and uh with this uh we'll move on to our very last demo for today and uh if uh the team is here i think jane is here we'll uh we'll kick off our last demo and that is project d web vr so i'll let you take it from here hey can you all hear me cool uh let's see if i can share my camera [Music] no no i'm gonna just screen share and then i could share computer sound cool all right so uh d web vr um should i play the video um yes they'll be that'd be great okay turn up my volume here applications are the main driving of course of the network so killer apps are the most important thing for everything else and in the popular show silicon valley we could see a perfect match pie piper solution and virtual reality because less lag equals less motion sickness so how about some decentralized web worlds here we are in a hacker space i can pick an avatar set a microphone this is open source right here um and the the microphone and webcam is using webrtc peer to peer awesome as you can see the url is also set on fleek week makes it easy for the ipfs hosting worlds from github um so in this world we have a speaker here talking about the web or sorry um he was talking about uh d2 and uh so we can watch previous talks from um conferences in this world uh we have video sharing avatars as well so we can meet up with friends and uh you know play games such as crypto voxels cryptovoxels cryptovoxels has a web mode and we have portals portals that go into other worlds here's another hackerspace in san francisco called noisebridge and so we have linked decentralized virtual worlds and this virtual world is also in vrchat so that we can talk to the the bigger population of virtual world people about hey did you know that this is a decentralized website wow i didn't know that that's amazing what where's the link where can i check it out and uh this person here elon musk will check it out so how do we make that hologram speaker um well in the case of lab day juan was standing behind or in front of a blank white screen so check this out we have internet archive nvr and uh and we replicated that same setup with a virtual avatar of youtuber and so that's just no bs template and so even if you don't have green screen white screen the right lighting setup you can pick a virtual avatar and get the same hologram effect so ipfs ecosystem i don't think this does justice to it so instead of looking at an image how about we transform it into an interactive experience enter anarchy arcade which is a 3d desktop i can spawn my shortcuts here and create nodes and basically it's kind of like a memory palace i know i'm working quickly here but uh um with a mind palace basically i can take the websites i can create shortcuts that turn into interactive objects so these arcade cabinets are all websites this is an interesting way to make a virtual world um out of the web and uh learn about the ecosystem in a fun way and it's conducive to thinking about gaming which is a huge driver of mass adoption so if you want to think about gaming and learn about the decentralized web ecosystem we can use this program and it can also export all the metadata really nicely and cleanly so that we can use it in other front ends um that's coming in the future so that way we can collaborate on that memory palace and uh i created a meeting space so that we can talk about and brainstorm other ways of visualizing the ecosystem such as creating an expo and i've got some templates here made for essentially prototyping a virtual expo out of the ipfs ecosystem diagram and um so that's about it for me and i hope you all right so um let me go through the demo over here uh first of all i wanted to visualize the ipfs ecosystem not as a static map but as a immersive world so all of these i scraped all the logos for all these projects and they're all on github and i uh do you hear me on the internet yeah so uh basically um all these are websites that you could click so like audios uh and by representing them as arcade cabinets it's sort of conducive to thinking about applications and use cases uh in terms of gaming which is a huge driver of adoption i'd say um so we have this and the next part of it was essentially creating dweb vr sites and i used fleeq i also used um unstoppable domains for one demo and uh this is my friend in here oh he's got his avatar set up um so instead of just kind of like a virtual world um like decentralized crypto voxels what about a virtual world to play decentraland or crypto voxels inside of here so that's kind of what i created in here and uh let me sign in here joy thank you so much joy thank you okay so uh let me try and sign in metamask here all right folks today on dark news hey where's my seat oh my god okay so yeah you can play crypto voxels inside of here you can build inside of here and uh it's a multi-user and then i also have in here um let me bring up the chat just in case um i also have speakers presentations so that um you could watch a talk from a previous presentation and give workshops at these virtual hacker spaces like i'm doing over here so i did that with um some of lab day presentations and i created an obs template where others could do that as well using youtuber software virtual green screen also zoom can do the virtual green screen background cropping but yeah same setup you just kind of cut out the videos for the presentation and the speaker and then boom uh you can specialize it inside of here we can take notes here's my friend me his webcam works it's all webrtc you can listen to music as well and we can go to other d web sites as well using portals so we're going to go into another ipfs hosted vr site here noise bridge and this is kind of a social network based on physical places digi physical i remember below just bellagi talking about um just kind of like building a city in the cloud and these communities are kind of bootstrapping off communities that have local chapters in these places around teaching and learning and building together and so by 3d scanning these spaces and making them into social vr worlds and also hosting them on other platforms like vrchat where there's hundreds of thousands of users we can evangelize the d web outside of the d web and um have meetups that are multi-platform and so that's kind of been my thinking just building bridges between the ipfs ecosystem inwards and outwards and this is the um part one and part two would be a larger expo where each of these nodes for data or any of these categories can expand into a whole experience you know um something that you could explore and have people uh position at booths answering questions interactive you know just like the hallway experience learning more about this and what applications it can be useful for so that is the webvr in a nutshell you know just an interest of time i think uh we're running a bit over time here but i'd love to uh some questions from our judges before uh we end today's session uh it's really interesting i guess i'm a little confused though about what um uh which aspects of this are kind of running on these these d web things is it mainly these um kind of arcade games that i see in the in the vr world or or is it more than that he's a arcade game so like what what i'm using here is like a 3d desktop and all this is just representing the metadata of all the websites so these are all shortcuts like a regular desktop and i can link to the d web experiences from here but really the d web stuff is the uh these uh uh web xr sites so on the github i have links to them it's all kind of markup based you can see the source code here and so the static it's like static html pages for uh 3d multi-user websites that i've hosted on uh fleek yeah i use fleeq to uh basically yeah post them so yeah mostly linking together the uh the immersive web worlds together and uh using them as classrooms for d web you know to teach it and to uh play d web games dapps inside of um a virtual world rather than you know taking up your full screen i feel like it's a provides a more meta way of playing the experience and uh you know representing um nfts and the ecosystem within um this virtual world rather than another tab jenna i think this isn't just so cool um like a lot of the stuff i do is event oriented and and also classroom based stuff like uh all of the workshop stuff and i can just see us using something like this so then it's like really exciting sometimes you see the future in hackathons like this and this is the future to me and um yeah like i think it's got a ton of potential in terms of um next steps so it seems like you're trying to cover a lot of different things but like what do you if we're going to narrow that focus slightly like what are gonna be the kind of primary um use cases for this and where you're gonna focus your your efforts uh so basically connecting um these worlds together i would say the got a bunch of templates for building the expo and i want to host meetups and build a community um because number one like it's gotta be community first and i built some brainstorming worlds where we could talk about d web vr in and um basically uh host events and these types of places or archive presentations and these types of places but i want to have the uh um all these things kind of like linked to one place where you can see everything and that's my goal is to kind of build a landmark for this is one hacker space so i want to have this in kind of a shell and have the other hacker space all kind of like uh linked together in some way i i kind of use this hackathon to learn more about the web and fleek and unstoppable domains and experimenting with all these but ultimately i want to build an expo world so that's my goal for the next few months here because the some other communities are building virtual expos and they get hundreds of thousands of visitors and in vr chat it's not a d web platform but it's where you can uh talk about nfts and stuff just using 3d models for props and whatnot so yeah um all i'm just planning to uh instead of a presentation from a two-year-old conference i'm going to also give a presentation as my hologram about this as well using this template i built awesome any uh last comments from our judges great no this is uh this is wonderful i think this is a whole new uh world where we're getting used to anyway now so i'm super excited to see what uh this becomes in a few more months so thank you so much jyn and with that i want to thank everybody who uh watched this uh recording and also uh as a participant uh hung out here to watch the rest of the demos and also of course our judges who can spend the last two hours looking in and kind of reviewing all these projects so thanks again to all of you for giving us your time and also to all the hackers are presented congrats on that again and with that i'd like to uh make sure that uh everybody here gets back the rest of their day so uh thank you so much and uh we'll see you tomorrow for day three of judging goodbye thanks everyone
