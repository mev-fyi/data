[Applause] [Music] good morning good afternoon good evening depending on where you are um we have our second workshop of the day for hack fs we have michael and proud here from sonar who are going to be doing a workshop on building in the decentralized web with sonar questions go into the zoom chat and they'll answer them at the end of the workshop and with that being said i'll pass the mic off to the two speakers i guess let's get straight into it uh the internet world is at an impasse with increasing pressure from users for freedom of speech and unwillingness from monolithic companies to loosen their indoctrinated moral grip humanity loses as a whole the internet contributes to 12 percent of global gdp and has grown seven times faster than any sector in the past four years it's clear that something so substantial to our economy should facilitate the proper measures in order to ensure that users won't be exploited correct um can we move next slide this is precisely the problem that my team and i have been diligently working on for the past six months my name is pratt i started coding when i was 12 making one of the first 5000 apps on the app store over the course of 2021 i wrote the fourth most code on github building key points of infrastructure that are used in sonar today and most recently i was a guest lecturer at mit sloan school with other notable speakers like vitalik um the creator of ethereum um and yeah i'm michael um i was in big tech prior to joining sonar companies like google and microsoft um joined proud about a year ago and his mission to to rebuild the internet as we'll kind of describe we're hoping that by the end of this presentation you'll also be bought into this idea of rebuilding the internet for the next hundred years and also kind of get an understanding of what that will look like in practice and how you can start building with sona right okay um rebuilding the internet is not an easy task to explain luckily i'm not going to do it myself so here is a quick video we put together that provides a brief overview to the sonar epos imagine a world where you can register for an internet driver's license where companies can't sell your data away to advertisers without your consent this isn't some far-off utopian world but an actively developed solution called sonar every time you use a new app sonar instantly verifies you based on patent-pending blockchain technology at sonar we realize that you'll have an infamous number of accounts to manage but you'll always have a finite number of devices that are connected to the internet be it your phone tv computer or even fridge all internet connected devices will be recorded as controllers for your driver's license we like to call these devices on sonar and motors motors all run on the sonar highway system a real-time peer-to-peer network where users have full control of their data and interactions as opposed to being dictated by monolithic companies the highway provides a full plethora of upgrades over the base internet to facilitate all the active motors including discovery exchange transmission verifiable objects and many more the highway helps point motors to different destinations and in our metaphor services and applications developers can easily and quickly create user-provided secure and immersive sonar-powered apps the possibilities are endless when it comes to application built on sonar verifiable social media identity for everyone easier contract negotiations secure collaborative productivity tools real-time games with transferable in-game nft assets and much much more at sonar we truly care about making this utopian vision possible and we hope we inspire you for the future to come here's an open secret we're not the only ones who are working to build this about five weeks ago we had jack dorsey introduce web5 i know that they've been working really hard over there at the square team with almost 52 whopping code commits uh i joke but i truly believe that this is a good signal that we're working on core infrastructure that needs to be in place for this space and yeah so so with that want to kind of go and go into how you as a hacker can get started um and building in this rebuilt internet with us so um the the kind of mini example we're gonna talk about um for for the next few slides is a hypothetical application called join me this would basically basically be an application where um users can create a group chat with all of the people presently located around them so imagine you're in a room a physical room with other people surrounding you and you want to be able to add everyone to a group shop without necessarily having to manually communicate with each person one by one and get their info so to to kind of understand how you might build this basic group chat creation app um you need to first understand some of sonar's core modules um and and the three primary ones that we'll go over as shown here um the first one is called schemas um so so these are verifiable types for for the different apps and they're all backed by the ipld spec which you can kind of read more about in our documentation um there are channels which effectively enable you to make all of your applications multiplayer by default um meaning that you can have um you can have different peers subscribe to channels and have interactivity across peers in that way um and then there's storage so leveraging decentralized storage like filecoin ipfs you'll notice in our prizes we we mentioned falcoin specifically as an area of interest in terms of exploring so i would definitely love to to hear ideas um involving that technology as well so these are kind of the the three core sonar modules and we'll sort of illustrate how these can kind of be combined to create the type of application like join me so as part of rebuilding the internet we're also building out the tools that you need as a developer to actually build on top of this new and indirect experience and some of the key toolkits we have are a sdk known as speedway which will essentially be a portal to quickly produced decentralized web applications coming with built-in like privacy and also allowing you as a developer to kind of focus on your user and so in that kind of explanatory video we talked about a sort of user-centric view of data meaning that users have full sovereignty and ownership over their data and this is also kind of the core element of our sdk and so as a developer you're sort of building from this kind of frame of mind and then there's also compliance with with the different kind of key specs like w3 and fido and this is also ultimately going to be a no code solution and so beyond just developers ultimately we hope that anyone will eventually be able to build in this decentralized web paradigm with with very minimal um kind of overhead in terms of code rambo um and then another kind of attached element to this is is called nebula so we're going to basically have a component library that allows you as a developer to build in authentication like past basically replacing passwords and seed phrases with device oriented access methods like biometric authentication so think like face id that's id um really kind of making the access process for your data more intuitive and more aligned with with what you're already likely used to in terms of your current and existing applications um and this would be compatible with different front-end libraries like react flutter react native and swift um so so trying to be as interoperable as possible with with kind of the common frameworks that people are used to and also kind of implementing a a special series of encryption methods allowing this to be as resistant as possible even to quantum computing so i'm going back to to join me on the left we have a kind of architecture breakdown of what this looks like when you combine the the core modules and the the key modules that you'll see here being primarily used are channels and objects so channels like we mentioned are where you basically publish the the key information um that's either being listened to or published by the different peers in the network um so so one of the channels you'll want to have is like a nearby channel where let's say you're constantly publishing the the actual locations of the surrounding peers their visibility so there could be a scenario where someone was once visible in the in the peer-to-peer network and um their visibility has changed um and maybe they are displaying him so i want to i want to basically know that proud is nearby know that his name is proud so that's the display name and then know his actual location in the room that's it and then the other channel here is the chat group itself so this might be where the actual messages are being published so you'll see that the the elements of message which is the object being published to chat group are text but then also something known as a did or decentralized identity and this this might be in the instance where messages are being signed or there's some way to basically secure access to your message data so you'll only enable people to see the messages if they're able to sign the did appropriately so this this is kind of a very basic example of what a join me type of application would look like where the key channels are nearby versus the chat group for the messages itself um and you can kind of deconstruct and rebuild this with with the core modules of sonar um other kind of call outs are there's a concept of filtering so channels can take a property where for example you can filter from filter certain people from from joining a channel um so this this would be for example if you only want like certain people in a group chat who um who securely or who appropriately satisfied the filter property and then there's open location code so this is an algorithm for encoding actual location or longitude latitude information which could also be a kind of important element in building this type of application so this is actually not too far from one of the the very first apps that the sonar team is building internally which will be a chat up known as beam and we basically aim for beam to be the last chat app that you'll ever need to download because it'll be interoperable with with other existing apps like um imessage slack sms um it'll also be compatible with with crypto meaning you'll you'll be able to send the sonar token and other key tokens in line with with your chat experience um it's also coming with the built-in kind of airdrop style features like discovering which peers are nearby and being able to secure share data securely with them and this is all kind of being built out again by by the sonar team but part of our goals in this hackathon is to challenge you guys to take our technology and and build on top of them so as far as what else you can can build um with the sonar experience um so there's collaboration tools so because you have the ability for devices to securely share data with each other that means that you can enable more secure collaboration and data sharing experiences um there's also multiplayer gaming um so again you have this built-in peer-to-peer networking as a as virtue of the the motor nodes and sonar combined with the highway nodes and so you can create leaderboard experiences um rpg gameplay and lobbies with with the ability to to join by different players um all as a function of the built-in sonar technology and then there there's also linked services so creating extensions for for other applications given sonar's um compliance with with the different specs that we mentioned so as far as progress up until now as proud proud has mentioned just just a few weeks ago we heard talks around web5 a lot of what sonar has already built out is is very much in line with with the the technology being described there um we we've already sort of built out the the key elements of the motor um which facilitate the the peer-to-peer network and the ability to kind of share shared data across devices um and we have several pretty exciting betas coming up including the the speedway or that dashboard for for essentially doing no code app building on sonar um we'll also be doing different tests for for beam the chat application that we mentioned and then we'll have a learning program where you can sort of go through learning modules to to learn essentially how to build on sonar so we have our our links um posted in the kind of main um sonar landing page for hack fest as well but just to kind of go over that um sonar.io is our main site um you can find our github at github.com sonar.io docs docs.sonar.io um and if you scan our the qr code here um it'll also kind of take you to to all the main links so um we'll be here throughout the the hackathon if you have more questions we're kind of here to kind of guide you through the building process um and you can also email us at team at sonar or contact us in the channel so i'll keep up the qr code um and i can't see the the chat since i'm screen sharing so if someone wants to read out the questions we can take a stop at answering them now or in the channel there any questions no i don't see anything right now okay so that's good all right all right well i guess we could just end things here um oh i think you have a couple questions popping up now i'm proud do you want to read out the questions yeah how does the authentication work to authenticate um so we're using a system called dids so if you guys are familiar with mpc which is a mechanism for essentially having multiple devices being able to calculate this seed phrase um through this direct peer-to-peer connection and this is recorded on a did document stored on the sonar blockchain and by leveraging device biometrics so you would type in uh i guess earl.snr a face id would pop up if you're on your phone or we would be utilizing web opt-in for web and uh it would be essentially that mechanism for that particular device and in terms of business model of sonar gas fees from zach sonar is built on the cosmos ecosystem so uh i'm all the blockchain specifications are pretty standard um and uh it's like one cent gas right now i think seven second block finality and in terms of our business model we're currently partnering with prism group in order to have our tokenomics be completed the first phase of that engagement has been done and you should be having more updates on that after phase two is done in around three weeks uh yes earl the idea is to have a smooth transition from web 2 applications into web3 and carl's question will users be able to maintain their anonymity yes so like since the data is in control of the users they're able to provision what aspects of their identity that they do want to share let's say you just only wanted to give your wallet address and just be completely anonymous on an application like um i don't know a burner instagram account powered by sonar or something um you would be able to go through with that and that mechanism exists just like how it does in traditional blockchain systems um and will will they be able to have an identity that's unrelated to their real world identity multiple identities yes so like in the did document um there's a field known as the also known as field so basically leveraging that along with our h s resolver that's built into our highway to make sure that all these dot s and r names are resolvable basically by all the motor nodes involved with the architecture and as michael pointed out we know the docs need a little bit of refactoring so a lot of these questions these are good we'll definitely add them to the docs um to answer zach uh so one of the cool ideas that we actually got um this is uh what is it the blocker for this is for us having a unity 3d plugin but um we're at uh hack unt for a hackathon and basically talking to a couple of college students and one of them suggested the idea of having like a pokemon go um which is a real life ar puzzle and uh since it would be able to be powered by this chain storing the objects uh by location let's say you collected like two or three pieces of a puzzle put it together minted as an nft and you have that as a collectible in the game as an asset um i think like a couple of blockers for this is like uh number one you have to have like cool enough characters like pokemon to actually make this possible because that ip is gonna be crazy um and yeah like the unity plugin would be really cool but aside from that stuff that you would be able to build immediately um like a docusign for sonar makes complete sense like digital signatures being powered by your identity here and uh sharing the file directly between peers makes completely complete sense um aside from that i feel like there definitely should be an email client because the h s domains uh basically have mx records that we can host so uh let's say you email prad at snr or uh zac at snr you would be able to hit their email address directly but the problem is that we don't have like clients for it to be resolvable and yes um yes so like this is known as capability delegation and you would be able to um delegate different uh or other dids to be able to access certain assets or if you do capability invocation you would be able to delegate this permission for a completely new account to actually manage that resource how is it access controlled handle if any um yeah and since it's on chain you just get the document and you would be able to read which dids are part of the capability invitation or delegation yeah yeah uh i mean like to uh posits point uh i guess that's one of the benefits of actually having a blockchain to structure data that way but uh we we do like our friends over there at ceramic they definitely uh what is it um have a really good uh toolkit for ipld objects and all that stuff uh yeah all right if that is it um be sure to follow us on twitter definitely we'll be putting out an update later this week and yeah if you want to keep progress of our github um that's probably where you'll get all of our updates we're always turning away there um yes yes uh and uh let me know if i'm pronouncing your name wrong but ocean um following up on ceramics on our buckets are acting as folders for items like uh ceramic streams um i i think you could compare ceramic streams a lot more to the channels um because it's like the real-time data transfer and you can think of the buckets like let's say that you sign up for just join me application the user would have a specific join me bucket where that application information is being stored on behalf of the user and they would be able to delegate the access to these resources to other applications likes like if you wanted to build extensions or integrations with other services or um like that also users also have a specific bucket for being able to manage this authentication data with the mpc i was talking about earlier uh and yes buckets hold a bunch of objects so like since the schema is defined on chain and that itself is just like the type definition of what an object is um the buckets in this case is basically pointing to where you can find the user data cool all right i think that's all the questions we have for now um thank you so much to everyone uh for attending and joining um the team is available on discord in the sponsor so on our channel so feel free to reach out if you have any questions and otherwise the they have their team email on the slide as well so feel free to reach out there too um and for michael and pratt thank you so much for taking the time to host a workshop for hack fs i was super interesting and informative and i hope everyone has a great rest of your morning evening or afternoon thanks everyone you
