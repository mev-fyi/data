foreign [Applause] [Music] we're incredibly proud and excited about this but along the way I think we just also got much much more uh interconnected stronger as the team more convinced about our mission and the fact that we actually can uh contribute a lot this industry and hopefully to to the world and yeah with this I would just actually hand it over to the actual hero and the person who made his mission to deliver this EK VM which is my good friend and co-founder Jordi balina and thank you thanks everyone again thank you thank you halo for for those words uh yeah but the hero it's like I'm just an engineer just try to just try to stay with the new that's what am I so um at the start of the talk uh I would like to start a little bit from the origins uh when we finish from polygon have investment we finished the first version of the Opera payment solving herbis and we I was in zuk and and at that point uh a very good fear and Barry White Hat come to my home he challenged me about the game yeah uh We Believe actually what the first time he told me about that I told him this is impossible and it is impossible to do but he just didn't see freaking in the different pieces uh we were well we were just uh trying to see okay let's do the exercise uh how we can do that and we were like going to the different uh to different challenges to the different critical points and we were zombie most of them in a very complex way a lot of times but we had the intuition at that point that things were possible and and we'll start to dig on that and and there was a moment where most of the big challenges that we had is okay they are solved at that point so this is really this could be possible okay and it was at this point that I started first convincing uh my partner on Center Point and Tony and uh well first here also Barbie have a lot to to come inside but this is a feature I think we can do that on that and then I did the presentation in Paris just explaining the community uh how I believe this could be possible and here I started the the real rule you know the the brushing they started not a lot but with a small team from the Harvest uh from the heart of esteem and there was a Kira crucial uh a crucial moment that was The Virtue with polygon this actually was fundamental because it certainly allows to put all the resources that we needed to build uh to build obvious uh with this we just built a team I just got uh the best professionals the best people that I knew that could deliver on that I convinced them to join the state but therefore together with the people that already was in their best would be of the what I believe it's the best thing in the world uh the team that can can really build that we started to work hard uh for a year and in Paris one year later we presented the could be a prototype if you want to be the first version that was a full proverb it was a proverb that really works terminate was terminated that was okay at least this was one this was last in July and since there of course we continue just uh improving this program a lot of optimizations in October last year we launched the the public test net that was another huge milestone and since there many who has been working really hard mainly focus on security security auditing checking double checking doing interval audience dealing with external audience to building rebuilding parts of the code to cleaning the code and and until we feel comfortable uh with the code that uh we have and here is where we are uh we are today at the day of the day that we have been achieving uh very much so the day that was uh that seems like impossible three years ago and it's uh you know this magic says where an engineer uh just uh put the things in production it's like really when the things that started getting useful for the people so this is the important point of the important point of the of the launch another thing that I want to announce now and I think that's also very important is that uh today we are not only launch but not on launching we're also open sourcing all the code and when I mean open sourcing is not making available has been available for the last six months they're also putting a GPR license and a gpl's license toward the reports of the approval I think this is an important gift uh for the comedian I'm very proud uh pronounce that and before uh finishing I wanted to share uh three seconds three seconds why we were able to build uh these things uh so fast the first uh is experience that we got in the first roll-up uh in the Hermes one this was uh really uh I mean all the all the learnings that we got from there down applied some some way uh to these uh to this throw up to that to this Acadia the second part is architecture I think that here we need a very good decisions and uh told you inside the architecture we divide the architecture in measures we have a low layer which is the the cryptography major okay that talks about polynomial commitments a star long sun or disrecursion about France and this is an important which has been an important layer another layer is the the arithmetization uh just with this sometimes it's a cool ad we have the sibim of uh the hardware later it's a piece of Hardware it has nothing to do with Hardware but we call it the hardware system layer issue we build the language for uh working in this layer we found this language appeal and we built the processor on top of this layer kind of VM specific processor to decode things as normal processor and in top of that is the software radio we got the ROM layer which is actually the program that's running on top of this processor to build this program we have to build an assembly for this processor and then the program that's actually the program that actually uh emulates the ABM and actually runs the Amia together and all these are stuck in layers allows us to have different teams working in parallel each one in one of these layers so not only that for example for auditing having also different nowadays running in parallel with different specialized teams working uh together this is what allows us to to to build the things uh so fast you know this amazing team already mentioned before but this amazing team uh team that's absolutely has been absolutely committed working day night and weekends for the last two years because they believe in this project and uh learning together because it's like you create the language and then you need to learn about that language and then you need to go back and forth and has in a huge effort but at the same time has been uh also a pleasure we enjoy it and and also I mean uh we had so fun also beyond that and these both things together this has worked this professionalism of the team and this uh uh and this uh I enjoy I enjoy the world that you're having done is what uh allows us to to to to build this uh uh this product uh this uh polygon cqbm uh so fast so in order to uh blockchain in order to redo the real launch uh we decided to well I uh that the way to we really say that the good way to do would be that to invite uh vitalik to do the symbolic first transaction of these uh of easy Kevin so I would like to invite Italy just to do uh these uh to do this transaction hello italicum thank you very much for accepting this uh Mr section next let's see if everything works the PC is a little bit risky but um hi Jordy it's uh good to be here good to see all of you guys um okay I shall uh I guess uh click present and uh then I click on here and then okay great so let's see okay you see my metamask 0.01 e if I'm connected to the polygons EK VM right okay so then you did the bridge before so that's I did I did indeed I did the bridge before okay so then I have to send uh what address should I send to um with okay let's uh go on polygod ckvm we'll check this uh most recent transaction and how about we'll take whoever sent it um someone to send to them um and ran sends to them 0.005 eats um except again it's a little bit six five zero four two have somewhere mean value and then click next yes maybe you want to put the message there or something how do I put a message again I I would show you I was just that like I was looking this up and like gbt told me to like click on Advanced options but I don't see Advanced options should be fine without the message sure sure okay yes sir okay some didn't do you know how to like add call data by the way uh like would you yeah I mean it's like the bands options I show the data somewhere right right but I just like like I don't see the advanced options field or something right and I cannot see very good the screen but that's amazing uh right here um oh there we go again um I guess to show them out there uh I did the previous one all right the configuration yes let's go to the configuration of metamask oh oh I see okay um okay hold on can I control zero again click on polygon um uh hold on where where do I go first American Service and just go to the okay just go to the configuration oh then then there we go okay perfect so I gotta add Network and then I just go back to networks and then Paul again ckvm and then that's okay but that's okay that's uh which which is in general Maybe advanced in advanced a second Advanced oh oh I see okay and Ryan stayed I mean that's gas control I'll show that but you're just up uh show that guys at this one just yeah there we go yeah okay okay let's see how this works um okay we're gonna call it send to this address send to oh there we go 0.05 um okay set let's do a meme number and then over it's here okay great I have to create some hex data okay I don't know we just wait for hex data first uh let's see I need something something corny I'll I'll deliver coordinate thank you okay is that corny enough for you that's perfect okay amazing okay going back here I'll um sir and uh sent to the 0x7 whoever that says 0.005 that's 11 has to go to a meme number uh and then X beta 0x or whatever this is um no I would mean number okay next I just and then confirm okay send pending amazing just it should no go forward okay but it says success um okay so we have so maybe yeah you can see the data there we're already showing that just showing and show just the selection lyrics There we go okay we made it okay I was not sleeping for life isn't so happy yeah so I think Grace so we can continue with we have the first attraction better well now we have a sufficiently launched cqvm you may not pay that and we love turning we love it so uh no there's a big Welcome to our community to our developers to our Builder and um we just want to say that we're going to share everything that you need to know about mainai beta at 6 30 the Central European Time or at 4 30 GMT time so with that and with this excitement we will continue with a five side chat and we will invite now vitalik and Jordy to stay in and no better person to take this fire chat on than mihilo
