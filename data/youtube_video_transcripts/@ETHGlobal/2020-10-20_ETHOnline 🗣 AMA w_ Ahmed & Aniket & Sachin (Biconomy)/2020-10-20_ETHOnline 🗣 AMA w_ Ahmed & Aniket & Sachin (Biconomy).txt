awkward pause glad carl got here on time i almost sent out a search party 15 minutes late to the last one there we go my relic of what once was this will be worth something someday someday someday it'll be a collector's item okay we're good awesome all right let's get started then um cool so thanks again to everybody for for attending uh the ema with uh with the economy team um here we have uh we have ahmed we have anakit and we have sachin um from the bi-economy side uh we're gonna chat all that sort of how things got kicked off uh the history a little bit of course what is uh bi-economy and then the technology that enables um and uh basically everything in between so uh looking forward to this conversation and of course a big thank you to the teams the first time we've had the opportunity to to work so closely with them um and you know we're really appreciative of the support we can't do this thing without our sponsors and um other everyone kind of bearing the cost on behalf of the attendees so uh big big thank you uh for for doing so and and for coming to the event and uh for the first time i know it's a big it's a big big jump and uh we're really really thankful to have you on board absolutely no no we um enjoy we're really enjoying actually so yeah really uh really pumped to be a part of it awesome cool so let's maybe start um i started sort of a little bit early early on in the process of like kind of the history if you will i love to kind of get a sense of sort of what everybody was working on um you know before uh before biconomy and what you're working on now i'd love to kind of know a little bit of like the origin story if you will yeah how how we got to to creating this and um yeah a little bit i guess be the the before times before we talk about the current times if that makes sense yeah no of course absolutely so um you know i'll also start off and um we so me and anika knew each other for like a couple of years um he managed to sort of actually manage to get to know sachin which he introduced me to around the beginning of 2018 um i was actually working for a dubai-based vc um back in the end of 2018 um they were they're very traditional e-commerce tech they've done sort of plus billion dollar exits and they were just interested in blockchain so i was helping them with tot with investing in blockchain and tokens then it was really at the end of 2018 when i was working there that's when me sachin anika came together we wanted to do something in the space and we actually uh we thought you know what staking is cool why not like run staking as a service we invested in tezos we liked the idea of proof of stake we thought you know let's go and see how it goes and so three months of sort of being a baker and running nodes we sort of realized that hey wait a minute all right we've secured the network but like what's next right you know where are these applications um okay and now there are some applications we saw where is that actual adoption where are the users and so we really asked ourselves the question um okay why are there no users and what are the main inhibitors affecting mainstream adoption and so we sort of did a research you know we spoke to a couple of developers a couple of applications out there and sort of realized that hey wait a minute user exp uh not many people are addressing hello hey i think you're coming back now yeah just a little bit yeah i think when you're talking about the user experience yeah yes exactly so user experience and developer experience were solved two really big issues and that we saw uh and so we saw you know many companies really replicating lots of infrastructure in-house that they didn't need to um uh most of which you know which we saw were um a concept called meta transactions whereby you know in very simple um layman terms or and the end users are subsidized um in terms of gas fees the developers pay gas fees on behalf of the end users and so we saw that you know multiple companies were building out um this infrastructure in house to basically enable more adoption for their applications and we thought hey this is actually a really interesting concept but one which is still not yet optimized [Music] so being made to a really clear compelling um infrastructure service and so you know for us we thought hey wait a minute how how about you know we actually build this you know piece of infrastructure out and sort of just you know give away as an api sdk um and really since then you know we thought okay this no thing was cool but like we thought this was a really bigger opportunity and because not many people really tackling it at that time um and we were just sort of you know um i'd say really head on with our vision of really bringing mainstream adoption awesome yeah very cool um awesome anything to add add to maybe your stories uh any kit and uh sachin yeah i can i can also probably start like prior to backgrounding what was happening so yeah i think amazon discussed like uh i and amazed to study together back in china so i did work for uh you know companies like finance uh at early on stages like when were just they were doing an seo kind of interesting experience to see you know the growth happening over there and then like moved back to india and india i was focusing mainly on the investment side of things so helping out from india to actually can you guys hear me yeah i can hear you okay yeah yeah yeah uh carl said you can't hear very well maybe if you just want to speak up any kids yeah so yeah i came back to india 2018 and i'm helping many projects from india like in terms of investments in terms of doing some media and this is where i nama always used to talk about things when i do the space and mit sachin in one of the events in india that's that's you know like a vision sort of a line regarding things he wanted to do in the space and things i wanted to do so as ahmed said like back in 2018 late we all got together and we started by economy and the mean definitely the mission was to sort of drive the main option because we were like working with different protocols different investing in different teams but we're not seeing any sort of adoption happening and uh this is like how it got started and we wanted to see you know all these applications and more users to come on board and that was basically the entire sort of you know mission of starting my economy gotcha cool and then such and i'll give you the the last word on this question if there's anything that was uh left out or omitted happy to turn over to you yeah so i i come from a you know technical background uh so i have you know i did my engineering in computer science in 2012 and uh you know back then uh i worked in companies like samsung and uh um make my trip that's one of the unicorns of india so you know it's funny i in 2000 uh i think it was it was 2013. you know i i was trying to mine bitcoin uh you know i saw a video a cool video on you know youtube about this bitcoin and i tried to mine bitcoin you know i tried to run a software on my pc but of course like nothing happened and then you know i gave it up and then again in 2017 again i you know because this blockchain technology was coming up in the space and being a developer you know i started looking at from a technology point of view and you know that's when i realized the you know full potential of this technology and you know i decided to you know quit my full-time working job and then you know i was fully into the space you know exploring the space from a technology point of view and uh yeah as emma said like back then uh you know we started off with the uh tasers my tasers were mining you know at that point in time you know so everyone was you know experimenting around with some you know solutions in this space but no one was actually building a proper solution for you know these uh web3 developers so that's when you know it's you know strike to us that why not you know build a solution that other people can use you know that that's uh how we started by economy awesome cool um so yeah so i mean maybe we'll dive into a little bit about the economy and what you guys are building um so you know you i think ahmed you mentioned sort of the early days you know thinking a lot about user experience and developer experience as well um as being kind of critical drivers here um you know a big piece behind your tech is it's kind of the idea of meta transactions which i know you touched on a little bit as well um i guess maybe first question would be sort of like how how do meta transactions play into the kind of user experience developer experience world and what are some you know like basically great example use cases um that you can turn to uh to otherwise improve uh the web3 experience basically yeah absolutely i mean i think really the core concept around i always like to use this analogy of um you know whenever you're watching netflix you know video netflix doesn't really charge you their aws bill do they right um so what why do these decentralized applications um charge at every point you know sort of a gas fee stop uh yeah they don't go to the adapts themselves but they still go they go to sort of the the miners which are basically sort of maintaining the the the dap as it were right and so um you know whenever you look at sort of traditional web two applications it's very seamless it's very easy to use there are no sort of headaches you know when when you do any sort of transaction um or any sort of interaction um the most um you'd see is do you confirm this and then it's a yes or no and then just go on right with your life so it's so we've seen and you know that there's been a lot of research that sort of goes in to show that you know the more steps you sort of put in the the more distracted your your end user becomes and they they drop off i think um it was you know during the height of cryptokitties and metamorph so a 99 drop of freight for you know um so um that goes to show you know the you know the complexities that new people have to deal with um when it comes to on board and so really the idea behind meta transactions we really see is that okay you know what we'll probably be seeing the future is all right um developers will be paying these gas fees on behalf of end users but it might happen in a number of different ways a they subsidize it just outright um b it might just be priced in already um so there might be a service that that that would potentially you know offer and it's just priced in i mean to whatever the customers are paying for or it might then it could be sponsored by an ad right um so you could see sort of domino's pizza as a gift you know popping up saying they've sort of sponsored your transaction fee and so we really see these um that these are sort of three main ways as to you know how we see transaction fees being um you know played out um in the long run and so why is this important again because if your end users are using your application you'd want them to basically just have a very seamless experience very frictionless experience you don't want them to sort of confirm or approve a smart contract and then sort of pay gas again you just want them to sort of sign once and that's it um and you're it's sort of good to go um and great use cases are basically any interaction um you would want your users to have with so essentially any inter [Music] contract so you know we've um basically helped to power applications like curve finance idle finance as well and it's allowed users to deposit and use those products and basically very easily and very and sort of free right they didn't have to pay gas it's just sort of one click experience and they managed to basically use the application very easily and so so that's that's what we envisioned sort of a very easy to use um and robust transaction um experience for for end users we haven't even gone into like sort of dealing with like pending transactions and stuck transactions but i guess we could go into that a bit later yeah i think we'll probably touch some of that for sure um maybe even with this question my next question so i i mean i think one of the interesting things is like you said um you know the beginning of kind of the relationship here was built around sort of um you know baking on tezos and sort of proof of steak on pesos and um which which obviously is is not ethereum right and i think kind of one of the interesting things as well is that um you know by economies the tech is built in such a way that it is uh chain agnostic right so you know like obviously this is a service that uh can be helpful on any major blockchain right who has the issue of of needing to you know submit transactions and do so on behalf of other people and that kind of thing so i guess kind of you know long way of saying i guess what was sort of the the interest in making sure that you were staying kind of you know so agnostic from everywhere else and are there any kind of trade-offs that you found that are associated with doing so rather than say you know pairing one to one on the ethereum network i don't know who's backing do you want to go ahead on this or um so you know initially we started on ethereum when we were you know building out the solution and uh at that point in time you know uh gas fees were not that much high you know it was around one gigabyte gas price at that point in time but uh you know with the uh you know when when apps like cryptokitties you know apps like those uh you know got involved in the system then you know we got to know about like how an app could you know uh crash uh the whole blockchain you know and you know with the with the increase in demand uh users are at that point in time like crypto users are willing to pay like highest gas fees just to get their transaction involved so you know on ethereum this gas price substrate subsidizing this gas price is not actually a practical solution you know given the gas prices you know went really crazy in the last two three months you know when you saw this t5 wave but you know we believe in the long term uh you know the gas prices would go down and you know at that point in time some layer two solutions for you know there were some talks about these layer two coming up uh in the future where you know they will reduce the gas that's gas cost and you know they will you know uh increase the the block creation uh and decrease the block creation time so that's when we realized like it's not just this level you know we have to i think uh you know into the future and we have to like like be a blockchain agnostic right from day one because it's not just about ethereum uh and in the future it's like gonna be uh you know mix of various chains with their uh you know advantage their specific advantage and you never know like where the the whole community moves you know towards in the future right now the the biggest advantage of ethereum is it has you know it has the composibility right now you know everything is on ethereum but uh of course like uh in the future i i think you know layer two would be a great thing you know given the gas prices we see on layer one that's you know when we decided okay let's build this infrastructure blockchain agnostic so that you know when it comes to uh the whole community moving to a particular layer or any other solution we would be really you know there also so and and speaking of trade-off uh the i don't i like i didn't see any any any trade-off you know when you're building the system uh it's just you know how modular how scalable you know your architecture should be in order to support these you know multi blockchain i think that was the only challenge i would not call it a trade-off you know in that sense uh and uh yeah i mean uh it's it's actually like like being blockchain agnostic is actually you know good for us also so uh and i don't see any trade-off in security also because our system is trustless actually you know you don't have to trust uh with your transaction data uh to us because uh you know the all the uh you know you you sign the transaction data and we can't tamper you know with any of your data and if we try to do it uh the transaction would not pass on the blockchain so you know in terms of security i would not say any trade-off but only thing right now is the bike on me is you know semi-centralized so you know some would say uh you could you know censor the transactions i think that's the only thing right now but you know we are on the path of you know uh uh making it uh you know a decentralized solution tomorrow but not right from day one uh so i think we can talk uh you know a bit more about that yeah thought i'm just i'm gonna do what certainly regarding um you know use cases and also of different genes that we are supporting and you know like as samantha mentioned before that wherever the transaction is we see by economy playing a role so like from the day one we made sure that you know our system works with any like other blocks and as well so currently uh we will live on ethereum uh matec xi and we come compatible with any other evm change and the best part about bioeconomy is like to integrate with any vm chain and this takes like few hours of integration so we made the integration with the finance smart chain within within a day so the plan ahead is to support as many as evm chain as possible and you know have as many transaction as possible happening and yeah and this is this is like how we see you know the the space evolving and how about we can be playing apart and not only atm but any other blockchain out there awesome and i mean since that you know in a way your blockchain agnostic and are sort of you know sitting apart is it is it currently possible or is it maybe in the future kind of future plans to be able to like kind of relay transactions between these different chains in sort of like a more interop type way like could i then you know pay for an xdi transaction with ethereum or vice versa so this is something we are very excited about actually this is part of the route for maxwell and we're actually working on it to have you know interoperable transactions between different latest or different lay ones as well so definitely i think that the way we are thinking about is firstly integrate with as many layer 2s and layer ones as possible so the easiest way possible to go to market strategy is to integrate more lates and evm based change so as i already said like uh xanmatic is already integrated and we are like looking at other other later solutions as well um talking of lay one uh you know tesla's is something you know we're working closely with and we are you know planning to support uh our take uh fundraisers as well in the next couple of months so once we have you know transactions being delayed on all these blockchains then definitely uh the next step ahead is how we can have interoperable transactions and how we can sort of interact the two or two layers you know together so this is something really excited about and already you know like we have a couple of plans on how we ought to do things yeah i mean just to add on to that i mean we are sort of i would say doing a part of that already where we're sort of like um like for example we're um supporting this application on layer 2 which is running on xdi um but what's interesting is is that you know if you're basically a user on metamask you don't need to change um sort of the the rpc or anything to solve the xdi chain and so you could just really sign from ethereum and and basically the transactions happen in the background um so that's pretty cool and that's i'd say that is you know a uh let's say a current way of how we're trying to sort of you know play about in this interoperability game before we sort of go on to do sort of let's say from x die to to other chains or from ethereum to other chains as well um but we'll see i mean we're you know we're also speaking to other um you know like you have a concept of um you have a binary smart chain as well which have their own sort of relay concept as well which is really interesting so this is a very sort of nascent space which we're sort of continuously you know exploring and which we're actively a part of i love it now it's like a really cool um i think the future space like i think it's just a very interesting space it's kind of like the idea of like in a way like kind of weaving fabric together i think you guys get to be the the piece of string that brings it all together which i think would be very very interesting yeah um awesome cool so i want to just note for everybody else in the chat that if you do have any questions feel free to either raise your hand or ask them directly in the chat and we'll be sure to bring them up so yeah so i i guess you know thinking about um the tech that you've created so far um you know i guess basically big question that i normally ask people is you know if you were kind of at this event hacking as a as a creator as a hacker um what would you probably be building right now like what is sort of the um you know maybe thinking about sort of the technology that you've built and what it enables um what would sort of be some of the exciting use cases that that you would want to try out i guess on your own tech if that makes sense yeah that's that's actually a really good question um i i would say i mean what's interesting is because you know the way we built our tech is that it it's basically it could basically support any general transaction whatever the use case so we haven't really built it for a particular type of let's say use case um but i would i would mainly say that um uh you know what would be really interesting are for use cases which are very let's say customer centric and end user focused where we'd see i mean whatever the use case whether it's an nft use case whether it's a um a d5 use case um um specifically for end users where there's just sort of an you know a very very clean ux um around the actual use case of the application i would say so um you know something that's very smooth and sleek and so just doesn't really annoy the end user with extra complicated steps is something that you know we'd like to see and basically you know this is what we think is going to be the norm right in the next couple of years um so yeah i mean unless such a nikket i'm sure you guys have other ideas if you look at the uh the current market situation you know i would i would definitely would want to work something on the gaming aspect because as for the current market situation and uh you know being an application maybe on some layer two i think uh attack works perfectly over there and already if have seen like many of our clients on the gaming industry using us and what sort of value by economy can add to the user experience after integration so a gaming application where they see you know frequent interactions of users on chain and to remove the friction point definitely you know my economy plays a very important part so i would have definitely you know built something or something over there yeah i am also like like more inclined to you know seeing more you know cool games uh that uh have really you know uh a slick user experience uh you know that that is something uh you know being able uh because prior to bike or me if you're building a game uh you know for the end user for normal gamer who doesn't you know know what what uh what exactly uh ether is what exactly a gas is you know you can't see any any adoption on those for these games on the blockchain but right now if you have a very cool idea you know you could really you know build it out of blockchain without worrying about these you know complexities and that's what we abstract away from the end user uh you know that that's what our solution does so yeah awesome yeah i think i'm in the same vein i'm still waiting for the amazing like diablo mmo type clone game that works perfectly nfts as kind of a first-class citizen it's coming but uh i haven't seen it yet but yeah i think i think i'd be hacking on the same thing um awesome and then um i i guess like we talked about sort of the interoperability piece uh of maybe being one of the future projects or things that uh overlap with bi economy any anything else that you can tell us that is like in the pipeline um that you're thinking about or or projects that that you're actively working on um i guess basically a weird way of saying what's next yeah yeah yeah i mean there's something you know we're working on actively and uh you know um we will be rolling out in couple of weeks from now as the forwarder contract uh so what it enables us you know it enables the end users to pay fees and you actually don't need tokens you know um so this is another you know something uh cool and very exciting uh you know uh product feature that we are planning to do a lot because of course you know let's say you're holding a lot of synthetics or compound and not having ethers you would want to pay peace and center compound on while using the platform so this is something also we can enable and something you know uh we do see like a lot of demand in the market and uh i think the initial sort of primary test has been done and we are very excited to probably launch it in a couple of weeks to make sure like the end users we provide more convenience to the end users to pay transaction fees not only ethereum but maybe in some stable coins or some here erc20 tokens so yeah this is this is another exciting product feature that will be rolling out soon awesome yeah that sounds great i mean yeah for people who either don't have eth or either on purpose or by accident it's certainly very frustrating to get to your wallet and realize you can't do anything um so yeah i can totally see that being you know really valuable use case and yeah and uh one more thing like it's good for you know these daps who does not want to subsidize you know these gas costs for the end user it's it's really you know good use case for those also you know uh so so that the burden is not on the tap tap developer also you know end user gets to pay the gas fees but at the same time he doesn't have you know uh a crew or all the ether all the gas you know specific to that particular blockchain so you know it's uh uh every everyone is happy that developer don't have to subsidize uh the fees from his pocket and you know end user also gets to you know uh uh gets to use the app by just you know paying in the token the user have so yeah awesome and then of course i can see this being even more powerful when paired with the feature of being able to have interrupts between different chains and that kind of thing of course just kind of like end times ends the search space of things you can do basically so yeah um that's that's really cool um awesome great well let's see if there's any audience questions uh there is one but uh i'm not sure if you're interested i'm not sure if it's totally related to your project or not um so maybe we can skip that one um that that is a billion dollar question i mean it is a billion dollar question yeah and many different answers to this my first actually it's funny because my first because i first started as a researcher and brought [Music] back now yeah yep um yeah i was saying yeah i was saying in 2016 was sort of when i got into the space and the first research topic i took up was actually identity and that has um yeah pretty much sort of um i'd say at least you know it's it's pretty much um evolved over these couple of years you know you've got even newer companies different people think about many different things and identity and to be honest do you really need blockchain for identity is also a separate question so there are more questions and answers when it comes to this yeah yeah it's definitely a big topic which i think is outside of the scope of what you guys are working on but yeah like you said there's a lot of people that are working on that problem right now and um there's like huge consortiums even uh that are trying to tackle it so uh it is literally a billion dollar question yeah but it's going to happen is it everyone hold on we don't know when awesome all right well it looks like maybe we'll we'll wrap up here um thank you so much for for taking the time out to review the chat with us um really again thank you for taking part in the event both both here and both you know sponsoring us by economy um of course for anyone who is looking to build um with the ux as a central pillar of your tech or or really in kind of any way to make your app not a web three app uh in in usability take a look at what they're building and uh take a look at using bicon me in your hack um uh of course you know if it's a user facing thing then you really owe it to your users to take a look so i'd strongly recommend it and of course they have you know prizes for integration and all that stuff so um yeah so i guess you know with that being said thanks again uh really enjoyed this conversation and uh catch everybody on discord thanks a lot thank you thank you thank you hey guys bye
