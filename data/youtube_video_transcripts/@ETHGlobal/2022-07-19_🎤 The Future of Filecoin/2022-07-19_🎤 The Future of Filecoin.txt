[Applause] [Music] so we are going to jump into our next talk of the summit which is going to be by ali developer alley i should be chatting about um the future file coins so filecoin obviously has a ton of stuff in the pipeline and recent stuff that has been very exciting announcements so um a lot to cover um in a pretty short amount of time so i'll probably just get out of the way and let ali handle this so um ally when you're ready feel free to jump in here uh share some slides if you've got them um and i'll let you take it from here thanks so much for being here awesome awesome thank you and thank you for the introduction and i caught a little bit of the end of lucas's talk and he's absolutely right there is so much going on in our ecosystem and so many opportunities to be involved um and so much coming up in the pipeline too which i want to chat to you about today so uh hello all um i'm ali and i'm a developer advocate here at the farcoin foundation uh so i'm very happy to be surrounded by such amazing company here at hack fs and i'm really grateful be to be included in today's amazing lineup as well so i appreciate you all taking the time out of your normal schedules to listen in and to learn today as well pack yourself on the back for uh you know spending your free time uh doing something positive for yourself as well so today i want to chat about the future of filecoin and some of the projects we're really excited about here at filecoin and protocol labs as well um so uh first a reminder of why we're doing all these things so i heard this quote um that is up on the slide here a couple of months ago when i was listening to juan verde uh the founder of protocol labs in case you didn't know uh talk at a small peer-to-peer meet-up in paris and it really struck me at the time because this is exactly why i'm in tech and more specifically it's why i'm in web 3. so one of the reasons i went into tech originally is because of just how fundamentally innovative and uh how fundamentally innovation and technological advancement if i can get that out i can change and improve our human lives so tech really creates new frontiers for us like the ability to take photos of black holes or to build sustainable energy sources uh go to the moon many years ago it can also help us solve some of our increasingly complex problems so with faster and more powerful computing crunching over more and more stored and available data and we'll get to that soon and it also has the capability to enable changes in not just our daily lives but those small daily uh changes do add up but also in society itself so we really don't have to look back too far to see evidence of that either like in the past 100 years alone advances in things like healthcare or inventions like the sewing machine the washing machine the printing press and then onto the more modern era of computers obviously the internet and mobile phones uh have drastically impre improved the lives of millions um and that's paved the way for major social changes and also a rethinking of the value and role of people in society as well so for example those household automations gave freedom and empowerment to women across the world they changed the landscape for women in general for the better uh the internet's given more accessibility and education to education and ideas sorry as well as enabling collaboration on a global scale and i have no idea where we would have been if the covert pandemic had been in the 80s for example so to me the real goal is not just tech in and of itself the real goal is people and it's improving the human condition uh by leveraging tech and other scientific breakthroughs to do so so uh that's also why it's kind of essential that we're creating a future for the underlying technology that we use daily to provide that open and fair web that protects our human rights and helps move humanity forward um so you know obviously that's the vision we hold here at protocol labs and the far farcoin foundation um and it's a vision that's that was also shared by the early web and open source movement and both of which were founded on being like a cooperative accessible and free sharing of knowledge and information so this is really what drives us um here at far corn foundation and protocol labs and it's a mission that i'm generally here for and why i'm working in web 3 and i'm sure many of you have similar stories as well but it's not without its challenges of course so let's talk about our data which is where we really play here so data is an absolutely essential part of those daily lives and also a super fast growing field in web3 because we need to enable distributed storage mechanisms that can also enable so many new applications and use cases to be built out with more permanence and with trustlessness and without the silos that we're used to in the centralized uh world today which you know can have a lot of problems so they have central points of failure central attack vectors um they're sensors censored because uh these are centralized entities can decide what data they want to put on there uh and they can also just lock you out if they don't like you for example or you're on from their own country you're from the wrong side of the road you're wearing the wrong socks it's their choice it's their it's their centralized well centralization model so they can do that anyway so uh these these current models are have several issues and they also like create vendor lock-in and create a lack of a free market around data pricing and like portability of your own data as well um so we've definitely seen a lot of issues around companies create using us as the product so all these issues is obviously why far coin was originally uh launched um it's designed to leverage crypto economic incentives to keep data distributed reliable and verifiably stored as well as being incredibly cheap and that this mission and the current issues in data storage is why filecoin was launched but as you're most likely aware um but and just over 15 months since we did launch the network which it hasn't been long we're so young we're still babies we've achieved so many great um things and we've come a long way towards creating an internet scale decentralized storage network but there's still a lot more to do um and this is where this is this is why this talk is called the future of far coin as well um so currently file coin enables verifiable storage at scale in that decentralized trustless and open way but accessing and retrieving that data isn't always very simple it's also not that easy to create programmable applications on top of this data or smart contracts or to do computation either overstate or over the data itself so all of these technology vectors form the future of far coin and the tech stack for the decentralized internet and we're not just focused on growing the technology either we're also growing our impact and aiming to build sustainably and with social good at our core um and our core value as well which is why the first project that i uh building for the future of file coin that i want to share with you today is far coin green so some of you might have heard of this project falcon green is an initiative that seeks to make the falcon uh blockchain uh carbon neutral and in time carbon negative uh so we're also a part of the crypto climate accord here uh so the thing is uh a lot of the conversations happening around blockchains focus on the proof of work chains and how much energy they're consuming um and look we are thinking about or at least falcon green is thinking about what uh the positives are of having this transparent ledger that we can track data on uh because filecoin green when we because we have an open network that allows us to capture and report storage provider energy use and energy sources and efficiency statistics all of a sudden we can uh track the energy in our chain as well as tracking where that energy is coming from and we can create tools for the entire web 3 um you know space and beyond actually um to help with the tracking their energy systems and this is becoming a big thing in the world especially in europe and especially and you know many other countries we're all quite concerned about climate change and we want to create actions so this is what falcon green's doing it's looking to uh make the falcon network green and sustainable as well as being an important player in driving those sustainability initiatives in crypto and leveraging that transparent tracking and accountability provided by the blockchain to create those open source tools to measure and reduce environmental impacts in web3 protocols and there's even an api you can play around with with filecoin green and some grants that i'll get to later um so as developers you can be involved that way but in order to meet these goals uh the team has done quite a few things they've created an energy dashboard to evaluate the use of energy on the filecoin chain which is at filecoin.energy it's also connecting storage providers in the network to renewable energy and providing assistance and grants to do this uh including green grants and the launch of a regenerative finance uh grant round as well that they've just launched they're also running hackathons and conferences to gather the community together and hear new ideas and build a greener web 3 dev community so if you're interested in this side of things in this um action on climate change and creating greener chains and and green tools for energy tracking uh then farquain green might be something that you want to have a look into um so they've even pledged and i actually was watching uh mark from the far clean green team this morning at 8th barcelona he gave an up or this afternoon i should say at 8th barcelona he gave a talk and this slide really stood out to me um so they've made a file queen green pledge where we want to be 80 renewable electricity procured by end of financial year 2023 so that's not really very far away and 100 by 2025 um so they've made a pledge to try and make this happen on the file coin sheen so we're not just buying carpet credits to offset our carbon usage but we also want to be completely sustainable um so obviously if you want to be uh find out more about any of this uh there's heaps of ways to be involved uh like i said earlier there is an api and the falcon green team is running hackathons they're running run running one at the moment called sbs and there'll be more in future um there's plenty of places to get update you can follow up updates follow them on the twitter uh for more information and contact them there as well and you can apply for a far queen green grant as well so there's our grants options for these type of initiatives um and the next exciting thing that's coming up if you are around paris or you're going to fcc uh just after that we have a sustainability uh summit which they've been planning for a long time and is going to be awesome lots of cool speakers there so july 23 i think that's on uh 22-23 so check that out if you're around paris and you're interested in that so the future of far coin is then also highly retrievable with file coin saturn so at the moment the far coin uh network is really more of an archival network uh when we store something on file coin it can take quite a long time to retrieve that data which is why our use cases are really for like kind of permanent and open data storage at the moment but falcon saturn is aiming to change this uh so this is this is one of the reasons far clean saturn is building out a decentralized cdn that will allow anyone to participate in the network from their laptops and other devices and be rewarded for serving files and folders to requesters so what that kind of means in layman's terms is that i can install something on my laptop and be a part of the filecoin retrieval network so not only does this drop latency and improve retrieval speeds in the network it kind of incentivizes participation and creates a retrievals market um which is a really exciting project uh and i'm definitely not doing it justice um you can even actually at the moment i believe currently a test it out so if you do want to join in or try out filecoin saturn um and be involved in the beta version of testing file queen saturn it's currently out and you can check out the github it's also got a massive roadmap so this is like a really enormous project and and there's lots of information on the github as well like the farquaad saturn team does host a lot of demo days uh which they record and put up on github so if you are interested not github youtube sorry so if you are interested in seeing more go and check out some of their youtube as well or as i said be involved they're looking for early partners so check out the code base there and and get in touch if you do want to try and be part of this early network but it will enable so many more people to access the network or enable faster retrievals so i can't imagine some of the use cases that we're going to get um from having this you know decentralized cdn live on the filecoin network so pretty exciting project and we're looking forward to that like obviously they've got a really quick timeline or they're hoping to get this out by you know q3 or q4 of this year so it's going to be really exciting to see so many people be able to actively participate in this network from their browsers and maybe even their phones in future then will be just like a silicon valley season for pfeiffer um almost anyway just kidding anyway the next project is one that i'm personally very excited about uh and i've been working kind of closely with this team so i will probably spend a little bit longer on this one because the future of file coin is going to be programmable with the filecoin virtual machine uh what does this mean this basically means that we're bringing smart contracts to a storage network so you've got storage uh already robust storage network combined with smart contracts so you know currently filecoin's known for being this decentralized storage and retrieval network like providing a lot of extra bytes of distributed data the largest distributed uh decentralized uh data storage network in the world with thousands of storage providers obviously and we can kind of think of this as the layer zero but it's really just a start because we want to be able to compute and analyze over and with the data on that far coin network um so this is the goal of the fbm to enable users to be able to deploy their own smart contracts or actors as the way call them in the uh filecoin ecosystem or in the fvm ecosystem and unlock the ability to perform on-chain computation over state data so this additional layer of capability which we can kind of think of as the layer one on the network adds programmability to this network um and that is going to open up so many boundless uh use cases and opportunities um and i know we were speaking to valas just before and they're super excited about this as well and they were part of the early builders team too so um shout out to them for helping to give us feedback on that program and and on the early fem as well um but just a quick look at the technicals the fbm's built on wasn't core with the reference sdk built in rust and it's also working on supporting evm and solidity capability out of the box uh compatibility out of the box too actually uh we've just released milestone one of fvm onto the fileclean network so it's called the v16 upgrade the skier and skyr skier upgrade uh and that's just been released with built-in actors to the file coin um lotus chain so it's actually running on the network right now but that is just step one uh so it's only built in actors the real programmability will happen in milestone 2.1 which will be out later this year and we're aiming to have that be completely evm compatible so it will be uh the seven se vm so to speak so it'll be the file coin uh evm compatible file coin virtual machine coming out later this this year which will mean you can bring all your uh skills from solidity programming i use all the tooling in the ethereum ecosystem like hard hat or foundry or whatever you like to use you'll be able to use them and deploy to the filecoin network and take advantage of some of those extras um available in the fabric network like robust storage um so that decision has been made and that's so if you want to keep an eye on that uh check out uh the fbm channel of our five point slack as well um but why does this matter are we just trying to build the same use cases as you know are already out there in ethereum in file coin well no um it it's going to really unlock um some really interesting possibilities because we already have this story this robust storage layer so this slide kind of illustrates some of those powerful use cases um and that includes trussless reputation systems so imagine an overlay network of nodes that could patrol this network this uh storage network performing random deals with storage providers in order to gauge key metrics like quality of service guarantees performance latency and region details so those nodes can then store these reputation scores on chain making them traceable and verifiable and enabling users to decide on the terms of service and hence the storage providers that they want to use for their data so that's that's one possibility for these and another one is replication workers so you can ensure the resiliency of your data by ensuring it's always stored end times automatically or be able to store your data just once in the file coin network and have this a trustless actor a smart contract replicate and send that to multiple storage locations and times you could also create a user-defined policy of rules for that data to obey so you can specify things that you got from your trustless reputation system and one of the big ones is going to be perpetual renewal of deals so creating basically permanent storage deals because an actor constantly renews those deals with as many different storage providers as you want i'm probably going over time here because i'm so excited about this one so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna move on so the milestone one like i said has already been shipped and is actually running on the file coin chain right now so for uh uh and milestone two the evm compatible one is getting worked on as we speak and you can be involved in that process um there's there's a lot of action happening in in the issue so if you are like a developer that's interested in uh working on bare bones or even just reading about uh how we're building this blockchain you can go to the github and have a look through the issues where there's a lot of discussions happening around how we're going to do this and why we're making some of these technical and engineering decisions that we are well actually as a group that we are making um so there's also dev opportunities um there's open grants uh for the fvm and there's an early builders program that will be focused on the evm uh compatible fvm like uh builders uh coming up soon so keep an eye out for that as well uh the next use case that i kind of want to talk about is um compute computation uh with filecoin um and it's a bit different to what i just spoke about with the filecoin virtual machine so this uh computational which is project battle baccalaure uh which is portuguese actually for code cod portuguese for cod which is compute over data so fun fact there uh cool name which i have trouble pronouncing but i'm sure someone who who is uh portuguese can probably correct me but anyway project at baccalau is reinventing science with open collaborative computing so we're really aiming to help those people with big data sets so one of the biggest uh challenges in big data is how to process growing data sets efficient efficiently and quickly while also managing costs um so you can have a look at this top picture here the typical data pipeline you've got your ingest and process you've got your engineer and split test data training data train and process serve so project back allow is really working on this first part of the pipeline um so taking on the challenge to bring data processing to the nodes where it's stored on filecoin and give researchers and data engineers the ability to publicly reproduce data pipelines so it's really aiming to transform france transform if i can get my words out big data processing by giving developers simple low-cost distributed first tools that unlock a new collaborative ecosystem so if you're in academics or science get in touch with the team or check out their repo which i've linked there that might be something that that is really interesting to you and could be really useful to you um like i said we're not just aiming to grow file coin uh technically we're also growing file coin by uh being part of uh public goods or creating public either creating public goods or um storing public data sets uh that should be stored persistently on file coin and ipfs and one of the ways we're doing this is through the filecoin foundation for the decentralized web so this is a non-profit um so it's a 501c for those in america whose mission is to ensure that permanent preservation of humanity's most important information and it does this by stewarding the development of open source software and open protocols for decentralized data storage and retrieval networks and focuses on charitable activities related to preserving important data sets such as building and supporting the decentralized web community funding research and development and educating the public about the decentralized web and they've done some amazing work uh this team and continues to do some amazing work so these are some of the web two data sets uh that they have helped to store uh on the file coin um ecosystem on the file clean network i should say so the showa foundation uh if you ever get a chance to watch um uh tim i think his name is from the show foundation talk i would definitely recommend that uh he's a really interesting guy but the show foundation we're preserving a lot of their data from holocaust survivors um together with starling so that that's a really cool use case we're also storing a lot of climate data so as you can imagine these climate data sets are massive they're really big sets of data so we're storing a lot of that on the file coin our network as well uh we've also worked together with the internet archive to help store um some of the data around american elections you could probably guess which one um and do some more uh with that uh just to make sure that it's tamper-proof as well and censorship resistant and that we can we are not uh just a raising history to our liking basically um so those are some of the cool things that we are doing uh with the with uh web 2 data sets and the file clone foundation the decentralized web is doing and they are doing so much more social good as well so if you do have kind of a good use case for them uh please uh get get in touch with that team or well really it's a charity so a lot of file clean uh employees lend out their time to working on the file foundation for the decentralized web um i know we're also starting to store um moot courses from universities to i have ipfs and filecoin as well so that's going to be a really cool used case that's coming out soon too and we're definitely working with some of our ukrainian storage providers to help store some of that data from ukraine uh there because you know there's we all know it's happening there so you know we want to make sure that we're preserving humanity's um data uh and making sure that you know it's preserved um properly uh so the last uh thing i think for the future of filecoin is that it's going to be in your browser uh and there was a recent announcement um as well that i will actually i'm just gonna skip to it because this is the exciting part so one of the most exciting recent news stories was the addition of file going to the brave wallet so this is a seamless integration uh together with many of the other projects that i've talked to the about today really paves the way for new applications to be built natively on the web and the team that is like really doing a lot of work in this space like so making sure that file cloning and ipfs are really accessible or available in the web is talking to all the browsers not just brave to try and make sure that protocols um have a home uh on on all the browsers is the browsers and platforms team which is headed up by dietrich ayala for those of you that might know um so he does a lot of work with the open web foundry as well also what's it called w3c i think yeah and the open web uh he does a lot of volunteering for that as well and he's making sure that you know we have a voice at the table there too so some really cool stuff happening on the browser's team uh another cool thing that happened recently was uh metamask snap deals so these snap deals kind of allow developers uh to expand the functionality of metamask and and make uh basically instant file clean and storage deals um so making a storage deal can actually be a bit of a lengthy process on file coins so with metamask snapdeals we're making it almost instantaneous so you can imagine the kind of applications you can build online uh with something like this and combined with the fvm and then combined with that far coin saturn and the retrievability aspect so there's so many kind of use cases that are coming up for far coin uh to get really excited about to be honest um i can't even keep up with them all like the teams uh the ecosystem is doing such an amazing job at bringing all of these kind of different parts of the uh far coin network to life and bringing them together um so we're also looking into how to support far coin on or ipfs really on mobile so if you're interested in building in any of these features get in touch with us as well or get in touch with the team and this is the kind of goals for the browsers and platform team or what they want to do next um so like i said lots happening in our ecosystem a lot we're trying to make it accessible to everyone we're trying to really expand the use cases and really make an open web which was our you know original value our mission as well and the last part the last part the future of far coin is also you we definitely could not build the future that is this decentralized open future that we all want uh this censorship resistant trustless kind of network without um help from all the developer developers out there without help with from your ideas um as lucas was saying before we just couldn't do it without any of our ecosystem partners or without your ideas or your participation or your feedback as well um so you and our ecosystem is really the strongest asset in growing the farquain network and growing our future and helping to shape that future as well and we're always open to your ideas like i've mentioned a lot of um the githubs are open actually pretty much all of them you can go to those githubs you can see those issues and you can uh chat on those issues if that's something that interests you if you're uh just here to learn i think lucas has probably mentioned and you are in a hackathon already so you probably already know about the hackathons uh and i think lucas also mentions that we've got kind of a pipeline from oh it's playing sorry uh so i think lucas also mentioned that we've got a pipeline from hackathons through to grants through to accelerators and then we also have that pipeline that goes into employment opportunities or to our launch pad program um so please get in touch or be involved if you want to um and yeah otherwise i think uh this is this is pretty much all from me i'm excited to see what ideas you come up with with some of these projects that i've mentioned uh on the that are coming up on the far coin network so really excited to see what you will build with falcoin and i'm sorry i think i'm a little bit short there jacob but i can take any questions or just talk on any kind of topic you like yeah i thought we had a deal here aren't we um i was supposed to use filler words i'm sorry i forgot about the killer words my bad that's awesome i mean it's great to see like all the uh i mean i mean there's so many different directions that like the file coin ecosystem is um expanding like you mentioned like saturn i think you guys are going to run out of planets pretty soon um and then you know we're even trying to take ipfs to a satellite with lockheed martin actually so that's another one that i kind of another case i didn't mention but we recently announced that we're going to be trying to run a node on a satellite together with lockheed martin and look this isn't just like a kind of stunt as well um because one of the things about ipfs is that because you can trust the content that you're getting you don't need to care where that data comes from so it can come from any satellite friendly or enemy uh and you can trust the data that you're getting you can verify the data that you're getting so it kind of creates this trustless cooperation um so and we are like going to send one up to a satellite somewhere in space so ipfs is going to space and then fun but it's going to space soon too which is kind of cool so thanks for reminding me about that use case yeah yeah i mean it's not it's not a stunt but like like it's still cool definitely i mean it's in the name isn't it we had to send it there eventually you had no choice yes exactly um well cool i mean we do have some more time i don't know if there's anything you wanted to maybe double click on as part of kind of some of these exciting things i know you mentioned like you know the fbm work that you're working on um in particular but um yeah i mean like when you think about kind of you know directionally this kind of expanding ecosystem that you've built like you said it's it's only i think you said like you know 15 months old like it's pretty recent um but you know to see all this kind of work that's coming out of it um you know to me like i think kind of saturn is probably you know very exciting just from like the point of view of like thinking about um you know just speed up saying computation like where do you turn first you turn to a cache or cdn right and just like data enables like so much more throughput which is really interesting um i don't know like if there's anything you want to double click on i mean we've got the time for it um and uh and and of course anybody who's watching if you do have any questions about any of the things that we just talked about shout out right now i'm happy yeah happy to talk about anything as well it doesn't matter it doesn't have to be on the topic of this talk if you have a question in general happy to answer it for you as well um yeah what i love about saturn as well is like firstly the team they are amazing uh but secondly um you know they're really doing something pretty unique here and it's really going to allow more people to be involved in the file coin network too which is like two of the main things that i really love as well as obviously getting that retrievals um going so the input output that you're used to with like web 2 applications going on the far coin ecosystem so i mean it's definitely going to kind of be a game changer when this comes out so it's like one of definitely one of the most exciting things happening in the ecosystem together with fpm but i'm working on that so i'm biased but uh yeah definitely uh interested to for when this comes out so and also people can be part of it right you can download this on your browser and like serve files to other people like you would with an ipfs node so that's you know going to be pretty pretty cool to see happen and like i said it's uh you can kind of download that already i believe uh from their github hopefully i'm not giving the wrong information out everyone goes and goes and downloads it and the team goes ally what have you done but i'm sure it'll be fine uh let them know if there are any problems too we're always looking for feedback like we said that's part of the process we're very open about you know trying to get our feedback from the community so if you do try it out and there's a problem let us know uh but yeah very exciting going to open up a heap of use cases um and yeah as i mentioned like definitely uh i can actually probably talk about a few more of the use cases that the fbm is going to unlock um yeah this slide is amazing so i mean anything you want to dive into on this slide i mean just like clearly you thought out like what what what can we do with them yeah yeah so well i mean we definitely haven't thought of everything like we can't wait to see what some people do with um the fvm so obviously it's also going to kind of open up the possibility for d5 but one of the things that i'm most excited about given that we're already a data storage network is unlocking the possibility for data dows and the data database so this kind of means like imagine you're kickstarting the data set economy by tokenizing data sets so you then get to like capture and represent the value of these like data sets to society and then you can exchange those data tokens between peers you can request computation services on that data like you know you could have validation or you could join that data analysis uh feature detection um so and then once you're getting into kind of feature detection and extraction you're like really kind of then moving into machine learning and i'd love to um i just heard a talk the other day about um kind of how we would decentralize machine learning because it feels like that's kind of right to do as well because you know you've got it takes so much computation machine learning and a lot of them are behind closed doors and that makes sense because they've got they have to collect and tag such big data sets but if this data is all becomes open and then we can create this kind of you know decentralized machine learning model that's just i'm just getting carried away now but the data data and the dataverse is you know tokenized data sets is definitely something that's going to be unlocked um by fbm and it's really something that we couldn't do without a storage network and then you know having like implementing programmability on top of it so because once you start like adding that computation onto the far clone blockchain you have like computation and storage under the same roof and this is like really going to be one of the big strengths and differentiators for the far coin network so i'm really excited about that um wonder you know nfts obviously is another big use case for us so we're already storing something like i don't know 69 million million billion i don't know nfts um on ipfs and filecoin at the moment so with fbm you'll not only be able to you know store them store that metadata on ipfs and filecoin but you'll be able to mint them on filecoin as well um and it's completely evm compatible like i said um so that's kind of going to be exciting to see uh the kickstarting of a creative economy perhaps on um where you can then tokenize them as well on the far coin virtual machine so that's going to be uh pretty pretty interesting as well and then obviously there's all those things if anyone's from like kind of a storage background and this is hack rfs so probably you have a good idea of this you know when you talk about traditional cloud networks you want to have user policies around your data you want to be able to decide where your data is stored how resiliently how long for like all these things should be in the hands of the engineer really basically um so that's what you know is is really going to get unlocked by the fbm as well so you're going to be able to kind of create these user policies um because it's going to be these smart contracts or actors as we call them um on the on the fm on the file coin network so you're going to be able to create user policies that decide how many copies of that data you want they'll be able to auto heal themselves as well so let's say one goes down which is really very rare in the farcoin ecosystem um but let's say it did that that deal would be able to auto heal itself and store somewhere else off one of the other nodes which is super cool um and you know obviously that perpetual renewal of deals is going to be like a kind of a a cool thing for the network as well you'll be able to just you know set and forget and it'll continually renew these deals uh for you at the cheapest price and with the parameters that you set for your storage provider so maybe uh there's been a government change and you have to change the parameters on your storage provider well on your user policy you'll be able to do that with the fbm as well uh it's also going to kind of unlock like l2 bridges then like we already do have some bridges over to ethereum to near to polygon to many of the other cool l1 projects but this is going to really enable that a lot more because it's already a layer one and already obviously evm compatible um so yeah a lot lots going on in fvm land and like i said we do have another early builders program coming up at the moment there is actually a few demos i wonder if i've got this on this slide there is a demo if you do want to play around with um kind of fvm actors and how they work one of our early builders called jim pick has created this kind of actor playground with like a bunch of examples on there so you can play around with kind of how they work um if you go to that active playground which i know this is a bit um hard to see but i can share these in the uh channel later as well um and there's also videos up on the youtube about that too if you are interested so yeah thank you i think uh yeah i think i've rather done enough about some of those use cases but yeah super excited about that and we're aiming for end of year so q4 uh for that to be released and you'll all be able to start building on things hopefully yeah and um i i mean there's just so much to explore so i mean i don't think you're rambling honestly we did get a question actually and you know it was going to steal my my thunder from my question anyway so it was a good question um and and yeah so dale asked a question about sort of um you know i was going to ask a question about what do you want to see built over the next couple weeks because that's my go-to default questions to hackathon obviously we care a lot about that gets built but dale had a little bit of a spin on that so today's question what are some good examples of non-standard or non-obvious use cases for decentralized storage wow i mean you're really you're really throwing throwing a spanner at me here but look when i when i think about what you can build with um ipfs and filecoin at the moment in its current form um and with the dev tools we have available which i'm sure most people have probably seen um the clearest use cases are for open data or for archival data like i kind of mentioned earlier um but you know one of the best things to do in this ecosystem is to find a pain point or find something that you're trying to build and you can't quite do uh and build a dev tool for that so i love seeing people submit projects that are almost like i found a pain point in your ecosystem and here's a dev tool to solve it i love those projects um or you know something we haven't considered so uh one of the hackathon entries i saw at i think it was the chain link hackathon actually uh but one of or it could be in east new york um i see a lot of these uh was like for an nft.storage helper for example and it it was aiming to so people don't necessarily know um what the image of the nft is going to be first because they're going to dynamically create that and they wanted to be able to then still store that and back it up to nft.story so they've created a helper to do that another one was kind of like i saw a password manager um created on ipfs uh link sharing with ipfs is is also really cool um but backing anything up to web3.storage so i saw a really cool ecommerce site get built out um there was also like a wrapper around youtube which is kind of relevant these days um that you know stored your channel uh to ipfs and you youtube um or it didn't i don't think it quite did that um but you know that would be a good way to go as well um so there's there's really like a heap of a heap of ways you could go and think about this especially if you're thinking about like ipfs as a peer-to-peer protocol um that really creates this verifiable content id and then you're talking about you know storing and persisting that data using filecoin and using any of the dev tools to do that like especially web3.storyjoynft.storage uh that makes it super easy uh for you to do that with so um yeah there's honestly so many ways you you could go with this like even creating a personal blog post that you'd share or like you know a kind of a medium or a stack overflow or there's there's definitely so many things you can do with it i've definitely seen a lot of really cool stuff with nfts as well um happen so i don't think that answered the question uh but uh there's some of my ideas off the top of my head i guess i mean this is great i mean i think you explored the space so yeah you know everybody's gonna be doing that over the next couple weeks as well so i guess this is kind of a primer for that okay awesome well ali i feel like i've taken up enough of your valuable time i really appreciate you being um here and walking through all the just the kind of massive growth of the coin ecosystem over the last little bit um it's really amazing to see and i think i i speak for everybody i really appreciate your energy and what you're bringing to this um and it was it was awesome to have you here well thank you jacob and thanks for the questions at the end as well really appreciate that um and happy hacking everyone if you do have any questions we're in the discord and available as well awesome thanks so much ali thank you you
