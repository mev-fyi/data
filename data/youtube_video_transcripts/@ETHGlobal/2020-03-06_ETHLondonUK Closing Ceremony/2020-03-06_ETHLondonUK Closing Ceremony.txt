let's do this okay thank you East London sing nobody yes I see I wasn't even gonna ask you to whoop and clap yet but thank you I was thinking you know we'll get a little while to to get going and get the energy up but now okay we are back this is the end of our weekend together but hopefully the beginning of many more thank you very much for for being here for hacking on some pretty awesome projects I've had the pleasure of seeing some of them I was judging earlier so it's been wonderful to see the work that everybody has been putting in but thank you so much for your tireless nights and yeah yeah no I was there 9:00 a.m. just 30 minutes before submissions were to you and you could see almost not a sound to be made everybody was focused or passed out and the energy right now the energy 30 minutes later it was just incredible and it just felt like Friday night again so it's exciting to see that you're all still up and excited and we let's let's get you this thing make this super quick and with that okay so going through these wonderful stats again we have had 300 attendees all of you want all 23 advanced intermediate beginners and newcomers Q and aetherium who have actually been doing some pretty fine hacking if I might add all of you have but it's great to see those beginners getting stuck in we have had oh man that you know the unicorn over nevermind tired tired so fifty project submissions that is insane of I can give video Silverado quads yeah 50 projects so I know Simona you you just a handful of these projects what were some of your takeaways from the submissions you saw so I've been this is definitely not my first hackathon rodeo so I've been you know have had the pleasure to judge for the past two years and the evolution of the projects that we're seeing the evolution of the the thought process that goes into those projects the care for the user experience has just gone up and up and up and up and up and the quality that I'm seeing from you know across so many different use cases and the the fact that the projects are actually incorporating so many of the the gaps that we already have in the ecosystem not starting to build something from scratch using things like three box things like you know all of the different plugins all of the different protocols it's super awesome to see because it means we can move quicker and we can deliver more and we can create more also I definitely want to mention again for me the seeing beginners get stuck in and actually go from let's say zero to submitting a project in in 48 hours is is pretty damn good and I think gap hero I must mention them here is a huge huge help for that where the guys adapt here oh there you go yeah I've seen so many beginner projects use them and actually Denison has been running around you know giving people solidity help that that is needed at 3:00 a.m. when you know we all need some solidity help at 3m it's it's been awesome to see so yeah continues to be a great pleasure having been through through this ecosystem for the past a few years it's it's always amazing to see just abstractions becoming more and more viable because you just lets us build it really quickly and the goal of the whole event and these events in general is to make that a lot easier so you're focused on the product not on the setup so 50 projects that's awesome all of you presented to all of our judges twice which was amazing the judges had a wonderful time they were definitely tired in doing that for five hours and after all of that deliberation we ended up with top six teams that the judges chose and what we're gonna do next is just invite them one by one and they'll demo what they built on stage to everybody and before we're going to kick into that I just want a big round of applause for all those six teams that made it to to this finals and these teams are good ghosting dodge gotcha Lee one hop that I ozq social recovery and lurch so please give them a big round of applause and also to all the other forty four teams that that are not on this thing you had an excellent sort of run here and it's an amazing to see all of you still made it and in your ear sitting in this audience so without further ado what I'd like to do is call good yo sting up on stage to present to everybody what they did for for their hack please welcome them on stage so good ghosting right so you know when you get go stood by girl from a dating app she never shows up right it sucks yeah yeah so that's that's the origin of the name so it's a savings game so using Ave in the background users commit to deposit nine nine CDI every week users who follow through for a year eventually get sue withdraw all their money and users who drop out lose all the interests they can still withdraw their principle but they lose all the interest so what happens is users who stick to it get a higher APR than they would if they just put the money in awe of it so starts off like this and then over time you see people start dropping out you know they start ghosting you your friends aren't as loyal as you thought but you're APR goes up so you're happy right so ghosting but made good so yeah this is what we built it's on kovin at the moment we can show you in a second but one thing I did want to talk about is that we have a very good referral program so if if you have any friends who you think might ghost you this is a very good way to find out if they're good friends so invite them you will get 10% of the interest that they should earn and if they invite other friends you also get 1% of that so it's very good to invite friends and you'll find out if they're good friends or if they'll goes to you over time we can also calculate some stats so you can check out how many players are in who are the most infectious players who spread the love more and you can also see the prize it grows every day and how long it's gonna take before the game ends so yeah we can show you our quick demo we call it quick it's not actually quick because it's web free stuff so it's gonna take a while and it's you need to press it once in a week or you will be hosted or you will become toast yeah this we think this is the best 2x1 button actually metamath makes like a 5 but that's different okay and it's going through we think in the background and overtime overtime you know Kovan it's taking its time and then you can send the next conformation then it was saying that it's sending the die guys let's clap for it come on come on give it get it since here come on hey success so we didn't ghost anyone this week but maybe next week we'll drop out who knows yep thank you thank you good ghosting next up we have dodge money from the future please welcome the Dodge team on stage [Applause] [Applause] all right that's working all right so we're dodge it means interesting lingo nyan that's beside the point basically it's a time warping machine that allows you to get future money right now so what I mean by that is that if you want to your die for example to interest your baby this is a lot of Star Trek memes in it if you want your die to an interest you have to put it on a V or compound and you have to wait for that interest to accrue and you actually don't know how much you're gonna get because the interest rate is variable so dodge solves both of those problems you know exactly how much you're gonna get but not only that you're also going to get it upfront so you're basically getting your cake and eating it too so that use cases for this hopefully are obvious it's a good way to avoid the opportunity risk with a lot of popular activities and web three if you're staking or escrow deferred payments say for example Alice wants to set up a get coin bounty for Bob she has to lock up her die but obviously if she's locking up her die she can't an interest on that day so she uses dad to get the interest upfront right so you're going to show how it works it's basically based on the new asset class which is called future tokens so future die F die the letter wasn't taken so we took it nobody else can have it now sorry quite typical I can approve the presence so you can just select how much ever you want to deposit what you can see what are the current rights and so right now we are waiting for the interest rate to be transferred from the future what what actually is happening behind the curtains we take your deposit we look for the best available option on the liquidity poles we diversify the risk and we recalculate the interest rate at send it back to the user so what you receive is a future token in this case future f that is locked until a maturity date Express here actually it's kind of a multi token you see 11:55 and what can you do with that token you can transfer it in space and in time so what do you mean by transferring in time you can decide to let's say okay take part of your deposit and push it further to the future and earn more interest or push it closer to the present so we play the interest that you already taken up front let us try that and maybe let's show also how to transfer that in space because they fully fungible talking within the categories that we define so we can send it to your friend you can put it on stake on the different protocols you can mix if order I defy app and you can even swap future F for future die if you are brave enough so here for example Alice can put F die or F in get coin and when Bob delivers the bounty he'll get his left eye and then can convert that for actual die at the maturity period so if it's June die we also have we're working on this as an actual product so we've been developing also a nice user friendly front-end that explains it that you can get your future money up front with like nicer sliders that hopefully you know gonna win the UX peeper prize we don't know [Applause] Thank You dodge team next up we have coach Lee please welcome them on stage and I'm pretty sure I butchered that name so let them correct me this weekend on Friday the problem statement that was originally postulated was just really kind of like privacy in general and then Tom came up with a really cool idea he said that's a P er there's a nice way to stream money to people let's just say I want to earn a salary and I want to earn my salary overtime everybody would be able to see what my salary is and that's not really great it wouldn't be great to see what my colleagues salary is when we could see what my boss's salary is so the solution to this would possibly be to do it in a private manner and so we have integrated the Aztek protocol to create streaming private money so you could conceivably stream a salary over a period of time so we tried it and it's pretty close to working so here you can see that I have a balance of six hundred died I've actually locked up 125 in 2zk die which is on the Aztek protocol and we can create a stream and so to create this stream we kind of really we say how much we want to stream so let's stream 100 die let's decide who will stream it to so let's just say this is my employee I'm going to stream him over the next seven days a stream of a hundred z:k died and so then we'll create this stream and we use the Aztek api to do it and I can maybe allow Tom to explain the proof that's about to get created its destination all the fun stuff that goes on back at this point we have created a Aztek note and sent it to the smart contracts transaction goes through that is we then are going to send another transaction which defines the all the parameters of the stream so that's going to tell you who it's going to and how long this stream is going to go on for once that's done the recipient can kind of obviously find a event on on chain which tells them that they have this stream pointed at them they can then choose to withdraw any fraction of that time frame they just have me to give a timestamp to smart contracts and it will do a dividend proof which proves that the amount of money they want to withdraw from the note on the smart contracts is equal to the time period claiming we then kind of check that they're not claiming money into the future and with those two aspects along with like the standard joints proofs proving that they aren't creating money out of nowhere that throws another note over to the recipient and then the like the change note gets placed onto the contracts the payment future thank you next up we have one hop the CDP manager so please well Tim welcome Sergei from one hop on stage [Applause] all right hi everyone it's a pleasure to stay on the main stage thank you very much with your information theorem global so what I built on this weekend this is CDP manager city manager can be used to migrate CDP position collateral tap position of the user and can improve the usability in defy so I and you can see on the screen there one hot dot IO it's actually deployed also on the Maenads here I have a compound position I learned 195 thigh and I borrowed a little bit BB TC and I would like to to move this position to our because it's more profitable for me to to land and borrow there because create interest rate on RM so and you can do it just with a few clicks which I will not execute the transaction because it's no Manhattan can take little time and after the migration to an NF t token you can actually easily migrate between different provider like compound like maker down like as well so I will show you a small architectural diagram how it works and why I need here and an NF gtalk nurse's 721 so it's also a big problem like if you have onion wallets you are really limited on compound you can have only a few positions there and if an eery 721 and if she talking you can have as many position you want yeah I try to build small like mini or micro service because I love and also my team from one inch loves the compressibility of defy just black every available service in into your own service and expose clear usable api's to everyone so that everyone can profit get profits from from you service and you get profits also from from other service so in this in this diagram you can see as a user with normal Assyrian wallet you can create an empty token which would hold the position in a smart contract another hood and I like flash lots so and yes maybe you heard we hacked for Chrome with flatulence white hacked in January before it's started to be popular but this is another story I likely used to flash Lance from our of course this little fee but they do a great job of that it's really usable so what I did I migrated the position from the wallet into the NFT token proxy so smart contract by asking for a fleshly non-album I repaid the user that to be able to migrate the position and I grabbed the user collateral tokens from the user and I created a new borrowing position on compound and we paid back the flash loan to our so first of all in the migration part and to create to just migrate to you position from your wallet to be flexible to emigrate to other services from from an NFC talk and the migration works similar to the import logic it's the same you have already deposition in your and if G talking and again flash loans and actually the same I can show you how such flash lon looks like this is it's a tool from my colleague Anton bukhov you can see the whole stack trace from parity trace more in little and usable also to the back and you can see it looks like if some I had here more than 137 hops in in different smart contracts sure to just import a position so I also used here at Taurus yeah also great solution to login with with Google as Amara off provider and what I heard they plan also to release solution for free guest transactions like that we are going also to integrate them I guess so like some cool things yeah thank you very much that's all defy arbitrage at the service that's great next up we have Zeke a social recovery please welcome the Zeke a social recovery team on stage [Applause] so everything how many blockchain engineers to the take to screen a snake cool yeah so high so yeah with a Zeke a social recovery team we're kind of going through a rebrand exercise at the moment so some people also knows as secret guardians anyway so I'm Tom I work as tech by day there somewhere so over in the corner I think and then from NASA and kick back exactly so we came with a problem statement so smart contracts these days smart contracts these days so you can think of things like monolith argent increasingly have this feature where you can nominate guardians and these guardians basically if you lose your private key or you lose your access to your smart contract wallet these Guardians can restore you access to your wallet so they're in quite privileged position but talking things through we quite quickly realize that these Guardian addresses are stored in public on chain and so anybody on chain can see who your garden address is we think that's both the privacy concern and a security concern so we set out to try and fix this supposed to do this we basically rely on zone knowledge technology so we built a yeah nice bill to prove a concept smart contract wallets and then I've integrated some zero annoyed stuff into it and Makoto has put together helped draft this front-end along with we're using a tool called sold out UI by RAM which is really really useful so yeah check out anyway so how does this work so normally in a smart contract wallet your guardian address is stored on chain in public now instead of doing that we take that a hash of this and we stop when you add a guardian to your wallet you store the hash of the address of the Guardian on chain which means nobody else can work out what this maps to and then fundamentally when a user is trying to get access back to their wallet a guardian has to generate a zero knowledge proof that they know the preimage to this hash now the only way that they're going to be able to have this proof satisfied is if they do in fact know the preimage to this hash which means that they are a valid guardian so if we take you through what this looks like step-by-step so the first thing we're going to do is we use Socrates to build some of the decade-- snark stuff that we need specifically we using a star called Roth 16 so first of all when you're using these sort of things you have to do various steps and you're gonna see something like matrix S stuff going on so these are very steps going on here when you're using Zacchaeus now have to do a trusted setup where you're basically creating some toxic waste and some of the crypto points that are used in this we're creating a proof here we're computing some secret information and also generating various keys you'll see at some point a proof is going to get output from this it looks like I think it's three elliptic curve points and you can see here at the bottom so we get a proof out so that's going to be our Guardians proof eventually that they know the preimage to the hash they stored on chain so that's the local proof side of things now this would happen on the client locally ideally in the browser if you can get this working in the browser so the next thing we built was a Zeke a social recovery is in the app so this is connected to ring P and it allows you to deploy one of these ZK wallets as we call them so click execute metal mask pops up more standard stuff so this is going to first of all deploy the wallet it's then going to deploy the associated verification contract so when a guardian calls recover on the sec a wallet the method is going to static call out to a proof verification contract and it sends the proof to this this verifies that there's a case proof is correct and if so the normal mechanics can continue so we're on rink B so this might take 30 seconds something like that but basically once you've deployed this wallet you can then interact with it you can get state you can I think that's muskies requesting my signature so it's also deploying the proof validator so it wants to signatures and then you can do various things you can send just as a normal wallet and then we have to set our proof validator we have to link these two contracts together this will ideally be abstracted away in a future version you can add a guardian by adding this hashed address that we talked about it hostage split into two segments some technical details and then eventually once you're working through this flow you can then call a ZK recover where you pass in some of those proof variables that you saw on the on the item terminal okay so that's like a recovery it's on github I feel free to check it out and yeah thank you for everything it's been another great it was awesome just being able to see privacy related things actually become integrated into products is a wave I'm super excited about next up is our last presentation on stage and with that please welcome Richard morph to talk about lurch like pester me afterwards or at the after-party once this thing comes up so what is lurch so lurch is this awesome new product I built it allows you to execute aetherium contracts on aetherium it's amazing so everyone's favorite feature of JavaScript come on say it together with me we all know that it's crap eval everyone loves eval it's such a useful feature it's flexible it's easy to use and it throws all security great of the window all things that we desire so we can go a little bit better these days in JavaScript and instead use the VM module this uh throws things out the window a little bit in terms of security but it also gives us hook ability which I'll cover more in later so what is lurch it's 100 sent in pure EVM assembly that's under two kilobytes I'm not sure people are used to writing an assembly it just makes you want to tear your hair sometimes and I'm doing good though the so yes basically says eval for theory I'm its performant ish the cost analysis is later on as well but basically it's an EVM emulator written in EVM so it doesn't matter whether your contract was written in solidity or lll or viper or whatever you use it'll just work you give us some bytecode and some call data and it just runs so there was two other options I was going to add but time ran out and on you got together yeah this will still be complete at some point in the near future but basically you have a couple it you could this you have a smart contract this is the solidity signature it's not written in solidity it just knows how to pull solidity signature part so you give it the bytecode you give the call data and whatever your call in that contract for that data returns is what it will return I will give a quick demo now yeah everyone else has had a beautiful UI this is the antithesis of the beautiful UI so we will as you can see I've been running it before for the various things it's going to price say the exact same numbers so what it's doing right now is it's deploying an ER C 721 sorry er C 20 contracts to a def net at the same time it's deploying lurch its then taking that same er C 20 contract and running it entirely through lurch as well just so you can see that both the real er C 20 and the years 220 that's running inside lurch are both doing the same things the important thing is you can see it start off with 958 yes the mafroom suit and that's my beautiful UI yes the one other kind of interesting thing to note is so this right here I ran earlier your main net if you want to use it it's not lurch eath you can see there's no other transactions that have ever been sent to this contract it was able to execute code any existing way to kind of do this require like paying and doing transactions that sort of thing this just lets you do it for free let me go back to my slides again I'm gonna power through some of them because it's a how does it work it's a little bit like a virus this is more complicated than I really have time to get into right now but please feel free to come after and like be like you know what virus home but and I'll explain to you so random news cases so counterfactual verification currently as it stands today if you're trying to counter if actually verify something and somebody's lying you might have to deploy a whole whack load of contracts and then execute them to prove you're being lied to instead of all that you can just simulate running the contracts yes you can also do large contracts I didn't get a chance to go to Shamu together but for example you could easily build a two gigabyte contract with this because you only ever need to put the piece of code around that actually gets executed upgradeable for storage the next person we're testing I'm gonna skip by this because it's just kind of like a reworking of this yes so for example this allows you to run arbitrary code anything you want to do you can just take code from your users and do what is what the code does but you can put hooks in it so for example maybe you don't want a person to be able to suicide your contract if they try you're just gonna roll back the whole transaction and consider their data invalid you can hijack pre compiles if you're doing some cool new thing or you want to replace a pre-compile or you just want to like intercept addresses maybe you only want to accept addresses that own a Koopa Kitty forwarding storage is interesting as well but I'm trying to keep this short so please feel free to come up and bug me with that as well anything limitations I don't currently have the jump desk checking for anyone who's done EVM stuff push opps have a really weird restriction for the EVM for security reasons and yadda yadda yadda it's not done but it's easy to do I just haven't done it I also eat up for slots on the stack like these things are really important for this discussion there's no gas metering it does cost more so onto cost analysis so to do a simple symbol of an ER c or c 20 contract it costs about 60 times as much to run it through lurch right now these will come down but you see like once you start having I'm done with point my screen doesn't help you forget balance for example you see comes way down that's because you're doing a read operation and read operations are expensive the more expensive the operations are the better your deal is which is why if you're doing a transfer you see you're only paying 1.6 times as much to run in this yes I think that's all so huzzah thank you thank you I think they all deserve a huge round of applause and obviously like Rick said chat to them later over drinks and so on any questions and collaborations and so on so those are our six winning teams but of course we also have all of the teams that have worked on these sponsor bounties so what I'm gonna do is get the sponsors up here at Dell announce the winners of their bounties and we're gonna start with Ave so Jordan come on up here where is he there he is oh my god look at the jacket yes very good Oh multitasking and fashion there you go microphone for you I will announce the winner of the other bounties so I will start from the third one it's called flash - so I ran off applause or flash - flash - flash - she's a dodge ball to basically get to know what's happening within the flash alone we have seen in the past weeks a lot of flash alone a lot of people trying to understand what's happening within those transaction flashes up to to do that the second one actually you Saudi yes nice no one told me that on the bounty so flash - one one thousand eight I so actually it's a bit more because we deposit did I in the protocol at the beginning of the weekend so it's still growing at the moment the second bounty for 1500 a die is a good ghosting so we you saw the presentation round of applause for podcasting very nice very nice project and the winner of the avi bounties is - the tram travelling tokens wonderful both of them as well [Applause] thank you thank you um next up we have hold on I'm doing the whole thing with we have our know from aspect there is thank you very much yeah it was it was really good to see the whole number of teams that integrated with with a stack and the team that we've chosen is quietly for the sab Li a and A Sketch integration and yeah they get the bouncy thank you very much awesome next up we have pipo Kevin come on up or Paul various thank you so first off thanks to everyone who's submitted for an award we had 18 submissions which was awesome and we judged off of five criteria which was a use case and user motivations empowerment innovation and responsibility so the three winners are and it was 4,000 died up for grabs so 2000 1000 1000 are looped together Lakshmi and loan shark so a round of applause please and for all of the everyone who's submitted we've got a free honey at our desks if you want to pop over afterwards please do thanks awesome next up we have diversifying star query dan where are you there he is [Applause] thank you so I have the pleasure of presenting the device for in stock where the boundary for the hackathon we had the pleasure of unveiling the first version of the API for our new star corporate exchange and we had some interesting project built on it the first prize goes to the bill and osama for building a diversified telegram ball which allows you to trade on the exchange from telegram like you have a broker which is about now we didn't see our api being used in kind of a significant way in any of the other projects but we're going to keep our prize open for the next week so we're gonna keep our development in vibrant up so if any of you guys want to develop anything second and third price is still up for grabs especially as our wallet connect and ledger integrations are going live over the next few days if you want feel free and contact us on telegram or all the resources available diverse welcome / jacqueline thank you thank you next up taurus then where are you he's running he is raving there he is hey guys thanks so much to everybody who integrated taurus we really like seeing the excitement over the weekend it was a pleasure hacking with some of you guys we have four prizes to give out the best that goes to Loxley they integrated Taurus with a smart contract wallet with by economy meta transactions which basically used CDI interest rates to pay for the transactions themselves very interesting very cool the next one is on patreon die they use the key resolver to build a social application to fund people in a patron like manner so that's the best social application the next one is pulled on us which integrated tourists using discord to prevent civil attacks for voting applications so that was very interesting as well and finally one hop dial which unfortunately couldn't get the smart contract wallet gasless transactions out but I guess they still integrated as well thank you very much thank you Taurus next up ENS Makoto let's do this okay so ENS in the past we used to give prize to anyone who integrated to ENS which was kind of too easy so we kind of raised a bar bit to more like you know creating tools to enhance capability of ENS or like hacking extending or issue more domains so we have three prizes first prize for the $600 worth of I think is I can possibly is radical domains and the second prize of $300 is ping ENS and the third $100 was a is e wallet and I only comment on the winning price of the what was a radical domains is that has have you guys know like a radical markets book and that there is a system called I don't know how to print us harburg tax something Harv enjoy tax yeah there are some radical ways which was originally actually like radical ways to basically have ownership on the property and actually Vitalik Prius kind of suggested to ens team that our short name should do that and we actually rejected his idea but the team kind of came up with opting ways to you know make it only radical as people whose radical enough so I would say this is like a better than Vitalik price so thank you magical domains thanks thank you and next up we have DAP hero with Denison and Drake taking to the stage hey Drake has arrived if you saw the fliers this is this is Drake he's here so this weekend we saw some really amazing submissions we were really excited by seeing what people were building we're thrilled so keep it up we're here really late at night where I was dick wasn't here yet but we had two prizes to give out a 500 I eat both both the the winners they're really awesome so the first one was co2 can or two can because they have a toucan as their logo really beautiful but the idea was really fantastic they had figured out the carbon costs of solidity transactions and their contract and made a library so that your smart contract can offset its own carbon emission costs directly in the code so not only did they used a pure to make a beautiful interface really blew our minds that was really amazing yeah and the second bounty goes too nebulous this team created a decentralized marketplace for purchasing or renting rather the high-end hardware used for PC gaming think uber for PC gaming so all from within the browser you can select gaming hardware and play the game directly they created a beautiful user interface and they powered the connection with DAP here I know you guys wanna stay on stage but you can and now the last one is the theorem Foundation and welcome Perl [Applause] so we had lots of different people working on the theorem to Pluto during the hackathon and I know it's like a very difficult challenge it's difficult to get to learn if m2 but we made it really easy it's right like have these people learn about the film - they met lots of progress and so we had to split the prize pool in a different way so instead of assigning like first place second place no that's the spirit in four segments so it's a thousand dollars each for each of the submissions they act on protecting faraday to clients from the network protecting from slashings and analyzing the lipid p stack and the other remainder of the prize money goes to the ongoing challenges there are all these people who learned a lot about if - who try different things have all these ideas they started hacking but they will continue the challenge online and I will be able to kick off this new bounty program and continue hacking say thank you thank you sponsors and of course we're hoping that everybody had a wonderful time and you already started clapping and you know what's coming it's gonna be the four slides of sponsors that we must really thank for you thought that was that was finished it is not so we must thank them because they make all of this possible they help us be here together having a wonderful time in a wonderful venue being able to you two enjoy each other's company and food and comfortable places to hack in so let's go Ave pepo start where diversify orchids consensus liquidity network astok ENS Fiddler's 1kx Taurus meta press very deaf hero pillar AWS since you're a kickback necropolis in your ste Phi prime CL blockchain Assyrian London meetup group holy smokes ok so and of course what is global does really really well and they tend to work with yearly partners to basically enable everything that we're doing the community the action that happens all over the world so aspect Len droid people of a Syrian foundation are the 2020 partners and also what I would love to say is give yourselves a big hand this has been amazing the energy the quality of the projects the wonderful faces for all of our peoples and with tweets and everything we also really really appreciate and and I'm you know here with supporting the the guys at East global and I think we all want to hear your feedback what you loved what you didn't maybe share it in East London slash community we would love to hear back from you and also find out whether we should do this again next year in London what do we think I think that's good I think that's good so what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to let Karthik share a few thanks a few stats and close this off and then we can head to the party yeah sound good great Karthik thanks Simona so when I come on stage it's usually the sign that we'll be done in the next five minutes so you can clap about that as the second part so what I want to do is actually just just be serious for a minute I want to thank a lot of people that actually made this event possible there's a lot that goes into making this happen you all get to experience that the two and a half days when when you come up here but the behind the scenes work is is kind of what we want to highlight for the next few minutes so I have a bunch of that and an N full of other notes so with that let's let's start with actually our mentors they are these are the people that actually were on available for this entire weekend in person online or in discord and these are the people that made anything from unblocking people from their projects to help them or get just understand the basics of anything from solidity the workshops are conducted to just being there to support people especially the beginners in and the intermediate developers out there so without you our mentors this would not be possible so thank you so much please give them a big round of applause this is the list of every person that volunteered this weekend people took all these shifts past few weeks when we were working on these events they can helped us out from being anywhere from local to helping out with all these things that we needed to do for making this venue work in this event possible so these are 40 or so names that made all this works thank you so much all of our volunteers for making this the best weekend for all of us and we cannot thank you enough thanks again and lastly we rely a lot on our local organizers over a particularly Bank men Abel George Franco Patrick and Simona for being super helpful for for the youth global team because when we come into a new city that we're not at locals for they help us anywhere from make not stupid decisions to to guide us into making this a really good experience for for all of you so thank you so much all of you and of course the judges who saw hundred demos this morning Oh without without all of your your heart work that that I'm really glad that I don't have to do because I deliberation and just just figuring out how to actually put forward six teams this would this would not be an event without all of you so thank you so much to all twelve of the judges that gave us all of their Sunday and of course everybody from the staff for this venue that made it possible to the videographers too to the the photographer's the the catering service the a/v crew thank you thank you thank you so much for making this work and giving us a really smooth event for this last for this entire weekend and lastly the global team this has been one of our smoothest events in terms of logistics and there's seven people on the global team that make all of this work it's when a particularly highlight Andrew Heather Emily and Jacob that that were there for this entire time this is one of those events where you may not realize this but we pulled all of this in in five weeks so a lot was up in the air when we were figuring this out and and I'm so excited to say that this is one of the best events we've done so thank you so much and thank you eat global so back to the actual finalists we saw six teams come up here on stage and they kind of talked about what they built and we saw some of the sponsor prizes so the question is what are the actual finalist win the if you've been to any global hackathon before the thing about these events is that these are not competitions we we don't have a first second third what we really want to do is actually make this easy for other people to come here and experiment and keep on building and trying new things so we can actually move this baseboard or actually help improve the developer platform in general and as part of that the the goal for the finalists is to actually just bubble up and highlight there they're really interesting and cool projects that we saw and what we do is actually instead of calling for a second third we actually consider all of them are our first-place winners and what we're gonna do is the finalists actually win $500 in a Thor or die every member on the team gets that so that is actually the the prize that every team is getting so please give all six of those teams a big round of applause and some announcements this is we are in London it's the damn London meetup group is one of the biggest meetup groups in and just on on the planet so if you are local which we know
