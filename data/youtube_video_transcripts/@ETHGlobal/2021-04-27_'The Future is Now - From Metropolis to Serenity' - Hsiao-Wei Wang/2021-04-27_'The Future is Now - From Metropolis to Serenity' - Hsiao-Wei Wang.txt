i want to welcome our very first talk of the day uh the talk is title feature is now from metropolis to serenity and this is going to be uh talk giving by xiaowei uh she's already here i'll have her turn her video on and really kick us off with her very first talk and uh thank you so much for uh for kicking us off today [Music] thanks patek um let me share my [Music] uh screen you see the screen great perfect okay cool um thank you everyone um so my topic is about the future um is now and from the metropolis to serenity my shower on a researcher at eastern foundation you can found me by these handles and here we are so first uh these pictures are taken after the east london last year some of our team visited the british museum thanks to its global yay and the right picture was taken by uh aka the proto-lambda and so it was uh same ethereum nerd it was me taking a picture of the byzantine uh gold coins so these brazilian coins were maintained in constantinople over a thousand years and just a couple years ago ethereum uh used byzantine and constantinople as the release codenames so when i visited the museum at that time i was wondering if our code of every each line of a code on the external history today will be read and be used by people after a thousand years so yeah that's the magic of the history and i think we can actually learn a lot from the past and to build the better future so here we are these are the are easily released releases um say it's the faces and so everything was landed in 2015 in july the pow the proper work chain landed so we started from the frontier with with a very small community uh supporters and then the next release was the home state which uh which provides some stabilized upgrades that just as a announcement how to tell people that our server is oh it's ready to vote future upgrades and then uh since 2017 to now we are in the age of the metropolis so uh us ceremony the ecosystem growing uh bigger and bigger we have uh government we have established the government's assistance like the eip process and by by review by design review and implemented this eips we have a lot of the uh eva enhancements and black reward adjustments in the past few years and metropolis is still is still continuous growing and at the same time the next stage the serenity state is already um is already happening right now the serenity is contains the proper stake and scaling solutions so what is serenity so uh i'd say the uh it's we sometimes called it like serenity is too you know it's certain 2.0 listeners are but generally the certainty is uh and the timeline was like the things happened before the prim the um the the mouth paper um in i think it was 2016 by vitalik and by that time there were just a couple a couple researchers uh in the earliest years and maybe the founders of ethereum have started to do the proof of stake study and research and then we have the hybrid consensus stage i will talk i'll explain that later and then now and we are at the beacon chain research and the merge uh research and development um this phases uh the is these stages might be in parallel in some way because this topic has its can can be done by a small group of people and then growing growing to be implemented in the mandate so the more paper um yeah i think like maybe the most a certain [Music] client developers has read this paper so back to 2019 uh the basic shape of each error 2.0 has already been established and in this paper that we have like six main goals first of course we want to remove the proper work to have a more efficient proper state consensus and things like fast block type and economic finality these properties could be come with uh cubicon can go with the proper stake automatically and then we will want to scale the ethereum the in the newspaper the main the main main design is the shading uh shotchan designs um so the structure is like you have multiple side chains but the sidechain is it's not the size turn listen to dimension uh dimension also has to listen to the strategy from time to time so by this communication fund mentioned to the side chain and then we can implement the chrome chart and communication via the uh core mentioned and then the last one is the censorship resistance um it's like if um like um if we want to uh if we want to remove the proper work then um there will be we will need to found the leader of the action of the certain block every time but so the risk is that if a rich attacker have enough staking power then could it uh consent could it censorship the blockchain easily so we want to reduce that possibility as we can so uh back to the early stage what lessons we learned from the casper profile stake uh this is the casper ffg paper um so in a very long time ago that uh there are already some main properties that uh still they are assigned us today in the beacon chain we used for example we have the validators to make deposits on the on the under the current chain so that um the the if the validator is doing something that badly then lend the blender uh sorry let me see oh so if the ladies do something that then they will uh they will take the economic stash so if they did something good then they will get incentive rewards from that from the protocol also uh the profile stake pro protocol provides the settlement phenology or we said the economic technology and also uh we proved that the past forever you can guaranteed some um the comfortable safety and the participle lightness now if you are interested in learning caster you can go read this paper and and back to today still very useful let's see and also the lesson we learned uh about shading and so charting is also not novel uh even in a few years ago but there are some bottlenecks that make it difficult to be useful today and so for example the computational ability and networking capacity if you have one function and how could you scale to like six sixty four or thousands of chance um and then also it has the same issue as the casper um as the proof of stake system because you have to select some of the validators to to uh to prove that the oh again i say i say to validate the certain block is correct and then this lessons we learned and then to make it step by step the first first practical implementation is the was the hybrid consensus ffg so there is um this is the like a basic outline of the lattice that version of design you can see that there are two different contracts one is the casper country and another is the trading manager contract so we in this design there was two different contracts and each contract um we accept except the later will make deposit on each contract and then if each contract controls the consensus in the country layer and then the evaluator want to make fault to prove that they have a test some certain info center history then they have to make a evn transaction to the contract so yeah that was the decide back to them and uh except that like for example cassandra casper ffg will uh change the focus rule and the charlie magic country will of course change the sky architecture um largely so what we learned from that stage is that we learned how to do some blockchain uh how to provide the blockchain randomness so uh as i said the censorship resistance is important so it's important to make the attacker should be very difficult to manipulate the randomness result so the most popular and practical approach including the randall and bdfs which is the future it's through my use and the second one is the by shutting by starting charting then we know that the data availability is really important and also uh to decide the future short trends like state business the stateless client and the account abstraction time uh the account attraction contracts uh lists different uh new chain futures uh is are likely to be used in the later uh indian or chinese design that's what the s1.x is working on and then the casper effect research so the the ffg research back back to them already phoned the uh the slashing condition rules and the procedure to handle the activity leak penalty so these things are still being used today but finally um the hybrid transfer is doable but the shouted heavy casper is really hard so back to them we realized that we should have started with a new full profile section so let's open the big concern age so here we are this is the the overview of the picture of the retention design we will edit the we control which is uh for section to provide finality randomness and as the core uh the so we only have like four production available is to fly when on the day one we launched uh the big engine last year so yeah shout out to the thai devs and then uh back to and now to today uh we have already already have like over 3.9 million users are in staging and over like 120 thousand validators surrounding their beacon nodes and they did a client um so learning from the big concern r d in um we are still learning uh so the first is oh so the data client and we can trans operation is good because it provides it's more flexible and more scalable um also if you separate the data client which handle the validating with the keys and the can know handle the network p2p network then we can have make the key management more secure and also uh the the staking user experience it was really important um it includes like how a newbie staker uh learn to manage that piece and to make uh deposit and to upgrade the softwares so um i'd like to thanks to the stake community they really helped a lot and the last thing is um i think that the devs generally likes the in incrementalism patches in development um so example like uh we will have the the first uh beacon train hub for called the odd air this year and which will increase some uh features of the light clients and in the future uh indeed they are already in process but in parallel so uh each patch is in the different codebase we can merge it uh not i mean then it's not necessary to be one should be before another or another should be after another then the merge oh finally it's the merge summit so yeah we will the merge is about of merging the current islamic net and these two magnet to be one eastern so it's the previous picture but uh the differences is that we add the um the beacon the the proof of work block into the beacon block but we don't have to we don't have to include the whole block um because the mining will be disabled violent so it's only the extrusion payload will be included in the beacon block so after the the proof of uh after the merge the b constraint will become the an executable beacon chain and to learn more the talk after list i will show you the full picture of the merge by a lectureman after me and if you want to learn more about the post merge ethereum of talik will talk about how it counts after the merge today um but what about you want to participate in now then um if you want to communicate and found uh some interesting issues um to hack uh you are welcome to go to the history it's indeed this code server um thanks to proto for making this fabulous website url and all the each one is one point x is to [Music] deliver discussions along that so it's now the new development hub now for eastern community and also we have the east research forum so we can go to the east research that ch and found the is one two is to transition category that's the merge related topics but if you want to learn other other topics your other scaling topics there are also many layer 2 scaling solutions like grow ups on that and also you can start with the good first issue today um to find a project that you're interested in and then read the contribute guide on that and pick one tackle issue maybe try to use the first issue level and also uh just want to let know that um don't be scared to ask unless unless china's you you see uh like github or discord or maybe guitar so i think the open source software community are usually really glad to to see the contributors that coming so well the um want to say is that um the israeli history is not very long yet so um but and then it's good because we can took the lessons from the past and the previous work are built um the previous work by the early researchers the owners they helped build our present and from the metropolis to serenity we are building the future right now so thank you for your time thank you so long oh thank you so much this was a really good overview of how we got from all of our initial attempts to uh look at any from charting to casper to ffg to the gadgets and and uh now we're at the merch so i i think you did a really awesome talk uh a job at uh just setting the context into what's been tried before and that really sets us up for the rest of the day uh because we're gonna have a lot more details on how everything that you talked about has affected the state of the merge and just what happened with e2 so with that i want to thank you uh for for giving this very first time for today and also for staying up super late to uh to do this from your time zone thank you thank you so much and yeah um so it's an overview so hopefully you will enjoy the later quotes later presentations thank you no i think just to kind of make sure that uh just one single comment uh we have a question from gabriel who's asking what was the link to the discord server i believe it's just 82.wtf and discord.e2.wtf is that correct oh let me go to that page again oh um [Music] i wish well uh we'll type that up on the chat as well and uh we'll coordinate that so yeah yeah definitely we'll just write that answer in the chat so uh thank you so much and now with that we are ready to move on to our next talk
