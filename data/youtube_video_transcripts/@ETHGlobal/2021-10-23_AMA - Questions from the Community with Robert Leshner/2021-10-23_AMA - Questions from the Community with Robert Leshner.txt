[Music] [Applause] [Music] and i'm super excited to welcome robert leshner um co-founder and founder and ceo of compound um we we're going to do an ama segment here and we sourced a lot of questions from the broader youth global and compound ecosystem so i'll just go rapid fire into this and hopefully we have enough to talk about for for 30 to 40 minutes uh if not we'll talk about whatever wants to talk about so um let's start with something easy robert i've known you for a few years we've seen so much happen in d5 uh my first question is three years ago when you originally thought compound would be and what it is now is that exactly what you thought in a good way what is like the expectation versus reality could you do sort of a comparison and contrast how that world was then and now yeah so first off i'm excited to be here speaking with you all today um three years ago when we launched compound it was you know august 2018 i think is when the first version of compound was launched it was after a year of building um in solitude you know in the upstairs attic above an advertising agency and we didn't know what to expect um there was very few things that looked or worked like d5 applications at this time um the phrase defy would sort of like be invented like around the same time the compound launched you know not by compound but by other folks in the community it was a very early time and what we were telling ourselves at the time was that it would take potentially five to ten years before there would be any meaningful traction in d5 um you know at the time there were some very early experiments in dexes um you know from you know token trader to etherdelta to xerox you know later to uniswap um but at the time there was like these very primitive examples of people trying to use smart contracts to create you know financial tools that sort of just ran on their own right and so our our genuine expectation was it was gonna be five to ten years one because you know it would take five to ten years for assets from the real world to start to come into crypto besides just like crypto natively issued tokens we thought that you know the user experience was you know extremely clunky and version one of compound was so hilariously clunky and we just thought it would take forever um and i think things evolved a lot faster than we expected um the white paper for compound at the time was like you know here's this system and eventually you know and then eventually to us actually we thought it was five ten years eventually it will be run by a dow because even then you know the term for anything like you know smart contract managed was down right and we said eventually this would be run by a doubt you know we thought it was gonna be yours the pace at which things unfolded was actually much faster than i or anybody in the community or anybody outside of crypto or really anyone inside of crypto and that includes like the most passionate believers it all occurred faster than anyone would have anticipated um you know in by the end of 2018 compound had like 20 million dollars of assets in it you know it was like number two behind maker down which i think there was like 50 million dollars of assets maker now at the time i mean you know 2019 i think was actually a really big year for d5 because really of the growth and you know adoption of stable coins you know stable points really weren't that popular in 2018 there were some very early examples of them but 2019 saw you know tether on ethereum it saw um usd coin and saw the growth of dye i mean it was still called psy at the time you know um and you know all of these stable points and this was like the sort of missing ingredient that turbocharged defy in my mind um suddenly you know applications like compounds start to make a lot of sense to people you know no one really wanted to borrow ether they really wanted to borrow staple cards you know people didn't necessarily want to trade an arbitrary token they wanted to trade you know a stable coin for crypto or trade a crypto for stablements and just enable the whole ecosystem to grow rapidly and so everything started moving at a speed faster than we anticipated um and that actually encouraged us to take what we thought was gonna be a five-year journey and condense its time frame and move the governance of compound to adao or the community um and decentralize the protocol and i actually think you know the thing that eclipsed our thinking was you know how fast we would be able to hand over controls a lot of the steps that went into this process compound created or designed um you know and are now becoming like the staples of you know d5 but like you know having a time lock contract you know we wrote a timelock that's not like you know used in hundreds of projects you know we wrote a governance system and you know voting token um which are used in hundreds of projects and you know all these things we have to discover for ourselves and just continuously try to you know not just innovate on the core protocol but the tools by which you know the community could use to run the protocol and so you know i didn't think by this point we would have a decentralized protocol when we launched compound was running on admin keys and now it's pretty much anything but it's a community-run decentralized protocol and it happened a lot faster than i would have guessed oh this is incredible um unknowingly you've set the stage for all the other questions i had because you touched on every single topic i have a big question on so we'll go deeper into everything so uh now this is definitely this incredible i think uh it still blows my mind that i remember uh last february or actually yeah early february i was like wait d5 just crossed a billion in tbl and that feels like forever but it was not even 18 months ago and yeah the space moves so fast and i just we couldn't imagine what maker caused 100 million in its deposits and uh still a lot two years ago i think but uh it's great uh you kind of already kind of set the stage here so uh i think one of the super interesting things here is that you essentially wore one of the super cutting edge but also high profile projects to introduce things like liquidity mining and governance and just all these growth tactics um and uh in my opinion it's a little bit challenging because you are the first ones to do this thing and find out if it's working or not so you're just in a super interesting position which uh is good and bad at the same time but um kind of knowing everything now in hindsight anywhere from the things we've invented to learnings from trying all those things out in iterations if you were to launch compound um again now um what would you do something differently i would do a lot differently um and you know a lot of things that we did at the time were being done for the first time we had to make some educated guesses and even in the educated guesses um you know it was impossible to predict whether we were going to be right wrong too conservative too aggressive or what um you know the idea of you know handing over the protocol to the community without like a gatekeeper was considered like an absolutely radical idea um at the time there was a few other examples of decentralized governance but they were very early so maker now was a good example um but people thought it was crazy that you know there wasn't going to be a foundation you know directly managing a protocol um you know a lot of the investors in compound labs thought it was crazy that we would give away half the tokens um up until this point there was really no project that was right giving away tokens at all they were selling tokens right um and you know everyone thought that 50 of the tokens being given away was like an insane thing um and you know the mechanics by which we like you know decided to actually roll out governance was also extremely experimental people forget but compound governance in the voting contracts in the voting system was actually tested live for three months with like a limited token holder group before being rolled out to the entire community um which is something that i actually haven't seen since people go from zero to like you know full unchained governance you know sometimes oftentimes the intermediate steps are like there's snapshots or there's you know a team that's vaguely in control and enforcing the community as well but you know we basically went from you know centralized to decentralized but the intermediate step was not like some intermediate governance solution it was just allowing a limited stakeholder group to use the full you know launching tools happy staging environment exactly um and you know if we could do it all differently you know there's a couple things that have emerged as like standards in the communities not just of compound but in crypto and in d5 generally though i think we would have like adopted but they just didn't really exist yet so one is you know i would say um you know distributing tokens to um historical users you know when we started distributing tokens to users it was to all present and future users it wasn't historical looking i actually think the way uniswap handled it was phenomenal it's probably too late to go back and revise this but you know if i could go back to the beginnings 2020 we would have changed how we allocated tokens between you know future users and present users and historical users um that's the first thing i think would have changed the second is that i think there should you know if i could do it all over again i think there should have been you know generally more for developers um it's you know very easy to focus on users but i actually think the most important part of the protocol um in a lot of ways are developers and i think that like you know coming up with some method of allocating tokens specifically for projects built on top of compound or developers building on top of a compound would have been really valuable um it's also you know hard to go back and change that but i actually think the community can potentially start to like recalibrate and focus more on you know the developer side of things as opposed to just raw users of the protocol itself once from like uh like are you sort of differentiating uh another category between like a grants program equivalent or kind of what do you mean by that yeah and it's a great question i think the way it gets developed and expresses itself you know now is something like a grants program right where you can allocate to developers um but i also think in terms of you know allocating you know tokens and governance rights to just applications um i think it'd be more interesting you know to look at not just how do you distribute governance to you know stakeholders that are building but also applications built on top of the protocol um you know at the end of the day you know what we wanted and didn't see play out as closely as you know i would have hoped would have been you know tokens going to like custodians and like things like that that are directly integrating the protocol um you know if i could revise it i think we would have changed you know the actual logic a little bit but you know building a system for the first time is incredibly difficult and it's hard to plan for all these outcomes um and i think what we also could have done is you know if i could go back in time it would have been you know setting up things like you know a grant committee sooner as opposed to letting it sort of like slowly develop over time um you know again when we created you know compound when we distributed it to users these weren't really concepts yet um but now these are concepts you know so if i could go back in time you know to the day that comp was released i think we would have you know had in place you know some allocation of tokens overseen by the community not through the protocol and the user you know usage of it but like to be distributed by users to other builders two other participants to other stakeholders absolutely i think um if i'm parsing this right like i think a lot of this is about tightening the feedback loops um the way i see it because you get to understand and iterate much faster um and i think that's an excellent sort of framing um as well uh on something you just mentioned obviously being the first one to try things out is is challenging but um what did you kind of think would happen for liquidity mining when you introduced it and and anyone from concerns to what you would change now and specifically around that yeah it's funny because at the time you know it wasn't really called liquidity mining and internally like we didn't think of it like i was like liquidity mining we just thought of it as hey this is like the coolest thing we can do to like bring users into the fold right and we thought the product is great what if we make it even greater by like you know giving comp to all the users like people love compound today they'll extra love compound you know if we just give them the tokens um we didn't really know what was going to happen there was a couple other you know similar approaches um that other you know ecosystem participants have done in the past i thought you know as we were designing it we'd been able to observe synthetics and some of the approaches they were taking so you know people say compound invented liquidity mining i don't really agree um but i do think you know we came up with a way of distributing liquid tokens to users for using the protocol directly as opposed to incentivizing some liquidity pool right or like some you know unispot pool or whatever right um we also saw exchanges that have been doing there was a long time ago there was a concept called trans fee mining that was like popular for like three months before like the exchanges that like pioneered it like imploded horribly but like you know what they did is they would give tokens to users based on how much trading volume they had and this was actually bad because it led to a lot of like wash trading and like just like useless activity and what we wanted to avoid was people like you know entering into useless activity and we tried to design a system that would just reward users not like arbitrary things and it was hard to get it exactly right i think you know if anyone on this call remembers the first couple weeks of the comp distribution the first couple weeks were chaotic because it was like first of its kind changes to it had to go through governance which was like a little bit slow and the incentives were crazy so like certain markets wound it being like hilariously used when like they didn't serve as much of like a legitimate underlying economic purpose as people expected like the bat market if anyone remembers it was like you number one market on compound and everybody like on the internet and twitter was like why is that so large and it's just because the algorithm that was used you know just led in this like unexpected consequence to like back being the number one marketing compound people are scrambling to like find that take it off exchanges move it into compound it was like such a bizarre situation yeah i remember all those things yep it was chaotic um one last kind of question on this um you sort of mentioned that a lot of people started using a lot of things that you came up with as part of the launch and anywhere from contracts on how to manage governance to just liquidity mining stuff um was it sort of uh did you take that as like a super good thing when everybody started using it you have hundreds of projects or was that worrying how do you connect i think it is a super good thing um you know like one of the best virtues of you know ethereum and d5 on ethereum and this applies to other blockchains as well but one of the strongest virtues i find is that you know every project increases the network effect of the entire ecosystem and you know if compound can build a contract that other people can use great right if projects don't have to reinvent the wheel and they can use like the compound time lock code or like the comp token code or the comp governance system code great it means there's more things happening on ethereum for everybody and everyone's going to benefit from it whether it's compound directly or compound indirectly like the more people that are able to ship things faster you know it just benefits the entire ecosystem um when we started there was almost no code that we could use off the shelf right um there was almost nothing that we could like refer to in terms of like how to like build out an application like compact we had to like truly discover and innovate a lot of the most basic you know concepts like compound pioneer appear to like pool liquidity like this didn't like really exist yet yeah and like how did like compute interest rates for an infinite quantity of users with one computation instead of iterating over a list of them like like very basic things we had to like discover for ourselves and now like if we wanted the right compound or we wanted to like make a new version like it wouldn't take the year that it took the first time right it's not that like we got smarter you know it's that there's more things available now like you don't have to like roll your own everything you can like focus on building a core application and like you know use certain contracts off the shelf or in lightly modified ways and so the fact that like people don't have to build out their own governance tools i think is unbelievably valuable for everyone because you get like a more decentralized ecosystem the fact that people don't have to like you know do the r and d to like discover basic concepts and just copy pieces from compound is great right so i think in a lot of ways you know whether it's noticed or unnoticed the more people that are using you know pieces of the compound ecosystem you know it's like you know a silent victory um and i think the people that do notice you know it's even better would you then say that it's uh usually not a good thing to be a first mover in this space because you have to figure a lot of this out or uh it's definitely harder to be a first mover um and what's really funny is when we were designing the compound governance system like the way that the token works the way you can delegate votes the way you actually vote on proposals like the way the system like mechanically operates when we were designing it we always say like we have a second mover advantage um because like discovering it for the first time would be like so hard we got to like look at maker now we got to look at like you know like other things that have been built we had you know we had an opportunity to look at like tezos the blockchain and how they were doing like governance of their blockchain we had a second mover advantage and i think it allowed us to spend less time building a better system um if we had to discover all this stuff for the first time and we had nothing to compare it to it would have been really really really hard and so like i give a lot of kudos to the teams that had to be the first mover on even designing governance absolutely um you let's see so i think a lot of projects right now are very focused on getting more and more people involved as they think about anywhere from increasing their users to their community um how did you initially bootstrap the compound ecosystem in the community and what advice would you give right now to projects that are trying to spar a community yeah so i i think there's things that we did well i think there's things we didn't do phenomenally well um you know i think the first thing that's actually important is the ability to delegate votes um was built natively into the comp token and the governance system i actually think this is really important because sometimes the most active participants and the loudest voices aren't the wealthiest users right and like what you want is a system where just anyone who's like active and wants to contribute has the opportunity to have like a loud say in the direction of the protocol even if they're like new or young or entering crypto for the first time right like it leads to more of a meritocracy so i think you know the way we built the comp token and the delegation system was actually like a really strong tool um to get like a couple of really active participants involved in the community um the things that we didn't do well is it's now been like over a year um a little more than a year since comp was released and like i feel like it's taken a long time for the community to start to organize around having a grants committee having a process to like directly reward contributors like we weren't able to foresee the importance of that and you know it led to there being like a delay before i think a lot of people could like start to get involved and compound governance is starting to like very rapidly evolve and flourish and i think we're starting to see more and more participants coming in and you know i think that you know one of the things that we could have done better originally and i think that other projects can learn from this just having like a solid you know foundation to be able to talk to contributors reward them make them a part of the process and it didn't start off with that gotcha yeah and i think the second falls into the first one to figure this out so others then can copy and be like oh we should change this thing um when we do it ourselves um changing gears a little bit last week uh an exploit was discovered on compound um could you tell us kind of what happened and sort of how do you kind of think about making sure that this doesn't happen again yeah so this goes to what i think is like truly the biggest opportunity of an open and decentralized protocol and also the biggest risk but like i'd like to start with the biggest opportunity so the biggest opportunity is that anyone can become a core contributor to the compound protocol um you know there's no obstacles there's no roadblocks anyone listening right now can become a core contributor you don't have to be a member of compound labs and it's an open development process with you know a group of community members that's excited to welcome new developers into the process and it means that people can work on code at the heart of compound um you know and so you know there was a bug that came from an amazing you know contribution from a great contributor who was looking to upgrade one of the features of compounds this upgrade was reviewed by lots of the community members it was reviewed by members of compound labs it was like what i actually think of is one of like the most virtuous benefits of decentralization is that you could have a community member being a core contributor um adding and improving like core functionality of the protocol making it better um the biggest risk is that there is a book right and in proposal 62 there was a book it happened right um luckily there was no user funds that were lost what was lost was comp that was reserved for future users so in a lot of ways it was like a bank error in the favor of in some cases like very randomly selected addresses and you know it was the first time that there was really like a smart contract bug that led to a loss of funds in compound history um and this is a massive disappointment now you know this one proposal proposal 62 shows the opportunity and it shows the risk of distributed governance and distributed development and it shows how distributed development is different than centralized development where there's like one core team that like writes all the code and then people can vote on it like compound goes all the way and it's decentralized development um and so there's nothing better than prop 62 to sort of like embody this i think it's going to be a catalyst for change within the community and within the decentralized development process because i think it's going to lead to a little bit more conservatism in a good way where there's going to be you know more participants more review you know more analysis um and it's going to lead to a much stronger decentralized development process but compounds also one of the first projects that like really you know develops in this fashion um most projects even when they have decentralized voting control they have centralized development um you know there's obviously some incredible examples to learn from like bitcoin you know is you know an open gut like uh development process like anyone can become a contributor to it right and i think compound is headed in that way where you're gonna have an open source code developed by a community not you know a permission team right right and that's the direction it's heading and i actually think that 62 is an amazing wake-up call because it was a disaster i mean frankly like it's a disaster right it led to a loss so far of you know about 220 000 comp is missing right um but it didn't lose user funds and no one in the community is going to forget this it's going to change the way that development occurs it's going to i think clarify the minds of all of the contributors and i think long term it's going to lead to a lot of improvements in the protocol you know there were bugs in bitcoin right that's a fact right this was a bug in compound but you know if the community handles it correctly it'll be the last bug and compound no i think that's a very optimistic and a good note um as a summary i think this is super interesting what um i think it's on the same theme you are the ceo of compound labs but a minority token holder of the compound protocol um how do you kind of see your your role in this eq system and for the protocol and sort of what do you think um that looks like compared to what the community expects of you as well yeah this is a really interesting question because you know i think there's more of a desire to have a figurehead then there is um then there should be right like i'm not actually special like pretty much anyone listening to this call could play almost as large of a role in the compound protocol that i play um you know what i have is years of you know experience and you know a history with the protocol and a passion for it but you know i think in order for a protocol like compound to succeed like it has to be taken up by the community they have to take it over like satoshi's not here to guide bitcoin right i think bitcoin is stronger because of it right if you had you know a single figurehead that was like in charge i think you get a worse outcome and so you know i think you know i'm trying to make my role more and more of like a cheerleader and somebody who knows how the system works but someone who like very genuinely wants the community to take over as much as possible yeah and uh i don't mean this in any negative or bad way but it's just interesting to see when um sometimes the crowd goes against what you're interested in if you're voting on something and like that in a way is a true way of uh showcasing that this is working as expected yeah i've lost a couple votes like in compound governance history and that's great you know it's a great sign moving on to sort of looking at the growth of the ecosystem if if you were a developer and if somebody comes to you says i want to contribute to the compound protocol um i guess what do you think is important over the next couple of years for the the way you think the community or the future should go it's a great question so there's really like four buckets of work that are needed uh in my mind so one is you know building out the core protocol itself adding features right adding like new code adding modifications we're starting to see a community you know set of developers really start to like gain this as a skill set um you know like a year ago there was one or two developers that were like contributing to the core code we're getting more and more contributors to the forklift um and that's really exciting and i think like we're starting to build a muscle as a community of like core contributors the second are applications built on top of the protocol right you know there's huge opportunities for better interfaces for taking the open source front end forking it improving it adding new features right that i think are like underrepresented um one of the things we did a couple weeks ago was open source and license the front end to the community and say like hey like take this like go run it like there's a one-click deploy process to ipfs like you know if you want to make a better version of this like it should be what everyone uses right um and i think like you know the experimentation around the front end is like a little bit low but i think there's really cool opportunities there like someone could build a front end that integrates compound and uniswap and does even cooler things with both of them or like there's a lot of opportunity to make the core interface even better and i think it's a little bit underserved should that come from like uh people's own creativity or do you think there's like a handful of things that you would like to see and you want to kind of incentivize that or broadcast that and tell people to do it yeah i mean i think you know the creativity is the limit like i'm not able to think of all like things that you know a front end should be but like i could see someone building a system that like you know you can opt in to like sharing your email and like it sends you alerts when they're like you know borrowing capacity is getting too dangerous and like you know it could be more useful you can see a version that like doesn't have that but focuses more on like dex integrations as well like there's a lot there that i think is possible um and so you know i think front ends are like a really under developed corner of this because like there doesn't have to be one front end right someone could you know you know fix some bugs like treasure and legend are always having issues that's hardware while it's you know using the interface like there's so much to do um that could be improved upon that's the second the third is that i actually think there's a big opportunity in the community to spend more time um thinking about the sort of parameters of the protocol right not like what is the code and how does it work but like you know what should the liquidation variables be what should the collateral variables be right why right you know gauntlet has recently come in and started spending more time on this but like there's big opportunities to think through the interest rate models and like the economic efficiency of these markets things that are still run by humans but that are like always looking for active contributors and thinkers so if you're someone who's not technically inclined but you are you know economically or mathematically inclined i think there's huge opportunities to like focus on the parameters of the protocol and lastly it's new projects like new projects are you know there's a very vague and open-ended you know category but it's you know could there be a version of the compound protocol you know specifically meant for being deployed to like roll-ups right where that could work with like other things like can the compound community deploy the code elsewhere like you know the sky's the limit but i think like you know there's a huge opportunity for creative thinking and you know for people to volunteer and say like hey it would be fun to have compound on you know optimism or compound on arbitrary compound on the solana or you know whatever it is and you know basically like adapt the core code base and the open source front end to those networks um you know i think the grants you know organization you know should be able and excited to encourage this and to you know incentivize you know the success of this and i think there's huge opportunities here so you know if you're listening to this and you're seeing yourself like oh it can't be that hard to like you know deploy compound on you know harvard trump it's great let's do it right like as a community like you know anyone here can you know help expand compound and i think that's really exciting and really empowering no it says a great message i i mean um i do have a couple of things left but they're all on the same theme before we kind of wrap today up um i think uh one of the most interesting things today um for as we looked at all the talks has been how much variety and sort of diversity there is on the types of projects that have been funded by the ecosystem some of them are just services that help you manage what you what your compound positions are to better interfaces to more technical projects to help you improve the design and even parameter tweaking and managing risk um it is such a big um ecosystem that you can contribute in so many different ways and one common questions we've got we've a common theme and common set of questions we've gone for every of these talks has been how do i contribute if i'm a developer or do i have to be really specifically like i mean perfect on understanding solidity or one of the other skill sets um is it is it really kind of how you're thinking about the growth of the ecosystem do you want to prioritize developers right now before you move on to other sort of types of skills or what does that look like as you think about it from your perspective yeah it's a great question so i would describe compound as you know very professional and boring anarchy um and you know there's an opportunity for anyone with any skill set to come in and just start participating right anyone would come in and just like sort of like you know there's no protocol job applications so to speak but if anyone's interested in like working like with a core d5 protocol there's a million opportunities for anyone with an idea on how they want to contribute it's like you know there's opportunities to help like come in as like a community like organizer and like you know organize like the development processes the community calls there's roles for people to come in and spend more time on the economics of the protocol there's opportunities for folks to focus on protocol business development or focus on marketing or focus on integrations like you know whatever your skill set is like if you just come into the community you're really excited you just raise your hand and you say you know here's what i'm gonna do how do i do this i think there's gonna be a lot of support for it and so there's very few people who tell you no or that want to tell you no um there's not a lot of structure in a good way i mean it's decentralized protocol but whatever your skill set like there's probably something for you that's perfect um so hopefully the couple questions we got today just right now um definitely address this um one sword related but a side conversation i want to have is i think one interesting problem right now in this market is that the incentive to start something new is far greater than contributing to something existing um how do you think about balancing that or giving advice for people on when they have this choice what should they think about long-term versus short-term and anything around it yeah it that's a great question um you know in a you know environment like this you know systems like compound that have been around for years you know are incredibly exciting for certain reasons but they're not as new as something that you can create from scratch um you know i think long term you know simple you know protocols like compound are extremely important but i understand the sort of like goals of like starting something from scratch um the advantages to working in a protocol like compound are that you know it's operating today there's tens of billions of dollars in it it's already at scale there's a huge global user base um and you can have a huge impact in a way that you don't have to you know take a risk on something that doesn't exist yet i but i'm someone who started compound you know from scratch and so i understand the idea of entrepreneurship as well but the skills that you build at compound are also you know the skills that are necessary to create a new protocol and oftentimes i think you know being a meaningful contributor to a protocol like compound helps you on whatever journey you want to go on next and so in a way you can have both yeah if anything this could also be a way to sort of get experience understanding how to manage things at scale and use that to learn and see what you can improve or change exactly no that's a that's a really good way of thinking about it last question and i feel like you've answered this in certain ways but i want to be like i want to get us a few more specific details here uh for everybody that's kind of interested in contributing to compound right now what is kind of uh your worst list of things that are super interesting to you that you think the compound ecosystem needs and what is the process of becoming a contributor to the protocol yeah so to get involved you know you can go to comp.xyz and join the discord that's where a lot of the conversations take place between those two um and you know you can ask what needs to be built um but like i think there's a lot of room to spend more time talking about things that haven't been looked at in years like the interest rate months right these are massively important move billions of dollars but like no one's really looked at like what the interest rate model should be in a really long time right so like taking a look at some of the parameters of the protocol with like a very like research driven approach i think is a good one um i think there's a large sort of like development um wish list that you can find on compoundgrants.org you know through rfps and like projects that are in the works um if there's things that start that look interesting and like haven't been worked on like great opportunity i think um you know focusing on the you know interface areas like we just open source the interface like i'll double back to this you know there's a lot of opportunities to make the interface better when we launched it in 2019 it was like the greatest interface that web 3 had ever seen but that was two years ago two and a half years ago and the interface really has been pretty much the exact same sense and a lot has changed i think you know forking the interface and improving it um is a huge opportunity and there's so many features that are available and lastly helping to expand you know compound um to new markets and in new ways i think is extremely exciting it's much harder and longer work especially because it comes from it i mean for like a specific interface prioritizing a user group or is that a product feature or protocol thing yeah in terms of like the protocol like you know working on you know gateway we're working on like you know deploying the code base to like a roll up like there's a lot of opportunities to just expand you know um the access of the protocol so that's the fourth area that i would say to look at but it all starts with just like you know raising your hand there's a lot of people that are happy to talk to you and i would say like comp.xyz and discord are really great places to come amazing i think that's a perfect note to uh to end on and uh i think if there's two takeaways here is uh go to com.exposing get involved with the community and for those of you who are interested in building compoundgrants.org is the place to go to learn about how to get involved or and get grants robert thank you so much here i want to thank uh everybody from the compound team and the compound grants program i'll do this plug one more time for for all of you here kaplan compoundgrants.org is the place to be you can see rfps and apply for grants directly and get more and more involved so uh with that i want to thank everybody who tuned in today um and participated a lot of great questions a lot of amazing projects and a lot of links shared on how to get more pull requests on on get up and get them to prod so uh with that i want to wish everybody happy hacking for the rest of the hackathon we got a few more days to go before all projects are due and we can't wait to see what everybody builds next week so uh until then um enjoy your weekend everybody or actually
