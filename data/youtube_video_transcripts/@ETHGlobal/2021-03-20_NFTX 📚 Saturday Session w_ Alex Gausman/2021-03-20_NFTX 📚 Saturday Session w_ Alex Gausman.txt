hey everyone uh thanks for joining us um yeah today uh we have alex from nfcx joining us and he's just going to take us through free flow session and with that i will pass it on to alex introduce himself and kick it off everyone i'm alex gausman founder of nftx um i did a workshop just a couple days ago which was kind of like an introduction for this hackathon to give people like a walk through of how nftx works uh behind the scenes i'm happy to do that again i'm also happy to answer any questions i've been told that people can be a little shy so if nobody has questions i'll just kind of babble on about nftx and nfts but yeah if anyone if anyone wants to interrupt or ask a specific question by all means i think the easiest way is to probably just put it in the chat yeah so a little bit about nftx for now um we're uh working on version two at the moment um i've actually been rewriting that um it's been an interesting experience because i i only started developing solidity in the summer after i finished my compsci degree and you know in hindsight many of the ways that i structured the nftx contract they weren't ideal and a lot of that was brought up during the audit um but you know it wasn't really security issues so much as just like structural things uh like the the contract becoming way too big so you know we've had a number of upgrades over the last couple months but it's it's very difficult to upgrade right now because the the contracts at this 24 kilobyte maximum uh so and you know that's partially my pro my fault because of how i didn't refactor it properly so we've been doing that recently and we think you know right now there's two contracts nftx and xstore the x store is like the the state storage um so it's version two the idea is we're gonna combine those two into a single contract to keep it simpler i thought by splitting it up i would be reducing the size but somehow it managed to each one ended up bigger with the interfaces or something so yeah it's been uh it's cool doing that i think we're making pretty good progress on version two you know we call it version two but in terms of actual uh features there won't be that much more um it's more just like an a better version one or one point x um that will allow us to kind of iterate because we'll have more space and it'll be better structured but the main difference is it is a design change basically an economic change so right now like well two things one thing is we're going to focus more on d1 funds instead of these d2 funds which we think are probably uh the timing isn't perfect for them right now we want to build up liquidity with the d1 funds first and the other thing is that until now we've been making uh we've been putting fun tokens uh into sushi swap um and we've been pairing them with ether so like we have a punk basic ether pool um we have you know the punk ether pool um but we've realized that you know it kind of uh bottlenecks us because we can only supply so much liquidity because we only have so much ether in our treasury but we have a lot of nftx tokens in our treasury like over 20 of the supply of course we could sell some of those to get more ether but you know we'd rather not dump our own tokens so the new idea is that we'll pair fun tokens with our own nftx token so you'll have like a punk basic nftx pool and then we'll also just make sure the e the ether nftx pool stays very liquid so and we've been doing this recently just the last week or so we've we've added this new punk basic nftx pool um and what's cool is if somebody comes and they want to you know buy punk basic or sell punk basic and they want to do it with ether then how that trade happens is it gets routed through the nftx ether pool first and then it goes to the nftx punk basic pool and so then it kind of it kind of gives our token a more central role in our product because the idea is that our token will be used um kind of as a bootstrap mechanism for these liquidity pools quite similar to how something like bancor works or synthetics how they use their own their own token to kind of bootstrap their platform um and you know it can be difficult to do but if they've done well it can make the token uh a much stronger you know create a stronger moat in that sense uh and the other thing we want to do is just move away from the the basic that's my bad you know i people aren't very happy with how i added this dash basic to a lot of the funds um the original idea was is that you know punk um i wanted punk to be the d2 fund which was like the index fund we might still go that direction but i think the direction we're going now is we'll rename the punk basic fund to just be called punk and then we're going to call the punk fund something else like punk x because we are finding that it's the floor funds that actually people seem more interested in um and we would like to get a lot of liquidity into this punk basic or soon to be called punk fund and then you know people another thing we've we've noticed is that people seem more interested in tracking the floor price of an asset rather than the average price um so like our our punk fund right now you know the balancer pool it's it's a combination of like punk basic my female punk attribute four five zombies and the idea is it's kind of like an index fund which actually gives you like a moving average sort of of like the entire collection um and you know some people do on twitter they seem to like use like to use punk kind of as like a metric for the nft space in general but i think for the most part people are more interested just in the floor price so they're interested you know what is the absolute cheapest crypto punk and right now i think it's around like 21 ether a few days ago was around like 19. um and so i think people are more interested in tracking that and that's kind of like what our mask fun tracks attracts the floor fun um so i think we're going to move in that direction we're gonna have punk be you know the floor fun mask be the floor fun avastar be the floor fun um for kitties and axes it's a bit more complicated because um the axi floor is is pretty low and the kitty floor is pretty low like so low in fact that it's not really usable um with uh like with the transaction costs um like for instance you know if we had a kitty fund which literally allowed any cryptokitties the cost of minting and redeeming would be like potentially as large as the entire value of that item so instead we have like the kitty generation zero uh the kitty gen zero fund um and then we also have the axi origin fund um and so the only origin axes are allowed in that and only generation zero kitties are allowed about and we we have this dilemma now like okay so you know these other funds like punk mask avistar we're gonna just keep the name simple it's gonna be punk it's gonna be mask it's me avastar it's just me a floor fun you know it's simple um and so some people they'd like to keep that consistency and they don't see it consistent if we do that with kitty um or if we do that with taxi because it's not actually a floor fund like you know that will be an axi origin fund and then it'll be a kitty gen zero fund uh so it's something we're discussing now personally i'm i'm more inclined to like to give those the better names even if it's not totally consistent um i don't think most people really even need to know what they're buying all they need to know is like okay kitty it represents crypto kitties um and you know if crypto kitties go up this will go up um and you know that's part of what nftx is hopefully going to do um is kind of my vision is you know right now the homepage it's bad but it's going to be much better very soon and it's part of my vision is that people can come to the nftx homepage and you know you can be a bit of a novice investor but you you can you know make smart investment decisions quite quickly because we don't want to you know um flood people with too much information um instead it's like you know you come to the home page and maybe all you know kitty kitty if you want crypto kitties we recommend you know the kitty fun and it's like you know then you're kind of directing investors in the right direction um they might not know a lot about cryptokitties but the fact of the matter is that generation zero kitties are very likely going to be much better investments than the rest of the kitties and many people wouldn't know that right off the bat right so you know they don't even have to know that they really they really don't it's like i see our job it's like of course we have to be transparent we want to help educate users but a lot of users you know they just want a simple product they want to be able to come buy something get some exposure and kind of trust that they don't have to do too much due diligence on their own so yeah it's something that i don't see other platforms having really accomplished yet you know there's a lot of different marketplaces that each have their own niche unlike you know async art and wearable um and but there's not really and you know openc of course is the largest marketplace um marketplace is probably the wrong word but you know it's it's nice if if investors can get sort of um a framework for investing that guides them a little bit um without you know flooding them with too much information so um okay i think i've ranted for like 10 minutes there so if anyone has any questions about the actual hackathon i'm happy to answer those um if not i can probably probably keep going nope uh let me think a lot of things i'd like to talk about but i probably shouldn't um just because you know some things we're trying to keep under wraps right now and uh and some things i'm just very opinionated about it doesn't do us any good when i go offending other projects um so um i'll talk about rare pepes for a bit because it's been on my mind um i probably don't have a lot to say about them but yeah the last couple weeks i've been getting into like uh counterparty nft scene um it's it's been like totally surreal uh it's it's so ironic because like in the the fall or like the summer um i remember i tweeted about how i uh i had sold all my bitcoin for for ether because i had found out about this crazy nft niche in the ethereum ecosystem and i thought it was so cool um and i thought it was so cool how everyone was using ether to buy and sell these nfts so i was like you know why am i even holding bitcoin ether so much more potential yadda yadda um so i did all that and then just this last month i've actually gone and bought some bitcoin um because i've i've realized that it's the only way to buy a lot of these counterparty collectibles and it's just crazy like there's um there's like this whole ecosystem of digital collectibles that i just started up around like 2015 2016 peaked around 2017 uh like lots of collections like not just the rare pepes there's also like spells of genesis uh bitcoin farming uh like really it's it's really crazy because you know here i thought that like ethereum had the original digital collectibles um scene and then it's like i find out there was like this whole other ecosystem basically on bitcoin and counterparty uh before ethereum um and you know it amazes me that like in all the years you know ethereum twitter bitcoin twitter fighting at each other um bitcoin has never shield this like really cool ecosystem of digital collectibles um and it's like it's almost like there's smart contracts on counterparty like you can set up like these dispenser contracts and like set prices um it's it's really cool um but it's just i find it so fascinating that like it seems as if the bitcoin community isn't even aware of this um and that you know i think it just prob like i didn't really get into crypto until later in 2017 uh but i think it probably shows that a lot of the people that found this aspect of bitcoin really interesting like 2016 2017 you know this decentralized finance digital collectibles this whole aspect um i think a lot of that probably just ended up moving to ethereum like anyone who was excited by that sort of stuff um and now you know what's what's probably been left with bitcoin is is more of a core community that's focused on hard money um but it's just crazy to me that like you know here i am i thought i was ahead of the curve selling all my bitcoin and this last month i've actually had to buy some back to collect some of these like rare pepes and spells of genesis i don't think they'll be nearly as valuable as nfts on ethereum first of all they're not actually non-fungible so they're just um they're just non-divisible so it's like you know if for example like the original rare pepe nakamoto card there's 300 of them if i have two and i get one more then i have three it's just a balance i can't say like oh this is the third one i got um like with a lot of like a crypto punk you can track each one of them individually uh but it's in my opinion still definitely like you know kind of the missing link between like these web 2 neopets and then like you know nfts and d5 and ethereum um was that there was this kind of short-lived ecosystem which is still kind of active and uh it's it's cool i've been collecting them i don't think you know my my main my main thought is that they won't have the same um d5 super powers um oh here we go do you think there will be wrapping of counterparty collectibles on ethereum great question um that's actually so originally the only reason i was interested in it was because i heard about a project who's actually working on a bridge um they're called emblem finance e-m-b-l-e-m and i think they even have some assets on open c right now i i don't know i haven't actually looked into the technicalities of it but it does you know they they appear to be trying to produce like an actual decentralized bridge um and so yeah originally that was my main reason for getting interested i was like okay you know if these can get bridged over to ethereum then now we're talking right uh and then i started looking into counterparty more my original assumption was that counterparty was its own blockchain but i'm pretty sure it's just a client which is cool so like the data is actually saved on the bitcoin blockchain which means that it's actually secure um at least for like the next 10 years or so because you know it doesn't have to rely on some separate counterparty chain it just embeds information data into like utxo transactions in the metadata i think and then this gets interpreted by counterparty client um so the cool thing is is that i've realized is that like you don't we don't really need it to get bridge to ethereum like you know i've been collecting these things and it's totally possible like i originally thought if i ever wanted to sell them i'd have to do some otc uh a deal on ethereum but it's like no i can actually sell these on counterparty through bitcoin um still again i know it's not the same as actually having them on ethereum um if they could get bridged you know trustlessly to a very popular uh protocol like run protocol i think that would be huge um of course people could do migrations you could do like a burn and mint but i don't think it's really the same having the burn in mint um you know part of what's cool about these rare pepes and counterparty collectibles is that they do still have an existence um which can you you can see that on chain and it proceeds you know crypto punch or whatever um again i don't think that this is really effect i don't think this hurts crypto pods value at all it's like they're still the original non-functional token in my mind uh but it's really cool and it's um yeah so i've been collecting them i wouldn't like ape into them but if they do end up getting transferred to ethereum i think that you know they could definitely go up in value i mean i could totally see in the future people wanting to have some rare pepes in their nft collections um one thing that's different from crypto punks is you know crypto punks it was made by these two guys i forget their name off the top of my head but you know like genius dudes fabulous project like they totally hit it out of the park um but it is in my opinion it's still a little bit different than rare like rare pepe's it's uh it's a very grassroots um decentralized um you know there was no single person like kind of like running the show um so it's different in that sense um it carries a lot of history um a lot of it is offensive to certain people and i think that just kind of adds to the history of it all so yeah i mean i shouldn't go on about them for too long but uh could you mention a few bitcoin based collectible projects yeah for sure um even though i i'm traditionally in ethereum maxi yeah so uh the first one that i'm aware of is spells of genesis um i think that it proceeded uh i'm i'm actually sure it preceded the original rare pet base if you go to this site x chain dot io you can kind of it's a block explorer and you can look it up and then i found a website too it's called sog bazaar and they actually still sell some of the original sog uh assets and they're still running like you just send them a bitcoin some bitcoin to a certain address and you get the collectible like a day later it's pretty cool so i tried to get some of the earlier sog cards um and then but it's mostly the rare pepes i've been focusing on um there's another site here i'll just share my screen um there's another site too it's called like i think it's like rare bits or something um what's it called um hmm um refined it but um yeah so the other one i was looking at is bitcoins here i gotta find this um it's down here somewhere tweet yeah here's some of my rare pepes that i've been getting so i've actually gotten quite a few um some are pretty cool like this guy here there's only 42 usually like the rarest is like 100 editions but there are some that have less than 100. um like this guy pepe french yeah it's pretty funny um anyways let's find this so oh yeah here did you rare that's it see i found this site called did you rare um and it's it's just so crazy like it's like going through like a time portal and it's like there's this whole nft scene well not nfts they're not non-fun people but like digital collectible scene um and it's like you know like since 2015 right and it's kind of just all died out but if you go to rankings um you can see you can see okay so here's like here's i guess all the counterparty uh collections and you can see that like some of them you know they're all so active like there's 24 users in the last or 34 users in the last 24 hours that have interacted with rare pepes mafia wars is you know second then you have bitcoin crops um kaleidoscope um so there are some others spells with genesis should be on here somewhere oh yeah way down here so in the last seven days you see the spells of genesis actually got quite a bit but just the last 24 hours we didn't get much um so yeah i've been buying the bitcoins a bit um so like what i do is i go to like x train dot io and then you can look it here and it's like this is basically like all the uh people like these are like kind of like the smart contract and it's like these are all the recent ones that people put up so it's like oh pepe market okay so somebody somebody's put this up um it's like there's only 100 of them so that's a pretty good card uh and then you go to you can look at issuances to like see when it was issued so it was originally issued four years ago um it's locked it's it's important that they're locked that just means more can't be meant mint minted um divisible it's not divisible which is a good thing in my opinion um and then you go to dispensers so it's like okay yeah so somebody just like added this to the dispenser and the price is 0.022 so then what i do is i i open this in my free wallet no ignore close you go to dispensers add dispense your watch list and then you go pepe market and then you see right here um it's and i could just hit like if i have enough bitcoin which i think i do have 0.18 i could just uh oh pepe market just hit buy now bang bang boom gonna buy that guy and then in like 30 minutes he'll show up in my wallet like the ux is actually pretty good it's just it's really slow but um it just blows my mind i've never seen bitcoin quarters chilling this stuff before let me make sure no one's asking questions pause share oh [Music] um everyone's watching me as i show that i'm a huge noob okay chat bring all the front okay here we go follow up have you tried to try to outflows cadence language do you have any thoughts on their structure linear types yeah so flow's probably one of the projects i shouldn't comment on personally because i'm kind of biased against it um i haven't tried it i honestly i haven't even tried out nba top shot like it's i know i should um i know i definitely should because like i'll admit that flow is as clearly like landed on a product market fit here um and they you know it's it's more scalable than if they just deployed to the base layer of ethereum but yeah i haven't tried a note i haven't tried it out um personally yet i just i get you know i get worried by the whole situation that you know it's it's one of these things that it's like you just you really just don't know um it's like i hope i hope it all ends up decentralized and i hope you know everyone gets their money out and i hope it gets bridged to ethereum um but um like i don't want to openly support it until that actually comes through and like personally i haven't really looked into it much um so no i haven't looked into it but like yeah i mean clear i'm a little bit biased um and i i would definitely like nftx to look into um enabling flow so it is something we'll look into if and when they actually come through and build a bridge um is there any competitions with you in bitcoin oh yeah yeah free wallet yeah it's free it's just hilarious the free wallet thing like is there any competition to a theorem in bitcoin's blog oh yeah flow so yeah you know the i i tell people like you know i go to um here i'll share my screen again um so like yeah i have a lot of friends you know it's funny all of a sudden like friends that haven't been listening to me about crypto for years all of a sudden they're hitting me up like manchester united by like ada um you know i don't want to don't want to say bad things but like so basically one interesting thing you can do token terminal it's just it's a really a great website and you can look at like all the projects um and how much how much revenue they're basically getting you know fees on ethereum fees on ethereum a lot of people see it as bad because it means that you know you have to pay more um and it is it is there's definitely an element of it which is bad um it's important that we get that people can use ethereum without having to pay a lot but overall fees are good because it means demand and it means people are willing to pay for something uh and i can tell from experience i did not enjoy spending like fifty thousand dollars in december deploying on ethereum um it cost a fortune but i did it because there was just it was really no other alternative in terms of like ecosystem and activity and like the amount of stuff being built and like if you look at this this graph here like here's 30 day revenue um you know ethereum's at 700 million um bitcoins at 200 million like and if you look at this list here like for 24-hour revenue ethereum's at 25 million um it's like bitcoin okay like close to eight million and then you look at all these other projects like unisop sushi swap one inch keeper dao ave like all of those are just projects on ethereum they're not even their own blockchain and then bitcoin or finance chain is here and it's it's gotten 17 000 in fees in the last 24 hours compared to ethereum's 25 million um like and then you know like a chain like flow it's not even on here i don't think and you know they would like those 400 um so it's like you know and i know these chains they would say oh well it's a good thing we have low fees um it's like kind of um basically my rule is it's like if if the if the chain isn't even getting a hundred thousand dollars a day in fees then it's like i'm not really even gonna consider investing in it um because it's basically vaporware um it's like maybe one day it could have millions of dollars of daily transactions but like um it's not even close to ethereum or bitcoin and like ethereum with like you know proof of stake and uh iep what is it one five five nine it's like stuff like that like you know these fees they're actually going to be getting distributed back to ether holders um so like and i mean of course other chains will do this and i i totally think in the future there will be other chains there will be other niches um i find solana kind of interesting i like their consensus mechanism but again you know they're not even until they're they're breaking a hundred thousand dollars a day in fees it's not really even something i would personally consider um because it's like it's just such a long shot so yeah that's that's my two cents on on that oh yeah transactions are free yeah so you know um yeah i'm biased so you know definitely you know take everything i say with a grain of salt um and like i do personally i would like nftx to try and you know integrate with flow and stuff but yeah i'm pretty biased towards ethereum and it's pretty astounding when you look at you know the fees and the metrics and it's like uh it's pretty crazy i think that pretty much um somehow you managed to use up all that time basically um so i didn't answer many questions but yeah i hope that was okay thanks alex no that was definitely very interesting you touched on a couple interesting topics there and yeah plenty questions coming in but yeah thanks so much for sharing your saturday with us and everybody for joining and we'll see you in the discord channels yeah for sure i'll be around in discord
