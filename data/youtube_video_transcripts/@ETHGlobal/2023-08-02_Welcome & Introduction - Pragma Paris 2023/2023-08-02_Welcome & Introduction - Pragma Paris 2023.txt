foreign [Music] good morning everybody how's everybody doing my name is carcake one of the co-founders of Youth Global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to pragma this is a conference Edith Global our goal is to get more people into the wetter ecosystem and we do this by running hackathons and Summits and today is one of our online Summits turning into in person so the goal of all of this is to highlight and address a few things that we've seen in our ecosystem over the last few years every developer knows that every contract starts with the word pragma it's not just the beginning of a developer's Journey but for us this is a call towards pragmatism our goal here is to make this ecosystem and the space be more accessible and be known to more people in the wet 3 ecosystem and just do even a bigger wider audience for the rest of the world who's just learning to see what's happening with all the things that we're doing as a result we want to do something a little bit different compared to all the other events and conferences we've seen so a big part of what we do is to tell people what's actually happening and what they can look forward to over the next few years and as a result today is very focused on the future of ethereum and how do we address particularly Us scalability in the space so pragma and all of today is going to be addressed as follows it's going to be a single day it's going to be single track which means we're not going to be doing two things at the same time you don't have to choose between this talk or the other talk and we're going to focus on the future which means less actual talks and more conversations around what people are excited about what have we learned from in the past and how can we apply those lessons into the future and also we're going to keep it non-technical well mostly which means you don't have to know what's happening with all the advances of cryptography we'll kind of cover some of the basics you don't have to know exactly everything from really specifics you just need to know that this is what it enables and we'll do our best to make sure you can follow how to actually understand what's happening and how that gets applied as part of this schedule we're going to do six interviews today and six announcements what are these announcements you ask uh or we haven't asked yet what are these announcements uh what we're going to do is we're going to actually bring on six people here who are talking about some things that they've launched over the last few weeks to also some of them are going to launch a few things today this way you get to understand what the actual Cutting Edge is on all of this ecosystem around specifically scalability and things as a developer that you can look forward to so before we go into the rest of the day and kick off with our very first interview um all of you got this amazing postcard when he checked in uh this is a an amazing representation of this event this venue this city and uh for all of you who signed up you may also remember that we asked you to verify your wallets and uh just to kind of give an appreciation of kind of you being here we're going to be giving this as an nft uh through Zora to all of your wallets so in the next hour or so it'll all land into the address that you verified uh as a memorabilia on top of all of that there's 375 people here today from 47 different countries we know we've been all walking around and running around all the things that are happening this week so we're super excited to have your time and your attention today for the rest of the day on understanding how to think about the future of ethereum I also want to thank some of our amazing Partners I want to thank ZK sync for helping support this event world's coin follow coin MX and polygon they're all also going to be here you can talk to all of the these teams and really understand what they're doing and how you can actually anywhere from use what they're building to build on top of these platforms all right let's get into the schedule everything I'm going to talk about is also on the website so you can check the website to see the latest on everything on the scheduling if something is delayed this is where we're going to update first and then we'll announce that there's any difference things are right now 10 minutes behind schedule only until lunch but everything else is back on track so when we kickoff today with an interview with Alex we're going to talk about how zero knowledge proofs and CK rollups can actually help hyperscale ethereum then George juice is going to talk about wrath if you're interested in building release powerful and quick and performant applications on top of rust and leveraging on-sain data you get to learn about how to do that and Ellie from star core is going to talk about how they're thinking about growing the Stockport ecosystem and how that overlaps with ethereum World Ahmed is going to talk about how do we actually make things more modular with that kind of tractions and everything around making transactions get confirmed very seamlessly then Jesse from bass is going to talk about what the on-chin feature looks like for ethereum and then we're going to have the founders of polygon come on stage in a panel and we're going to talk about the future of how they think scalability ZK VMS and polycon is growing then after lunch we're gonna have Robert Miller from flashpots tell you about Suave and how you can actually think about muv to be more accessible and as a platform then Uma is going to demo something their team has been building on just actually helping you do a lot of cool things with like clients and then we're gonna have ramco from worldcoin Cello just share an exciting announcement on what their progress has been and then run a from some of you may have heard from Cello he's going to be sharing his perspective on what made them decide to now transition solo to be back to ethereum as an L2 then we're going to close the day off with Martin to talk about how we can write safe code and how you can use better auditing tools to actually think about building things at scale that are consumer grade and our last thing for the day will be an interview with Zach from Aztec telling you all the latest things about privacy zero knowledge proofs and all the new cryptography announcements that week enhancements that we can look forward to for the next couple years again all this is on the website so I'm going to stop talking and we'll get the show started
